            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE dignity of the ſubject of this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, not any perſuaſion of its merits as a literary compoſition, encourages me to offer it to your Lordſhip's patronage. The cauſe of freedom has always been found ſufficient, in every age and country, to attract the notice of the generous and humane; and it is therefore, in a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, worthy of the attention and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a perſonage, who holds a diſtinguiſhed rank in that illuſtrious iſland, the very air of which has been determined, upon a late inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of its laws, to be an antidote againſt ſlavery. I feel a ſatisfaction in the opportunity, which the publication of this treatiſe offords me, of acknowledging your Lordſhip's civilities, which can only be equalled by the reſpect, with which I am,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the ſubject of the following work has fortunately become of late a topick of converſation, I cannot begin the preface in a manner more ſatisfactory to the feelings of the benevolent reader, than by giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe humane and worthy perſons, who have endeavoured to draw upon it that ſhare of the publick attention which it has obtained.</p>
            <p>Among the well diſpoſed individuals, of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ages, who have humanely exerted themſelves to ſuppreſs the abject perſonal ſlavery, introduced in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cultivation of the <hi>European</hi> colonies in the weſtern world, <hi>Bartholomew de las Caſas,</hi> the pious biſhop of <hi>Chiapa,</hi> in the fifteenth century, ſeems to have been the firſt. This amiable man, during his reſidence. in <hi>Spaniſh America,</hi> was ſo ſenſibly affected at the treatment which the miſerable Indians underwent, that he returned to <hi>Spain,</hi> to make a publick remonſtrance before the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, declaring, that heaven would one day call him to an account for thoſe cruelties, which he then had it in his power to prevent. The ſpeech which he made on the occaſion, is now extant, and is a moſt perfect picture of benevolence and piety.</p>
            <p>But his intreaties, by the oppoſition of avarice, were rendered ineffectual: and I do not find by any books which I have read upon the ſubject, that any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon interfered till the laſt century, when <hi>Morgan Godwyn,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> clergyman, diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>The preſent age has alſo produced ſome zealous and able oppoſers of the <hi>colonial</hi> ſlavery. For about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the preſent century, <hi>John Woolman</hi> and <hi>Anthony Benezet,</hi> two reſpectable members of the religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety called Quakers, devoted much of their time to the ſubject. The former travelled through moſt parts of
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:019561_0004_0FABFB7E79708B48"/>
               <hi>North America</hi> on foot, to hold converſations with the members of his own ſect, on the impiety of retaining thoſe in a ſtate of involuntary ſervitude, who had never given them offence. The latter kept a free ſchool at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for the education of black people. He took every opportunity of pleading in their behalf. He publiſhed ſeveral treatiſes againſt ſlavery,<note n="*" place="bottom">A Deſcription of Guinea, with an Inquiry into the Riſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Slave Trade, &amp;c.—A Caution to Great Britain and her Colonies, in a ſhort Repreſentation of the calamitous State of the enſlaved Negroes in the Britiſh Dominons. Beſides ſeveral ſmaller pieces.</note> and gave an hearty proof of his attachment to the cauſe, by leaving the whole of his fortune in ſupport of that ſchool, to which he had ſo generouſly devoted his time and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when alive.</p>
            <p>Till this time it does not appear, that any bodies of men had collectively intereſted themſelves in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remedy the evil. Not in the year 1754, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſociety, called Quakers, publickly teſtified their ſentiments upon the ſubject,<note n="‖" place="bottom">They had cenſured the <hi>African Trade</hi> in the year 1727, but had taken no publick notice of the <hi>colonial</hi> ſlavery till this time.</note> declaring, that <q>to live in eaſe and plenty by the toil of thoſe, whom fraud and violence had put into their power, was neither conſiſtent with Chriſtianity nor common juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Impreſſed with theſe ſentiments, many of this ſociety immediately liberated their ſlaves; and though ſuch a meaſure appeared to be attended with conſiderable loſs to the benevolent individuals, who unconditionally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with their freedom, yet they adopted it with pleaſure: nobly conſidering, that to poſſeſs a little, in an honourable way, was better than to poſſeſs much, through the medium of injuſtice. Their example was gradually followed by the reſt. A general emancipation of the ſlaves in the poſſeſſion of Quakers, at length took place; and ſo effectually did they ſerve the cauſe which they had undertaken, that they denied the claim of memberſhip in their religious community, to all ſuch
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:019561_0005_0FABFB7F445953B8"/>as ſhould hereafter oppoſe the ſuggeſtions of juſtice in this particular, either by retaining ſlaves in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or by being in any manner concerned in the ſlave trade.</p>
            <p>But though this meaſure appeared, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, to be attended with conſiderable loſs to the benevolent individuals who adopted it, yet, as virtue ſeldom fails of obtaining its reward, it became ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficial. Many of the ſlaves, who were thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionally freed, returned without any ſolicitation to their former maſters, to ſerve them, at ſtated wages, as free men. The work, which they now did, was found to be better done than before. It was found alſo, that a greater quantity was done in the ſame time. Hence leſs than the former number of labourers was ſufficient. From theſe, and a variety of other circumſtances, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that their plantations were conſiderably more profitable, when worked by free men, than when work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before, by ſlaves; and that they derived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, contrary to their expectations, a conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from their benevolence.</p>
            <p>Animated by the example of the Quakers, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other ſects began to deliberate about adopting the ſame meaſure. Some of thoſe of the church of England, of the Roman Catholicks, and of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Independants, freed their ſlaves in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> It was agitated in the ſynod of the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to oblige their members to liberate their ſlaves. The queſtion was negatived by a majority of but one perſon, as I am informed; and this oppoſition ſeemed to ariſe rather from a diſlike to the attempt of forcing ſuch a meaſure upon the members of that community, than from any other conſideration. I have the pleaſure of being credibly informed, that the manumiſſion of ſlaves, or the employment of free men in the plantations, is now daily gaining ground in North America. Should ſlavery be aboliſhed there, (and it is an event, which, from theſe circumſtances, we may reaſonably expect to be produced in time) let it be remembered, that the Quakers will have had the merit of its abolition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:019561_0006_0FABFB7FF13BA340"/>
Nor have their brethren here been leſs aſſiduous in the cauſe. As there are happily no ſlaves in this country, ſo they have not the had ſame opportunity of ſhewing their benevolence by a general emancipation. They have not however omitted to ſhew it as far as they have been able. At their religious meetings they have regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inquired if any of their members are concerned in the iniquitous <hi>African</hi> trade. They have appointed a committee for obtaining every kind of information on the ſubject, with a view to its ſuppreſſion, and, about three or four years ago, petitioned parliament on the occaſion for their interference and ſupport. I am ſorry to add, that their benevolent application was ineffectual, and that the reformation of an evil, productive of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences equally impolitick and immoral, and generally acknowledged to have long diſgraced our national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, is yet left to the unſupported efforts of piety, morality and juſtice, againſt intereſt, violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and theſe, I bluſh to acknowledge, too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenanced by the legiſlative authority of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the baſis of whoſe government is <hi>liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing can be more clearly ſhewn, than that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible mine of wealth is neglected in <hi>Africa,</hi> for the proſecution of this impious traffick; that, if proper meaſures were taken, the revenue of this country might be greatly improved, its naval ſtrength increaſed, its colonies in a more flouriſhing ſituation, the planters richer, and a trade, which is now a ſcene of blood and deſolation, converted into one, which might be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with <hi>advantage</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such have been the exertions of the Quakers in the cauſe of humanity and virtue. They are ſtill proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as far as they are able, their benevolent deſign; and I ſhould ſtop here and praiſe them for thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their humane endeavours, but that I conceive it to be unneceſſary. They are acting conſiſtently with the principles of religion. They will find a reward in their own conſciences; and they will receive more real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from a ſingle reflection on their conduct, than they can poſſibly experience from the praiſes of an hoſt of writers.</p>

In giving this ſhort account of thoſe humane and worthy perſons, who have endeavoured to reſtore to their fellow creatures the rights of nature, of which they had been unjuſtly deprived, I ſhould feel myſelf unjuſt, were I to omit two zealous oppoſers of the <hi>colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> tyranny, conſpicuous at the preſent day.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Mr. <hi>Granville Sharp.</hi> This Gentleman has particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the cauſe of freedom. It is a notorious fact, that, but a few years ſince, many of the unfortunate black people, who had been brought from the colonies into this country, were ſold in the metropolis to merchants and others, when their maſters had no farther occaſion for their ſervices; though it was always underſtood that every perſon was free, as ſoon as he landed on the Britiſh ſhore. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this notion, theſe unfortunate black people, refuſed to go to the new maſters, to whom they were conſigned. They were however ſeized, and forcibly conveyed, under cover of the night, to ſhips then lying in the <hi>Thames,</hi> to be retranſported to the colonies, and to be delivered again to the planters as merchantable goods. The humane Mr. <hi>Sharpe,</hi> was the means of putting a ſtop to this iniquitous traffick. Whenever he gained information of people in ſuch a ſituation, he cauſed them to be brought on ſhore. At a conſiderable expence he undertook their cauſe, and was inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in obtaining the famous decree in the caſe of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett,</hi> that as ſoon as any perſon whatever ſet his foot in this country, he came under the protection of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> laws, and was conſequently free. Nor did he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere leſs honourably in that cruel and diſgraceful caſe, in the ſummer of the year 1781, when <hi>an hundred and thirty two</hi> negroes, in their paſſage to the colonies, were thrown into the ſea alive, to defraud the underwriters; but his pious endeavours were by no means attended with the ſame ſucceſs. To enumerate his many laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able endeavours in the extirpation of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, would be to ſwell the preface into a volume: ſuffice it to ſay, that he has written ſeveral books on the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:019561_0008_0FABFB81EE745D50"/>ſubject, and one particularly, which he diſtinguiſhes by the title of <hi>"A Limitation of ſlavery."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Rev. James Ramſay.</hi> This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſided for many years in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in the clerical office. He peruſed all the colonial codes of law, with a view to find if there were any favourable clauſes, by which the grievances of ſlaves could be redreſſed; but he was ſeverely diſappointed in his purſuits. He publiſhed a treatiſe, ſince his return to England, called <hi>An Eſſay on the Treatment and Converſion of African Slaves in the Britiſh Sugar Colonies,</hi> which I recommend to the peruſal of the humane reader. This work reflects great praiſe upon the author, ſince, in order to be of ſervice to this ſingularly oppreſſed part of the human ſpecies, he compiled it at the expence of forfeiting that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which he had contracted with many in thoſe parts, during a ſeries of years, and at the hazard, as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, of ſuffering much in his private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as well as of ſubjecting himſelf to the ill will and perſecution of numerous individuals.</p>
            <p>This Eſſay <hi>on the Treatment and Converſion of African Slaves,</hi> contains ſo many important truths on the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſlavery, and has come ſo home to the planters, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written by a perſon who has a thorough knowledge of the ſubject) as to have occaſioned a conſiderable alarm. Within the laſt eight months, two publications have expreſsly appeared againſt it. One of them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled "<hi>Curſory Remarks</hi> on Mr. Ramſay's Eſſay;" the other an <hi>Apology for Negroe Salvery.</hi>" On each of theſe I am bound, as writing on the ſubject, to make a few remarks.</p>
            <p>The <hi>curſory remarker</hi> inſinuates, that Mr. Ramſay's account of the treatment is greatly exaggerated, if not wholly falſe. To this I ſhall make the following reply. I have the honour of knowing ſeveral diſintereſted gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who have been acquainted with the Weſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an iſlands for years. I call them diſintereſted, becauſe they have neither had a concern in the <hi>African</hi> trade, nor in the <hi>colonial</hi> ſlavery: and I have heard theſe unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:019561_0009_0FABFB87765702C0"/>aſſert, that Mr. <hi>Ramſay</hi>'s account is ſo far from being exaggerated, or taken from the moſt dreary pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that he could find, that it is abſolutely below the truth; that he muſt have omitted many inſtances of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which he had ſeen himſelf; and that they only wondered, how he could have written with ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration upon the ſubject. They allow the <hi>Curſory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> to be excellent as a compoſition, but declare that it is perfectly devoid of truth.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>curſory remarker</hi> does not depend ſo much on the circumſtances which he has advanced, (nor can he, ſince they have no other exiſtence than in his own brain) as on the inſtrument <hi>detraction.</hi> This he has uſed with the utmoſt virulence through the whole of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, artfully ſuppoſing, that if he could bring Mr. <hi>Ramſay's</hi> reputation into diſpute, his work would fall of courſe, as of no authenticity. I ſubmit this ſimple que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to the reader. When a writer, in attempting to ſilence a publication, attacks the character of its author, rather than the principles of the work itſelf, is it not a proof that the work itſelf is unqueſtionable, and that this writer is at a loſs to find an argument againſt it?</p>
            <p>But there is ſomething ſo very ungeneous in this mode of replication, as to require farther notice. For if this is the mode to be adopted in literary diſputes, what writer can be ſafe? Or who is there, that will not be deterred from taking up his pen in the cauſe of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? There are circumſtances in every perſon's life, which, if given to the publick in a malevolent manner, and without explanation, might eſſentially injure him in the eyes of the world; though, were they explained, they would be even reputable. The <hi>curſory remarker</hi> has adopted this method of diſpute; but Mr. <hi>Ramſay</hi> has explained himſelf to the ſatisfaction of all parties, and has refuted him in every point. The name of this <hi>curſory remarker</hi> is <hi>Tobin:</hi> a name, which I feel myſelf obliged to hand down with deteſtation, as far as I am able; and with an hint to future writers, that they will do themſelves more credit, and ſerve more effectually the cauſe which they undertake, if on ſuch occaſions
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:019561_0010_0FABFB8AE44A8318"/>they attack the work, rather than the character of the writer, who affords them a ſubject for their lucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the only circumſtance, which induces me to take ſuch particular notice of the <hi>Curſory Remarks.</hi> I feel it incumbent upon me to reſcue an injured perſon from the cruel aſperſions that have been thrown upon him, as I have been repeatedly informed by thoſe, who have the pleaſure of his acquaintance, that his character is irreproachable. I am alſo intereſted myſelf. For if ſuch detraction is paſſed over in ſilence, my own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and not my work, may be attacked by an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous hireling in the cauſe of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apology for Negroe Slavery</hi> is almoſt too deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a compoſition to merit a reply. I have only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to obſerve, (as is frequently the caſe in a bad cauſe, or where writers do not confine themſelves to truth) that the work refutes itſelf. This writer, ſpeaking of the ſlave-trade, aſſerts, that people are never kidnapped on the coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi> In ſpeaking of the treatment of ſlaves, he aſſerts again, that it is of the very mildeſt nature, and that they live in the moſt comfortable and happy manner imaginable. To prove each of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he propoſes the following regulations. That the <hi>ſtealing</hi> of ſlaves from <hi>Africa</hi> ſhould be felony. That the <hi>premeditated murder</hi> of a ſlave by any perſon on board, ſhould come under the ſame denomination. That when ſlaves arrive in the colonies, lands ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for their proviſions, <hi>in proportion to their number,</hi> or commiſſioners ſhould ſee that a <hi>ſufficient</hi> quantity of <hi>ſound wholeſome</hi> proviſions is purchaſed. That they ſhould not work on <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>other</hi> holy-days. That extra labour, or <hi>night-work, out of crop,</hi> ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. That a <hi>limited number</hi> of ſtripes ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them. That they ſhould have <hi>annually</hi> a ſuit of clothes. That old infirm ſlaves ſhould be <hi>properly cared for,</hi> &amp;c.—Now it can hardly be conceived, that if this author had tried to injure his cauſe, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf, he could not have done it in a more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner, than by this propoſal of theſe ſalutary
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:019561_0011_0FABFB8E9A1B22D0"/>regulations. For to ſay that ſlaves are honourably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on the coaſt; to ſay that their treatment is of the mildeſt nature, and yet to propoſe the above-mentioned regulations as neceſſary, is to refute himſelf more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than I confeſs myſelf to be able to do it: and I have only to requeſt, that the regulations propoſed by this writer, in the defence of ſlavery, may be conſidered as ſo many proofs of the aſſertions contained in my own work.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe my account with an obſervation, which is of great importance in the preſent caſe. Of all the publications in favour of the ſlave-trade, or the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſlavery in the colonies, there is not one, which has not been written, either by a chaplain to the African factories, or by a merchant, or by a planter, or by a perſon whoſe intereſt has been connected in the cauſe which he has taken upon him to defend. Of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription are Mr. <hi>Tobin,</hi> and the <hi>Apologiſt for Negroe Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> While on the other hand thoſe, who have had as competent a knowledge of the ſubject, but not the <hi>ſame intereſt</hi> as themſelves, have unanimouſly condemned it; and many of them have written their ſentiments upon it, at the hazard of creating an innumerable hoſt of enemies, and of being ſubjected to the moſt malignant oppoſition. Now, which of theſe are we to believe on the occaſion? Are we to believe thoſe, who are parties concerned, who are intereſted in the practice?—But the queſtion does not admit of a diſpute.</p>
            <p>Concerning my own work, it ſeems proper to obſerve, that when the original Latin Diſſertation, as the title page expreſſes, was honoured by the Univerſity of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge with the firſt of their annual prizes for the year 1785, I was waited upon by ſome gentlemen of reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability and conſequence, who requeſted me to publiſh it in Engliſh. The only objection which occurred to me was this; that having been prevented, by an attention to other ſtudies, from obtaining that critical knowledge of my own language, which was neceſſary for an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh compoſition, I was fearful of appearing before the publick eye: but that, as they flattered me with the
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:019561_0012_0FABFB9091B1A5D8"/>hope, that the publication of it might be of uſe, I would certainly engage to publiſh it, if they would allow me to poſtpone it for a little time, till I was more in the habit of writing. They replied, that as the publick attention was now excited to the caſe of the unfortunate <hi>Africans,</hi> it would be ſerving the cauſe with double the effect, if it were to be publiſhed within a few months. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument prevailed. Nothing but this circumſtance could have induced me to offer an Engliſh compoſition to the inſpection of an hoſt of criticks: and I truſt therefore that this circumſtance will plead much with the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reader, in favour of thoſe faults, which he may find in the preſent work.</p>
            <p>Having thus promiſed to publiſh it, I was for ſome time doubtful from which of the copies to tranſlate. There were two, the original, and an abridgement. The latter (as theſe academical compoſitions are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a certain length) was that which was ſent down to Cambridge, and honoured with the prize. I was determined however, upon couſulting with my friends, to tranſlate from the former. This has been faithfully done with but few<note n="*" place="bottom">The inſtance of the <hi>Dutch</hi> coloniſts at the Cape, in the firſt part of the Eſſay; the deſcription of an African battle, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and the poetry of a negroe girl in the third, are the only conſiderable additions that have been made.</note> additions. The reader will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably perceive the Latin idiom in ſeveral paſſages of the work, though I have endeavoured, as far as I have been able, to avoid it. And I am ſo ſenſible of the diſadvantages under which it muſt yet lie, as a tranſlation, that I wiſh I had written upon the ſubject, without any reference at all to the original copy.</p>
            <p>It will perhaps be aſked, from what authority I have collected thoſe facts, which relate to the colonial ſlavery. I reply, that I have had the means of the very beſt of information on the ſubject; having the pleaſure of being acquainted with many, both in the naval and military departments, as well as with ſeveral others, who have been long acquainted with <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi>
               <pb n="xv" facs="unknown:019561_0013_0FABFB9143951188"/>iſlands. The facts therefore which I have related, are compiled from the diſintereſted accounts of theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all of whom, I have the happineſs to ſay, have coincided, in the minuteſt manner, in their deſcriptions. It muſt be remarked too, that they were compiled, not from what theſe gentlemen heard, while they were reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in thoſe parts, but from what they actually <hi>ſaw.</hi> Nor has a ſingle inſtance been taken from any book whatever upon the ſubject, except that from <hi>Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſur la Colonie de St. Dominigue,</hi> in the latter part of Chap. ix, and this book was publiſhed in <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1777, by <hi>authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now the pleaſure to ſay, that the accounts of theſe diſintereſted gentlemen, whom I conſulted on the occaſion, are confirmed by all the books which I have ever peruſed upon ſlavery, except thoſe which have been written by <hi>merchants, planters, &amp;c.</hi> They are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir <hi>Hans Sloane's</hi> Voyage to Barbadoes; <hi>Griffith Hughes's</hi> Hiſtory of the ſame iſland, printed 1750; an Account of North America, by <hi>Thomas Jefferies,</hi> 1761; all <hi>Benezet's</hi> works, &amp;c. &amp;c. and particularly by Mr. <hi>Ramſay's</hi> Eſſay on the Treatment and Converſion of the African Slaves in the Britiſh Sugar Colonies; a work which is now firmly eſtabliſhed; and, I may add, in a very extraordinary manner, in conſequence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy which this gentleman has ſuſtained with the <hi>Curſory Remarker,</hi> by which ſeveral facts which were mentioned in the original copy of my own work, before the controverſy began, and which had never appeared in any work upon the ſubject, have been brought to light. Nor has it received leſs ſupport from a letter, publiſhed only laſt week, from Capt. J. S. Smith, of the Royal Navy, to the Rev. Mr. Hill; on the former of whom too high encomiums cannot be beſtowed, for ſtanding forth in that noble and diſintereſted manner, in behalf of an injured character.</p>
            <p>I have now only to ſolicit the reader again, that he will make a favourable allowance for the preſent work, not only from thoſe circumſtances which I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but from the conſideration, that only two months
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:019561_0014_0FABFB9209922A30"/>are allowed by the Univerſity for theſe their annual compoſitions. Should he however be unpropitious to my requeſt, I muſt conſole myſelf with the reflection, (a reflection that will always afford me pleaſure, even amidſt the cenſures of the great,) that by undertaking the cauſe of the unfortunate <hi>Africans,</hi> I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as far as my abilities would permit, the cauſe of injured innocence.</p>

                  <p>WHEN civilized, as well as barbarous nations, have been found, through a long ſucceſſion of ages, uniformly to concur in the ſame cuſtoms, there ſeems to ariſe a preſumption, that ſuch cuſtoms are not only eminently uſeful, but are ſounded alſo on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of juſtice. Such is the caſe with reſpect to <hi>Slavery:</hi> it has had the concurrence of all the nations, which hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory has recorded, and the repeated practice of ages from the remoteſt antiquity, in its favour. Here then is an argument, deduced from the general conſent and arreement of mankind, in favour of the propoſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but alas! when we reflect that the people, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſtate of ſervitude, have had the ſame feelings
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019561_0019_0FABFB95C226FEB0"/>with ourſelves; when we reflect that they have had the ſame propenſities to pleaſure, and the ſame averſions from pain; another argument ſeems immediately to ariſe in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former, deduced from our own feelings and that divine ſympathy, which nature has implanted in our breaſts, for the moſt uſeful and generous of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. To aſcertain the truth therefore, where two ſuch oppoſite ſources of argument occur; where the force of cuſtom pleads ſtrongly on the one hand, and the feelings of humanity on the other; it is a matter of much import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the diginity of human nature is concerned, and the rights and liberties of mankind will be involved in its diſcuſſion.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary, before this point can be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to conſult the Hiſtory of Slavery, and to lay before the reader, in as conciſe a manner as poſſible, a general view of it from its earlieſt appearance to the preſent day.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, whom we ſhall mention here to have been reduced to a ſtate of ſervitude, may be comprehended in that claſs, which is uſually denominated the <hi>Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It conſiſted of free-born citizens, who, from the various contingencies of fortune, had become ſo poor, as to have recourſe for their ſupport to the ſervice of the rich. Of this kind were thoſe, both among the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and the Jews, who are recorded in the<note n="*" place="bottom">Geneſis, Ch. 47.

                  </p>
                  <p>We may obſerve of the above-mentioned, that their ſituation was in many inſtances ſimilar to that of our own
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019561_0020_0FABFB967B2C25C8"/>ſervants. There was an expreſs contract between the parties: they could, moſt of them, demand their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, if they were ill uſed by their reſpective maſters; and they were treated therefore with more humanity than thoſe, whom we uſually diſtinguiſh in our language by the appellation of <hi>Slaves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this claſs of ſervants was compoſed of men, who had been reduced to ſuch a ſituation by the contingences of fortune, and not by their own miſconduct; ſo there was another among the ancients, compoſed entirely of thoſe, who had ſuffered the loſs of liberty from their own imprudence. To this claſs may be reduced the Grecian <hi>Prodigals,</hi> who were detained in the ſervice of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, till the fruits of their labour were equivalent to their debts; the <hi>delinquents,</hi> who were ſentenced to the oar; and the German <hi>enthuſiaſts,</hi> as mentioned by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, who were ſo immoderately charmed with gaming, as, when every thing elſe was gone, to have ſtaked their liberty and their very ſelves. "The loſer," ſays he, <q>goes into a voluntary ſervitude, and though younger and ſtronger than the perſon with whom he played, patiently ſuffers himſelf to be bound and ſold. Their perſeverance in ſo bad a cuſtom is ſtiled honour.— The ſlaves, thus obtained, are immediately exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of the ſcandal of his victory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To enumerate other inſtances, would be unneceſſary: it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that the ſervants of this claſs were in a far more wretched ſituation, than thoſe of the former; their drudgery was more intenſe; their treatment more ſevere; and there was no retreat at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from the frowns and laſhes of their deſpotick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>Having premiſed this, we may now proceed to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diviſion of ſlavery, into <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>involuntary.</hi> The <hi>voluntary</hi> will comprehend the two claſſes, which we have already mentioned; for, in the firſt inſtance, there was a <hi>contract,</hi> founded on <hi>conſent;</hi> and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, there was a <hi>choice</hi> of engaging or not in thoſe practices, the known conſequences of which were ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019561_0021_0FABFB9740D10BA0"/>The <hi>involuntary,</hi> on the other hand, will compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thoſe, who were forced, without any ſuch <hi>condition</hi> or <hi>choice,</hi> into a ſituation, which as it tended to degrade a part of the human ſpecies, and to claſs it with the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, muſt have been, of all human ſituations, the moſt wretched and inſupportable. Theſe are they, whom we ſhall conſider ſoley in the preſent work. We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take our leave of the former, as they were mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, that we might ſtate the queſtion with greater accuracy, and be the better enabled to reduce it to its proper limits.</p>

                     <q>It was a law, eſtabliſhed from time immemorial among the nations of antiquity, to oblige thoſe to undergo the ſeverities of ſervitude, whom victory had thrown into their hands.</q> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably with this, we find all the Eaſtern nations unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the practice. The ſame cuſtom prevailed among the people of the Weſt; for as the Helots became the ſlaves of the Spartans, from the right of conqueſt only, ſo priſoners of war were reduced to the ſame ſituation by the reſt of the inhabitants of Greece. By the ſame principles that actuated theſe, were the Romans alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced. Their Hiſtory will confirm the fact: for how many cities are recorded to have been taken; how many armies to have been vanquiſhed in the field, and the wretched ſurvivors, in both inſtances, to have been doomed to ſervitude? It remains only now to obſerve, in ſhewing this cuſtom to have been univerſal, that all thoſe nations which aſſiſted in overturning the Roman Empire, though many and various, adopted the ſame meaſures; for we find it a general maxim in their polity, that whoever ſhould fall into their hands as a priſoner of war, ſhould immediately be reduced to the condition of a ſlave.</p>

It may here, perhaps, be not unworthy of remark, that the <hi>involuntary</hi> were of greater antiquity than the <hi>voluntary</hi> ſlaves. The latter are firſt mentioned in the time of Pharaoh: they could have ariſen only in a ſtate of ſociety; when property, after its diviſion, had become ſo unequal, as to multiply the wants of individuals; and when government, after its eſtabliſhment, had given ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the poſſeſſor by the puniſhment of crimes.— Whereas the former ſeem to be dated with more propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety from the days of Nimrod; who gave riſe probably to that inſeparable idea of <hi>victory</hi> and <hi>ſervitude,</hi> which we find among the nations of antiquity, and which has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted uniformly ſince, in one country or another, to the preſent day.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>But it was not victory alone, or any preſuppoſed right, founded in the damages of war, that afforded a pretence for invading the liberties of mankind: the honourable light, in which <hi>piracy</hi> was conſidered in the uncivilized ages of the world, contributed not a little to the <hi>ſlavery</hi> of the human ſpecies. Piracy had a very early beginning. "The Grecians,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Thucydides. L. 1. ſub initio.</note> ſays Thucydides, <q>in their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive "ſtate, as well as the contemporary barbarians, who "inhabited the ſea coaſts and iſlands, gave themſelves "wholly to it; it was, in ſhort, their only profeſſion and ſupport.</q> The writings of Homer are ſufficient of themſelves to eſtabliſh this account. They ſhew it to have been a common practice at ſo early a period as that of the Trojan war; and abound with many lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019561_0023_0FABFB997508EF50"/>of it, which, had they been as groundleſs as they are beautiful, would have frequently ſpared the ſigh of the reader of ſenſibility and reflection.</p>
                  <p>The piracies, which were thus practiſed in the early ages, may be conſidered as <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private.</hi> In the former, whole crews embarked for the<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem.—"the ſtrongeſt," ſays he, "engaging in theſe adventures.</note> benefit of their reſpective tribes. They made deſcents on the ſea coaſts, carried off cattle, furpriſed whole villages, put many of the inhabitants to the ſword, and carried others into ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>In the latter, individuals only were concerned, and the emolument was their own. Theſe landed from their ſhips, and, going up into the country, concealed themſelves in the woods and thickets; where they waited every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of catching the unfortunate ſhepherd or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman alone. In this ſituation they ſallied out upon him, dragged him on board, conveyed him to a foreign market. and ſold him for a ſlave.</p>
                  <p>To this kind of piracy Ulyſſes alludes, in oppoſition to the former, which he had been juſt before mentioning, in his queſtion to Eumoeus.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Homer. Odyſs. L. 15.385.</note> "Did pirates wait, till all thy friends were gone,</l>
                     <l>"To catch thee ſingly with thy flocks alone;</l>
                     <l>"Say, did they force thee from thy fleecy care,</l>
                     <l>"And from thy fields tranſport and fell thee here?"</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But no picture, perhaps, of this mode of depredation, is equal to that, with which<note n="†" place="bottom">Xenoph. L. 6. ſub initio.</note> Xenophon preſents us in the ſimple narrative of a dance. He informs us that the Grecian army had concluded a peace with the Paphlagoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that they entertained their embaſſadors in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with a banquet, and the exhibition of various feats of activity. "When the Thracians," ſays he, had <q>performed the parts allotted them in this entertainment, ſome Aenianian and Magnetian ſoldiers roſe up, and,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019561_0024_0FABFBA1A0842860"/>accoutred in their proper arms, exhibited that dance, which is called <hi>Karpoea.</hi> The figure of it is thus. One of them, in the character of an huſbandman, is ſeen to till his land, and is obſerved, as he drives his plough, to look frequently behind him, as if apprehenſive of danger. Another immediately appears in ſight, in the character of a robber. The huſbandman, having ſeen him previouſly advancing, ſnatches up his arms. A battle enſues before the plough. The whole of this performance is kept in perfect time with the muſick of the flute. At length the robber, having got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the huſbandman, binds him, and drives him off with his team. Sometimes it happens that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ſubdues the robber: in this caſe the ſcene is only reveried, as the latter is then bound and driven off by the former.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve, that this dance was a repreſentation of the general manners of men, in the more uncivilized ages of the world; ſhewing that the huſbandman and ſhepherd lived in continual alarm, and that there were people in thoſe ages, who derived their pleaſures and fortunes from <hi>kidnapping</hi> and <hi>enſlaving</hi> their fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>We may now take notice of a circumſtance in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which will lead us to a review of our firſt aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on this point, <q>that the honourable light, in which <hi>piracy</hi> was conſidered in the times of barbariſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the <hi>ſlavery</hi> of the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</q> The robber is repreſented here as frequently defeated in his attempts, and as reduced to that deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation, to which he was endeavouring to bring another. This ſhews the frequent difficulty and danger of his undertakings: people would not tamely reſign their lives or liberties, without a ſtruggle. They were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prepared; were ſuperior often, in many points of view, to theſe invaders of their liberty; there were an hundred accidental circumſtances frequently in their favour. Theſe adventurers therefore required all the ſkill, ſtrength, agility, valour, and every thing, in ſhort, that may be ſuppoſed to conſtitute heroiſm, to conduct
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019561_0025_0FABFBA1C0F63F10"/>them with ſucceſs. Upon this idea piratical expeditions firſt came into repute, and their frequency afterwards, together with the danger and fortitude, that were inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected with them, brought them into ſuch credit among the barbarous nations of antiquity, that of all human profeſſions, piracy was the moſt honourable.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thucydides. L. 1. ſub initio. Sextus Empiricus. Schol. &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The notions then, which were thus annexed to pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical expeditions, did not fail to produce thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which we have mentioned before. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded an opportunity to the views of avarice and ambition, to conceal themſelves under the maſk of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. They excited a ſpirit of enterprize, of all others the moſt irreſiſtible, as it ſubſiſted on the ſtrongeſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of action, emolument and honour. Thus could the vileſt of paſſions be gratified with impunity. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were robbed, ſtolen, murdered, under the pretended idea that theſe were reputable adventures: every enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in ſhort was committed, and dreſſed up in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments of honour.</p>
                  <p>But as the notions of men in the leſs barbarous ages, which followed, became more corrected and refined, the practice of piracy began gradually to diſappear. It had hitherto been ſupported on the grand columns of <hi>emolument</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> When the latter therefore was removed, it received a conſiderable ſhock; but, alas! it had ſtill a pillar for its ſupport! <hi>avarice,</hi> which exiſts in all ſtates, and which is ready to turn every invention to its own ends, ſtrained hard for its preſervation. It had been produced in the ages of barbariſm; it had been pointed out in thoſe ages as lucrative, and under this notion it was continued. People were ſtill ſtolen; many were intercepted (ſome, in their purſuits of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, others, in the diſcharge of their ſeveral occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) by their own countrymen; who previouſly laid in wait for them, and ſold them afterwards for ſlaves; while others ſeized by merchanis, who traded on the different coaſts, were torn from their friends and connections,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019561_0026_0FABFBA3797C2FC0"/>and carried into ſlavery. The merchants of Theſſaly, if we can credit<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtoph. Plut. Act. 2. Scene 5.</note> Ariſtophanes who never ſpared the vices of the times, were particularly infamous for the latter kind of depredation; the Athenians were notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the former; for they had practiſed theſe robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſuch an alarming degree of danger to individuals, that it was found neceſſary to enact a<note n="†" place="bottom">Zenoph. L. 1.</note> law, which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed kidnappers with death.—But this is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe; it will enable us to aſſert, that there were two claſſes of <hi>involuntary</hi> ſlaves among the ancients, <q>of thoſe who were taken publickly in a ſtate of war, and of thoſe who were privately ſtolen in a ſtate of innocence and peace.</q> We may now add, that the children and deſcendents of theſe compoſed a third.</p>

                  <p>It will be proper to ſay ſomething here concerning the ſituation of the unfortunate men, who were thus doomed to a life of ſervitude. To enumerate their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious employments, and to deſcribe the miſeries which they endured in conſequence, either from the ſeverity, or the long and conſtant application of their labour, would exceed the bounds we have propoſed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent work. We ſhall confine ourſelves to their <hi>perſonal treatment,</hi> as depending on the power of their maſters, and the protection of the law. Their treatment, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered in this light, will equally excite our pity and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. They were beaten, ſtarved, tortured, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at diſcretion: they were dead in a civil ſenſe; they had neither name nor tribe; were incapable of a judicial proceſs; were in ſhort without appeal. Poor unfortunate men! to be deprived of all poſſible protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! to ſuffer the bittereſt of injuries without the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of redreſs! to be condemned unheard! to be
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019561_0027_0FABFBA3F3B45018"/>murdered with impunity! to be conſidered as dead in that ſtate, the very members of which they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting by their labours!</p>
                  <p>Yet ſuch was their general ſituation: there were two places however, where their condition, if conſidered in this point of view, was more tolerable. The Aegyptian ſlave, though perhaps of all others the greateſt drudge, yet if he had time to reach the<note n="*" place="bottom">Herodotus. L. 2.113.</note> temple of Hercules, found a certain retreat from the perſecution of his maſter; and he received additional comfort from the reflection, that his life, whether he could reach it or not, could not be taken with impunity. Wiſe and ſalutary law! how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten muſt it have curbed the inſolence of power, and ſtopped thoſe paſſions in their progreſs, which had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been deſtructive to the ſlave!</p>
                  <p>But though the perſons of ſlaves were thus greatly ſecured in Aegypt, yet there was no place ſo favourable to them as Athens. They were allowed a greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech;<note n="†" place="bottom">

Nor was this all: they had a privilege
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019561_0028_0FABFBA4DCDA2390"/>infinitely greater than the whole of theſe. They were allowed an opportunity of working for themſeves, and if their diligence had procured them a ſum equivalent with their ranſom, they could immediately, on paying it down,<note n="*" place="bottom">To this privilege Plautus alludes in his <hi>Caſina,</hi> where he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a ſlave, ſpeaking in the following manner.

                  <p>Thus then, to the eternal honour of Aegypt and Athens, they were the only places that we can find, where ſlaves were conſidered with any humanity at all. The reſt of the world ſeemed to vie with each other, in the debaſement and oppreſſion of theſe unfortunate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They uſed them with as much ſeverity as they choſe; they meaſured their treatment only by their own paſſion and caprice; and, by leaving them on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, without the poſſibility of an appeal, they render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſituation the moſt melancholy and intolerable, that can poſſibly be conceived.</p>

                  <p>As we have mentioned the barbarous and inhuman treatment that generally fell to the lot of ſlaves, it may not be amiſs to inquire into the various circumſtances by which it was produced.</p>
                  <p>The firſt circumſtance, from whence it originated, was the <hi>commerce:</hi> for if men could be conſidered as <hi>poſſeſſions;</hi> if, like <hi>cattle,</hi> they could be <hi>bought</hi> and <hi>ſold,</hi> it will not be difficult to ſuppoſe, that they could be
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019561_0029_0FABFBA8E9655210"/>held in the ſame conſideration, or treated in the ſame manner. The commerce therefore, which was begun in the primitive ages of the world, by claſſing them with the brutal ſpecies, and by habituating the mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the terms of <hi>brute</hi> and <hi>ſlave</hi> as <hi>ſynonimous,</hi> ſoon cauſed them to be viewed in a low and deſpicable light, and as greatly inferiour to the human ſpecies. Hence proceeded that treatment, which might not unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſuppoſed to ariſe from ſo low an eſtimation. They were tamed, like beaſts, by the ſtings of hunger and the laſh, and their education was directed to the ſame end, to make them commodious inſtruments of labour for their poſſeſſors.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>treatment,</hi> which thus proceeded in the ages of barbariſm, from the low eſtimation, in which ſlaves were unfortunately held from the circumſtances of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, did not fail of producing, in the ſame inſtant, its <hi>own</hi> effect. It depreſſed their minds; it numbed their faculties; and, by preventing thoſe ſparks of genius from blazing forth, which had otherwiſe been conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous; it gave them the appearance of being endued with inferior capacities than the reſt of mankind. This effect of the <hi>treatment</hi> had made ſo conſiderable a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as to have been a matter of obſervation in the days of Homer.</p>

                  <p>Thus then did the <hi>commerce,</hi> by claſſing them originally with <hi>brutes,</hi> and the conſequent <hi>treatment,</hi> by cramping their <hi>abilities</hi> and hindering them from becoming <hi>conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> give to theſe unfortunate people, at a very early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, the moſt unfavourable <hi>appearance.</hi> The riſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, who received both the commerce and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their anceſtors, and who had always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to behold their <hi>effects,</hi> did not conſider theſe <hi>effects</hi> as <hi>incidental:</hi> they judged only from what they ſaw; they believed the <hi>appearances</hi> to be <hi>real;</hi> and hence aroſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019561_0030_0FABFBA94DF75528"/>the combined principle, that ſlaves were an <hi>inferiour</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men, and perfectly void of <hi>underſtanding.</hi> Upon this <hi>principle</hi> it was, that the former treatment began to be fully confirmed and eſtabliſhed; and as this <hi>principle</hi> was handed down and diſſeminated, ſo it became, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, an <hi>excuſe</hi> for any ſeverity, that deſpotiſm might ſuggeſt.</p>
                  <p>We may obſerve here, that as all nations had this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in common, as ariſing from the <hi>circumſtances</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſo the Greeks firſt, and the Romans after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, had an <hi>additional excuſe,</hi> as ariſing from their own <hi>vanity.</hi>

                  <p>The former having conquered Troy, and having united themſelves under one common name and intereſt, began, from that period, to diſtinguiſh the reſt of the world by the title of <hi>barbarians;</hi> inferring by ſuch an appellation,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle.

                     <q>that they were men who were only noble in their own country; that they had no right, from their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to authority or command; that, on the contrary, ſo low were their capacities, they were <hi>deſtined</hi> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>to obey,</hi> and live in a ſtate of perpetual drudgery and ſubjugation.</q> Conformable with this opinion was the treatment, which was accordingly preſcribed to a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian.</hi> The philoſopher Ariſtotle himſelf, in the advice which he gave to his pupil Alexander, before he went upon his Aſiatick expedition,<note n="†" place="bottom">Plutarch de Fortun.

                     </q> inferring that the Greeks, from the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their capacities, had a <hi>natural</hi> right to dominion, and that the reſt of the world, from the inferiority of their own, were to be conſidered and treated as the <hi>irrational</hi> part of the creation.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we conſider that this was the treatment, which they judged to be abſolutely proper for people of this deſcription, and that their ſlaves were uniformly thoſe,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019561_0031_0FABFBAA2AF24EF8"/>whom they termed <hi>barbarians;</hi> being generally ſuch, as were either kidnapped from <hi>Barbary,</hi> or purchaſed from the <hi>barbarian</hi> conquerors in their wars with one another; we ſhall immediately ſee, with what an additional excuſe their own vanity had furniſhed them for the ſallies of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price and paſſion.</p>
                  <p>To refute theſe cruel ſentiments of the ancients, and to ſhew that their ſlaves were by no means an inferiour order of beings than themſelves, may perhaps be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an unneceſſary taſk; particularly, as having ſhewn, that the cauſes of this inferiour appearance were <hi>incidental,</hi> ariſing, on the one hand, from the combined effects of the <hi>treatment</hi> and <hi>commerce,</hi> and, on the other, from <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> we ſeem to have refuted them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. But we truſt that ſome few obſervations, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of theſe unfortunate people, will neither be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable nor improper.</p>
                  <p>How then ſhall we begin the refutation? Shall we ſay with Seneca, who ſaw many of the ſlaves in queſtion, <q>What is a <hi>knight,</hi> or a <hi>libertine,</hi> or a <hi>ſlave?</hi> Are they not names, aſſumed either from <hi>injury</hi> or <hi>ambition?</hi>
                     </q> Or, ſhall we ſay with him on another occaſion, <q>Let us conſider that he, whom we call our ſlave, is born in the ſame manner as ourſelves; that he enjoys the ſame ſky, with all its heavenly luminaries; that he breathes, that he lives, in the ſame manner as ourſelves, and, in the ſame manner, that he expires.</q> Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, we confeſs, would furniſh us with a plentiful ſource of arguments in the caſe before us; but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their aſſiſtance. How then ſhall we begin? Shall we enumerate the many inſtances of ſidelity, patience, or valour, that are recorded of the <hi>ſervile</hi> race? Shall we enumerate the many important ſervices, that they rendered both to the individuals and the community, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they lived? Here would be a ſecond ſource, from whence we could collect ſufficient materials to thew, that there was no inferiority in their nature. But we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to uſe them. We ſhall content curſelves with ſome few inſtances, that relate to the <hi>genius</hi> only: we ſhall mention the names of thoſe of a <hi>ſervile</hi> condition, whoſe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019561_0032_0FABFBAABAD376A8"/>writings, have eſcaped the wreck of time, and having been handed down even to the preſent age, are now to be ſeen, as ſo many living monuments, that neither the Grecian, nor Roman genius, was ſuperiour to their own.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, whom we ſhall mention here, is the famous Aeſop. He was a Phrygian by birth, and lived in the time of Croeſus, king of Lydia, to whom he dedicated his fables. The writings of this great man, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light we conſider them, will be equally entitled to our admiration. But we are well aware, that the very mention of him as a writer of fables, may depreciate him in the eyes of ſome. To ſuch we ſhall propoſe a queſtion, <q>Whether this ſpecies of writing has not been more beneficial to mankind; or whether it has not produced more important events, than any other?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the firſt conſideration, it is evident that theſe fables, as conſiſting of plain and ſimple tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, are particularly eaſy to be underſtood; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in images, they pleaſe and ſeduce the mind; and, as containing a <hi>moral,</hi> eaſily deducible on the ſide of virtue; that they afford, at the ſame time, the moſt weighty precepts of philoſophy. Here then are the two grand points of compoſition, <q>a manner of expreſſion to be apprehended by the loweſt capacities, and<note n="*" place="bottom">Omne tulit punctum, qui miſcuit utile dulci. Horace.</note> (what is conſidered as a victory in the art) an happy conjunction of utility and pleaſure.</q> Hence Quintili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an recommends them, as ſingularly uſeful, and as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably adapted, to the puerile age; as a juſt gradation between the language of the nurſe and the preceptor, and as furniſhing maxims of prudence and virtue, at a time when the ſpeculative principles of philoſophy are too difficult to be underſtood. Hence alſo having been introduced by moſt civilized nations into their ſyſtem of education, they have produced that general benefit, to which we at firſt alluded. Nor have they been of leſs conſequence in maturity; but particularly to thoſe of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour capacities, or little erudition, whom they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019561_0033_0FABFBAB8DF165A0"/>ſerved as a guide to conduct them in life, and as a medium, through which an explanation might be made, on many and important occaſions.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the latter conſideration, which is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deducible from hence, we ſhall only appeal to the wonderful effect, which the fable, pronounced by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes againſt Philip of Macedon, produced among his hearers; or to the fable, which was ſpoken by Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Agrippa to the Roman populace; by which an illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate multitude were brought back to their duty as citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, when no other ſpecies of oratory could prevail.</p>
                  <p>To theſe truly <hi>ingenious,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi> works of Aeſop, we ſhall add thoſe of his imitator Phaedrus, which in purity and elegance of ſtyle, are inferiour to none. We ſhall add alſo the Lyrick <hi>Poetry</hi> of Alckman, which is no <hi>ſervile</hi> compoſition; the ſublime <hi>Morals</hi> of Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and the incomparable <hi>comedies</hi> of Terence.</p>
                  <p>Thus then does it appear, that the <hi>excuſe</hi> which was uniformly ſtarted in defence of the <hi>treatment</hi> of ſlaves, had no foundation whatever either in truth or juſtice. The inſtances that we have mentioned above, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew, that there was no inferiority, either in their <hi>nature,</hi> or their underſtandings: and at the ſame time that they refute the principles of the ancients, they afford a valuable leſſon to thoſe, who have been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to form too precipitate a judgment on the abilities of men: for, alas! how often has <hi>ſecret anguiſh</hi> depreſſed the ſpirits of thoſe, whom they have frequently cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from their gloomy and dejected appearance! and how often, on the other hand, has their judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from their own <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>pride!</hi>

                  <p>We proceed now to the conſideration of the <hi>commerce:</hi> in conſequence of which, people, endued with the ſame feelings and faculties as ourſelves, were made ſubject to the laws and limitations of <hi>poſſeſſion.</hi>

This commerce of the human ſpecies was of a very early date. It was founded on the idea that men were <hi>property;</hi> and, as this idea was coeval with the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>involuntary</hi> ſlaves, it muſt have ariſen, (if the date, which we previouſly affixed to that order, be right) in the firſt practices of barter. The Story of Joſeph, as recorded in the ſacred writings, whom his brothers ſold from an envious ſuſpicion of his future greatneſs, is an ample teſtimony of the truth of this conjecture. It ſhews that there were men, even at that early period, who travelled up and down as merchants, collecting not only balm, myrrh, ſpicery, and other wares, but the human ſpecies alſo, for the purpoſes of traffick. The inſtant determination of the brothers, on the firſt ſight of the merchants, <hi>to ſell him,</hi> and the immediate acquieſcence of theſe, who purchaſed him for a foreign market, prove that this commerce had been then eſtabliſhed, not only in that part of the country, where this tranſaction hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, but in that alſo, whither the merchants were then travelling with their camels, namely, Aegypt: and they ſhew farther, that, as all cuſtoms require time for their eſtabliſhment, ſo it muſt have exiſted in the ages, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to that of Pharaoh; that is, in thoſe ages, in which we fixed the firſt date of <hi>involuntary</hi> ſervitude. This commerce then, as appears by the preſent inſtance, exiſted in the earlieſt practices of barter, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the Aegyptians, through as long a period of time, as was ſufficient to have made it, in the times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, an eſtabliſhed cuſtom. Thus was Aegypt, in thoſe days, the place of the greateſt reſort; the grand emporium of trade, to which people were driving their merchandize, as to a centre; and thus did it afford, among other opportunities of traffick, the <hi>firſt market</hi> that is recorded, for the ſale of the human ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>This market, which was thus ſupplied by the conſtant concourſe of merchants, who reſorted to it from various parts, could not fail, by theſe means, to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. It received, afterwards, an additional ſupply from thoſe piracies, which we mentioned to have exiſted in the uncivilized ages of the world, and which, in fact,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019561_0035_0FABFBAD1FF46B80"/>it greatly promoted and encouraged; and it became, from theſe united circumſtances, ſo famous, as to have been known, within a few centuries from the time of Pharaoh, both to the Grecian colonies in Aſia, and the Grecian iſlands. Homer mentions Cyprus and Aegypt as the common markets for ſlaves, about the times of the Trojan war. Thus Antinous, offended with Ulyſſes, threatens to ſend him to<note n="*" place="bottom">Hom.

The ſame poet alſo, in his<note n="†" place="bottom">L. 26.</note> hymn to Bacchus, mentions them again, but in a more unequivocal manner, as the common mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for ſlaves. He takes occaſion, in that hymn, to deſcribe the pirates method of ſcouring the coaſt, from the circumſtance of their having kidnapped Bacchus, as a noble youth, for whom they expected an immenſe ranſom. The captain of the veſſel, having dragged him on board, is repreſented as addreſſing himſelf thus, to the ſteerſman:
<q>
                        <l>"Haul in the tackle, hoiſt aloft the ſail,</l>
                        <l>"Then take your helm, and watch the doubtful gale!</l>
                        <l>"To mind the captive prey, be our's the care,</l>
                        <l>"While you to <hi>Aegypt</hi> or to <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſteer;</l>
                        <l>"There ſhall he go, unleſs his friends he'll tell,</l>
                        <l>"Whoſe ranſom-gifts will pay us full as well."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may not perhaps be conſidered as a digreſſion, to mention in ſew words, by itſelf, the wonderful concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the writings of Moſes and Homer with the caſe before us: not that the farmer, from their divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, want additional ſupport, but becauſe it cannot be unpleaſant to ſee them confirmed by a perſon, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the earlieſt writers, and living in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote age, was the firſt that could afford us any additional proof of the circumſtances above-mentioned. Aegypt is repreſented, in the firſt book of the ſacred writings, as a market for ſlaves, and, in the<note n="†" place="bottom">Exodus. Ch. 1.</note> ſecond, as famous
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:019561_0036_0FABFBADD086B298"/>for the ſeverity of its ſervitude.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide note 1ſt. page 38.</note> The ſame line, which we have already cited from Homer, conveys to us the ſame ideas. It points it out as a market for the human ſpecies, and by the epithet of "<hi>bitter</hi> Aegypt," (<note n="†" place="bottom">This ſtrikes us the more forcibly, as it is ſtiled, <hi>"beautiful and well watered,"</hi> in all other paſſages where it is mentioned, but this.</note> which epithet is peculiarly annexed to it on this occaſion) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes in the ſtrongeſt manner to that ſeverity and rigour, of which the ſacred hiſtorian tranſmitted us the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>But, to return. Though Aegypt was the firſt market recorded for this ſpecies of traffick; and though Aegypt, and Cyprus afterwards, were particularly diſtinguiſhed for it, in the times of the Trojan war; yet they were not the only places, even at that period, where men were bought and ſold. The Odyſſey of Homer ſhews that it was then practiſed in many of the iſlands of the Aegoean ſea; and the Iliad, that it had taken place among thoſe Grecians on the continent of Europe, who had embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence on the Trojan expedition. This appears particularly at the end of the ſeventh book. A fleet is deſcribed there, as having juſt arrived from Lemnos, with a ſupply of wine for the Grecian camp. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are deſcribed alſo, as immediaetly expoſing it to ſale, and as receiving in exchange, among other articles of barter, <hi>"a number of ſlaves."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will now be ſufficient to obſerve, that, as other ſtates aroſe, and as circumſtances contributed to make them known, this cuſtom is diſcovered to have exiſted among them; that it travelled over all Aſia; that it ſpread through the Grecian and Roman world; was in uſe among the barbarous nations, which overturned the Roman empire; and was practiſed therefore, at the ſame period, throughout all Europe.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>ſlavery</hi> and <hi>commerce,</hi> which had continued for ſo long a time, and which was thus practiſed in Europe at ſo late a period as that, which ſucceeded the grand revolutions in the weſtern world, began, as the northern nations were ſettled in their conqueſts, to decline, and, on their full eſtabliſhment, were aboliſhed. A differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion has ariſen reſpecting the cauſe of their abolition; ſome having aſſerted, that they were the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences of the <hi>feudal ſyſtem;</hi> while others, ſuperiour both in number and in argument, have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that they were the natural effects of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> The mode of argument, which the former adopt on this occaſion, is as follows. <q>The multitude of little States, which ſprang up from one great one at this Aera, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned infinite bickerings and matter for contention. There was not a ſtate or ſeignory, which did not want all the hands they could muſter, either to defend their own right, or to diſpute that of their neighbours. Thus every man was taken into the ſervice: whom they armed they muſt truſt: and there could be no truſt but in free men. Thus the barrier between the two natures was thrown down, and <hi>ſlavery</hi> was no more heard of in the <hi>weſt.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this was not the <hi>neccſſary</hi> conſequence of ſuch a ſituation, is apparent. The political ſtate of Greece, in its early hiſtory, was the ſame as that of Europe, when divided, by the feudal ſyſtem, into an infinite number of ſmall and independent kingdoms. There was the ſame matter therefore for contention, and the ſame call for all the hands that could be muſtered: the Grecians, in ſhort, in the <hi>heroick,</hi> were in the ſame ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in theſe reſpects as the <hi>feudal barons</hi> in the <hi>Gothick</hi> times. Had this therefore been a <hi>neceſſary</hi> effect, there had been a ceſſation of ſervitude in Greece, in thoſe ages, in which we have already ſhewn that it exiſted.</p>

But with reſpect to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> many and great are the arguments, that it occaſioned ſo deſirable an event. It taught, <q>that all men were originally equal; that the Deity was no reſpecter of perſons, and that, as all men were to give an account of their actions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, it was neceſſary that they ſhould be free.</q> Theſe doctrines could not fail of having their proper influence on thoſe, who firſt embraced <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> from a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of its truth; and on thoſe of their deſcendents afterwards, who, by engaging in the <hi>cruſades,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their lives and fortunes there, ſhewed, at leaſt, an <hi>attachment</hi> to that religion. We find them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly actuated by theſe principles: we have a poſitive proof, that the <hi>feudal ſyſtem</hi> had no ſhare in the honour of ſuppreſſing ſlavery, but that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was the only cauſe; for the greateſt part of the <hi>charters</hi> which were granted for the freedom of ſlaves in thoſe times (many of which are ſtill extant) were granted, <q>
                        <hi>pro amore Dei, pro mercede animae.</hi>
                     </q> They were founded, in ſhort, on religious conſiderations, <q>that they might procure the favour of the Deity, which they conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have forfeited, by the ſubjugation of thoſe, whom they found to be the objects of the divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and attention equally with themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations, which had thus their firſt origin in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> began to produce their effects, as the different nations were converted; and procured that general liberty at laſt, which, at the cloſe of the twelfth century, was conſpicuous in the weſt of Europe. What a glorious and important change! Thoſe, who would have had otherwiſe no hopes, but that their miſeries would be terminated by death, were then freed from their ſervile condition; thoſe, who, by the laws of war, would have had otherwiſe an immediate proſpect of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude from the hands of their imperious conquerors, were then <hi>exchanged;</hi> a cuſtom, which has happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the preſent day. Thus, <q>A numerous claſs of men, who formerly had no political exiſtence, and were employed merely as inſtruments of labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came uſeful citizens, and contributed towards, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019561_0039_0FABFBAFF51E5F98"/>the force or riches of the ſociety, which adopted them as members;</q> and thus did the greater part of the Europeans, by their conduct on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, aſſert not only liberty for themſelves but for their fellow-creatures, alſo.</p>

We mean only to aſſert, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> were the firſt of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who made their <hi>piratical</hi> expeditions, and ſhewed the way to that <hi>ſlavery,</hi> which now makes ſo diſgraceful a figure in the weſtern colonies of the <hi>Europeans.</hi> In the term "Europeans," wherever it ſhall occur in the remaining part of this firſt diſſertation, we include the <hi>portugueſe,</hi> and <hi>thoſe nations only,</hi> who followed their example.</note>
                     <hi>firſt</hi> carried the wretched inhabitants into ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>This practice, however trifling and partial it might appear at firſt, ſoon became ſerious and general. A melancholy inſtance of the depravity of human nature;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019561_0040_0FABFBB1C5DA17B8"/>as it ſhews, that neither the laws nor religion of any country, however excellent the forms of each, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bind the conſciences of ſome; but that there are always men, of every age, country, and perſuaſion, who are ready to ſacrifice their deareſt principles at the ſhrine of gain. Our own anceſtors, together with the Spaniards, French, and moſt of the maritime powers of Europe, ſoon followed the <hi>piratical</hi> example; and thus did the Europeans, to their eternal infamy, renew a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which their <hi>own</hi> anceſtors had ſo lately exploded, from a <hi>conſcientiouſneſs</hi> of its <hi>impiety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The unfortunate Africans, terrified at theſe repeated depredations, fled in confuſion from the coaſt, and ſought, in the interiour parts of the country, a retreat from the perſecution of their invaders But, alas, they were miſerably diſappointed! There are few retreats, that can eſcape the penetrating eye of avarice. The Europeans ſtill purſued them; they entered their rivers; ſailed up into the heart of the country; ſurprized-tho unfortunate Africans again; and carried them into ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>But this conduct, though ſucceſsful at firſt, defeated afterwards its own ends. It created a more general alarm, and pointed out, at the ſame inſtant, the beſt method of ſecurity from future depredations. The banks of the rivers were accordingly deſerted, as the coaſts had been before; and thus were the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> invaders left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proſpect of their prey.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation however, expedients were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They now formed to themſelves the reſolution of ſettling in the country; of ſecuring themſelves by forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied poſts; of changing their ſyſtem of force into that of pretended liberality; and of opening, by every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of bribery and corruption, a communication with the natives. Theſe plans were put into immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The Europeans erected their<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> erected their firſt fort at <hi>D'Elmine,</hi> in the year 1481, about forty years after Alonzo Gonzales had pointed the Southern Africans out to his countrymen as articles of commerce.</note> forts; landed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019561_0041_0FABFBB2467F8F18"/>their merchandize; and endeavoured, by a peaceable deportment, by preſents, and by every appearance of munificence, to ſeduce the attachment and confidence of the Africans. Theſe ſchemes had the deſired effect. The gaudy trappings of European art, not only caught their attention, but excited their curioſity: they dazzled the eyes and bewitched the ſenſes, not only of thoſe, to whom they were given, but of thoſe, to whom they were ſhewn. Thus followed a ſpeedy intercourſe with each other, and a confidence, highly favourable to the views of avarice or ambition.</p>
                  <p>It was now time for the Europeans to embrace the opportunity, which this intercourſe had thus afforded them, of carrying their ſchemes into execution, and of fixing them on ſuch a permanent foundation, as ſhould ſecure them future ſucceſs. They had already diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the different interviews obtained, the chiefs of the African tribes. They paid their court therefore to theſe, and ſo compleatly intoxicated their ſenſes with the luxuries, which they brought from home, as to be able to ſeduce them to their deſings. A treaty of peace and commerce was immediately concluded: it was agreed, that the kings, on their part, ſhould, from this period, ſentence <hi>priſoners of war</hi> and <hi>convicts</hi> to <hi>European ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude;</hi> and that the Europeans ſhould ſupply them, in return, with the luxuries of the north. This agreement immediately took place; and thus begun that <hi>commerce,</hi> which makes ſo conſiderable a figure at the preſent day.</p>
                  <p>But happy had the Africans been, if thoſe only, who had beer, juſtly convicted of crimes, or taken in a juſt war, had been ſentenced to the ſeverities of ſervitude! How many of thoſe miſeries, which afterwards attended them, had been never known; and how would their hiſtory have ſaved thoſe ſighs and emotions of pity, which muſt now ever accompany its peruſal. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, on the eſtabliſhment of their weſtern colonies, required a greater number of ſlaves than a ſtrict adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the treaty could produce. The princes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had only the choice of relinquiſhing the commerce,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019561_0042_0FABFBBAA68432F0"/>or of conſenting to become unjuſt. They had long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the emoluments of the trade; they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a taſte for the luxuries it afforded; and they now beheld an opportunity of gratifying it, but in a more extenſive manner. <hi>Avarice</hi> therefore, which was too powerful for <hi>juſtice</hi> on this occaſion, immediately turned the ſcale: not only thoſe, who were fairly convicted of offences, were now ſentenced to ſervitude, but even thoſe who were <hi>ſuſpected.</hi> New crimes were invented, that new puniſhments might ſucceed. Thus was every appearance ſoon conſtrued into reality; every ſhadow into a ſubſtance; and often virtue into a crime.</p>
                  <p>Such alſo was the caſe with reſpect to priſoners of war. Not only thoſe were now delivered into ſlavery, who were taken in a ſtate of publick enmity and injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but thoſe alſo, who, conſcious of no injury what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; were taken in the <hi>arbitrary</hi> ſkirmiſhes of theſe <hi>venal</hi> ſovereigns. War was now made, not as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the motives of retaliation and defence, but for the ſake of obtaining priſoners alone, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages reſulting from their ſale. If a ſhip from Europe came but into ſight, it was now conſidered as a ſufficient motive for a war, and as a ſignal only for an inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commencement of hoſtilities.</p>
                  <p>But if the African kings could be capable of ſuch injuſtice, what vices are there, that their conſciences would reſtrain, or what enormities, that we might not expect to be committed? When men once conſent to be unjuſt, they loſe, at the ſame inſtant with their virtue, a conſiderable portion of that ſenſe of ſhame, which, till then, had been found a ſucceſsful protector againſt the ſallies of vice. From that awful period, almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expectation is forlorn: the heart is left unguarded: its great protector is no more: the <hi>vices</hi> therefore, which ſo long encompaſſed it in vain, obtain an eaſy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: in crouds they pour into the defenceleſs avenues, and take poſſeſſion of the ſoul: there is nothing now too vile for them to meditate, too impious to perform. Such was the ſituation of the deſpotick ſovereigns of Africa. They had once ventured to paſs the bounds of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019561_0043_0FABFBBB2DB3F768"/>virtue, and they ſoon proceeded to enormity. This was particularly conſpicuous in that general conduct, which they uniformly obſerved, after any unſucceſsful conflict. Influenced only by the venal motives of European traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, they firſt made war upon the neighbouring tribes, contrary to every principle of juſtice; and if, by the flight of the enemy, or by other contingencies, they were diſappointed of their prey, they made no heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of immediately turning their arms againſt their own ſubjects. The firſt villages they came to, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways marked on this occaſion, as the firſt objects of their avarice. They were immediately ſurrounded, were afterwards ſet on ſire, and the wretched inhabitants ſeized, as they were eſcaping from the flames. Theſe, conſiſting of whole families, fathers, brothers, huſbands, wives, and children, were inſtantly driven in chains to the merchants, and conſigned to ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>To theſe calamities, which thus aroſe from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the kings, we may now ſubjoin thoſe, which aroſe from the avarice of private perſons. Many were kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napped by their own countrymen, who, encouraged by the merchants of Europe, previouſly lay in wait for them, and ſold them afterwards for ſlaves; while the ſeamen of the different ſhips, by every poſſible artifice, enticed others on board, and tranſported them to the regions of ſervitude.</p>
                  <p>As theſe practices are in full force at the preſent day, it appears that there are four orders of <hi>involuntary</hi> ſlaves on the African continent; of<note n="*" place="bottom">In the ancient ſervitude, we reckoned <hi>convicts</hi> among the <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> ſlaves, becauſe they had it in their power, by a virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to have avoided ſo melancholy a ſituation: in the <hi>African,</hi> we include them in the <hi>involuntary,</hi> becauſe, as virtues are frequently conſtrued into crimes, from the venal motives of the traffick, no perſon whatever poſſeſſes ſuch a <hi>power</hi> or <hi>choice.</hi>

                     <hi>convicts;</hi> of <hi>priſoners of war;</hi> of thoſe, who are publickly ſeized by virtue of the <hi>authority</hi> of their prince; and of thoſe, who are privately <hi>kidnapped</hi> by individuals.</p>
                  <p>It remains only to obſerve on this head, that in the ſale and purchaſe of theſe the African commerce or

                     <hi>Slave Trade</hi> conſiſts; that they are delivered to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Europe in exchange for their various commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; that theſe tranſport them to their colonies in the weſt, where their <hi>ſlavery</hi> takes place; and that a fifth order ariſes there, compoſed of all ſuch as are born to the native Africans, after their tranſportation and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have commenced.</p>
                  <p>Having thus explained as much of the hiſtory of modern ſervitude, as is ſufficient for the proſecution of our deſign, we ſhould have cloſed our account here, but that a work, juſt publiſhed, has furniſhed us with a ſingular anecdote of the coloniſts of a neighbouring nation, which we cannot but relate.

                  <p>AS we explained the Hiſtory of Slavery in the firſt part of this Eſſay, as far as it was neceſſary for our purpoſe, we ſhall now take the queſtion into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which we propoſed at firſt as the ſubject of our inquiry, viz. how far the commerce and ſlavery of the human ſpecies, as revived by ſome of the nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in the perſons of the unfortunate Africans, and as revived, in a great meaſure, on the principles of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, are conſiſtent with the laws of nature, or the common notions of equity, as eſtabliſhed among men.</p>
                  <p>This queſtion reſolves itſelf into two ſeparate parts for diſcuſſion, into <hi>the African commerce (as explained in the hiſtory of ſlavery)</hi> and <hi>the ſubſequent ſlavery in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as founded on the equity of the commerce.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of courſe, will be firſt examined.

Such an inquiry will be particularly uſeful in the preſent place; it will afford us that general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſubordination and liberty, which is neceſſary in the caſe before us, and will be ſound, as it were, a ſource, to which we may frequently refer for many and valuable arguments.</p>

                     <pb n="50" facs="unknown:019561_0047_0FABFBC0A0599DC0"/>
It appears that mankind were originally free, and that they poſſeſſed an equal right to the ſoil and produce of the earth. For proof of this, we need only appeal to the <hi>divine</hi> writings; to the <hi>golden age</hi> of the poets, which, like other fables of the times, had its origin in truth; and to the inſtitution of the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> and of other ſimilar feſtivals; all of which are ſo many monuments of this original equality of men. Hence then there was no rank, no diſtinction, no ſuperiour. Every man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered where he choſe, changing his reſidence, as a ſpot attracted his fancy, or ſuited his convenience, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled by his neighbour, unconnected with any but his family. Hence alſo (as every thing was common) he collected what he choſe without injury, and enjoyed without injury what he had collected. Such was the firſt ſituation of mankind;<note n="*" place="bottom">This concluſion concerning the diſſociated ſtate of mankind, is confirmed by all the carly writers, with whoſe deſcriptions of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times no other concluſion is reconcileable.</note> a ſtate of <hi>diſſociation</hi> and <hi>independence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this diſſociated ſtate it is impoſſible that men could have long continued. The dangers to which they muſt have frequently been expoſed, by the attacks of fierce and rapacious beaſts, by the procdatory attempts of their own ſpecies, and by the diſputes of contiguous and independent families; theſe, together with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to defend themſelves, on many ſuch occaſions, muſt have incited them to unite. Hence then was <hi>ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> formed on the grand principles of preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: and as theſe principles began to operate, in the different parts of the earth, where the different families had roamed, a great number of theſe <hi>ſocieties</hi> began to be formed and eſtabliſhed; which, taking to themſelves particular names from particular occurrences, began to be perfectly diſtinct from one another.</p>
                  <p>As the individuals, of whom theſe ſocieties were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, had aſſociated only for their defence, ſo they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, at firſt, no change in their condition. They
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:019561_0048_0FABFBC1504B2C50"/>were ſtill independent and free; they were ſtill without diſcipline or laws; the had every thing ſtill in common; they purſued the ſame manner of life; wandering only, in <hi>herds,</hi> as the earth gave them or refuſed them ſuſtenance, and doing, as a <hi>publick body,</hi> what they had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to do as <hi>individuals</hi> before.

                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus joined themſelves together, and having formed themſelves into ſeveral large and diſtinct bodies, they could not ſail of ſubmitting ſoon to a more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable change. Their numbers muſt have rapidly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their ſocieties, in proceſs of time, have become ſo populous, as frequently to have experienced the want of ſubſiſtence, and many of the commotions and tumults of inteſtine ſtrife. For theſe inconveniences however there were remedies to be found. <hi>Agriculture</hi> would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with that ſubſiſtence and ſupport, which the earth, from the rapid increaſe of its inhabitants, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unable ſpontaneouſly to produce. An <hi>Aſſignation</hi> of <hi>property</hi> would not only enforce an application, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite an emulation, to labour; and <hi>government</hi> would at once afford a ſecurity to the acquiſitions of the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and heal the inteſtine diſorders of the community, by the introduction of Laws.</p>
                  <p>Such then were the remedies, that were gradually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. The <hi>ſocieties,</hi> which had hitherto ſeen their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, undiſtinguiſhed either by authority or rank, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted now of magiſtratical pre-eminence. They were divided into tribes; to every tribe was allotted a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſtrict for its ſupport, and to every individual his

                  <p>As we have thus traced the ſituation of man from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded liberty to ſubordination, it will be proper to carry our inquiries farther, and to conſider, who firſt obtained the pre-eminence in theſe <hi>primoeval ſocieties,</hi> and by what particular methods it was obtained,</p>
                  <p>There where only two ways, by which ſuch an event could have been produced, by <hi>compulſion</hi> or <hi>conſent.</hi>— When mankind firſt ſaw the neceſſity of government, it is probable that many had conceived the deſire of rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To be placed in a new ſituation, to be taken from the common herd, to be the firſt, diſtinguiſhed among men, were thoughts, that muſt have had their charms. Let us ſuppoſe then, that theſe thoughts had worked ſo unuſually on the paſſions of any particular individual, as to have driven him to the extravagant deſign of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the pre-eminence by force. How could his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign have been accompliſhed? How could he forcibly have uſurped the juriſdiction at a time, when, all being equally free, there was not a ſingle perſon, whoſe aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he could command? Add to this, that, in a ſtate of univerſal liberty, force had been repaid by force, and the attempt had been fatal to the uſurper.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>empire</hi> then could never have been gained at firſt by <hi>compulſion,</hi> ſo it could only have been obtained by <hi>conſent;</hi> and as men were then going to make an import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſacrifice, for the ſake of their <hi>mutual</hi> happineſs, ſo he alone could have obtained it, (not whoſe <hi>ambition</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:019561_0050_0FABFBC2DFC41480"/>had greatly diſtinguiſhed him from the reſt) but in whoſe <hi>wiſdom, juſtice, prudence,</hi> and <hi>virtue,</hi> the whole community could confide.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this reaſoning, we ſhall appeal, as before, to facts; and ſhall conſult therefore the hiſtory of thoſe nations, which having juſt left their former ſtate of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſociety,</hi> were the very people that eſtabliſhed <hi>ſubordination</hi> and <hi>government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The commentaries of Caeſar afforded us the following accounts of the ancient Gauls. When any of their kings, either by death, or depoſition, made a vacancy in the regal office, the whole nation was immediately convened for the appointment of a ſucceſſor. In theſe national conventions were the regal offices conferred. Every individual had a voice on the occaſion, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual was free. The perſon upon whom the general approbation appeared to fall, was immediately advanced to pre-eminence in the ſtate. He was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly one, whoſe actions had made him eminent; whoſe conduct had gained him previous applauſe; whoſe valour the very aſſembly, that elected him, had themſelves wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in the field; whoſe prudence, wiſdom and juſtice, having rendered him ſignally ſerviceable, had endeared him to his tribe. For this reaſon, their kingdoms were not hereditary; the ſon did not always inherit the virtues of the ſire; and they were determined that he alone ſhould poſſeſs authority, in whoſe virtues they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. Nor was this all. So ſenſible were they of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſacrifice they had made; ſo extemely jealous even of the name of ſuperiority and power, that they limited, by a variety of laws, the authority of the very perſon, whom they had juſt elected, from a confidence of his integrity; Ambiorix himſelf confeſſing, <q>that his people had as much power over him, as he could poſſibly have over his people.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame cuſtom, as appears from Tacitus, prevailed alſo among the Germans. They had their national, councils, like the Gauls; in which the regal and ducal offices were confirmed according to the majority of voices. They elected alſo, on theſe occaſions, thoſe only,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019561_0051_0FABFBC3726DA718"/>whom their virtue, by repeated trial, had unequivocally diſtinguiſhed from the reſt; and they limited their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo far, as neither to leave them the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting impriſonment or ſtripes, nor of exerciſing any penal juriſdiction. But as puniſhment was neceſſary in a ſtate of civil ſociety, <q>it was permitted to the prieſts alone, that it might appear to have been inflicted, by the order of the gods, and not by any ſuperiour au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The accounts which we have thus given of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Germans and Gauls, will be found alſo to be equally true of thoſe people, which had arrived at the ſame ſtate of ſubordinate ſociety. We might appeal, for a teſtimony of this, to the hiſtory of the Goths; to the hiſtory of the Franks and Saxons; to the hiſtory in ſhort, of all thoſe nations, from which the different governments, now conſpicuous in Europe, have undeniably ſprung. And we might appeal, as a farther proof, to the Americans, who are repreſented by many of the moderns, from their own ocular teſtimony, as obſerving the ſame cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms at the preſent day.</p>
                  <p>It remains only to obſerve, that as theſe cuſtoms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among the different nations deſcibed, in their early ſtate of ſubordinate ſociety, and as they were more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the cuſtoms of their reſpective anceſtors, it appears that they muſt have been handed down, both by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe, from the firſt introduction of <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <p>We may now deduce thoſe general maxims concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſubordination,</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> which we mentioned to have been eſſentially connected with the ſubject, and which ſome, from ſpeculation only, and without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to facts, have been bold enough to deny.</p>
                  <p>It appears firſt, that <hi>liberty</hi> is a <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> an <hi>adventitious</hi> right, becauſe all men were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally free.</p>

It appears ſecondly, that government is a<note n="*" place="bottom">The author has lately read a work, intitled Paley's Moral and Political Philoſophy, which, in this one reſpect, favours thoſe which have been hinted at, as it denies that government was a contract. <q>No ſocial compact was ever made in fact,"—"it is to ſuppoſe it poſſible to call ſavages out of caves and deſerts, to deliberate upon topicks, which the experience and ſtudies, and the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of civil life alone ſuggeſt. Therefore no government in the univerſe begun from this original.</q> But there are no grounds for ſo abſurd a ſuppoſition; for government, and of courſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial compact, does not appear to have been introduced at the time, when families coming out of their caves and deſerts, or, in other words, quitting their former <hi>diſſociated</hi> ſtate, joined themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. They had lived a conſiderable time in <hi>ſociety,</hi> like the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians and Goetulians before-mentioned, and had felt many of the diſadvantages of a want of diſcipline and laws, before government was introduced at all. The author of this Eſſay, before he took into conſideration the origin of government, was determined, in a matter of ſuch importance, to be biaſſed by no opinion whatever, and much leſs to indulge himſelf in ſpeculation. He was determined ſolely to adhere to fact, and, by looking into the accounts left us of thoſe governments which were in their infancy, and, of courſe in the leaſt complicated ſtate, to attempt to diſcover their foundation: he cannot ſay therefore, that upon a very minute peruſal of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent work before quoted, he has been ſo far convinced, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in the leaſt from his ſentiments on this head, and to give up maxims, which are drawn from hiſtorical facts, for thoſe, which are the reſult of ſpeculation. He may obſerve here, that whether go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was a <hi>contract</hi> or not, it will not affect the reaſoning of the preſent Eſſay; ſince where ever the contract is afterwards mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is inferred only that its object was "the <hi>happineſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>" which is confeſſedly the end of government. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he is under the neceſſity of inſerting this little note, though he almoſt feels himſelf ungrateful in contradicting a work, which has afforded him ſo much entertainment.</note>
                     <hi>contract;</hi> becauſe, in theſe primoeval ſubordinate ſocieties, we have ſeen it voluntarily conferred on the one hand, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted on the other. We have ſeen it ſubject to various reſtrictions. We have ſeen its articles, which could then only be written by tradition and uſe, as perfect and binding as thoſe, which are now committed to letters. We have ſeen it, in ſhort, partaking of the <hi>foederal</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as much as it could in a ſtate, which wanted the means of recording its tranſactions.</p>

It appears, thirdly, that the grand object of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> is the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the people; becauſe they gave the ſupremacy to him alone, who had been conſpicuous for the ſplendour of his abilities, or the integrity of his life: that the power of the multitude being directed by the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of the prince, they might expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the moſt effectual protection from injury, the higheſt advantages of ſociety, the greateſt poſſible <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi>

                  <p>Having now collected the materials that are neceſſary for the proſecution of our deſign, we ſhall immediately enter upon the diſcuſſion.</p>
                  <p>If any man had originally been endued with power, as with other faculties, ſo that the reſt of mankind had diſcovered in themſelves an <hi>innate neceſſity</hi> of obeying this particular perſon; it is evident that he and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants, from the ſuperiority of their nature, would have had a claim upon men for obedience, and a natural right to command: but as the right to empire is <hi>adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious;</hi> as all were originally free; as nature made every man's body and mind <hi>his own;</hi> it is evident that no juſt man can be conſigned to <hi>ſlavery,</hi> without his own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can men, by the ſame principles, be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as lands, goods, or houſes, among <hi>poſſeſſions.</hi> It is neceſſary that all <hi>property</hi> ſhould be inferiour to its <hi>poſſeſſor.</hi> But how does the <hi>ſlave</hi> differ from his <hi>maſter,</hi> but by <hi>chance?</hi> For though the mark, with which the latter is pleaſed to brand him, ſhews, at the firſt ſight, the difference of their <hi>fortune;</hi> what mark can be found in his <hi>nature,</hi> that can warrant a diſtinction?</p>
                  <p>To this conſideration we ſhall add the following, that if men can juſtly become the property of each other, their children, like the offspring of cattle, muſt inherit their <hi>paternal</hi> lot. Now, as the actions of the father and the child muſt be thus at the ſole diſpoſal of their common maſter, it is evident, that the <hi>authority</hi> of the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:019561_0054_0FABFBD701054E88"/>one, as a <hi>parent,</hi> and the <hi>duty</hi> of the other, as a <hi>child,</hi> muſt be inſtantly annihilated; rights and obligations, which, as they are founded in nature, are implanted in our feelings, and are eſtabliſhed by the voice of God, muſt contain in their annihilation a ſolid argument to prove, that there cannot be any <hi>property</hi> whatever in the <hi>human ſpecies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may conſider alſo, as a farther confirmation, that it is impoſſible, in the nature of things, that <hi>liberty</hi> can be <hi>bought</hi> or <hi>ſold!</hi> It is neither <hi>ſaleable,</hi> nor <hi>purchaſable.</hi> For if any one man can have an abſolute property in the liberty of another, or, in other words, if he, who is called a <hi>maſter,</hi> can have a <hi>juſt</hi> right to command the actions of him, who is called a <hi>ſlave,</hi> it is evident that the latter cannot be accountable for thoſe crimes, which the former may order him to commit. Now as every reaſonable being is accountable for his actions, it is evident, that ſuch a right cannot <hi>juſtly</hi> exiſt, and that human liberty, of courſe, is beyond the poſſibility either of <hi>ſale</hi> or <hi>purchaſe.</hi> Add to this, that, whenever you ſell the liberty of a man, you have the power only of alluding to the <hi>body:</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> cannot be confined or bound: it will be free, though its manſion be beſet with chains. But if, in every ſale of the <hi>human ſpecies,</hi> you are under the neceſſity of conſidering your ſlave in this abſtracted light; of alluding only to the body, and of making no alluſion to the mind; you are under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity alſo of treating him, in the ſame moment, as a <hi>brute,</hi> and of abuſing therefore that nature, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be conſidered, than in the double capacity of <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome perſon, perhaps, will make an objection to one of the former arguments. <q>If men, from the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> of their nature, cannot be conſidered, like lands, goods, or houſes, among poſſeſſions, ſo neither can cattle: for being endued with life, motion, and ſenſibility, they are evidently <hi>ſuperiour</hi> to theſe.</q>— But this objection will receive its anſwer from thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which have been already made; and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the true reaſon, why cattle are juſtly to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:019561_0055_0FAFFBD7C0C05648"/>as property. For firſt, the right to empire over brutes, is <hi>natural,</hi> and not <hi>adventitious,</hi> like the right to empire over men. There are, ſecondly, many and evident ſigns of the <hi>inferiority</hi> of their nature; and thirdly, their liberty can be bought and ſold, becauſe, being void of reaſon, they cannot be <hi>accountable</hi> for their actions.</p>
                  <p>We might ſtop here for a conſiderable time, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many valuable leſſons from the remarks that have been made, but that ſuch a circumſtance might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a digreſſion. There is one, however, which, as it is ſo intimately connected with the ſubject, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deduce. We are taught to treat men in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner from brutes, becauſe they are ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuperiour in their nature; we are taught to treat brutes in a different manner from ſtones, for the ſame reaſon; and thus, by giving to every created thing its due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to anſwer the views of Providence, which did not create a variety of natures without a purpoſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe things are ſo, how evidently againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nature, and every thing human and divine, muſt they act, who not only force men into <hi>ſlavery,</hi> againſt their own <hi>conſent,</hi> but treat them altogether as <hi>brutes,</hi> and make the <hi>natural liberty</hi> of man an article of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick commerce! and by what arguments can they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly defend that commerce, which cannot be carried on, in any ſingle inſtance, without a flagrant violation of the laws of nature and of God?</p>

                  <p>That we may the more accurately examine the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are advanced on this occaſion, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to divide the <hi>commerce</hi> into two parts; firſt, as it relates to thoſe who <hi>ſell,</hi> and ſecondly, as it relates to thoſe who <hi>purchaſe,</hi> the <hi>human ſpecies</hi> into ſlavery. To the former part of which, having given every previous and neceſſary information in the hiſtory of ſervitude, we ſhall immediately proceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:019561_0056_0FABFBD874AF2AD8"/>
Let us inquire firſt, by what particular right the <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the harmleſs people are invaded by the <hi>prince.</hi> "By the <hi>right of empire,</hi>" it will be anſwered; <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he poſſeſſes dominion and power by their own approbation and conſent.</q> But ſubjects, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion, are not the <hi>property,</hi> of the prince. They cannot be conſidered as his <hi>poſſeſſions.</hi> Their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are both the ſame; they are both born in the ſame manner; are ſubject to the ſame diſorders; muſt apply to the ſame remedies for a cure; are equally partakers of the grave: an <hi>incidental</hi> diſtinction accompanies them through life, and this—is all.</p>
                  <p>We may add to this, that though the prince poſſeſſes dominion and power, by the conſent and approbation of his ſubjects, he poſſeſſes it only for the moſt <hi>ſalutary</hi> ends. He may tyrannize, if he can: he may alter the <hi>form</hi> of his government: he cannot, however, alter its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>end.</hi> Theſe will be immutably the ſame, though the whole ſyſtem of its adminiſtration ſhould be changed; and he will be ſtill bound to <hi>defend</hi> the lives and properties of his ſubjects, and to make them <hi>happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Does he defend thoſe therefore, whom he invades at diſcretion with the ſword? Does he protect the property of thoſe, whoſe houſes and effects he conſigns at diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the flames? Does he make thoſe happy, whom he ſeizes, as they are trying to eſcape the general devaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and compels with their wives and families to a wretched <hi>ſervitude?</hi> He acts ſurely, as if the uſe of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire conſiſted in violence and oppreſſion; as if he, that was moſt exalted, ought, of neceffity, to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. Here then the voice of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> is againſt him. He breaks that law of <hi>nature,</hi> which ordains, <q>that no juſt man ſhall be given into ſlavery, againſt his own <hi>conſent:</hi>
                     </q> he violates the firſt law of <hi>juſtice,</hi> as eſtabliſhed among men, <q>that no perſon ſhall do harm to another without a previous and ſufficient <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;</hi>
                     </q> and he violates alſo the ſacred condition of <hi>empire,</hi> made with his anceſtors, and neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in every ſpecies of government, <q>that, the power
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:019561_0057_0FABFBD933AFD790"/>of the multitude being given up to the wiſdom and juſtice of the prince, they may experience, in return, the moſt effectual protection from injury, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantages of ſociety, the greateſt poſſible <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if kings then, to whom their own people have granted dominion and power, are unable to invade the liberties of their harmleſs ſubjects, without the higheſt <hi>injuſtice;</hi> how can thoſe private perſons be juſtified, who treacherouſly lie in wait for their fellow-creatures, and ſell them into ſlavery? What arguments can they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring in their defence? What treaty of empire can they produce, by which their innocent victims ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to them the leaſt portion of their <hi>liberty?</hi> In vain will they plead the <hi>antiquity</hi> of the cuſtom: in vain will the <hi>honourable</hi> light, in which <hi>piracy</hi> was conſidered in the ages of barbariſm, afford them an excuſe. Impious and abandoned men! ye invade the liberties of thoſe, who, (with reſpect to your impious ſelves) are in a ſtate of <hi>nature,</hi> in a ſtate of original <hi>diſſociation,</hi> perfectly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,</hi> perfectly <hi>free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears then, that the two orders of ſlaves, which have been mentioned in the hiſtory of the African ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, <q>of thoſe who are publickly ſeized by virtue of the authority of their prince; and of thoſe, who are privately kidnapped by individuals,</q> are collected by means of violence and oppreſſion; by means, repugnant to <hi>nature,</hi> the principles of <hi>government,</hi> and the common notions of <hi>equity,</hi> as eſtabliſhed among men.</p>

               <div n="6" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>We come now to the third order of <hi>involuntary</hi> ſlaves, "to convicts." The only argument that the ſellers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance here, is this, <q>that they have been found guilty of offences, and that the puniſhment is juſt.</q> But before the equity of the ſentence can be allowed, two queſtions muſt be decided, whether the puniſhment is <hi>proportioned</hi> to the offence, and what is its particular <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and <hi>end?</hi>

To decide the firſt, we may previouſly obſerve, that the African ſervitude comprehends <hi>baniſhment,</hi> a <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of <hi>liberty,</hi> and many <hi>corporal</hi> ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>baniſhment,</hi> the following obſervations will ſuffice. Mankind have their <hi>local</hi> attachments. They have a particular regard for the ſpot, in which they were born and nurtured. Here it was, that they firſt drew their infant-breath: here, that they were cheriſhed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: here, that they paſſed thoſe ſcenes of childhood, which, free from care and anxiety, are the happieſt in the life of man; ſcenes, which accompany them through life; which throw themſelves frequently into their thoughts, and produce the moſt agreeable ſenſations. Theſe then are weighty conſiderations; and how great this regard is, may be evidenced from our own feelings; from the teſtimony of ſome, who when remote from their country, and in the hour of danger and diſtreſs, have found their thoughts unuſually directed, by ſome impulſe or other, to their native ſpot; and from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, who, having braved the ſtorms and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of life, either repair to it for the remainder of their days, or deſire even to be conveyed to it, when exiſtence is no more.</p>
                  <p>But ſeparately from theſe their <hi>local,</hi> they have alſo their <hi>perſonal</hi> attachments; their regard for particular men. There are ties of blood; there are ties of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In the former caſe, they muſt of neceſſity be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached: the conſtitution of their nature demands it. In the latter, it is impoſſible to be otherwiſe; ſince friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is founded on an harmony of temper, on a concord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſentiments and manners, on habits of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a mutual exchange of favours.</p>
                  <p>We may now mention, as perfectly diſtinct both from their <hi>local</hi> and <hi>perſonal,</hi> the <hi>national</hi> attachments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, their regard for the whole body of the people, among whom they were born and educated. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is particularly conſpicuous in the conduct of ſuch, as, being thus <hi>nationally</hi> connected, reſide in foreign parts. How anxiouſly do they meet together! how much do they enjoy the ſight of others of their countrymen,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:019561_0059_0FABFBDB6E8A5268"/>whom fortune places in their way! what an eagerneſs do they ſhew to ſerve them, though not born on the ſame particular ſpot, though not connected by conſanguinity or friendſhip, though unknown to them before! Neither is this affection wonderful, ſince they are creatures of the ſame education; of the ſame principles; of the ſame manners and habits; caſt, as it were, in the ſame mould; and marked with the ſame impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>If men therefore are thus ſeparately attached to the ſeveral objects deſcribed, it is evident that a ſeparate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from either muſt afford them conſiderable pain. What then muſt be their ſufferings, to be forced for ever from their country, which includes them all? Which contains the <hi>ſpot,</hi> in which they were born and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; which contains their <hi>relations</hi> and <hi>friends;</hi> which contains the whole body of the <hi>people,</hi> among whom they were bred and educated. In theſe ſufferings, which ariſe to men, both in bidding, and in having bid, adieu to all that they eſteem as dear and valuable, <hi>baniſhment</hi> conſiſts in part; and we may agree therefore with the ancients, without adding other melancholy circumſtances to the account, that it is no inconſiderable puniſhment of itſelf.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>liberty,</hi> which is the ſecond conſideration in the puniſhment, it is evident that men bear nothing worſe; that there is nothing, that they lay more at heart; and that they have ſhewn, by many and memorable inſtances, that even death is to be preferred. How many could be named here, who, having ſuffered the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>liberty,</hi> have put a period to their exiſtence! How many, that have willingly undergone the hazard of their lives to deſtroy a tyrant! How many, that have even gloried to periſh in the attempt! How many bloody and publick wars have been undertaken (not to mention the numerous <hi>ſervile</hi> inſurrections, with which hiſtory is ſtained) for the cauſe of <hi>freedom!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if nothing is dearer than <hi>liberty</hi> to men, with which, the barren rock is able to afford its joys, and without which, the glorious ſun ſhines upon them but in vain, and all the ſweets and delicacies of life are taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:019561_0060_0FABFBE72F3E5C40"/>and unenjoyed; what puniſhment can be more ſevere than the loſs of ſo great a bleſſing? But if to this <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of <hi>liberty,</hi> we add the agonizing pangs of <hi>baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and if to the complicated ſtings of both, we add the inceſſant <hi>ſtripes, wounds,</hi> and <hi>miſeries,</hi> which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by thoſe, who are ſold into this horrid <hi>ſervitude;</hi> what crime can we poſſibly imagine to be ſo enormous, as to be worthy of ſo great a puniſhment?</p>
                  <p>How contrary then to reaſon, juſtice, and nature, muſt thoſe act, who apply this, the ſevereſt of human puniſhments, to the moſt inſignificant offence! yet ſuch is the cuſtom with the Africans: for, from the time, in which the Europeans firſt intoxicated the African princes with their foreign draughts, no crime has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, no ſhadow of a crime deviſed, that has not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately been puniſhed with <hi>ſervitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for what purpoſe is the puniſhment applied? Is it applied to amend the manners of the criminal, and thus render him a better ſubject? No, for if you baniſh him, he can no longer be a ſubject, and you can no longer therefore be ſolicitous for his morals. Add to this, that if you baniſh him to a place, where he is to experience the hardſhips of want and hunger (ſo powerfully does hunger compel men to the perpetration of crimes) you force him rather to corrupt, than amend his manners, and to be wicked, when he might otherwiſe be juſt.</p>
                  <p>Is it applied then, that others may be deterred from the ſame proceedings, and that crimes may become leſs frequent? No, but that <hi>avarice</hi> may be gratified; that the prince may experience the emoluments of the ſale: for, horrid and melancholy thought! the more crimes his ſubjects commit, the richer is he made; the more <hi>abandoned</hi> the ſubject, the <hi>happier</hi> is the prince!</p>
                  <p>Neither can we allow that the puniſhment thus applied, tends in any degree to anſwer the <hi>publick happineſs;</hi> for if men can be ſentenced to ſlavery, right or wrong; if ſhadows can be turned into ſubſtances, and virtues into crimes; it is evident that none can be happy, becauſe none can be ſecure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:019561_0061_0FABFBE8CD943628"/>
But if the puniſhment is infinitely greater than the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, (which has been ſhewn before) and if it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, neither to amend the criminal, nor to deter others from the ſame proceedings, nor to advance, in any degree, the happineſs of the publick, it is ſcarce ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that it is totally unjuſt, ſince it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to <hi>reaſon,</hi> the dictates of <hi>nature,</hi> and the very principles of <hi>government.</hi>

                  <p>We come now to the fourth and laſt order of ſlaves, to <hi>priſoners of war.</hi> As the <hi>ſellers</hi> lay a particular ſtreſs on this order of men, and infer much, from its <hi>antiquity,</hi> in ſupport of the juſtice of their cauſe, we ſhall examine the principle, on which it ſubſiſted among the ancients. But as this principle was the ſame among all nations, and as a citation from many of their hiſtories would not be leſs tedious than unneceſſary, we ſhall ſelect the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Romans for the conſideration of the caſe.</p>
                  <p>The law, by which priſoners of war were ſaid to be ſentenced to ſervitude, was the<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <hi>law of nations.</hi> It was ſo called from the univerſal concurrence of nations in the cuſtom. It had two points in view, the <hi>perſons</hi> of the <hi>captured,</hi> and their <hi>effects;</hi> both of which it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſentenced, without any of the uſual forms of law, to be the property of the <hi>captors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principle, on which the law was eſtabliſhed, was the <hi>right of capture.</hi> When any of the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had overcome their opponents, and were about to deſtroy them, the right was conſidered to commence; a right, which the victors conceived themſelves to have, to recall their ſwords, and, from the conſideration of having ſaved the lives of the vanquiſhed, when they could have taken them by the laws of war, to commute

                     <hi>blood</hi> for <hi>ſervice.</hi> Hence the Roman lawyer, Pomponius, deduces the etymology of <hi>ſlave</hi> in the Roman language.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>To examine this right, by which the vanquiſhed were ſaid to be ſlaves, we ſhall uſe the words of a celebrated Roman author, and apply them to the preſent caſe.<note n="†" place="bottom">Neque eſt contra naturam ſpoliare eum, ſi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

L 3.6.</note> "If it is lawful," ſays he, <q>to deprive a man of his life, it is certainly not inconſiſtent with nature to rob him;</q> to rob him of his liberty. We admit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to be juſt, if the ſuppoſition be the ſame: we allow, if men have a right to commit that, which is conſidered as a greater crime, that they have a right, at the ſame inſtant, to commit that, which is conſidered as a leſs. But what ſhall we ſay to the <hi>hypotheſis?</hi> We deny it to be true. The voice of nature is againſt it. It is not lawful to kill, but on <hi>neceſſity.</hi> Had there been a neceſſity, where had the wretched captive ſurvived to be broken with chains and ſervitude? The very act of ſaving his life is an argument to prove, that no ſuch neceſſity exiſted. The <hi>concluſion</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:019561_0063_0FABFBE9B4AF7510"/>is therefore falſe. The captors had no right to the <hi>lives;</hi> of the captured, and of courſe none to their <hi>liberty:</hi> they had no right to their <hi>blood,</hi> and of courſe none to their <hi>ſervice.</hi> Their right therefore had no foundation in juſtice. It was founded on a principle, contrary to the law of nature, and of courſe contrary to that law, which people, under different governments, are bound to obſerve to one another.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarce neceſſary to obſerve, as a farther teſtimony of the injuſtice of the meaſure, that the Europeans, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the introduction of Chriſtianity, exploded this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the ancients, as frivolous and falſe; that they ſpared the lives of the vanquiſhed, not from the ſordid motives of <hi>avarice,</hi> but from a conſcientiouſneſs, that homicide could only be juſtified by <hi>neceſſity;</hi> that they introduced an <hi>exchange</hi> of priſoners, and, by many and wiſe regulations, deprived war of many of its former horrours.</p>
                  <p>But the advocates for ſlavery, unable to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt theſe arguments, have fled to other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, and, ignorant of hiſtory, have denied that the <hi>right of capture</hi> was the true principle, on which ſlavery ſubſiſted among the ancients. They reaſon thus "The learned Grotius, and others, have conſidered ſlavery as the juſt conſequence of a private war, (ſuppoſing the war to be juſt and the opponents in a ſtate of nature,) upon the principles of <hi>reparation</hi> and <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Now as the law of nature, which is the rule of conduct to individuals in ſuch a ſituation, is applicable to members of a different community, there is reaſon to preſume, that theſe principles were applied by the ancients to their priſoners of war; that their <hi>effects</hi> were confiſcated by the right of <hi>reparation,</hi> and their <hi>perſons</hi> by the right of <hi>puniſhment."—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuch a preſumption is falſe. The <hi>right of capture</hi> was the only argument, that the ancients adduced in their defence. Hence Polybius; <q>What muſt they, (the Mantinenſes) ſuffer, to receive the puniſhment they deſerve? Perhaps it will be ſaid, <hi>that they muſt be ſold, when they are taken, with their wives and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:019561_0064_0FABFBEA75E83778"/>children into ſlavery:</hi> But this is not to be conſidered as a puniſhment, ſince even thoſe ſuffer it, by the laws of war, who have done nothing that is baſe.</q> The truth is, that both the <hi>offending</hi> and the <hi>offended</hi> parties, whenever they were victorious, inflicted ſlavery alike. But if the <hi>offending</hi> party inflicted ſlavery on the perſons of the vanqiſhed, by what right did they inflict it? It muſt be anſwered from the preſumption before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, "by the right of <hi>reparation,</hi> or of <hi>puniſhment:</hi>" an anſwer plainly abſurd and contradictory, as it ſuppoſes the <hi>aggreſſor</hi> to have a <hi>right,</hi> which the <hi>injured</hi> only could poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the argument leſs fallacious than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, in applying theſe principles, which in a <hi>publick</hi> war could belong to the <hi>publick</hi> only, to the perſons of the <hi>individuals</hi> that were taken. This calls us again to the hiſtory of the ancients, and, as the rights of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and puniſhment could extend to thoſe only, who had been injured, to ſelect a particular inſtance for the conſideration of the caſe.</p>
                  <p>As the Romans had been injured without a previous provocation by the conduct of Hannibal at Saguntum, we may take the treaty into conſideration, which they made with the Carthaginians, when the latter, defeated at Zama, ſued for peace. It conſiſted of three articles.<note n="*" place="bottom">1. Ut lib<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> By the firſt, the Carthaginians were to be free, and to enjoy their own conſtitution and laws. By the ſecond, they were to pay a conſiderable ſum of money, as a reparation for the damages and expence of the war: and, by the third, they were to deliver up their elephants and ſhips of war, and to be ſubject to various reſtrictions, as a puniſhment. With theſe terms they complied, and the war was finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:019561_0065_0FABFBEB6B517E28"/>
Thus then did the Romans make that diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> war, which was neceſſary to be made, and which the argument is fallacious in not ſuppoſing. The <hi>treaſury</hi> of the vanquiſhed was marked as the means of <hi>reparation;</hi> and as this treaſury was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in a great meaſure, by the impoſition of taxes, and was, wholly, the property of the <hi>publick,</hi> ſo the <hi>publick</hi> made the reparation that was due. The <hi>elephants</hi> alſo, and <hi>ſhips of war,</hi> which were marked as the means of <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> were <hi>publick</hi> property; and as they were conſiderable inſtruments of ſecurity and defence to their poſſeſſors, and of annoyance to an enemy, ſo their loſs, added to the reſtrictions of the treaty, operated as a great and <hi>publick</hi> puniſhment. But with reſpect to the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an priſoners, who had been taken in the war, they were retained in <hi>ſervitude:</hi> not upon the principles of <hi>repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> becauſe the Romans had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by their own confeſſion in the treaty, a ſufficient ſatisfaction: not upon theſe principles, becauſe they were inapplicable to <hi>individuals:</hi> the legionary ſoldier in the ſervice of the injured, who took his priſoner, was not the perſon, to whom the <hi>injury had been done,</hi> any more than the ſoldier in the ſervice of the aggreſſors, who was taken, was the perſon, who had <hi>committed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:</hi> but they were retained in ſervitude by the <hi>right of capture;</hi> becauſe, when both parties had ſent their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary into the field to determine the diſpute, it was at the <hi>private</hi> choice of the legionary ſoldier before-mentioned, whether he would ſpare the life of his conquered oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, when he was thought to be entitled to take it, if he had choſen, by the laws of war.</p>
                  <p>To produce more inſtances, as an illuſtration of the ſubject, or to go farther into the argument, would be to treſpaſs upon the patience, as well as underſtanding of the reader. In <hi>a ſtate of nature,</hi> where a man is ſuppoſed to commit an injury, and to be unconnected with the reſt of the world, the act is <hi>private,</hi> and the right, which the injured acquires, can extend only to <hi>himſelf:</hi> but in <hi>a ſtate of ſociety,</hi> where any member or members of a particular community give offence to thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019561_0066_0FABFBEC281FAAE0"/>of another, and they are patronized by the ſtate, to which they belong, the caſe is altered; the act becomes immediately <hi>publick,</hi> and the <hi>publick</hi> alone are to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the conſequences of their injuſtice. For as no particular member of the community, if conſidered as an individual, is guilty, except the perſon, by whom the injury was done, it would be contrary to reaſon and juſtice, to apply the principles of <hi>reparation</hi> and <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which belong to the people as a collective body, to any individual of the community, who ſhould happen to be taken. Now, as the principles of <hi>reparation</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> are thus inapplicable to the priſoners, taken in a <hi>publick</hi> war, and as the <hi>right of capture,</hi> as we have ſhewn before, is inſufficient to intitle the victors to the <hi>ſervice</hi> of the vanquiſhed, it is evident that <hi>ſlavery</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly exiſt at all, ſince there are no other maxims, on which it can be founded, even in the moſt equitable wars.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe things are ſo; if ſlavery cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended even in the moſt <hi>equitable</hi> wars, what arguments will not be found againſt that ſervitude, which ariſes from thoſe, that are <hi>unjuſt?</hi> Which ariſes from thoſe African wars, that relate to the preſent ſubject? The African princes, corrupted by the merchants of Europe, ſeek every opportunity of quarrelling with one another. Every ſpark is blown into a flame; and war is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken from no other conſideration, than that <hi>of procuring ſlaves:</hi> while the Europeans, on the other hand, happy in the quarrels which they have thus excited, ſupply them with arms and ammunition for the accompliſhment of their horrid purpoſe. Thus has Africa, for the ſpace of two hundred years, been the ſcene of the moſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous and bloody wars; and thus have many thouſands of men, in the moſt iniquitous manner, been ſent into ſervitude.</p>

                  <p>As the two orders of men, of thoſe who are privately kidnapped by individuals, and of thoſe who are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſeized by virtue of the authority of their prince, compoſe together, at leaſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">The total annual exportation from Africa, is eſtimated here at 100,000 men, two thirds of whom are exported by the Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants alone. This eſtimate is leſs than that which is uſually made, and has been publiſhed. The author has been informed by diſintereſted people, who were in moſt of the Weſt India iſlands during the late war, and who converſed with many of the moſt intelligent of the negroes, for the purpoſe of inquiring by what methods they had ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally been reduced to ſlavery, that they did not find even two in twenty, who had been reduced to that ſituation, by any other means than thoſe mentioned above. The author, deſirous of a farther confirmation of this circumſtance, ſtopped the preſs till he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to another friend, who had reſided twenty years in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and whoſe opinion he had not yet aſked. The following is an extract from the anſwer. <q>I do not among many hundreds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have ſeen but one or two ſlaves, of thoſe imported from Africa, who had any ſcars to ſhew, that they had been in war. They are generally ſuch as are kidnapped, or ſold by their tyrants, after the deſtruction of a village. In ſhort, I am firmly of opinion, that crimes and war together do not furniſh one ſlave in an hundred of the numbers introduced into the European colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Of conſequence the trade itſelf, were it poſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe convicts or priſoners of war to be juſtly ſentenced to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is accountable for ninety-nine in every hundred ſlaves whom it ſupplies. It is an inſult to the publick, to attempt to palliate the in mod of procuring them.</q>
                     </note> nine tenths of the African ſlaves, they cannot contain, upon a moderate computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſs than ninety thouſand men annually tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: an immenſe number, but eaſily to be credited, when we reflect that thouſands are employed for the purpoſe of ſtealing the unwary, and that theſe diabolical prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices are in force, ſo far has European <hi>injuſtice</hi> been ſpread, at the diſtance of a thouſand miles from the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:019561_0068_0FABFBED8262DED0"/>on the coaſt. The <hi>ſlave merchants,</hi> among whom a quantity of European goods is previouſly divided, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into the heart of the country to this amazing diſtance. Some of them attend the various markets, that are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed through ſo large an extent of territory, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the kidnapped people, whom the <hi>ſlave-hunters</hi> are continually bringing in; while the reſt, ſubdividing their merchandize among the petty ſovereigns with whom they deal, receive, by an immediate exertion of fraud and violence, the ſtipulated number.</p>
                  <p>Now, will any man aſſert, in oppoſition to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before advanced, that out of this immenſe body of men, thus annually collected and tranſported, there is even <hi>one,</hi> over whom the original or ſubſequent ſeller can have any power or right? Whoever aſſerts this, in the firſt inſtance, muſt contradict his own feelings, and muſt conſider <hi>himſelf</hi> as a juſt object of prey, whenever any daring invader ſhall think it proper to attack <hi>him.</hi> And, in the ſecond inſtance, the very idea which the African princes entertain of their villages, as <hi>parks</hi> or <hi>reſervoirs,</hi> ſtocked only for their own convenience, and of their ſubjects, as <hi>wild beaſts,</hi> whom they may purſue and take at pleaſure, is ſo ſhocking, that it need only be mentioned, to be inſtantly reprobated by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>The order of ſlaves, which is next to the former in reſpect to the number of people whom it contains, is that of priſoners of war. This order, if the former ſtatement be true, is more inconſiderable than is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagined; but whoever reflects on the prodigious ſlaughter that is conſtantly made in every African ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, cannot be otherwiſe than of this opinion: he will find, that where <hi>ten</hi> are taken, he has every reaſon to preſume that an <hi>hundred</hi> periſh. In ſome of theſe ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, though they have been begun for the expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>precuring ſlaves,</hi> the conquerors have ſuffered but few of the vanquiſhed to eſcape the fury of the ſword; and there have not been wanting inſtances, where they have been ſo incenſed at the reſiſtance they have found, that their ſpirit of vengeance has entirely got the better
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:019561_0069_0FABFBEE80CAD1E0"/>of their avarice, and they have murdered, in cool blood, every individual, without diſcrimination, either of age or ſex.</p>

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">The writer of the letter of which this is a faithful extract, and who was known to the author of the preſent Eſſay, was a long time on the African coaſt. He had once the misfortune to be ſhipwrecked there, and to be taken by the natives, who conveyed him and his companions a conſiderable way up into the country. The hardſhips which he underwent in the march, his treatment during his captivity, the ſcencs to which he was witneſs, while he retided among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Africans, as well as while in the African trade, gave occaſion to a ſeries of very intereſting letters. Theſe letters were ſent to the author of the preſent Eſſay, with liberty to make what uſe of them he choſe, by the gentleman to whom they were written.</note> The following is an account of one of theſe ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, as deſcribed by a perſon, who was witneſs to the ſcene. <q>I was ſent, with ſeveral others, in a ſmall ſloop up the river Niger, to purchaſe ſlaves: we had ſome free negroes with us in the practice; and as the veſſels are liable to frequent attacks from the negroes on one ſide of the river, or Moors on the other, they are all armed. As we rode at anchor a long way up the river, we obſerved a large number of negroes in huts by the river's ſide, and for our own ſafety kept a wary eye on them. Early next morning we ſaw from our maſt-head a numerous body approaching, with apparently but little order, but in cloſe array. They approached very faſt, and fell furiouſly on the inhabitants of the town, who ſeemed to be quite <hi>ſurprized,</hi> but nevertheleſs, as ſoon as they could get together, fought ſtoutly. They had ſome fire-arms, but made very little uſe of them, as they came directly to cloſe fighting with their ſpears, lances, and ſabres. Many of the invaders were mounted on ſmall horſes; and both parties fought for about half an hour with the fierceſt animoſity, exerting much more courage and perſeverance than I had ever before been witneſs to amongſt them. The women and children of the town cluſtered together to the water's edge, running ſhrieking up and down with terrour, waiting the event
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:019561_0070_0FABFBEEF987A170"/>of the combat, till their party gave way and took to the water, to endeavour to ſwim over to the Barbary ſide. They were cloſely purſued even into the river by the victors, who, though they came for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>getting ſlaves,</hi> gave no quarter, <hi>their cruelty even prevailing over their avarice.</hi> They made no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, but put all to the ſword without mercy. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible indeed was the carnage of the vanquiſhed on this occaſion, and as we were within two or three hundred yards of them, their cries and ſhrieks affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us extremely. We had got up our anchor at the beginning of the fray, and now ſtood cloſe in to the ſpot, where the victors having followed the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the water, were continually dragging out and murdering thoſe, whom by reaſon of their wounds they eaſily overtook. The very children, whom they took in great numbers, did not eſcape the maffacre. Enraged at their barbarity, we fired our guns loaden with grape-ſhot, and a volley of ſmall arms among them, which effectually checked their ardour, and obliged them to retire to a diſtance from the ſhore; from whence a few round cannon ſhot ſoon removed them into the woods. The whole river was black over with the heads of the fugitives, who were ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for their lives. Theſe poor wretches, fearing <hi>us</hi> as much as their conquerors, dived when we fired, and cried moſt lamentably for mercy. Having now effectually favoured their retreat, we ſtood back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, and took up ſeveral that were wounded and tired. All whoſe wounds had diſabled them from ſwimming, were either butchered or drowned, before we got up to them. With a juſtice and generoſity, <hi>never I believe before heard of among ſlavers,</hi> we gave thoſe their liberty whom we had taken up, ſetting them on ſhore on the Barbary ſide, among the poor reſidue of their companions, who had ſurvived the ſlaughter of the morning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall make but two remarks on this horrid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of African cruelty. It adds, firſt, a conſiderable weight to the ſtatements that have been made; and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:019561_0071_0FABFBEFB9157AC8"/>confirms, ſecondly, the concluſions that were drawn in the preceding chapter. For if we even allow the right of capture to be juſt and the principles of reparation and puniſhment to be applicable to the individuals of a community, yet would the former be unjuſt, and the latter inapplicable, in the preſent caſe. Every African war is a robbery; and we may add, to our former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, when we ſaid, <q>that thus have many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men, in the moſt iniquitous manner, been ſent into ſervitude,</q> that we believe there are few of this order, who are not as much the examples of injuſtice, as the people that have been kidnapped; and who do not additionally convey, when we conſider them as priſoners of war, an idea of the moſt complicated ſcene of murder.</p>
                  <p>The order of <hi>convicts,</hi> as it exiſts almoſt ſolely among thoſe princes, whoſe dominions are contugious to the European factories, is from this circumſtance ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, when compared with either of the preceding, that we ſhould not have mentioned it again, but that we were unwilling to omit any additional argument that occurred againſt it.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſhewn already, that the puniſhment of ſlavery is inflicted from no other motive, than that of gratifying the <hi>avarice</hi> of the prince, a conſideration ſo deteſtable, as to be ſufficient of itſelf to prove it to be unjuſt; and that it is ſo diſproportionate, from its <hi>nature,</hi> to the offence, as to afford an additional proof of its injuſtice. We ſhall add now, as a ſecond argument, its diſproportion from its <hi>continuance:</hi> and we ſhall derive a third from the conſideration, that, in civil ſociety, every violation of the laws of the community is an offence againſt the <hi>ſtatc.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Were this not the caſe, the government of a country could have no right to take cognizance of crimes, and puniſh them, but every individual, if injured, would have a right to puniſh the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor with his own hand, which is contrary to the notions of all civilized men, whether among the ancients or the moderns.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe then an African prince, diſdaining for once the idea of emolument: let us ſuppoſe him for once
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:019561_0072_0FABFBFAC93116A0"/>inflamed with the love of his country, and reſolving to puniſh from this principle alone, <q>that by exhibiting an example of terrour, he may preſerve that <hi>happineſs of the publick,</hi> which he is bound to ſecure and defend by the very nature of his contract; or, in other words, that he may anſwer the end of government.</q> If ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated then by this principle, he ſhould adjudge ſlavery to an offender, as a juſt puniſhment for his offence, for whoſe benefit muſt the convict labour? If it be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "for the benefit of the ſtate," we allow that the puniſhment, in whatever light it is conſidered, will be found to be equitable: but if it be anſwered, <q>for the benefit of any <hi>individual whom he pleaſes to appoint,</hi>
                     </q> we deny it to be juſt. The<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſame notion is entertained even by the African princes, who do not permit the perſon injured to revenge his injury, or to receive the convict as his ſlave. But if the very perſon who has been <hi>injured,</hi> does not poſſeſs him, much leſs ought any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever.</note> ſtate alone is conſidered to have been injured, and as <hi>injuries cannot poſſibly be transferred,</hi> the ſtate alone can juſtly receive the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of his labour. But if the African prince, when he thus condemns him to labour for the benefit of an <hi>unoffended individual,</hi> ſhould at the ſame time ſentence him to become his <hi>property;</hi> that is, if he ſhould make the perſon and life of the convict at the abſolute diſpoſal of him, for whom he has ſentenced him to labour; it is evident that, in addition to his former injuſtice, he is uſurping a power, which no ruler or rulers of a ſtate can poſſeſs, and which the great Creator of the univerſe never yet gave to any order whatever of created beings.</p>
                  <p>That this reaſoning is true, and that civilized nations have conſidered it as ſuch, will be beſt teſtified by their practice. We may appeal here to that <hi>ſlavery,</hi> which is now adjudged to delinquents, as a puniſhment, among many of the ſtates of Europe. Theſe delinquents are ſentenced to labour at the <hi>oar,</hi> to work in <hi>mines,</hi> and on <hi>fortifications,</hi> to cut and clear <hi>rivers,</hi> to make and repair <hi>roads,</hi> and to perform other works of national utility. They are employed, in ſhort, in the <hi>publick</hi> work; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019561_0073_0FABFBFAF99F7AE8"/>as the crimes they have committed are conſidered to have been crimes againſt the publick, no individual can juſtly receive the emoluments of their labour; and they are neither <hi>ſold,</hi> nor made capable of being <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,</hi> becauſe no government whatſoever is inveſted with ſuch a power.</p>
                  <p>Thus then m<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     </gap>, be perfectly equitable, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent will always receive his puniſhment as a <hi>man;</hi> whereas in that, which additionally includes the idea of <hi>property,</hi> and to undergo which, the delinquent muſt previouſly change his nature, and become a <hi>brute,</hi> there is an inconſiſtency, which no arguments can reconcile, and a contradiction to every principle of nature, which a man need only to appeal to his own feelings immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to evince. And we will venture to aſſert, from the united obſervations that have been made upon the ſubject, in oppoſition to any arguments that may be advanced, that there is ſcarcely one of thoſe, who are called African convicts, on whom the prince has a right to inflict a puniſhment at all; and that there is no one whatever, whom he has a power of ſentencing to labour for the benefit of an unoffended individual, and much leſs whom he has a right to ſell.</p>

                  <p>It remains only now to examine by what arguments thoſe, who <hi>receive</hi> or <hi>purchaſe</hi> their fellow-creatures into ſlavery, defend the <hi>commerce.</hi> Their firſt plea is, <q>that they receive thoſe with propriety, who are convicted of crimes, becauſe they are delivered into their hands by <hi>their own magiſtrates.</hi>
                     </q> But what is this to you <hi>receivers?</hi> Have the unfortunate <hi>convicts</hi> been guilty of injury to <hi>you?</hi> Have they broken <hi>your</hi> treaties? Have they plundered <hi>your</hi> ſhips? Have they carried <hi>your</hi> wives and children into ſlavery, that <hi>you</hi> ſhould thus retaliate? Have they offended <hi>you</hi> even by word or geſture?</p>
                  <p>But if the African convicts are innocent with reſpect to you; if you have not even the ſhadow of a claim upon their perſons; by what right do you receive them? "By the laws of the Africans." you will ſay; <q>by which it is poſitively allowed.</q> — But can <hi>laws</hi> alter the nature of vice? They may give it a ſanction perhaps: it will ſtill be immutably the ſame, and, though dreſſed in the outward habiliments of <hi>honour,</hi> will ſtill be <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically baſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alas! you do not only attempt to defend your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by theſe arguments, but even dare to give your actions the appearance of lenity, and aſſume <hi>merit</hi> from your <hi>baſeneſs!</hi> and how firſt ought you particularly to bluſh, when you aſſert, <q>that priſoners of war are only purchaſed from the hands of their conquerors, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from death.</hi>
                     </q> Ridiculous defence! can the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:019561_0075_0FABFBFCDAD556C8"/>moſt credulous believe it? You entice the Africans to war; you foment their quarrels; you ſupply them with arms and ammunition, and all—from the <hi>motives of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</hi> Does a man ſet fire to an houſe, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of reſcuing the inhabitants from the flames? But if they are only purchaſed, to <hi>deliver them from death;</hi> why, when they are delivered into your hands, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, do you torture them with hunger? Why do you kill them with fatigue? Why does the whip deform their bodies, or the knife their limbs? Why do you ſentence them to death? to a death, infinitely more excruciating than that from which you ſo kindly ſaved them? What anſwer do you make to this? for if you had not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely preſerved them from the hands of their conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, a quick death perhaps, and that in the ſpace of a moment, had freed them from their pain: but on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>benevolence,</hi> it is known, that they have lingered years in pain and agony, and have been ſentenced, at laſt, to a dreadful death for the moſt inſignificant offence.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we allow the other argument to be true, on which you found your merit; <q>that you take them from their country for their own convenience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Africa, ſcorched with inceſſant heat, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the moſt violent rains and tempeſts, is unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and unfit to be inhabited.</q> Prepoſterous men! do you thus judge from your own feelings? Do you thus judge from your own conſtitution and frame? But if you ſuppoſe that the Africans are incapable of enduring their own climate, becauſe you cannot endure it yourſelves; why do you receive them into ſlavery? Why do you not meaſure them here by the ſame ſtandard? For if you are unable to bear hunger and thirſt, chains and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, wounds and torture, why do you not ſuppoſe them incapable of enduring the ſame treatment? Thus then is your argument turned againſt yourſelves. But conſider the anſwer which the Scythians gave the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when they contended about the antiquity of their original,<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtin, L. 2. C. 1.</note> 
                     <q>That nature, when ſhe firſt diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:019561_0076_0FABFBFD6201B428"/>countries by different degrees of heat and cold, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the bodies of animals, at the ſame inſtant, to endure the different ſituations: that as the climate of Scythia was ſeverer than that of Aegypt, ſo were the bodies of the Scythians harder, and as capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the ſeverity of their atmoſphere, as the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians the temperateneſs of their own</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you may ſay perhaps, that, though they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enduring their own climate, yet their ſituation is frequently uncomfortable, and even wretched: that Africa is infeſted with locuſts, and inſects of various kinds; that they ſettle in ſwarms upon the trees, deſtroy the verdure, conſume the fruit, and deprive the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of their food. But the ſame anſwer may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as before; "that the ſame kind Providence, who tempered the body of the animal, tempered alſo the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the tree; that he gave it a quality to recover the bite of the locuſt, which he ſent; and to reaſſume, in a ſhort interval of time, its former glory." And that ſuch is the caſe experience has ſhewn: for the very trees that have been infeſted, and ſtripped of their bloom and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, ſo ſurprizingly quick is vegetation, appear in a few days, as if an inſect had been utterly unknown.</p>
                  <p>We may add to theſe obſervations, from the teſtimony of thoſe who have written the Hiſtory of Africa from their own inſpection, that no country is more luxurious in proſpects, none more fruitful, none more rich in herds and flocks, and none, where the comforts of life can be gained with ſo little trouble.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay again, as a confirmation of theſe your former arguments, (by which you would have it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Africans themſelves are ſenſible of the goodneſs of your intentions) <q>that they do not appear to go with you againſt their will.</q> Impudent and baſe aſſertion! Why then do you load them with chains? Why keep you your daily and nightly watches? But alas, as a farther, though a more melancholy proof, of the falſehood of your aſſertions, how many, when on board your ſhips, have put a period to their exiſtence? How many have leaped into the ſea? How many have
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:019561_0077_0FABFC04A91A8988"/>pined to death, that, even at the expence of their lives, they might fly from your <hi>benevolence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you call them obſtinate then, becauſe they refuſe your favours? Do you call them ungrateful, becauſe they make you this return? How much rather ought you receivers to bluſh! How much rather ought you receivers to be conſidered as abandoned and execrable; who, when you uſurp the dominion over thoſe, who are as free and independent as yourſelves, break the firſt law of juſtice, which ordains, <q>that no perſon ſhall do harm to another, without a previous provocation;</q> who offend againſt the dictates of nature, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <q>that no juſt man ſhall be given or received into ſlavery againſt his own conſent;</q> and who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the very laws of the empire that you aſſume, by conſigning your ſubjects to miſery.</p>
                  <p>Now, as a famous Heathen philoſopher obſerves, from whoſe mouth you ſhall be convicted,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cicero de Officiis. L. 1. C. 8.</note> 
                     <q>there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difference, whether an injury is done, during any perturbation of mind, which is generally ſhort and momentary; or whether it is done with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious meditation and deſign; for, thoſe crimes, which proceed from any ſudden commotion of the mind, are leſs than thoſe, which are ſtudied and prepared,</q> how great and enormous are your crimes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, who plan your African voyages at a time, when your reaſon is ſound, and your ſenſes are awake; who coolly and deliberately equip your veſſels; and who ſpend years, and even lives, in the traffick of <hi>human liberty.</hi>

               <head>PART III. THE SLAVERY OF THE AFRICANS IN THE EUROPEAN COLONIES.</head>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>HAVING confined ourſelves wholly, in the ſecond part of this Eſſay, to the conſideration of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> we ſhall now proceed to the conſideration of the <hi>ſlavery</hi> that is founded upon it. As this ſlavery will be conſpicuous in the <hi>treatment,</hi> which the unfortunate Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans uniformly undergo, when they are put in the hands of the <hi>receivers,</hi> we ſhall deſcribe the manner in which they are accuſtomed to be uſed from this period.</p>
                  <p>To place this in the cleareſt, and moſt conſpicuous point of view, we ſhall throw a conſiderable part of our information on this head into the form of a narrative: we ſhall ſuppoſe ourſelves, in ſhort, on the continent of Africa, and relate a ſcene, which, from its agreement with unqueſtionable facts, might not unreaſonably be preſumed to have been preſented to our view, had we been really there.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, let us turn our eyes to the cloud of duſt that is before us. It ſeems to advance rapidly, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with diſmal ſhrieks and yellings, to make the very air, that is above it, tremble as it rolls along. What can poſſibly be the cauſe? Let us inquire of that
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:019561_0079_0FABFC056F5A6BD8"/>melancholy African, who ſeems to walk dejected near the ſhore; whoſe eyes are ſtedfaſtly fixed on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching object, and whoſe heart, if we can judge from the appearance of his countenance, muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated.</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" ſays the unhappy African, <q>the cloud that that you ſee approaching, is a train of wretched ſlaves. They are going to the ſhips behind you. They are deſtined for the Engliſh colonies, and, if you will ſtay here but for a little time, you will ſee them paſs. They were laſt night drawn up upon the plain which you ſee before you, where they were branded upon the breaſt with an <hi>hot iron;</hi> and when they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the whole of the treatment which is cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary on theſe occaſions, and which I am informed that you Engliſhmen at home uſe to the <hi>cattle</hi> which you buy, they were returned to their priſon. As I have ſome dealings with the members of the factory which you ſee at a little diſtance, (though thanks to the Great Spirit, I never dealt in the <hi>liberty</hi> of my fellow creatures) I gained admittance there. I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hiſtory of ſome of the unfortunate people, whom I ſaw confined, and will explain to you, if my eye ſhould catch them as they paſs, the real cauſes of their ſervitude.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Scarcely were theſe words ſpoken, when they came diſtinctly into ſight. They appeared to advance in a long column, but in a very irregular manner. There were three only in the front, and theſe were chained together. The reſt that followed ſeemed to be chained by pairs, but by preſſing forward, to avoid the laſh of the drivers, the breadth of the column began to be greatly extended, and ten or more were obſerved abreaſt.</p>
                  <p>While we were making thoſe remarks, the intelligent African thus reſumed his diſcourſe. <q>The firſt three whom you obſerve, at the head of the train, to be chained together, are priſoners of war. As ſoon as the ſhips that are behind you arrived, the news was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched into the inland country; when one of the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:019561_0080_0FABFC07E2158E30"/>petty kings immediately aſſembled his ſubjects, and attacked a neighbouring tribe. The wretched people, though they were ſurprized, made a formidable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, as they reſolved, almoſt all of them, rather to loſe their lives, than ſurvive their liberty. The perſon whom you ſee in the middle, is the father of the two young men, who are chained to him on each ſide. His wife and two of his children were killed in the attack, and his father being wounded, and, on account of his age, <hi>incapable of ſervitude,</hi> was left bleeding on the ſpot where this tranſaction happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>With reſpect to thoſe who are now paſſing us, and are immediately behind the former, I can give you no other intelligence, than that ſome of them, to about the number of thirty, were taken in the ſame ſkirmiſh. Their tribe was ſaid to have been numerous before the attack; theſe however are <hi>all that are left alive.</hi> But with reſpect to the unhappy man, who is now oppoſite to us, and whom you may diſtinguiſh, as he is now looking back and wringing his hands in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, I can inform you with more preciſion. He is an unfortunate convict. He lived only about five days journey from the factory. He went out with his king to hunt, and was one of his train; but, through too great an anxiety to afford his royal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter diverſion, he rouſed the game from the covert rather ſooner than was expected. The king, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated at this circumſtance, ſentenced him to ſlavery. His wife and children, fearing leſt the tyrant ſhould extend the puniſhment to themſelves, <hi>which is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual,</hi> ſled directly to the woods, where they were all devoured.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The people, whom you ſee cloſe behind the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy convict, form a numerous body, and reach a conſiderable way. They ſpeak a language, which no perſon in this part of Africa can underſtand, and their features, as you perceive, are ſo different from thoſe of the reſt, that they almoſt appear a diſtinct race of men. From this circumſtance I recollect them. They
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:019561_0081_0FABFC098AECF770"/>are the ſubjects of a very diſtant prince, who agreed with the <hi>ſlave merchants, for a quantity of ſpirituous liquors,</hi> to furniſh him with a ſtipulated number of ſlaves. He accordingly ſurrounded, and ſet fire to one of his own villages in the night, and ſeized theſe people, who were unfortunately the inhabitants, as they were eſcaping from the flames. I firſt ſaw them as the merchants were driving them in, about two days ago. They came in a large body, and were tied together at the neck with leather thongs, which permitted them to walk at the diſtance of about a yard from one another. Many of them were loaden with elephants teeth, which had been purchaſed at the ſame time. All of them had bags, made of ſkin, upon their ſhoulders; for as they were to travel, in their way from the great mountains, through barren ſands and inhoſpitable woods for many days together, they were obliged to carry water and proviſions with them. Notwithſtanding this, many of them periſhed, ſome by hunger, but the greateſt number by fatigue, as the place from whence they came, is at ſuch an amazing diſtance from this, and the obſtacles, from the nature of the country, ſo great, that the journey could ſcarcely be completed in ſeven moons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this relation was finiſhed, and we had been looking ſtedfaſtly for ſome time on the croud that was going by, we loſt fight of that peculiarity of feature, which we had before remarked. We then diſcovered that the inhabitants of the depopulated village had all of them paſſed us, and that the part of the train, to which we were now oppoſite, was a numerous body of kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napped people. Here we indulged our imagination. We thought we beheld in one of them a father, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an huſband, and in another a ſon, each of whom was forced from his various and tender connections, and without even the opportunity of bidding them adieu. While we were engaged in theſe and other melancholy reflections, the whole body of ſlaves had entirely paſſed us. We turned almoſt inſenſibly to look at them again, when we diſcovered an unhappy man at the end of the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:019561_0082_0FABFC09F453ACF8"/>train, who could ſcarcely keep pace with the reſt. His feet ſeemed to have ſuffered much from long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant travelling, for he was limping painfully along.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This man, reſumes the African, has travelled a conſiderable way. He lived at a great diſtance from hence, and had a large family, for whom he was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide. As he went out one night to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſpring, to procure water for his thirſty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he was kidnapped by two <hi>ſlave hunters,</hi> who ſold him in the morning to ſome country merchants for a <hi>bar of iron.</hi> Theſe drove him with other ſlaves, procured almoſt in the ſame manner, to the neareſt market, where the Engliſh merchants, to whom the train that has juſt now paſſed us belongs, purchaſed him and two others, by means of their travelling agents, for a <hi>piſtol.</hi> His wife and children have been long waiting for his return. But he is gone for ever from their ſight: and they muſt be now diſconſolate, as they muſt be certain by his delay, that he has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And now, as I have mentioned the name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> a name, by which the Europeans diſtinguiſh themſelves from us, I could wiſh to be informed of the meaning which ſuch an appellation may convey. They conſider themſelves as <hi>men,</hi> but us unfortunate Africans, whom they term <hi>Heathens,</hi> as the <hi>beaſts</hi> that ſerve us. But ah! how different is the fact! What is <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but a ſyſtem of <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion?</hi> The cries and yells of the unfortunate people, who are now ſoon to embark for the regions of ſervitude, have already pierced my heart. Have you not heard me ſigh, while we have been talking? Do you not ſee the tears that now trickle down my cheeks? and yet theſe hardened <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are unable to be moved at all: nay, they will ſcourge them amidſt their groans, and even ſmile, while they are torturing them to death. Happy, happy Heatheniſm? which can deteſt the vices of Chriſtianity, and feel for the diſtreſſes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="unknown:019561_0083_0FABFC0AF0B646A0"/>
"But" we reply, <q>You are totally miſtaken: <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi> is the moſt perfect and lovely of moral ſyſtems. It bleſſes even the hand of perſecution itſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns good for evil. But the people againſt whom you ſo juſtly declaim, are not <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They are <hi>infidels.</hi> They are <hi>monſters.</hi> They are out of the common courſe of nature. Their countrymen at home are generous and brave. They ſupport the ſick, the lame, and the blind. They ſly to the ſuccour of the diſtreſſed. They have noble and ſtately buildings for the ſole purpoſe of benevolence. They are in ſhort, of all nations, the moſt remarkable for humanity and juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"But why then," replies the honeſt African, <q>do they ſuffer this? Why is Africa a ſcene of blood and deſolation? Why are her children wreſted from her, to adminiſter to the luxuries and greatneſs of thoſe whom they never offended? And why are theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cries in vain?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Alas!" we reply again, <q>can the cries and groans, with which the air now trembles, be heard acroſs this extenſive continent? Can the ſouthern winds convey them to the ear of Britain? If they could reach the generous Engliſhman at home, they would pierce his heart, as they have already pierced your own. He would ſympathize with you in your diſtreſs. He would be enraged at the conduct of his countrymen, and reſiſt their tyranny.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here a ſhriek unuſually loud, accompanied with a dreadful rattling of chains, interrupted the diſcourſe. The wretched Africans were juſt about to embark: they had turned their face to their country, as if to take a laſt adieu, and, with arms uplifted to the ſky, were making the very atmoſphere reſound with their prayers and imprecations.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>The foregoing ſcene, though it may be ſaid to be imaginary, is ſtrictly conſiſtent with fact. It is a ſcene, to which the reader himſelf may have been witneſs, if he has ever viſited the place, where it is ſuppoſed to lie; as no circumſtance whatever has been inſerted in it, for which the fulleſt and moſt undeniable evidence cannot be produced. We ſhall proceed now to deſcribe, in general terms, the treatment which the wretched Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans undergo, from the time of their embarkation.</p>
                  <p>When the African ſlaves, who are collected from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious quarters, for the purpoſes of ſale, are delivered over to the <hi>receivers,</hi> they are conducted in the manner above deſcibed to the ſhips. Their ſituation on board is beyond all deſcription: for here they are crouded, hundreds of them together, into ſuch a ſmall compaſs, as would ſcarcely be thought ſufficient to accommodate twenty, if conſidered as <hi>free men.</hi> This confinement ſoon produces an effect, that may be eaſily imagined. It generates a peſtilential air, which, co-operating with bad proviſions, occaſions ſuch a ſickneſs and mortality among them, that not leſs than<note n="*" place="bottom">It is univerſally allowed, that at leaſt one fifth of the exported negroes periſh in the paſſage. This eſtimate is made from the time in which they are put an board, to the time when they are diſpoſed of in the colonies. The French are ſuppoſed to loſe the greateſt number in the voyage, but particularly from this circumſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſlave ſhips are in general ſo very large, that many of the ſlaves that have been put on board ſickly, die before the cargo can be completed.</note>
                     <hi>twenty thouſand</hi> are generally taken off in every yearly tranſportation.</p>
                  <p>Thus confined in a peſtilential priſon, and almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely excluded from the chearful face of day, it remains for the ſickly ſurvivors to linger out a miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, till the vovage is finiſhed. But are no farther evils to be expected in the interim, particularly if we add to their already wretched ſituation, the indignities
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:019561_0085_0FABFC0C64280AE0"/>that are daily offered them, and the regret which they muſt conſtantly feel, at being for ever forced from their connexions? Theſe evils are but too apparent. Some of them have reſolved, and, notwithſtanding the threats of the <hi>receivers,</hi> have carried their reſolves into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſtarve themſelves to death. Others, when they have been brought upon deck for air, if the leaſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity has offered, have leaped into the ſea, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated their miſeries at once. Others, in a fit of deſpair, have attempted to riſe, and regain their liberty. But here what a ſcene of barbarity has conſtantly enſued.— Some of them have been inſtantly killed upon the ſpot; ſome have been taken from the hold, have been bruiſed and mutilated in the moſt barbarous and ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and have been returned bleeding to their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as a ſad example of reſiſtance; while others, tied to the ropes of the ſhip, and mangled alternately with the whip and knife, have been left in that horrid ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till they have expired.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the only inhuman treatment which they are frequently obliged to undergo; for if their ſhould be any neceſſity, from tempeſtuous weather, for lightening the ſhip; or if it ſhould be preſumed on the voyage, that the proviſions will fall ſhort before the port can be made, they are, many of them, thrown into the ſea, without any compunction of mind on the part of the <hi>receivers,</hi> and without any other regret for their loſs, than that which <hi>avarice</hi> inſpires. Wretched ſurvivors! what muſt be their feelings at ſuch a ſight! how muſt they tremble to think of that ſervitude which is approaching, when the very <hi>dogs</hi> of the <hi>receivers</hi> have been retained on board, and preferred to their unoffending countrymen. But indeed ſo lightly are theſe unhappy people eſteemed, that their lives have been even taken away upon ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: there has been an inſtance,<note n="*" place="bottom">This inſtance happened in a ſhip, commanded by one Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. On the 29th of November, 1781, fifty-four of them were thrown into the ſea alive; on the 30th forty-two more; and in about three days afterwards, twenty-ſix. Ten others, who were brought upon the deck for the ſame purpoſe, did not wait to be hand-cuffed, but bravely leaped into the ſea, and ſhared the ſate of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. It is a fact, that the people on board this ſhip had not been put upon ſhort allowance. The excuſe which this execrable wretch made on board for his conduct, was the following, <q>
                           <hi>that if the ſlives, who were then ſickly, had died a natural death, the loſs would have been the owners; but as they were thrown alive into the ſea it would fall upon the underwriters</hi>
                        </q>
                     </note> within the laſt five
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:019561_0086_0FABFC0D0E1CDE88"/>years, of <hi>one hundred and thirty-two</hi> of them being thrown into the ſea, becauſe it was ſuppoſed that, by this <hi>trick,</hi> their value could be recovered from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſhip ſhould arrive ſafe at its deſtined port, a circumſtance which does not always happen, (for ſome have been blown up, and many loſt) the wretched Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans do not find an alleviation of their ſorrow. Here they are again expoſed to ſale. Here they are again ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the inſpection of other brutal <hi>receivers,</hi> who examine and treat them with an inhumanity, at which even avarice ſhould bluſh. To this mortifying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is added another, that they are picked out, as the purchaſer pleaſes, with out any conſideration whether the wife is ſeparated from her huſband, or the mother from her ſon: and if theſe cruel inſtances of ſeparation ſhould happen; if relations, when they find themſelves about to be parted, ſhould cling together; or if filial, conjugal, or parental affection, ſhould detain them but a moment longer in each other's arms, than theſe <hi>ſecond receivers</hi> ſhould think ſufficient, the laſh inſtantly ſevers them from their embrances.</p>
                  <p>We cannot cloſe our account of the treatment, which the wretched Africans undergo while in the hands of the <hi>firſt receivers,</hi> without mentioning an inſtance of wanton barbarity, which happened ſome time ago; particularly as it may be inſerted with propriety in the preſent place, and may give the reader a better idea of the cruelties, to which they are continually expoſed, than any that he may have yet conceived. To avoid making a miſtake, we ſhall take the liberty that has been allowed us, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:019561_0087_0FABFC0DC245DD08"/>tranſcribe it from a little manuſcript account, with which we have been favoured by a<note n="*" place="bottom">This gentleman is at preſent reſident in England. The author of this Eſſay, applied to him for ſome information on the treatment of ſlaves, ſo far as his own knowledge was concerned. He was ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging as to furniſh him with the written account alluded to, interſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with ſuch inſtances, as he himſelf could undertake to anſwer for. The author, as he has never met with theſe inſtances before, and as they are of ſuch high authority, intends to tranſcribe two or three of them, and inſert them in the fourth chapter. They will be ſound in inverted commas.</note> perſon of the ſtricteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and who was at that time in the place where the tranſaction happened. "Not long after," ſays he, (continuing his account) <q>the perpetrator of a cruel murder, committed in open day light, in the moſt publick part of a town, which was the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſcaped every other notice than the curſes of a few of the more humane witneſſes of his barbarity. An officer of a Guinea ſhip, who had the care of a number of new ſlaves, and was returning from the <hi>ſale-yard</hi> to the veſſel with ſuch as remained unſold, obſerved a ſtout fellow among them rather ſlow in his motions, which he therefore quickened with his rattan. The ſlave ſoon afterwards fell down, and was raiſed by the ſame application. Moving forwards a few yards, he fell down again; and this being taken as a proof of his ſullen perverſe ſpirit, the enraged officer furiouſly repeated his blows till he expired at his feet. The brute coolly ordered ſome of the ſurviving ſlaves to carry the dead body to the water's ſide, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremony or delay, being thrown into the ſea, the tragedy was ſuppoſed to have been immediately finiſhed by the not more inhuman ſharks, with which the harbour then abounded. Theſe voracious fiſh were ſuppoſed to have followed the veſſels from the coaſt of Africa, in which ten thouſand ſlaves were imported in that one ſeaſon, being allured by the ſtench, and daily fed by the dead carcaſſes thrown overboard on the voyage.</q>

If the reader ſhould obſerve here, that cattle are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter protected in this country, than ſlaves in the colonies, his obſervation will be juſt. The beaſt which is driven to market, is defended by law from the goad of the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; whereas the wretched African, though an human being, and whoſe feelings receive of courſe a double poignancy from the power of reflection, is unnoticed in this reſpect in the colonial code, and may be goaded and and beaten till he expires.</p>
                  <p>We may now take our leave of the <hi>firſt receivers.</hi> Their crime has been already eſtimated; and to reaſon farther upon it, would be unneceſſary. For where the conduct of men is ſo manifeſtly impious, there can be no need, either of a ſingle argument or a reflection; as every reader of ſenſibility will anticipate them in his own feelings.</p>

                  <p>When the wretched Africans are thus put into the hands of the <hi>ſecond receivers,</hi> they are conveyed to the plantations, where they are totally conſidered as <hi>cattle,</hi> or <hi>beaſts of labour;</hi> their very children, if any ſhould be born to them in that ſituation, being previouſly deſtined to the condition of their parents. But here a queſtion ariſes, which will interrupt the thread of the narration for a little time, viz. how far their deſcendants, who compoſe the fifth order of ſlaves, are juſtly reduced to ſervitude, and upon what principles the <hi>receivers</hi> defend their conduct.</p>
                  <p>Authors have been at great pains to inquire, why, in the ancient ſervitude, the child has uniformly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the condition of the mother. But we conceive that they would have ſaved themſelves much trouble and have done themſelves more credit, if inſtead of endeavouring to reconcile the cuſtom with <hi>heathen</hi> notions, or their own laboured conjectures, they had ſhewn its inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency with reaſon and nature, and its repugnancy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juſtice. Suffice it to ſay, that the whole theory of the ancients, with reſpect to the deſcendants of ſlaves,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:019561_0089_0FABFC0F4D234800"/>may be reduced to this principle, <q>that as the parents, by becoming <hi>property,</hi> were wholly conſidered as <hi>cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> their children, like <hi>the progeny of cattle,</hi> inherited their parental lot.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such alſo is the excuſe of the tyrannical <hi>receivers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned. They allege, that they have purchaſed the parents, that they can fell and diſpoſe of them as they pleaſe, that they poſſeſs them under the ſame laws and limitations as their cattle, and that their children, like the progeny of theſe, become their property <hi>by birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the abſurdity of the argument will immediately appear. It depends wholly on the ſuppoſition, that the parents are <hi>brutes.</hi> If they are <hi>brutes,</hi> we ſhall inſtantly ceaſe to contend: if they are <hi>men,</hi> which we think it not difficult to prove, the argument muſt immediately fall, as we have already ſhewn that there cannot juſtly be any <hi>property</hi> whatever in the <hi>human ſpecies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has appeared alſo, in the ſecond part of this Eſſay, that as nature made every man's body and mind <hi>his own,</hi> ſo no <hi>juſt</hi> perſon can be reduced to ſlavery againſt his own <hi>conſent.</hi> Do the unfortunate offspring ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to be ſlaves?—They are ſlaves from their birth.— Are they <hi>guilty</hi> of crimes, that they loſe their freedom? —They are ſlaves when they cannot ſpeak.—Are their <hi>parents</hi> abandoned? The crimes of the parents cannot juſtly extend to the children.</p>
                  <p>Thus then muſt the tyrannical <hi>receivers,</hi> who preſume to ſentence the children of ſlaves to ſervitude, if they mean to diſpute upon the juſtice of their cauſe; either allow them to have been <hi>brutes</hi> from their birth, or to have been guilty of crimes at a time, when they were incapable of offending the very <hi>King of Kings.</hi>

                  <p>But to return to the narration. When the wretched Africans are conveyed to the plantations, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>beaſts of labour,</hi> and are put to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:019561_0090_0FABFC10083574A8"/>work. Having led, in their own country, a life of indolence and eaſe, where the earth brings forth ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly the comforts of life, and ſpares frequently the toil and trouble of cultivation, they can hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to endure the drudgeries of ſervitude. Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are accordingly made upon their lives. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that if three in four ſurvive what is called the <hi>ſeaſoning,</hi> the bargain is highly favourable. This ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſaid to expire, when the two firſt years of their ſervitude are completed: It is the time which an African muſt take to be ſo accuſtomed to the colony, as to be able to endure the common labour of a plantation, and to be put into the <hi>gang.</hi> At the end of this period the calculations become verified,<note n="*" place="bottom">One third of the whole number imported, is often computed to be loſt in the ſeaſoning, which, in round numbers, will be 27000. The loſs in the ſeaſoning depends, in a great meaſure, on two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, viz. on the number of what are called refuſe ſlaves that are imported, and on the quantity of new lands in the colony. In the French windward iſlands of Martinico, and Guadaloupe, which are cleared and highly cultivated, and in our old ſmall iſlands, one fourth, including refuſe ſlaves, is conſidered as a general proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in St. Domingo where there is a great deal of new land annually taken into culture, and in other colonics in the ſame ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the general proportion, including refuſe ſlaves, is found to be one third. This therefore is a lower eſtimate than the former, and reduces the number to about 23000. We may obſerve, that this is the common eſtimate, but we have reduced it to 20000 to make it free from all objection.</note>
                     <hi>twenty thouſand</hi> of thoſe, who are annually imported, dying before the ſeaſoning is over. This is ſurely an horrid and awful conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and thus does it appear, (and let it be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is the loweſt calculation that has been ever made upon the ſubject) that out of every annual ſupply that is ſhipped from the coaſt of Africa,<note n="†" place="bottom">Including the number that periſh on the voyage, and in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. It is generally thought that not half the number purchaſed can be conſidered as an additional ſtock, and of courſe that 50,000 are conſumed within the firſt two years from their embarkation.</note>
                     <hi>forty thouſand lives</hi> are regularly expended, even before it can be ſaid, that there is really any additional ſtock for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</p>

                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:019561_0091_0FABFC10B05F3978"/>
When the ſeaſoning is over, and the ſurvivors are thus enabled to endure the uſual taſk of ſlaves, they are conſidered as real and ſubſtantial ſupplies.<note n="*" place="bottom">That part of the account, that has been hitherto given, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all the Europeans and their coloniſts, who are concerned in this horrid practice. But we are ſorry that we muſt now make a diſtinction, and conſine the remaining part of it to the coloniſts of the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands, and to thoſe of the ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of North America. As the employment of ſlaves is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the two parts of the world laſt mentioned, we ſhall content ourſelves with deſeribing it, as it exiſts in one of them, and we ſhall afterwards annex ſuch treatment and ſuch conſequences as are applicable to both. We have only to add, that the reader muſt not conſider our accounts as <hi>univerſally,</hi> but only <hi>generally,</hi> true.</note> From this period therefore we ſhall deſcribe their ſituation.</p>
                  <p>They are ſummoned at five in the morning to begin their work. This work may be divided into two kinds, the culture of the fields, and the collection of graſs for cattle. The laſt is the moſt laborious and in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>erable employment; as the graſs can only be collected blade by blade, and is to be fetched frequently twice a day at a conſiderable diſtance from the plantation. In theſe two occupations they are jointly taken up, with no other intermiſſion than that of taking their ſubſiſtence twice, till nine at night. They then ſeparate for their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive huts, when they gather ſticks, prepare their ſupper, and attend their families. This employs them till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when they go to reſt. Such is their daily way of life for rather more than half the year. They are <hi>ſixteen</hi> hours, including two intervals at meals, in the ſervice of their maſters: they are employed <hi>three</hi> afterwards in their own neceſſary concerns; <hi>five</hi> only remain for ſleep, and their day is finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>During the remaining portion of the year, or the time of crop, the nature, as well as the time of their employment, is conſiderably changed. The whole gang is generally divided into two or three bodies. One of theſe, beſides the ordinary labour of the day, is kept in turn at the mills, that are conſtantly going, during the whole of the night. This is a dreadful encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:019561_0092_0FABFC1237C5C178"/>upon their time of reſt, which was before too ſhort to permit them perfectly to refreſh their wearied limbs, and actually reduces their ſleep, as long as this ſeaſon laſts, to about three hours and an half a night, upon a moderate<note n="*" place="bottom">This computation is made on a ſuppoſition, that the gang is divided into three bodies; we call it therefore moderate, becauſe the gang is frequently divided into two bodies, which muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet up alternately <hi>every other night.</hi>
                     </note> computation. Thoſe who can keep their eyes open during their nightly labour, and are willing to reſiſt the drowſineſs that is continually coming upon them, are preſently worn out; while ſome of thoſe, who are overcome, and who feed the mill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween aſleep and awake, ſuffer, for thus obeying the calls of nature, by the<note n="†" place="bottom">An hand or arm being frequently ground off.</note> loſs of a limb. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they go on, with little or no reſpite from their work, till the crop ſeaſon is over, when the year (from the time of our firſt deſcription) is completed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">The reader will ſcarcely believe it, but it is a fact, that a ſlave's annual allowance from his maſter, for proviſions, clothing, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines when ſick, &amp;c. is limited, upon an average, to thirty ſhill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> To ſupport a life of ſuch unparalleled drudgery, we ſhould at leaſt expect to find, that they were comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly clothed, and plentifully fed. But ſad reverſe! they have ſcarcely a covering to defend themſelves againſt the inclemency of the night. Their proviſions are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bad, and are always dealt out to them with ſuch a ſparing hand, that the means of a bare livelihood are not placed within the reach of four out of five of theſe unhappy people. It is a fact, that many of the diſorders of ſlaves are contracted from eating the vegetables, which their little ſpots produce, before they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ripe: a clear indication, that the calls of hunger are frequently ſo preſſing, as not to ſuffer them to wait, till they can really enjoy them.</p>
                  <p>This ſituation, of a want of the common neceſſaries of life, added to that of hard and continual labour, muſt be ſufficiently painful of itſelf. How then muſt
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:019561_0093_0FABFC12FAFC3458"/>the pain be ſharpened, if it be accompanied with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! if an unfortunate ſlave does not come into the field exactly at the appointed time, if, drooping with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or fatigue, he appears to work unwillingly, or if the bundle of graſs that he has been collecting, appears too ſmall in the eye of the overſeer, he is equally ſure of experiencing the whip. This inſtrument eraſes the ſkin, and cuts out ſmall portions of the fleſh at almoſt every ſtroke; and is ſo frequently applied, that the ſmack of it is all day long in the ears of thoſe, who are in the vicinity of the plantations. This ſeverity of maſters, or managers, to their ſlaves, which is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as common diſcipline, is attended with bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It enables them to behold inſtances of cruelty without commiſeration, and to be guilty of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorſe. Hence thoſe many acts of deliberate mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation, that have taken place on the ſlighteſt occaſions: hence thoſe many acts of inferiour, though ſhocking, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, that have taken place without any occaſion at all:<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>A boy having received ſix ſlaves as a preſent from his father, immediately ſlit their ears, and for the following reaſon, that as his father was a whimſical man, he might claim them again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were marked.</q> We do not mention this inſtance as a conſirmation of the paſſage to which it is annexed, but only to ſhew how cautious we ought to be in giving credit to what may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in any work written in defence of ſlavery, by any native of the colonies: for being trained up to ſcenes of cruelty from his cradle, he may, conſiſtently with his own feelings, repreſent that treatment as mild, at which we, who have never been uſed to ſee them, ſhould abſolutely ſhudder.</note> the very ſlitting of ears has been conſidered as an operation, ſo perfectly devoid of pain, as to have been performed for no other reaſon than that for which a brand is ſet upon cattle, as <hi>a mark of property.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not the only effect, which this ſeverity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces: for while it hardens their hearts, and makes them inſenſible of the miſery of their fellow-creatures, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a turn for wanton cruelty. As a proof of this, we ſhall mention one, among the many inſtances that occur, where ingenuity has been exerted in contriving modes of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:019561_0094_0FABFC1BEC0AA0B0"/>torture. <q>An iron coffin, with holes in it, was kept by a certain coloniſt, as an auxiliary to the laſh. In this the poor victim of the maſter's reſentment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and placed ſufficiently near a fire, to occaſion extreme pain, and conſequently ſhrieks and groans, until the revenge of the maſter was ſatiated, without any other inconvenience on his part, then a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuſpenſion of the ſlave's labour. Had he been flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to death, or his limbs mutilated, the intereſt of the brutal tyrant would have ſuffered a more irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In mentioning this inſtance, we do not mean to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that it is common. We know that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated by many. All that we would infer from it is, that where men are habituated to a ſyſtem of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, they become <hi>wantonly cruel,</hi> and that the mere toleration of ſuch an inſtrument of torture, in any country, is a clear indication, <hi>that this wretched claſs of men do not there enjoy the protection of any laws, that may be pretended to have been enacted in their favour.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such then is the general ſituation of the unfortunate Africans. They are beaten and tortured at diſcretion. They are badly clothed. They are miſerably fed. Their drudgery is intenſe and inceſſant, and their reſt ſhort. For ſcarcely are their heads reclined, ſcarcely have their bodies a reſpite from the labour of the day, or the cruel hand of the overſeer, but they are ſummoned to renew their ſorrows. In this manner they go on from year to year, in a ſtate of the loweſt degradation, without a ſingle law to protect them, without the poſſibility of redreſs, without a hope that their ſituation will be changed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs death ſhould terminate the ſcene.</p>
                  <p>Having deſcribed the general ſituation of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate people, we ſhah now take notice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſequences that are found to attend it, and relate them ſeparately, as they reſult either from long and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>labour,</hi> a <hi>want</hi> of the common neceſſaries of life, or continual <hi>ſeverity</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oppreſſed by a daily taſk of ſuch immoderate labour as human nature is utterly unable to perform, many of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:019561_0095_0FABFC214522E160"/>them run away from their maſters. They fly to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the mountains, where they chooſe rather to live upon any thing that the ſoil affords them, nay, the very ſoil itſelf, than return to that <hi>happy ſituation,</hi> which is repreſented by the <hi>receivers,</hi> as the condition of a ſlave.</p>
                  <p>It ſometimes happens, that the manager of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain plantation, falls in with one of theſe; he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeizes him, and threatens to carry him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer maſter, unleſs he will conſent to live on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cultivate his ground. When his plantation is put in order, he carries the delinquent home, abandons him to all the ſuggeſtions of deſpotick rage, and accepts a reward for his <hi>honeſty.</hi> The unhappy wretch is chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſcourged, tortured; and all this, becauſe he obeyed the dictates of nature, and wanted to be free. And who is there, that would not have done the ſame thing, in the ſame ſituation? Who is there, that has once known the charms of liberty, that would not fly from deſpotiſm? And yet, by the impious laws of the <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> the<note n="*" place="bottom">In this caſe he is conſidered as a criminal againſt the ſtate. The <hi>marſhal,</hi> an officer anſwering to our ſheriff, ſuperintends his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the maſter receives the value of the ſlave from the publick treaſury. We may obſerve here, that in all caſes where the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is a criminal of the ſtate, he is executed, and his value is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſame manner. He is tried and condemned by two or three juſtices of the peace, and without any intervention of a <hi>jury.</hi>
                     </note> abſence of ſix months from the laſh of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is—<hi>death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this law is even mild, when compared with another againſt the ſame offence, which was in force ſometime ago, and which we fear is even nom in force, in ſome of thoſe colonies which this account of the treament comprehends. <q>Advertiſements have frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there, offering a reward for the apprehending of fugitive ſlaves either alive or <hi>dead.</hi> The following inſtance was given us by a perſon of unqueſtionable veracity, under whoſe own obſervation it fell. As he was travelling in one of the colonies alluded to, he
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:019561_0096_0FABFC23681EB8B0"/>obſerved ſome people in purſuit of a poor wretch, who was ſeeking in the wilderneſs an aſylum from his labours. He heared the diſcharge of a gun, and ſoon afterwards ſtopping at an houſe for refreſhment, the head of the fugitive, ſtill reeking with blood, was brought in and laid upon a table with exultation. The production of ſuch a trophy was the proof <hi>required by law</hi> to entitle the heroes to their reward.</q> Now reader determine if you can, who were the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable; the rulers of the ſtate in authorizing murder, or the people in being bribed to commit it.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the common conſequences of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſhare of labour, which is impoſed upon them; nor is that, which is the reſult of a ſcanty allowance of food, leſs to be lamented. The wretched African is often ſo deeply pierced by the excruciating ſangs of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as almoſt to be driven to deſpair. What is he to do in ſuch a trying ſituation? Let him apply to the <hi>receivers.</hi> Alas! the majeſty of <hi>receiverſhip</hi> is too ſacred for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and the intruſion would be fatal. Thus attacked on the one hand, and ſhut out from every poſſibility of relief on the other, he has only the choice of being ſtarved, or of relieving his neceſſities by taking a ſmall portion of the fruits of his own labour. Horrid crime! to be found eating the cane, which probably his own hands have planted, and to be eating it, becauſe his neceſſities were preſſing! This crime however is of ſuch a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as always to be accompanied with the whip; and ſo unmercifully has it been applied on ſuch an occaſion, as to have been the cauſe, in wet weather, of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent's death. But the ſmart of the whip has not been the only pain that the wretched Africans have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced. Any thing that paſſion could ſeize, and convert into an inſtrument of puniſhment, has been uſed; and, horrid to relate! the very knife has not been overlooked in the fit of phrenzy. Ears have been ſlit, eyes have been beaten out, and bones have been broken; and ſo frequently has this been the caſe, that it has been a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſtant lamentation with diſintereſted people,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:019561_0097_0FAC02CF3190A4F8"/>who out of curioſity have attended the<note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly in Jamaica. Theſe obſervations were made by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted people, who were there for three or four years during the late war.</note> markets to which theſe unhappy people weekly reſort, that they have not been able to turn their eyes on any group of them whatever, but they have beheld theſe inhuman marks of paſſion, deſpotiſm, and caprice.</p>
                  <p>But theſe inſtances of barbarity have not been able to deter them from ſimilar proceedings. And indeed, how can it be expected that they ſhould? They have ſtill the ſame appetite to be ſatisfied as before, and to drive them to deſperation. They creep out clandeſtinely by night, and go in ſearch of food into their maſter's, or ſome neighbouring plantation. But here they are almoſt equally ſure of ſuffering. The watchman, who will be puniſhed himſelf, if he neglects his duty, frequently ſeizes them in the fact. No excuſe or intreaty will avail; he muſt puniſh them for an example, and he muſt puniſh them, not with a ſtick, nor with a whip, but with a cutlaſs. Thus it happens, that theſe unhappy ſlaves, if they are taken, are either ſent away mangled in a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, or are killed upon the ſpot.</p>
                  <p>We may now mention the conſequences of the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The wretched Africans, daily ſubjected to the laſh, and unmercifully whipt and beaten on every trifling oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, have been found to reſiſt their oppoſers. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable crime! that they ſhould have the feelings of nature! that their breaſts ſhould glow with reſentment on an injury! that they ſhould be ſo far overcome, as to reſiſt thoſe, whom <hi>they are under no obligation to obey,</hi> and whoſe only title to their ſervices conſiſts in <hi>a violation of the rights of men!</hi> What has been the conſequences? But here let us ſpare the feelings of the reader, (we wiſh we could ſpare our own) and let us only ſay, without a recital of the cruelty, <hi>that they have been murdered at the diſcretion of their maſters.</hi> For let the reader obſerve, that the life of an African is only valued at a price, that would
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:019561_0098_0FAC02CFF5DD2B58"/>ſcarcely purchaſe an horſe; that the maſter has a power of murdering his ſlave, if he pays but a trifling fine; and that the murder muſt be attended with uncommon circumſtances of horrour, if it even produces an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Immortal Alfred! father of our invaluable conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! parent of the civil bleſſings we enjoy! how ought thy laws to excite our love and veneration, who haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden us, thy poſterity, to tremble at the frown of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants! how ought they to perpetuate thy name, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, to the remoteſt ages, who has ſecured, even to the meaneſt ſervant, a fair and impartial trial! How much does nature approve thy laws, as conſiſtent with her own feelings, while ſhe abſolutely turns pale, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and recoils, at the inſtitutions of theſe <hi>receivers!</hi> Execrable men! you do not murder the horſe, on which you only ride; you do not mutilate the cow, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affords you her milk; you do not torture the dog, which is but a partial ſervant of your pleaſures: but theſe unfortunate men, from whom you derive your very pleaſures and your fortunes, you torture, mutilate, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at diſcretion! Sleep then you <hi>receivers,</hi> if you can, while you ſcarcely allow theſe unfortunate people to reſt at all! feaſt if you can, and indulge your genius, while you daily apply to theſe unfortunate people the ſtings of ſeverity and hunger! exult in riches, at which even avarice ought to ſhudder, and which humanity muſt deteſt!</p>

                  <p>Some people may ſuppoſe, from the melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that has been given in the preceding chapter, that we have been abſolutely dealing in romance: that the ſcene exhibited is rather a dreary picture of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than a repreſentation of fact.

<pb n="102" facs="unknown:019561_0099_0FAC02D0CFA975E0"/>deſcription of the general treatment of ſlaves has been greatly exaggerated.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>receivers,</hi> notwithſtanding the ample and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted evidence, that can be brought on the occaſion, do not admit the deſcription to be true.

Let them reflect upon the prodigious ſupplies that are <hi>annually</hi> required, and their argument will be nothing leſs than a confeſſion, that the ſlavery has been juſtly depicted.</p>
                  <p>They appeal next to every man's own reaſon, and deſire him to think ſeriouſly, whether <q>ſelf-intereſt will not always reſtrain the maſter from acts of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ſlave, and whether ſuch accounts therefore, as the foregoing, do not contain within themſelves, their own refutation.</q> We anſwer, "No." For if this reſtraining principle be as powerful as it is imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why does not the general conduct of men afford us a better picture? What is imprudence, or what is vice, but a departure from every man's own intereſt, and yet theſe are the characteriſticks of more than half the world?—</p>
                  <p>—But, to come more cloſely to the preſent caſe, <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> will be found but a weak barrier againſt the ſallies of <hi>paſſion:</hi> particularly where it has been daily indulged in its greateſt latitude, and there are no laws to reſtrain its calamitous effects. If the obſervation be true, that paſſion is a ſhort madneſs, then it is evident that ſelf-intereſt, and every other conſideration, muſt be loſt, ſo long as it continues. We cannot have a ſtronger inſtance of this, than in a circumſtance related in the ſecond part of this Eſſay, "that though the Africans have gone to war for the expreſs purpoſe of procuring ſlaves, yet ſo great has been their reſentment at the reſiſtance they have frequently found, that their <hi>paſſion</hi> has entirely got the better of their <hi>intereſt,</hi> and they have murdered all without any diſcrimination, either of age or ſex." Such may be preſumed to be the caſe with the no leſs
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:019561_0100_0FAC02D49DBB34C0"/>ſavage <hi>receivers.</hi> Impreſſed with the moſt haughty and tyrannical notions, eaſily provoked, accuſtomed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their anger, and, above all, habituated to ſcenes of cruelty, and unawed by the fear of laws, they will hardly be found to be exempt from the common fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of human nature, and to ſpace an unlucky ſlave, at a time when men of a cooler temper, and better regulated paſſions, are ſo frequently blind to their own intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>paſſion</hi> may be ſuppoſed to be generally more than a balance for <hi>intereſt,</hi> how muſt the ſcale be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favour of the melancholy picture exhibited, when we reflect that <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> additionally ſteps in, and demands the moſt <hi>rigorous ſeverity.</hi> For when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that where there is <hi>one</hi> maſter, there are <hi>fifty</hi> ſlaves; that the latter have been all forcibly torn from their country, and are retained in their preſent ſituation by violence; that they are perpetually at war in their hearts with their oppreſſors, and are continually cheriſhing the ſeeds of revenge; it is evident that even <hi>avarice</hi> herſelf, however cool and deliberate, however free from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and caprice, muſt ſacrifice her own ſordid feelings, and adopt a ſyſtem of tyranny and oppreſſion, which it muſt be ruinous to purſue.</p>
                  <p>Thus then, if no picture had been drawn of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlaves, and it had been leſt ſolely to every man's ſober judgment to determine, what it might probably be, he would conclude, that if the ſituation were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed, the page muſt be frequently ſtained with acts of uncommon cruelty.</p>
                  <p>It remains only to make a reply to an objection, that is uſually advanced againſt particular inſtances of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſlaves, as recorded by various writers. It is ſaid that <q>ſome of theſe are ſo inconceivably, and beyond all example inhuman, that their very exceſs above the common meaſure of cruelty ſhews them at once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated and incredible.</q> But their credibility ſhall be eſtimated by a ſuppoſition. Let us ſuppoſe that the following inſtance had been recorded by a writer of the higheſt reputation, <q>that the maſter of a ſhip, bound
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:019561_0101_0FAC02D71CA94F90"/>"to the weſtern colonies with ſlaves, on a preſumption "that many of them would die, ſelected an <hi>hundred "and thirty two</hi> of the moſt ſickly, and ordered them "to be thrown into the ſea, to recover their value from "the inſurers, and, above all, that the fatal order was put into execution.</q> What would the reader have thought on the occaſion? Would be have believed the fact? It would have ſurely ſtaggered his faith; becauſe he could never have heard that any <hi>one</hi> man ever was, and could never have ſuppoſed that any <hi>one</hi> man ever could be, guilty of the murder of <hi>ſuch a number</hi> of his fellow creatures. But when he is informed that ſuch a fact as this came before<note n="*" place="bottom">The action was brought by the owners againſt the under-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to recover the value of the <hi>murdered</hi> ſlaves. It was tried at Guildhall.</note> a court of juſtice in this very coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that it happened within the laſt five years; that hundreds can come forwards and ſay, that they heard the melancholy evidence with tears; what bounds is he to place to his belief? The great God, who looks down upon all his creatures with the ſame impartial eye, ſeems to have infatuated the parties concerned, that they might bring the horrid circumſtance to light, that it might be recorded in the annals of a publick court, as an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſpecimen of the treatment which the unfortunate Africans undergo, and at the ſame time, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſhew, that there is no ſpecies of cruelty, that is recorded to have been exerciſed upon theſe wretched people, ſo enormous that it may not <hi>readily be believed.</hi>

                  <p>If the treatment then, as before deſcribed, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by reaſon, and the great credit that is due to diſintereſted writers on the ſubject; if the unfortunate Africans are uſed, as if their fleſh were ſtone, and their vitals braſs; by what arguments do you <hi>receivers</hi> defend your conduct?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:019561_0102_0FAC02D803A84B68"/>
You ſay that a great part of your ſavage treatment conſiſts in puniſhment for real offences, and frequently for ſuch offences, as all civilized nations have concurred in puniſhing. The firſt charge that you exhibit againſt them is ſpecifick, it is that of <hi>theft.</hi> But how much rather ought you <hi>receivers</hi> to bluſh, who reduce them to ſuch a ſituation! who reduce them to the dreadful alternative, that they muſt either <hi>ſteal</hi> or <hi>periſh!</hi> How much rather ought you <hi>receivers</hi> to be conſidered as <hi>rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> yourſelves, who cauſe theſe unfortunate people to be <hi>ſtolen!</hi> And how much greater is your crime, who are <hi>robbers of human liberty!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next charge which you exhibit againſt them, is general, it is that of <hi>rebellion;</hi> a crime of ſuch a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that you can impoſe it upon almoſt every action, and of ſuch a nature, that you always annex to it the moſt excruciating pain. But what a contradiction is this to common ſenſe! Have the wretched Africans formally reſigned their freedom? Have you any other claim upon their obedience, than that of force? If then they are your ſubjects, you violate the laws of government, by making them unhappy. But if they are not your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, then, even though they ſhould reſiſt your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they are not <hi>rebellious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what do you ſay to that long catalogue of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which you puniſh, and of which no people but yourſelves take cognizance at all? You ſay that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of legiſlation has inſerted it in the colonial laws, and that you puniſh by authority. But do you allude to that execrable code, that <hi>authoriſes murder?</hi> that tempts an unoffended perſon to kill the ſlave, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors and flies your ſervice? that delegates a power, which no hoſt of men, which not all the world, can poſſeſs?—</p>
                  <p>Or,—What do you ſay to that daily unmerited ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which you conſider only as common diſcipline? Here you ſay that the Africans are vicious, that they are all of them ill-diſpoſed, that you muſt of neceſſity be ſevere. But can they be well-diſpoſed to their oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors? In their own country they were juſt, generous,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:019561_0103_0FAC02D9D8889420"/>hoſpitable: qualities, which all the African hiſtorians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them eminently to poſſeſs. If then they are vicious, they muſt have contracted many of their vices from your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and as to their own native vices, if any have been imported with them, are they not amiable, when compared with yours?</p>
                  <p>Thus then do the excuſes, which have been hitherto made by the <hi>receivers,</hi> force a relation of ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as makes their conduct totally inexcuſable, and, inſtead of diminiſhing at all, highly aggravates their guilt.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <p>We come now to that other ſyſtem of reaſoning, which is always applied, when the former is confuted; <q>that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and are made for ſlavery.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This aſſertion is proved by two arguments; the firſt of which was advanced alſo by the ancients, and is drawn from the <hi>inferiority of their capacities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us allow then for a moment, that they appear to have no parts, that they appear to be void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And is this wonderful, when you <hi>receivers</hi> depreſs their ſenſes by hunger? Is this wonderful when by inceſſant labour, the continual application of the laſh, and the moſt inhuman treatment that imagination can deviſe, you overwhelm their genius, and hinder it from breaking forth?—No,—You confound their abilities by the ſeverity of their ſervitude: for as a ſpark of fire, if cruſhed by too great a weight of incumbent fuel, cannot be blown into a flame, but ſuddenly expires, ſo the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, if depreſſed by rigorous ſervitude, cannot be excited to a diſplay of thoſe ſaculties, which might otherwiſe have ſhone with the brighteſt luſtre.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it wonderful in another point of view. For what is it that awakens the abilities of men, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes them from the common herd? Is it not often the amiable hope of becoming ſerviceable to individuals, or the ſtate? Is it not often the hope of riches, or of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:019561_0104_0FAC02DA6AA15480"/>Is it not frequently the hope of temporary honours, or a laſting fame? Theſe principles have all a wonderful effect upon the mind. They call upon it to exert its faculties, and bring thoſe talents to the publick view, which had otherwiſe been concealed. But the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Africans have no ſuch incitements as theſe, that they ſhould ſhew their genius. They have no hope of riches, power, honours, fame. They have no hope but this, that their miſeries will be ſoon terminated by death.</p>
                  <p>And here we cannot but cenſure and expoſe the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings of the unthinking and the gay; who, going on in a continual round of pleaſure and proſperity, repine at the will of Providence, as exhibited in the ſhortneſs of human duration. But let a weak and infirm old age overtake them: let them experience calamities: let them feel but half the miſeries which the wretched Africans undergo, and they will praiſe the goodneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who hath made them mortal; who hath preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain ordinary bounds to the life of man; and who, by ſuch a limitation, hath given all men this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hope, that however perſecuted in life, a time will come, in the common courſe of nature, when their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings will have an end.</p>
                  <p>Such then is the nature of this ſervitude, that we can hardly expect to find in thoſe, who undergo it, even the glimpſe of genius. For if their minds are in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate of depreſſon, and if they have no expectations in life to awaken their abilities, and make them eminent, we cannot be ſurprized if a ſullen gloomy ſtupidity ſhould be the leading mark in their charrcter; or if they ſhould appear inferiour to thoſe, who do not only enjoy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable bleſſings of freedom, but have every proſpect before their eyes, that can allure them to exert their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Now, if to theſe conſiderations we add, that the wretched Africans are torn from their country in a ſtate of nature, and that in general, as long as their ſlavery continues, every obſtacle is placed in the way of their improvement, we ſhall have a ſufficient anſwer to any argument that may be drawn from the inferiority of their capacities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="unknown:019561_0105_0FAC02DDB126E2C0"/>
It appears then from the circumſtances that have been mentioned, that to form a true judgment of the abilities of theſe unfortunate people, we muſt either take a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral view of them before their ſlavery commences, or confine our attention to ſuch, as, after it has commenced, have had any opportunity given them of ſhewing their genius either in arts or letters. If, upon ſuch a fair and impartial view, there ſhould be any reaſon to ſuppoſe, that they are at all inferiour to others in the ſame ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the argument will then gain ſome of that weight and importance, which it wants at preſent.</p>
                  <p>In their own country, where we are to ſee them firſt, we muſt expect that the proſpect will be unfavourable. They are moſtly in a ſavage ſtate. Their powers of mind are limited to few objects. Their ideas are conſequently few. It appears, however, that they follow the ſame mode of life, and exerciſe the ſame arts, as the anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of thoſe very Europeans, who boaſt of their great ſuperiority, are deſcribed to have done in the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated ſtate. This appears from the Nubian's Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, the writings of Leo, the Moor, and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent hiſtories, which thoſe, who have viſited the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can continent, have written from their own inſpection. Hence three concluſions; that their abilities are ſufficient for their ſituation;—that they are as great, as thoſe of other people have been, in the ſame ſtage of ſociety;— and that they are as great as thoſe of any civilized peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatever, when the degree of the barbariſm of the one is drawn into a compariſon with that of the civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other.</p>
                  <p>Let us now follow them to the colonies. They are carried over in the unfavourable ſituation deſcribed. It is obſerved here, that though their abilities cannot be eſtimated high, from a want of cultivation, they are yet various, and that they vary in proportion as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which they have been brought, has advanced more or leſs in the ſcale of ſocial life. This obſervation, which is ſo frequently made, is of great importance: for if their abilities expand in proportion to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:019561_0106_0FAC02E0ADEC4578"/>of their ſtate, it is a clear indication, that if they were equally improved, they would be equally ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>But here, before we conſider any opportunities that may be aſſorded them, let it be remembered that even their moſt poliſhed ſituation may be called barbarous, and that this circumſtance, ſhould they appear leſs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile than others, may be conſidered as a ſufficient anſwer to any objection that may be made to their capacities. Notwithſtanding this, when they are put to the mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal arts, they do not diſcover a want of ingenuity.— They attain them in as ſhort a time as the Europeans, and arrive at a degree of excellence equal to that of their teachers. This is a fact, almoſt univerſally known, and affords us this proof, that having learned with facility ſuch of the mechanical arts, as they have been taught, they are capable of attaining any other, at leaſt, of the ſame ciaſs, if they ſhould receive but the ſame inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the liberal arts, their proficiency is certainly leſs; but not leſs in proportion to their time and opportunity of ſtudy; not leſs, becauſe they are leſs capable of attaining them, but becauſe they have ſeldom or ever an opportunity of learning them at all. It is yet extraordinary that their talents appear, even in ſome of theſe ſciences, in which they are totally uninſtructed. Their abilities in muſick are ſuch, as to have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally noticed. They play frequently upon a variety of inſtruments, without any other aſſiſtance than their own ingenuny. They have alſo tunes of their own compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some of theſe have been imported among us; are now in uſe; and are admired for their ſprightlineſs and eaſe, though the ungenerous and prejudiced impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has concealed their original.</p>
                  <p>Neither are their talents in poetry leſs conſpicuous. Every occurrence, if their ſpirits are not too greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, is turned into a ſong. Theſe ſongs are ſaid to be incoherent and nonſenſical. But this proceeds prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from two cauſes, an improper conjunction of words, ariſing from an ignorance of the language in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:019561_0107_0FAC02E270B20C98"/>which they compoſe; and a wildneſs of thought, ariſing from the different manner, in which the organs of rude and civilized people will be ſtruck by the ſame object. And as to their want of harmony and rhyme, which is the laſt objection, the difference of pronunciation is the cauſe. Upon the whole, as they are perfectly conſiſtent with their own ideas, and are ſtrictly muſical as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by themſelves, they afford us as high a proof of their poetical powers, as the works of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged poets.</p>
                  <p>But where theſe impediments have been removed, where they have received an education, and have known and pronounced the language with propriety, theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have vaniſhed, and their productions have been leſs objectionable. For a proof of this, we appeal to the writings of an<note n="*" place="bottom">Phillis Wheatley, negro ſlave to Mr. John Wheatley, of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in New-England.</note> African girl, who made no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible appearance in this ſpecies of compoſition. She was kidnapped when only eight years old, and, in the year 1761, was tranſported to America, where ſhe was ſold with other ſlaves. She had no ſchool education there, but receiving ſome little inſtruction from the family, with whom ſhe was ſo fortunate as to live, ſhe obtained ſuch a knowledge of the Engliſh language within ſixteen months from the time of her arrival, as to be able to ſpeak it and read it to the aſtoniſhment of thoſe who heard her. She ſoon afterwards learned to write, and, having a great inclination to learn the Latin tongue, ſhe was indulge, by her maſter, and made a progreſs. Her Poetical works were publiſhed with his permiſſion, in the year 1773. They contain thirty-eight pieces on different ſubjects. We ſhall beg leave to make a ſhort extract from two or three of them, for the obſervation of the reader.</p>

                  <p>Such is the poetry which we produce as a proof of our aſſertions. How far it has ſucceeded, the reader may by this time have determined in his own mind.— We ſhall therefore only beg leave to accompany it with this obſervation, that if the authoreſs <hi>was deſigned for ſlavery,</hi> (as the argument muſt confeſs) the greater part of the inhabitants of Britain muſt loſe their claim to freedom.</p>
                  <p>To this poetry we ſhall only add, as a farther proof of their abilities, the Proſe compoſitions of Ignatius Sancho, who received ſome little education. His letters are too well known, to make any extract, or indeed any farther mention of him, neceſſary. If other examples of African genius ſhould be required, ſuffice it to ſay, that they can be produced in abundance; and that if we were allowed to enumerate inſtances of African grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, patience, fidelity, honour, as ſo many inſtances of good ſenſe, and a ſound underſtanding, we fear that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the enlightened Europeans would have occaſion to bluſh.</p>
                  <p>But an objection will be made here, that the two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom we have particularized by name, are prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and that if we were to live for many years, we ſhould ſcarcely meet with two other Africans of the ſame deſcription. But we reply, that conſidering their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as before deſcribed, two perſons, above mediocrity in the literary way, are as many as can be expected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a certain period of years; and farther, that if theſe
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:019561_0110_0FAC02E42E323BA0"/>are prodigies, they are only ſuch prodigies as every day would produce, if they had the ſame opportunities of acquiring knowledge as other people, and the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in life to excite their genius. This has been conſtantly and ſolemnly aſſerted by the pious Benezet,<note n="†" place="bottom">In the Preface.</note> whom we have mentioned before, as having devoted a conſiderable part of his time to their inſtruction. This great man, for we cannot but mention him with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, had a better opportunity of knowing them than any perſon whatever, and he always uniformly declared, that he could never find a difference between their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and thoſe of other people; that they were as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reaſoning as any individual Europeans; that they were as capable of the higheſt intellectual attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in ſhort, that their abilities were equal, and that they only wanted to be equally cultivated, to afford ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens of as fine productions.</p>
                  <p>Thus then does it appear from the teſtimony of this venerable man, whoſe authority is ſufficient of itſelf to ſilence all objections againſt African capacity, and from the inſtances that have been produced, and the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been made on the occaſion, that if the minds of the Africans were unbroken by ſlavery; if they had the ſame expectations in life as other people, and the ſame opportunities of improvement, they would be equal, in all the various branches of ſcience, to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, and that the argument that ſtates them <q>to be an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſervitude,</q> as far as it depends on the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority of their capacities,</hi> is wholly malevolent and falſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">As to Mr. Hume's aſſertions with reſpect to African capacity, we have paſſed them over in ſilence, as they have been ſo admirably refuted by the learned Dr. Beattie, in his Eſſay on Truth, to which we refer the reader.

                  <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
                  <p>The ſecond argument, by which it is attempted to be proved, <q>that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and are deſigned for ſlavery,</q> is drawn from <hi>colour,</hi> and from thoſe other marks, which diſtinguiſh them from the inhabitants of Europe.</p>
                  <p>To prove this with the greater facility, the <hi>receivers</hi> divide in opinion. Some of them contend that the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, from theſe circumſtances, are the deſcendants of<note n="*" place="bottom">Geneſis, ch. iv. 15.</note> Cain: others, that they are the poſterity of Ham; and that as it was declared by divine inſpiration, that theſe ſhould be ſervants to the reſt of the world, ſo they are deſigned for ſlavery; and that the reducing of them to ſuch a ſituation is only the accompliſhment of the will of heaven: while the reſt, conſidering them from the ſame circumſtances as a totally diſtinct ſpecies of men, conclude them to be an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and deduce the inference deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer theſe arguments in the cleareſt and fulleſt manner, we are under the neceſſity of making two ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, firſt, that the ſcriptures are true; ſecondly, that they are falſe.</p>
                  <p>If then the ſcriptures are true, it is evident that the poſterity of Cain were extinguiſhed in the flood. Thus one of the arguments is no more.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the curſe of Ham, it appears alſo that it was limited; that it did not extend to the poſterity of all his ſons, but only to the<note n="†" place="bottom">Geneſis, ch. ix. 25, 26, 27.</note> deſcendants of him who was called Canaan: by which it was foretold that the Canaanites, a part of the poſterity of Ham, ſhould ſerve the poſterity of Shem and Japhet. Now how does it appear that theſe wretched Africans are the deſcendants of Canaan?—By thoſe marks, it will be ſaid, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them from the reſt of the world.—But where
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:019561_0112_0FAC02E5B774CED0"/>are theſe marks to be found in the divine writings? In what page is it ſaid, that the Canaanites were to be known by their <hi>colour,</hi> their <hi>features,</hi> their <hi>form,</hi> or the very <hi>hair of their heads,</hi> which is brought into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? —But alas! ſo far are the divine writings from giving any ſuch account, that they ſhew the aſſertion to be falſe. They ſhew that the<note n="†" place="bottom">Jeremiah ſays, ch. xiii. 23, <q>Can the Aethiopian change his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or the leopard his ſpots?</q> Now the word, which is here tranſlated <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> is in the original Hebrew <q>
                           <hi>the deſcendant of Cuſh,</hi>
                        </q> which ſhews that this colour was not confined to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the advocates for ſlavery aſſert.</note> deſcendants of Cuſh were of the colour, to which the advocates for ſlavery allude; and of courſe, that there was no ſuch limitation of colour to the poſterity of Canaan, or the inheritors of the curſe.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe we ſhould now ſhew, upon the moſt undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is very extraordinary that the advocates for ſlavery ſhould conſider thoſe Africans, whom they call negroes, as the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when few hiſtorical facts can be ſo well aſcertained, as that out of the deſcendants of the four ſons of Ham, the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Canaan were the only people, (if we except the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were a colony of Canaan, and were afterwards ruined) who did not fettle in that quarter of the globe. Africa was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertibly peopled by the poſterity of the three other ſons. We cannot ſhew this in a clearer manner, than in the words of the learned Mr. Bryant, in his letter to Mr. Granville Sharp on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

                  <p>But unfortunately again for the argument, though wonderfully for the confirmation that the ſcriptures are of divine original, the whole prophecy has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. A part of the deſcendants of Canaan were hewers of wood and drawers of water, and became tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary and ſubject to the Iſraelites, or the deſcendants of Shem. The Greeks afterwards, as well as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who were both the deſcendants of Japhet, not only ſubdued thoſe who were ſettled in Syria and Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, but purſued and conquered all ſuch as were then remaining. Theſe were the Tyrians and Carthaginians:
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:019561_0114_0FAC02E7317481D8"/>the former of whom were ruined by Alexander and the Greeks, the latter by Scipio and the Romans.</p>
                  <p>It appears then that the ſecond argument is wholly inapplicable and falſe: that it is falſe in its <hi>application,</hi> becauſe thoſe, who were the objects of the curſe, were a totally diſtinct people: that it is falſe in its <hi>proof,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſuch diſtinguiſhing marks, as have been ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are to be found in the divine writings: and that, if the proof could be made out, it would be now <hi>inappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,</hi> as the curſe has been long completed.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the third argument, we muſt now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the ſcriptures are falſe; that mankind did not all ſpring from the ſame original; that there are different ſpecies of men. Now what muſt we juſtly conclude from ſuch a ſuppoſition? Muſt we conclude that one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is inferiour to another, and that the inferiority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their <hi>colour,</hi> or their <hi>features,</hi> or their <hi>form?</hi> —No—We muſt now conſult the analogy of nature, and the concluſion will be this: "that as ſhe tempered the bodies of the different ſpecies of men in a different degree, to enable them to endure the reſpective climates of their habitation, ſo ſhe gave them a variety of colour and appearance with a like benevolent deſign."</p>
                  <p>To ſum up the whole. If the ſcriptures are true, it is evident that the poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> are no more; that the curſe of <hi>Ham</hi> has been accompliſhed; and that, as all men were derived from the ſame ſtock, ſo this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of appearance in men muſt either have proceeded from ſome interpoſition of the Deity; or from a co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of certain cauſes, which have an effect upon the human frame, and have the power of changing it more or leſs from its primitive appearance, as they happen to be more or leſs numerous or powerful than thoſe, which acted upon the frame of man in the firſt ſeat of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. If from the interpoſition of the Deity, then we muſt conclude that he, who bringeth good out of evil, produced it for their convenience. If, from the co-operation of the cauſes before related, what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be found againſt any ſociety of men, who ſhould happen to differ, in the points alluded to, from ourſelves?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="unknown:019561_0115_0FAC02E7ECB42B08"/>
If, on the other hand, the ſcriptures are falſe, then it is evident, that there was neither ſuch a perſon as <hi>Cain,</hi> nor <hi>Ham,</hi> nor <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that nature beſtowed ſuch colour, features, and form, upon the different ſpecies of men, as were beſt adapted to their ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Thus, on which ever ſuppoſition it is founded, the whole argument muſt fall. And indeed it is impoſſible that it can ſtand, even in the eye of common ſenſe.— For if you admit the <hi>form</hi> of men as a juſtification of ſlavery, you may ſubjugate your own brother: if <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> then you muſt quarrel with all the world: if <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> where are you to ſtop? It is evident, that if you travel from the equator to the northern pole, you will find a regular gradation of colour from black to white. Now if you can juſtly take him for your ſlave, who is of the deepeſt die, what hinders you from taking him alſo, who only differs from the former but by a ſhade. Thus you may proceed, taking each in a regular ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the poles. But who are you, that thus take into ſlavery ſo many people? Where do you live yourſelf? Do you live in <hi>Spain,</hi> or in <hi>France,</hi> or in <hi>Britain?</hi> If in either of theſe countries, take care leſt the <hi>whiter natives of the north</hi> ſhould have a claim upon yourſelf.—But the argument is too ridiculous to be farther noticed.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſilenced the whole argument, we might immediately proceed to the diſcuſſion of other points, without even declaring our opinion as to which of the ſuppoſitions may be right, on which it has been refuted; but we do not think ourſelves at liberty to do this. The preſent age would rejoice to find that the ſcriptures had no foundation, and would anxiouſly catch at the writings of him, who ſhould mention them in a doubtful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We ſhall therefore declare our ſentiments, by aſſerting that they are true, and that all mankind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever various their appearance, are derived from the ſame ſtock.</p>
                  <p>To prove this, we ſhall not produce thoſe innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, by which the ſcriptures have ſtood the teſt of ages, but advert to a ſingle fact. It is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal law, obſervable throughout the whole creation,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:019561_0116_0FAC02E8ADD65830"/>
                     <hi>that if two animals of a different ſpecies propagate, their offspring is unable to continue its own ſpecies.</hi> By this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable law, the different ſpecies are preſerved diſtinct; every poſſibility of confuſion is prevented, and the world is forbidden to be over-run by a race of monſters. Now, if we apply this law to thoſe of the human kind, who are ſaid to be of a diſtinct ſpecies from each other, it immediately fails. The <hi>mulattoe</hi> is as capable of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his own ſpecies as his father; a clear and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable proof, that the<note n="†" place="bottom">When America was firſt diſcovered, it was thought by ſome, that the ſcripture account of the creation was falſe, and that there were different ſpecies of men, becauſe they could never ſuppoſe that people, in ſo rude a ſtate as the Americans, could have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themſelves to that continent from any parts of the known world. This opinion however was refuted by the celebrated Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cooke, who ſhewed that the traject between the continents of Aſia and America, was as ſhort as ſome, which people in as rude a ſtate have been actually known to paſs. This affords an excellent caution againſt an ill-judged and haſty cenſure of the divine writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe every difficulty which may be ſtarted, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly cleared up.</note> ſcripture account of the creation is true, and that <q>God, who hath made the world, hath made of<note n="*" place="bottom">The divine writings, which aſſert that all men were derived from the <hi>ſame ſtock,</hi> ſhew alſo, in the ſame inſtance of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> p. 115, that ſome of them had changed their original complexion.</note> one blood all the nations of men that dwell on all the face of the earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this be the caſe, it will be ſaid that mankind were originally of one colour; and it will be aſked at the ſame time, what it is probable that the colour was, and how they came to aſſume ſo various an appearance? To each of theſe we ſhall make that reply, which we conceive to be the moſt rational.</p>
                  <p>As mankind were originally of the ſame ſtock, ſo it is evident that they were originally of the ſame colour. But how ſhall we attempt to aſcertain it? Shall we <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> ſay, that it was the ſame as that which we now find to be peculiar to ourſelves?—No—This would be a vain and partial conſideration, and would betray our
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:019561_0117_0FAC02E972088090"/>judgment to have ariſen from that falſe fondneſs, which habituates us to ſuppoſe, that every thing belonging to ourſelves is the perfecteſt and the beſt. Add to this, that we ſhould always be liable to a juſt reproof from every inhabitant of the globe, whoſe colour was differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from our own; becauſe he would juſtly ſay, that he had as good a right to imagine that his own was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive colour, as that of any other people.</p>
                  <p>How then ſhall we attempt to aſcertain it? Shall we look into the various climates of the earth, ſee the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that generally prevails in the inhabitants of each, and apply the rule? This will be certainly free from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and will afford us a better proſpect of ſucceſs: for as every particular diſtrict has its particular colour, ſo it is evident that the complexion of Noah and his ſons, from whom the reſt of the world were deſcended, was the ſame as that, which is peculiar to the country, which was the feat of their habitation. This, by ſuch a mode of deciſion, will be found a dark olive; a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful colour, and a juſt medium between white and black. That this was the primitive colour, is highly probable from the obſervations that have been made; and, if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, will afford a valuable leſſon to the Europeans, to be cautious how they deride thoſe of the oppoſite complexion, as there is great reaſon to preſume, <hi>that the pureſt<note n="*" place="bottom">The following are the grand colours diſcernible in mankind, between which there are many ſhades;

                  <p>We come now to the grand queſtion, which is, that if mankind were originally of this or any other colour, how came it to paſs, that they ſhould wear ſo various an appearance? We reply, as we have had occaſion to ſay before, either <hi>by the interpoſition of the Deity;</hi> or <hi>by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of certain cauſes, which have an effect upon the human frame, and have the power of changing it more or

                  </p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the Divine interpoſition, two epochs have been aſſigned, when this difference of colour has been imagined to have been ſo produced. The firſt is that, which has been related, when the curſe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on a branch of the poſterity of <hi>Ham.</hi> But this argument has been already refuted; for if the particular colour alluded to were aſſigned at this period, it was aſſigned to the deſcendants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe of his other brothers, and was therefore <hi>limited</hi> to the former. But the deſcendants of<note n="*" place="bottom">See note, p. 115. To this we may add, that the reſt of the deſcendants of <hi>Ham,</hi> as far as they can be traced, are now alſo black, as well as many of the deſcendants of <hi>Shem.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Cuſh,</hi> as we have ſhewn before, partook of the ſame colour; a clear proof, that it was neither aſſigned to them on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor at this period.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond epoch is that, when mankind were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed on the building of <hi>Babel.</hi> It has been thought, that both <hi>national features and colour</hi> might probably have been given them at this time, becauſe theſe would have aſſiſted the confuſion of language, by cauſing them to diſperſe into tribes, and would have united more firmly the individuals of each, after the diſperſion had taken place. But this is improbable: firſt, becauſe there is great reaſon to preſume that Moſes, who has mentioned the confuſion of language, would have mentioned theſe circumſtances alſo, if they had actually contributed to bring about ſo ſingular an event: ſecondly, becauſe the confuſion of language was ſufficient of itſelf to have accompliſhed this; and we cannot ſuppoſe that the Deity could have done any thing in vain: and thirdly, becauſe, if mankind had been diſperſed, each tribe in its peculiar hue, it is impoſſible to conceive, that they could have wandered and ſettled in ſuch a manner, as to exhibit that regular gradation of colour from the equator to the poles, ſo conſpicuous at the preſent day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="unknown:019561_0119_0FAC02EAF1C9AAA0"/>
Theſe are the only periods, which there has been even the ſhadow of a probability for aſſigning; and we may therefore conclude that the preceding obſervations, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch circumſtances as will appear in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent chapter, will amount to a demonſtration, that the difference of colour was never cauſed by any interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deity, and that it muſt have proceeded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from that <hi>incidental co-operation of cauſes,</hi> which has been before related.</p>
                  <p>What theſe cauſes are, it is out of the power of human wiſdom poſitively to aſſert: there are facts; however, which, if properly weighed and put together, will throw conſiderable light upon the ſubject. Theſe we ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the peruſal of the reader, and ſhall deduce from them ſuch inferences only, as almoſt every perſon muſt make in his own mind, on their recital.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point, that occurs to be aſcertained, is, "What part of the ſkin is the ſeat of colour?" The old anatomiſts uſually divided the ſkin into two parts, or lamina; the exteriour and thinneſt, called by the Greeks <hi>Epidermis,</hi> by the Romans <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and hence by us <hi>Cuticle;</hi> and the interiour, called by the former <hi>Derma,</hi> and by the latter <hi>Cutis,</hi> or <hi>true ſkin.</hi> Hence they muſt neceſſarily have ſuppoſed, that, as the <hi>true ſkin</hi> was in every reſpect the ſame in all human ſubjects, however various their external hue, ſo the ſeat of colour muſt have exiſted in the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> or upper ſurface.</p>
                  <p>Malphigi, an eminent Italian phyſician, of the laſt century, was the firſt perſon who diſcovered that the ſkin was divided into three lamina, or parts; the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> the <hi>true ſkin,</hi> and a certain coagulated ſubſtance ſituated between both, which he diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>Mucoſum Corpus;</hi> a title retained by anatomiſts to the preſent day: which coagulated ſubſtance adhered ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> as, in all former anatomical preparations, to have come off with it, and, from this circumſtance, to have led the ancient anatomiſts to believe, that there were but two lamina, or diviſible portions in the human ſkin.</p>
                  <p>This diſcovery was ſufficient to aſcertain the point in queſtion: for it appeared afterwards that the <hi>Cuticle,</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:019561_0120_0FAC02EBAE3FDBE8"/>when divided according to this diſcovery from the other lamina, was ſemi-tranſparent; that the cuticle of the blackeſt negroe was of the ſame tranſparency and colour, as that of the pureſt white; and hence, the <hi>true ſkins</hi> of both being invariably the ſame, that the <hi>mucoſum corpus</hi> was the ſeat of colour.</p>
                  <p>This has been farther confirmed by all ſubſequent anatomical experiments, by which it appears, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the colour of this intermediate coagulated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, nearly the ſame is the apparent colour of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſurface of the ſkin. Neither can it be otherwiſe; for the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> from its tranſparency, muſt neceſſarily tranſmit the colour of the ſubſtance beneath it, in the ſame manner, though not in the ſame degree, as the <hi>cornea</hi> tranſmits the colour of the <hi>iris</hi> of the eye. This tranſparency is a matter of ocular demonſtration in white people. It is conſpicuous in every bluſh; for no one can imagine, that the cuticle becomes red, as often as this happens: nor is it leſs diſcoverable in the veins, which are ſo eaſy to be diſcerned; for no one can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the blue ſtreaks, which he conſtantly ſees in the faireſt complexons, are painted, as it were, on the ſurface of the upper ſkin. From theſe, and a variety of other<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſeaſes have a great effect upon the <hi>mucaſum corpus,</hi> but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the jaundice, which turns it yellow. Hence, being tranſmitted through the cuticle, the yellow appearance of the whole body.— But this, even as a matter of ocular demonſtration, is no confined ſolely to white people; negroes themſelves, while affected with theſe or other diſorders, changing their black colour for that which the diſeaſe ha, conveyed to the <hi>mucous</hi> ſubſtance.</note> obſervations, no maxim is more true in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology, than that <hi>on the mucoſum corpus depends the colour of the human body;</hi> or, in other words, that the <hi>mucoſum corpus</hi> being of a different colour in different inhabitants of the globe, and appearing through the cuticle or upper ſurface of the ſkin, gives them that various appearance, which ſtrikes us ſo forcibly in contemplating the human race.</p>
                  <p>As this can be incontrovertibly aſcertained, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:019561_0121_0FAC02EC6A110330"/>that whatever cauſes co-operate in producing this different appearance, they produce it by acting upon the <hi>mucoſum corpus,</hi> which, from the almoſt incredible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the<note n="*" place="bottom">The cutaneous pores are ſo exceſſively ſmall, that one grain of ſand, (according to Dr. Lewenhoeck's culculations) would cover many hundreds of them.</note> cuticle is perforated, is as acceſſible as the cuticle itſelf. Theſe cauſes are probably thoſe various qualities of things, which, combined with the influence of the ſun, contribute to form what we call <hi>climate.</hi> For when any perſon conſiders, that the mucous ſubſtance, before-mentioned, is found to vary in its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as the <hi>climates</hi> vary from the equator to the poles, his mind muſt be inſtantly ſtruck with the hypotheſis, and he muſt adopt it without any heſitation, as the genuine cauſe of the phaenomenon.</p>
                  <p>This fact,<note n="†" place="bottom">We do not mean to inſinuate that the ſame people have their <hi>corpus mucoſum</hi> ſenſibly vary, as often as they go into another latitude, but that the fact is true only of different people, who have been long eſtabliſhed in different latitudes.</note>
                     <hi>of the variation of the mucous ſubſtance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſituation of the place,</hi> has been clearly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the numerous anatomical experiments that have been made; in which, ſubjects of all nations have come under conſideration. The natives of many of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Iſles of <hi>Aſia,</hi> are found to have their <hi>corpus mucoium</hi> black. Thoſe of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſituated near the line, of the ſame colour. Thoſe of the maritime parts of the ſame continent, of a duſky brown, nearly approaching to it; and the colour becomes lighter or darker in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the diſtance from the equator is either greater or leſs. The Europeans are the faireſt inhabitants of the world. Thoſe ſituated in the moſt ſouthern regions of <hi>Europe,</hi> have in their <hi>corpus mucoſum</hi> a tinge of the dark hue of their <hi>African</hi> neighbours: hence the epidemick complexion, prevalent among them, is nearly of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the pickled Spaniſh olive; while in this country, and thoſe ſituated nearer the north pole, it appears to be nearly, if not abſolutely, white.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="unknown:019561_0122_0FAC02EE2FE50838"/>
Theſe are<note n="*" place="bottom">We beg leave to return our thanks here to a gentleman, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the medical line, who furniſhed us with the abovementioned facts.</note> facts, which anatomy has eſtabliſhed; and we acknowledge them to be ſuch, that we cannot diveſt ourſelves of the idea, that <hi>climate</hi> has a conſiderable ſhare in producing a difference of colour. Others, we know, have invented other hypotheſes, but all of them have been inſtantly refuted, as unable to explain the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties for which they were advanced, and as abſolutely contrary to fact: and the inventors themſelves have been obliged, almoſt as ſoon as they have propoſed them, to acknowledge them deficient.</p>
                  <p>The only objection of any conſequence, that has ever been made to the hypotheſis of <hi>climate,</hi> is this, <hi>that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the ſame parellels are not exactly of the ſame colour.</hi> But this is no objection in fact: for it does not follow that thoſe countries, which are at an equal diftance from the equator, ſhould have their climates the ſame. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing is more contrary to experience than this. Climate depends upon a variety of accidents. High mountains, in the neighbourhood of a place, make it cooler, by chilling the air that is carried over them by the winds. Large ſpreading ſucculent plants, if among the productions of the ſoil, have the ſame effect: they afford agreeable cooling ſhades, and a moiſt atmoſphere from their continual exhalations, by which the ardour of the ſun is conſiderably abated. While the ſoil, on the other hand, if of a ſandy nature, retains the heat in an uncommon degree, and makes the ſummers conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hotter than thoſe which are found to exiſt in the ſame latitude, where the ſoil is different. To this prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imity of what may be termed <hi>burning ſands,</hi> and to the ſulphurous and metallick particles, which are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhaling from the bowels of the earth, is aſcribed the different degree of blackneſs, by which ſome <hi>African</hi> nations are diſtinguiſhable from each other, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame parallels. To theſe obſervations, we may
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:019561_0123_0FAC02EEB7145B68"/>add, that though the inhabitants of the ſame parallel are not exactly of the ſame hue, yet they differ only by ſhades of the ſame colour; or, to ſpeak with more preciſion, that there are no two people, in ſuch a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, one of whom is white, and the other black. To ſum up the whole—Suppoſe we were to take a common globe; to begin at the equator; to paint every country along the meridian line in ſucceſſion from thence to the poles; and to paint them with the ſame colour which prevails in the reſpective inhabitants of each, we ſhould ſee the black, with which we had been obliged to begin, inſenſibly changing to an olive, and the olive, through as many intermediate colours, to a white: and if, on the other hand, we ſhould complete any one of the parallels according to the ſame plan, we ſhould ſee a difference perhaps in the appearance of ſome of the countries through which it ran, though the difference would conſiſt wholly in ſhades of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>The argument therefore, which is brought againſt the hypotheſis, is ſo far from being an objection, that we ſhall conſider it as one of the firſt arguments in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: for if <hi>climate</hi> has really an influence on the <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſubſtance</hi> of the body, it is evident, that we muſt not only expect to ſee a gradation of colour in the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants from the equator to the poles, but alſo<note n="*" place="bottom">Suppoſe we were to ſee two nations, contiguous to each other, of black and white inhabitants in the ſame parallel, even this would be no objection, for many circumſtances are to be conſidered. A black people may have wandered into a white, and a white people into a black latitude, and they may not have been ſettled there a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient length of time for ſuch a change to have been accompliſhed in their complexion, as that they ſhould be like the old eſtabliſhed inhabitants of the parallel, into which they have lately come.</note> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhades of the ſame colour in the inhabitants of the ſame parallel.</p>
                  <p>To this argument, we ſhall add one that is incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible, which is, that when the <hi>black</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Africa</hi> are tranſplanted to <hi>colder,</hi> or the <hi>white</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>hotter</hi> climates, their children, <hi>born there,</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="unknown:019561_0124_0FAC02EF6FAEBDC8"/>are of a <hi>different colour from themſelves;</hi> that is, lighter in the firſt, and darker in the ſecond inſtance.</p>
                  <p>As a proof of the firſt, we ſhall give the words of the Abbé Raynal, in his admired publication.<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtamond's Abbé Raynal, v. 5. p. 193.</note> 
                     <q>The children," ſays he, "which they, (the <hi>Africans</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create in <hi>America,</hi> are not ſo black as their parents were. After each generation the difference becomes more palpable. It is poſſible, that after a numerous ſucceſſion of generations, the men come from <hi>Africa</hi> would not be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the country, into which they may have been tranſplanted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This circumſtance we have had the pleaſure of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by a variety of perſons, who have been witneſſes of the fact; but particularly by many<note n="†" place="bottom">The author of this Eſſay made it his buſineſs to inquire of the moſt intelligent of thoſe, whom he could meet with in London, as to the authenticity of the fact. All thoſe from <hi>America</hi> aſſured him that it was ſtrictly true; thoſe from the Weſt-Indies, that they had never obſerved it there; but that they had found a ſenſible differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in themſelves ſince they came to England.</note> intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Africans, who have been parents themſelves in <hi>America,</hi> and who have declared that the difference is ſo palpable in the <hi>northern provinces,</hi> that not only they themſelves have conſtantly obſerved it, but that they have heard it obſerved by others.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this variation in the children from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their parents improbable. <hi>The children of the blackeſt Africans are</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">This circumſtance, which always happens, ſhews that they are deſcended from the ſame parents as ourſelves; for had they been a diſtinct ſpecies of men, and the blackneſs entirely ingrafted in their conſtitution and frame, there is great reaſon to preſume, that their children would have been born <hi>black.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>born white.</hi> In this ſtate they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for about a month, when they change to a pale yellow. In proceſs of time they become brown. Their ſkin ſtill continues to increaſe in darkneſs with their age, till it becomes of a dirty, ſallow black, and at length, after a certain period of years, gloſſy and ſhining. Now, if climate has any influence on the <hi>mucous ſubſtance</hi> of
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:019561_0125_0FAC02F031B94F20"/>the body, this variation in the children from the colour of their parents is an event, which muſt be reaſonably expected: for being born white, and not having equally powerful cauſes to act upon them in colder, as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had in the hotter climates which they left, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the ſame effect cannot poſſibly be produced.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo, if the hypotheſis be admitted, may be deduced the reaſon, why even thoſe children, who have been brought from their country at an early age into cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er regions, have been<note n="*" place="bottom">This obſervation was communicated to us by the gentleman in the medical line, to whom we returned our thanks for certain anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical facts.</note> obſerved to be of a lighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour than thoſe who have remained at home till they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at a ſtate of manhood. For having undergone ſome of the changes which we mentioned to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their countrymen from infancy to a certain age, and having been taken away before the reſt could be completed, theſe farther changes, which would have taken place had they remained at home, ſeem either to have been checked in their progreſs, or weakened in their degree, by a colder climate.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the ſecond and oppoſite caſe; for a proof of which we ſhall appeal to the words of Dr. Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions.<note n="†" place="bottom">Philoſ. Tranſ. No. 476. ſect. 4.</note> 
                     <q>The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> who have inhabited <hi>America</hi> under the torrid zone for any time, are become as dark coloured as our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> of which, <hi>I myſelf have been a witneſs;</hi> and were they not to intermarry with the <hi>Europeans,</hi> but lead the ſame rude and barbarous lives with the <hi>Indians,</hi> it is very probable that, in a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many generations, they would become as dark in complexion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this inſtance we ſhall add one, which is mentioned by a<note n="†" place="bottom">Treatiſe upon the Trade from Great Britain to Africa, by an African merchant.</note> late writer, who deſcribing the <hi>African</hi> coaſt, and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:019561_0126_0FAC02F0F015A588"/>the <hi>European</hi> ſettlements there, has the following paſſage. <q>There are ſeveral other ſmall <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſettlements, and one of ſome note at <hi>Mitomba,</hi> a river in <hi>Sierra Leon.</hi> The people here called <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally perſons bred from a mixture of the firſt <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe diſcoverers</hi> with the natives, and now become, in their <hi>complexion</hi> and <hi>woolly quality</hi> of their hair, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect negroes,</hi> retaining however a ſmattering of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> language.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe facts, with reſpect to the coloniſts of the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi> are of the higheſt importance in the preſent caſe, and deſerve a ſerious attention. For when we know to a certainty from whom they are deſcended; when we know that they were, at the time of their tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the ſame colour as thoſe from whom they ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſprung; and when, on the other hand, we are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that they have changed it for the native colour of the place which they now inhabit; the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſupport of theſe facts is as great, as if a perſon, on the removal of two or three families into another climate, had determined to aſcertain the circumſtance; as if he had gone with them and watched their children; as if he had communicated his obſervations at his death to a ſucceſſor; as if his ſucceſſor had proſecuted the plan, and thus an uninterrupted chain of evidence had been kept up from their firſt removal to any determined period of ſucceeding time.</p>
                  <p>But though theſe facts ſeem ſufficient of themſelves to confirm our opinion, they are not the only facts which can be adduced in its ſupport. It can be ſhewn, that the members of the <hi>very ſame family,</hi> when divided from each other, and removed into different countries, have not only changed their family complexion, but that they have changed it to <hi>as many different colours</hi> as they have gone into <hi>different regions of the world.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, perhaps, a more ſtriking inſtance of this, than in the <hi>Jews.</hi> Theſe people are ſcattered over the face of the whole earth.

Now, as they were undoubtedly ſettled there, and as they were neither ſo totally deſtroyed, nor made any ſuch rapid conqueſts, as that hiſtory ſhould notice the event, there is great reaſon to preſume, that their deſcendants continued in the ſame, or ſettled in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent country; from whence it will follow, that they muſt have changed their complexion to that, which is obſervable in the inhabitants of this particular region at the preſent day; or, in other words, that the <hi>black in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant

                  <p>As we have now ſhewn it to be highly probable, from the facts which have been advanced, that climate is the cauſe of the difference of colour which prevails in the different inhabitants of the globe, we ſhall now ſhew its probability from ſo ſimilar an effect produced on the <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſubſtance</hi> before-mentioned by ſo ſimilar a cauſe, that though the fact does not abſolutely prove our conjecture to be right, yet it will give us a very lively conception of the manner, in which the phaenomenon may be cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>This probability may be ſhewn in the caſe of <hi>freckles,</hi> which are to be ſeen in the face of children, but of ſuch only, as have the thinneſt and moſt tranſparent ſkins, and are occaſioned by the rays of the ſun, ſtriking forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibly on the <hi>mucous ſubſtance</hi> of the face, and drying the accumulating fluid. This accumulating fluid, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirable matter, is at firſt colourleſs; but being expoſed to violent heat, or dried, becomes brown. Hence, the <hi>mucoſum corpus</hi> being tinged in various parts by this brown coagulated fluid, and the parts ſo tinged appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ticle,</hi> or upper ſurface of the ſkin, ariſes that ſpotted appearance, obſervable in the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we were to conceive a black ſkin to be an <hi>univerſal freckle,</hi> or the rays of the ſun to act ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally on the <hi>mucous ſubſtance</hi> of a perſon's face, as to produce theſe ſpots ſo contiguous to each other that they ſhould unite, we ſhould then ſee, in imagination, a face ſimilar to thoſe, which are daily to be ſeen among black people: and if we were to conceive his body to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:019561_0129_0FAC02F677AB6760"/>poſed or acted upon in the ſame manner, we ſhould then ſee his body aſſuming a ſimilar appearance; and thus we ſhould ſee the whole man of a perfect black, or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling one of the naked inhabitants of the torrid zone. Now as the ſeat of freckles and of blackneſs is the ſame; as their appearance is ſimilar; and as the cauſe of the firſt is the ardour of the ſun, it is therefore probable that the cauſe of the ſecond is the ſame: hence, if we ſubſtitute for the word <hi>"ſun,"</hi> what is analogous to it, the word <hi>climate,</hi> the ſame effect may be ſuppoſed to be produced, and the conjecture to receive a ſanction.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it unlikely that the hypotheſis, which conſiders the cauſe of freckles and of blackneſs as the ſame, may be right. For if blackneſs is occaſioned by the rays of the ſun ſtriking forcibly and univerſally on the <hi>mucous ſubſtance</hi> of the body, and drying the accumulating fluid, we can account for the different degrees of it to be found in the different inhabitants of the globe. For as the quantity of perſpirable fluid, and the force of the ſolar rays is ſucceſſively increaſed, as the climates are ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively warmer, from any given parallel to the line, it follows that the fluid, with which the <hi>mucous ſubſtance</hi> will be ſtained, will be ſucceſſively thicker and deeper coloured; and hence, as it appears through the cuticle, the complexion ſucceſſively darker; or, what amounts to the ſame thing, there will be a difference of colour in the inhabitants of every ſucceſſive parallel.</p>
                  <p>From theſe, and the whole of the preceding obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ſubject, we may conclude, that as all the inhabitants of the earth cannot be otherwiſe than the children of the ſame parents, and as the difference of their appearance muſt have of courſe proceeded from incidental cauſes, theſe cauſes are a combination of thoſe qualities, which we call <hi>climate;</hi> that the blackneſs of the <hi>Africans</hi> is ſo far ingraſted in their conſtitution, in a courſe of many generations, that their children wholly inherit it, if brought up in the ſame ſpot, but that it is not ſo abſolutely interwoven in their nature, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed, if they are born and ſettled in another; that <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſons were probably of an <hi>olive</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:019561_0130_0FAC02F84AA48C60"/>that thoſe of their deſcendants, who went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſouth, became of a deeper olive or <hi>copper;</hi> while thoſe, who went ſtill farther, became of a deeper copper or <hi>black;</hi> that thoſe, on the other hand, who travelled farther to the north, became leſs olive or <hi>brown,</hi> while thoſe who went ſtill farther than the former, became leſs brown or <hi>white;</hi> and that if any man were to point out any one of the colours which prevails in the human complexion, as likely to furniſh an argument, that the people of ſuch a complexion were of a different ſpecies from the reſt, it is probable that his own deſcendants, if removed to the climate to which this complexion is peculiar, would, in the courſe of a few generations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>Having now replied to the argument, <q>that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature,</q> as far as it depended on their <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>colour,</hi> we ſhall now only take notice of an expreſſion, which the <hi>receivers</hi> before-mentioned are pleaſed to make uſe of, <q>that they are made for ſlavery.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had the Africans been <hi>made for ſlavery,</hi> or to become the property of any ſociety of men, it is clear, from the obſervations that have been made in the ſecond part of this Eſſay, that they muſt have been created <hi>devoid of reaſon:</hi> but this is contrary to fact. It is clear alſo, that there muſt have been many and evident ſigns of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriority of their nature,</hi> and that this ſociety of men muſt have had a <hi>natural right</hi> to their dominion: but this is equally falſe. No ſuch ſigns of <hi>inferiority</hi> are to be found in the one, and the right to dominion in the other is <hi>incidental:</hi> for in what volume of nature or religion is it written, that one ſociety of men ſhould <hi>breed ſlaves</hi> for the benefit of another? Nor is it leſs evident that they would have wanted many of thoſe qualities which they have, and which brutes have not: they would have wanted that <hi>ſpirit of liberty,</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">There are a particular people among thoſe tranſported from Africa to the colonies, who immediately on receiving puniſhment, deſtroy themſelves. This is a fact which the <hi>receivers</hi> are unable to contradict.</note>
                     <hi>ſenſe of ignominy and
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:019561_0131_0FAC02F86D38B8A0"/>ſhame,</hi> which ſo frequently drives them to the horrid extremity of finiſhing their own exiſtence. Nor would they have been endowed with a <hi>contemplative power;</hi> for ſuch a power would have been unneceſſary to people in ſuch a ſituation; or rather, its only uſe could have been to increaſe their pain. We cannot ſuppoſe therefore that God has made an order of beings, with ſuch mental qualities and powers, for the ſole purpoſe of being uſed as <hi>beaſts,</hi> or <hi>inſtruments</hi> of labour. And here, what a dreadful argument preſents itſelf againſt you <hi>receivers?</hi> For if they have no underſtandings as you confeſs, then is your conduct impious, becauſe, as they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the intention of your puniſhment, your ſeverities cannot make them better. But if, on the other hand, they have had underſtandings, (which has evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared) then is your conduct equally impious, who, by deſtroying their faculties by the ſeverity of your diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, have reduced men, who had once the power of reaſon, to an equality with the brute creation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <p>The reader may perhaps think, that the <hi>receivers</hi> have by this time expended all their arguments, but their ſtore is not ſo eaſily exhauſted. They are well aware that juſtice, nature, and religion, will continue, as they have ever uniformly done, to oppoſe their conduct.— This has driven them to exert their ingenuity, and has occaſioned that multiplicity of arguments to be found in the preſent queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe arguments are of a different complexion from the former. They conſiſt in comparing the ſtate of <hi>ſlaves</hi> with that of ſome of the claſſes of <hi>free</hi> men, and in certain ſcenes of felicity, which the former are ſaid to enjoy.</p>
                  <p>It is affirmed that the puniſhments which the Africans undergo, are leſs ſevere than the military; that their life is happier than that of the Engliſh peaſant; that they have the advantages of manumiſſion; that they have
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:019561_0132_0FAC02FC0319D2C0"/>their little ſpots of ground, their holy-days, their dances; in ſhort, that their life is a ſcene of feſtivity and mirth, and that they are much happier in the colonies than in their own country.</p>
                  <p>Theſe repreſentations, which have been made out with much ingenuity and art, may have had their weight with the unwary; but they will never paſs with men of conſideration and ſenſe, who are accuſtomed to eſtimate the probability of things, before they admit them to be true. Indeed the bare aſſertion, that their ſituation is even comfortable, contains its own refutation, or at leaſt leads us to ſuſpect that the perſon, who aſſerted it, has omitted ſome important conſiderations in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Such we ſhall ſhew to have been actually the caſe, and that the repreſentations of the <hi>receivers,</hi> when ſtripped of their gloſſy ornaments, are but empty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, firſt, of <hi>military puniſhments,</hi> that they are more ſevere than thoſe which the <hi>Africans</hi> undergo.— But this is a bare aſſertion without a proof. It is not ſhewn even by thoſe, who aſſert it, how the fact can be made out. We are left therefore to draw the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ourſelves, and to fill up thoſe important conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we have juſt ſaid that the <hi>receivers</hi> had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>That military puniſhments are ſevere we confeſs, but we deny that they are ſeverer than thoſe with which they are compared. Where is the military man, whoſe ears have been ſlit, whoſe limbs have been mutilated, or whoſe eyes have been beaten out? But let us even allow, that their puniſhments are equal in the degree of their ſeverity: ſtill they muſt loſe by compariſon. The ſoldier is never puniſhed but after a fair and equitable trial, and the deciſion of a military court; the unhappy African, at the diſcertion of his Lord. The one<note n="*" place="bottom">The articles of war are frequently read at the head of every regiment in the ſervice, ſtating thoſe particular actions which are to be conſidered as crimes.</note> knows what particular conduct will conſtitute an offence; the other
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:019561_0133_0FAC02FDD3466ED8"/>has no ſuch information, as he is wholly at the diſpoſal of paſſion and caprice, which may impoſe upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however laudable, the appellation of a crime. The former has it of courſe in his power to avoid a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the latter is never ſafe. The former is puniſhed for a real, the latter, often, for an imaginary falt.</p>
                  <p>Now will any perſon affert, on comparing the whole of thoſe circumſtances together, which relate to their reſpective puniſhments, that there can be any doubt, which of the two are in the worſt ſituation, as to their penal ſyſtems?</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the declaration, that the life of an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> in the colonies is happier than that of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> peaſant, it is equally falſe. Indeed we can ſcarcely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our indignation, when we conſider, how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſituation of this latter claſs of men has been miſrepreſented, to elevate the former to a ſtate of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious happineſs. If the repreſentations of the <hi>receivers</hi> be true, it is evident that thoſe of the moſt approved writers, who have placed a conſiderable ſhare of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the <hi>cottage,</hi> have been miſtaken in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that thoſe of the rich, who have been heard to ſigh, and envy the felicity of the <hi>peaſant,</hi> have been treacherous to their own ſenſations.</p>
                  <p>But which are we to believe on the occaſion? Thoſe, who endeavour to dreſs <hi>vice</hi> in the habit of <hi>virtue,</hi> or thoſe, who derive their opinion from their own feelings? The latter are ſurely to be believed; and we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that the horrid picture which is given of the life of the <hi>peaſant,</hi> has not ſo juſt a foundation as the <hi>receivers</hi> would lead us to ſuppoſe. For has he no pleaſure in the thought, that he lives in his <hi>own country,</hi> and among his relations and friends? That he is actually <hi>free,</hi> and that his children will be the ſame? That he can never be <hi>ſold</hi> as a beaſt? That he can ſpeak his mind <hi>without the fear of the laſh?</hi> That he cannot even be ſtruck <hi>with impunity?</hi> And that he partakes, equally with his ſuperiours, of the <hi>protection of the law?</hi>—Now, there is no one of theſe advantages which the <hi>African</hi> poſſeſſes, and no one, which the deſenders of ſlavery take into their account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="unknown:019561_0134_0FAC0300B47054E8"/>
Of the other compariſons that are uſually made, we may obſerve in general, that, as they conſiſt in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the iniquitous practice of ſlavery with other iniquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices in force among other nations, they can neither raiſe it to the appearance of virtue, nor exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate its guilt. The things compared are in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances both of them evils alike. They call equally for redreſs, and are equally diſgraceful to the<note n="*" place="bottom">We cannot omit here to mention one of the cuſtoms, which has been often brought as a palliation of ſlavery, and which prevailed but a little time ago, and we are doubtful whether it does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail now, in the metropolis of this country, of kidnapping men for the ſervice of the Eaſt-India Company. Every ſubject, as long as he behaves well, has a right to the protection of government; and the tacit permiſſion of ſuch a ſcene of iniquity, when it becomes known, is as much a breach of duty in government, as the conduct of thoſe ſubjects, who, on other occaſions, would be termed, and puniſhed as, rebellious.</note> governments which ſuffer them, if not encourage them, to exiſt. To attempt therefore to juſtify one ſpecies of iniquity, by comparing it with another, is no juſtification at all; and is ſo far from anſwering the purpoſe, for which the compariſon is intended, as to give us reaſon to ſuſpect, that the <hi>comparer</hi> has but little notion either of equity or honour.</p>
                  <p>We come now to thoſe ſcenes of felicity, which ſlaves are ſaid to enjoy. The firſt advantage which they are ſaid to experience, is that of <hi>manumiſſion.</hi> But here the advocates for ſlavery conceal an important circumſtance. They expatiate indeed on the charms of freedom, and contend that it muſt be a bleſſing in the eyes of thoſe, upon whom it is conferred. We perfectly agree with them in this particular. But they do not tell us that theſe advantages are <hi>confined;</hi> that they are confined to ſome <hi>favourite domeſtick;</hi> that not <hi>one in an hundred</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them; and that they are <hi>never</hi> extended to thoſe, who are employed in the <hi>cultivation of the field,</hi> as long as they can work. Theſe are they, who are moſt to be pitied, who are deſtined to <hi>perpetual</hi> drudgery; and of whom <hi>no one whatever</hi> has a chance of being freed from
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:019561_0135_0FAC03016E7B1BE0"/>his ſituation, till death either releaſes him at once, or age renders him incapable of continuing his former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And here let it be remarked, <hi>to the diſgrace of the receivers,</hi> that he is then made free, not—<hi>as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his paſt ſervices,</hi> but, as his labour is then of little or no value,—<hi>to ſave the</hi>

                  <p>With the ſame artiſice is mention alſo made of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpots, or <hi>gardens,</hi> as they are called, which ſlaves are ſaid to poſſeſs from the <hi>liberality</hi> of <hi>the reccivers.</hi> But peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt not be led away by agreeable and pleaſant ſounds. They muſt not ſuppoſe that theſe gardens are made for <hi>flowers;</hi> or that they are places of <hi>amuſement,</hi> in which they can ſpend their time in botanical reſearches and delights.

Hence it appears, that the <hi>receivers</hi> have no merit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in ſuch an appropriation of land to their unfortunate ſlaves: for they are either under the neceſſity of doing this, or of <hi>loſing</hi> them by the jaws of famine. And it is a notorious fact, that, with their weekly allowance, and the produce of their ſpots together, it is often with the greateſt difficulty that they preſerve a wretched ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
                  <p>The third advantage which they are ſaid to experience, is that of <hi>holy-days,</hi> or days of reſpite from their uſual diſcipline and fatigue. This is certainly a great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:019561_0136_0FAC030228ED9D88"/>and ought to be recorded to the immortal honour of the <hi>receivers.</hi> We wiſh we could expreſs their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in thoſe handſome terms, in which it deſerves to be repreſented, or applaud them ſufficiently for deviating for once from the rigours of ſervile diſcipline. But we confeſs, that we are unequal to the taſk, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore content ourſelves with obſerving, that while the horſe has <hi>one</hi> day in <hi>ſeven</hi> to refreſh his limbs, the happy <hi>African</hi> has but <hi>one</hi> in<note n="*" place="bottom">They are allowed in general three holy-days at Chriſtmas, but in Jamaica they have two alſo at Eaſter, and two at Whitſuntide: ſo that on largeſt ſcale, they have only ſeven days in a year, or one day in fifty-two. But this is on a ſuppoſition, that the receivers do not break in upon the afternoons, which they are frequently too apt to do. If it ſhould be ſaid that Sunday is an holy-day, it is not true; it is ſo far an holy-day, that they do not work for their maſters; but ſuch an holy-day, that if they do not employ it in the cultivation of their little ſpots, they muſt be <hi>ſtarved.</hi>

                  <p>With reſpect to their <hi>dances,</hi> on which ſuch a particular ſtreſs has been generally laid, we fear that people may have been as ſhamefully deceived, as in the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. For from the manner in which theſe are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mentioned, we ſhould almoſt be led to imagine, that they had certain hours allowed them for the purpoſe of joining in the dance, and that they had every comfort and convenience, that the people are generally ſuppoſed to enjoy on ſuch convivial occaſions. But this is far from the caſe. Reaſon informs us, that it can never be. If they wiſh for ſuch innocent recreations, they muſt enjoy them in the time that is allotted them for ſleep; and ſo far are theſe dances from proceeding from any uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon degree of happineſs, which excites them to convivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſociety, that they proceed rather from an uncommon depreſſion of ſpirits, which makes them even ſacrifice their<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe dances are uſually in the middle of the night; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous are theſe unfortunate people of obtaining but a joyful hour, that they not only often give up their ſleep, but add to the labours of the day, by going ſeveral miles to obtain it.</note> reſt, for the ſake of experiencing for a moment
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:019561_0137_0FAC0302F79C4460"/>a more joyful oblivion of their cares. For ſuppoſe any one of the <hi>receivers,</hi> in the middle of a dance, were to addreſs his ſlaves in the following manner: <q>
                        <hi>Africans!</hi> I begin at laſt to feel for your ſituation; and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſeverely hurt, whenever I reflect that I have been reducing thoſe to a ſtate of miſery and pain, who have never given me offence. You ſeem to be fond of theſe exerciſes, but yet you are obliged to take them at ſuch unſeaſonable hours, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair your health, which is ſufficiently broken by the intolerable ſhare of labour which I have hitherto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon you, I will therefore make you a propoſal.

Which makes them motionleſs in an inſtant? Which interrupts the feſtive ſcene?—their country? —tranſporting ſound!—Behold! they are now flying from the dance: you may ſee them running to the ſhore, and, frantick as it were with joy, demanding with open arms an inſtantaneous paſſage to their beloved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive plains.</p>
                  <p>Such are the <hi>colonial delights,</hi> by the repreſentation of which the <hi>receivers</hi> would perſuade us, that the <hi>Africans</hi> are taken from their country to a region of conviviality and mirth; and that like thoſe, who leave their uſual places of reſidence for a ſummer's amuſement, they are conveyed to the colonies—<hi>to bathe,—to dance,—to keep holy-day,—to be jovial.</hi>—But there is ſomething ſo truly ridiculous in the attempt to impoſe theſe ſcenes of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city on the publick, as ſcenes which fall to the lot of ſlaves, that the <hi>receivers</hi> muſt have been driven to great extremities, to hazard them to the eye of cenſure.</p>
                  <p>The laſt point that remains to be conſidered, is the ſhameful aſſertion, that the <hi>Africans</hi> are much <hi>happier in the colonies, than in their own country.</hi> But in what does this ſuperiour happineſs conſiſt? In thoſe real ſcenes, it muſt be replied, which have been juſt mentioned; for theſe, by the confeſſion of the receivers, conſtitute the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:019561_0138_0FAC0303B1400840"/>happineſs they enjoy.—But it has been ſhewn that theſe have been unfairly repreſented; and, were they realized in the moſt extenſive latitude, they would not confirm the fact. For if, upon a recapitulation, it conſiſts in the pleaſure of <hi>manumiſſion, they</hi> ſurely muſt have paſſed their lives in a much more comfortable manner, who like the <hi>Africans at home,</hi> have had no occaſion for ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit at all. But the <hi>receivers,</hi> we preſume, reaſon upon this principle, that we never know the value of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing but by its loſs. This is generally true: but would any one of them make himſelf a <hi>ſlave</hi> for years, that he might run the chance of the pleaſures of <hi>manumiſſion?</hi> Or that he might taſte the charms of liberty with <hi>a greater reliſh?</hi> Nor is the aſſertion leſs falſe in every other conſideration. For if their happineſs conſiſts in the few <hi>holy days,</hi> which <hi>in the colonies</hi> they are permitted to enjoy what muſt be their ſituation <hi>in their own country,</hi> where the whole year is but one continued holy-day, or ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from diſcipline and fatigue?—If in the poſſeſſion <hi>of a mean and contracted ſpot,</hi> what muſt be their ſituation, where a whole region is their own, producing almoſt ſpontaneouſly the comforts of life, and requiring for its cultivation none of thoſe hours, which ſhould be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to <hi>ſleep?</hi>—If in the pleaſures of the <hi>colonial dance,</hi> what muſt it be in <hi>their own country,</hi> where they may dance for ever; where there is no ſtated hour to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their felicity, no intolerable labour immediately to ſucceed their recreations, and no overſeer to receive them under the diſcipline of the laſh?—If theſe therefore are the only circumſtances, by which the aſſertion can be proved, we may venture to ſay, without fear of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that it can never be proved at all.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are not the only circumſtances. It is ſaid that they are barbarous at home.—But do you <hi>receivers</hi> civilize them?—Your unwillingneſs to convert them to Chriſtianity, becauſe you ſuppoſe you muſt uſe them more kindly when converted, is but a bad argument in favour of the fact.</p>
                  <p>It is affirmed again, that their manner of life, and their ſituation is ſuch in their own country, that to ſay
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:019561_0139_0FAC03049200FE58"/>they are happy is a jeſt. <q>

That ſtate which each man, under the guidance of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, forms for himſelf, and not one man for another? To know what conſtitutes mine or your happineſs, is the ſole prerogative of him who created us, and caſt us in ſo various and different moulds Did your ſlaves ever complain to you of their unhappineſs, amidſt their native woods and deſarts?

                  <p>But ſince you ſpeak with ſo much confidence on the ſubject, let us aſk you <hi>receivers</hi> again, if you have ever been informed by your unfortunate ſlaves, that they had no connexions in the country from which they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly been torn away: or, if you will take upon you to aſſert, that they never ſigh, when they are alone; or that they never relate to each other their tales of miſery and woe. But you judge of them, perhaps, in an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py moment, when you are dealing out to them their proviſions for the week; and are but little aware, that, though the countenance may be cheered with a moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſmile, the heart may be exquiſitely tortured. Were you to ſhew us, indeed, that there are laws, ſubject to no evaſion, by which you are obliged to clothe and feed them in a comfortable manner; were you to ſhew us

                  <p>But we ſhall now mention a circumſtance, which, in the preſent caſe, will have more weight than all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which have hitherto been advanced. It is an opinion, which the <hi>Africans</hi> univerſally entertain, that, as ſoon as death ſhall releaſe them from the hands of their oppreſſors, they ſhall immediately be wafted back to their native plains, there to exiſt again, to enjoy the ſight of their beloved countrymen, and to ſpend the whole of their new exiſtence in ſcenes of tranquillity and delight: and ſo powerfully does this notion operate upon them, as to drive them frequently to the horrid extremity of putting a period to their lives. Now if theſe ſuicides are frequent, (which no perſon can deny) what are they but a proof, that the ſituation of thoſe who deſtroy themſelves muſt have been inſupportably wretched: and if the thought of returning to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try after death, <hi>when they have experienced the colonial joys,</hi> conſtitutes their ſupreme felicity, what are they but a proof, that they think there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two ſituations, as there is between miſery and delight?</p>

                     <pb n="144" facs="unknown:019561_0141_0FAC0305ED0FA500"/>
Nor is the aſſertion of the <hi>receivers</hi> leſs liable to a refutation in the inſtance of thoſe, who terminate their own exiſtence, than of thoſe, whom nature releaſes from their perſecutions. They die with a ſmile upon their face, and their funerals are attended by a vaſt concourſe of their countrymen, with every poſſible<note n="*" place="bottom">A negroe-funeral is conſidered as a curious ſight, and is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſinging, dancing, muſick, and every circumſtance that can ſhew the attendants to be happy on the occaſion.</note> demouſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of joy. But why this unuſual mirth, if their departed brother has left an happy place? Or if he has been taken from the care of an indulgent maſter, who conſulted his pleaſures, and adminiſtered to his wants? But alas, it ariſes from hence, that <hi>he has gone to his happy country:</hi> a circumſtance, ſufficient of itſelf, to ſilence a myriad of thoſe ſpecious arguments, which the imagination has been racked, and will always be racked to produce, in favour of a ſyſtem of tyranny and oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>It remains only, that we ſhould now conclude the chapter with a fact, which will ſhew that the account, which we have given of the ſituation of ſlaves, is ſtrictly true, and will refute at the ſame time all the arguments which have hitherto been, and may yet be brought by the <hi>receivers,</hi> to prove that their treatment is humane. In one of the weſtern colonies of the Europeans,<note n="†" place="bottom">In 96 years, ending in 1774, 800,000 ſlaves had been imported into the French part of St. Domingo, of which there remained only 290,000 in 1774. Of this laſt number only 140,000 were creoles, or natives of the iſland, i. e. of 650,000 ſlaves, the whole poſterity were 140,000. <hi>Conſiderations ſur la Colonie de St. Domingue,</hi> publiſhed by authority in 1777.</note> ſix hundred and fifty thouſand ſlaves were imported within an hundred years; at the expiration of which time, their whole poſterity were found to amount to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty thouſand. This fact will aſcertain the treatment of itſelf. For how ſhamefully muſt theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate people have been oppreſſed? What a dreadful havock muſt famine, fatigue, and cruelty, have made among them, when we conſider, that the deſcendants
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:019561_0142_0FAC0306B13EE348"/>of <hi>ſix hundred and fifty thouſand</hi> people in the prime of life, gradually imported within a century, are leſs nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than thoſe, which only<note n="*" place="bottom">Ten thouſand people under fair advantages, and in a ſoil conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to their conſtitutions, and where the means of ſubſiſtence are eaſy, ſhould produce in a century 160,000. This is the proportion in which the Americans increaſed; and the Africans in their own country increaſe in the ſame, if not in a greater proportion. Now as the climate of the colonies is as favourable to their health as that of their own country, the cauſes of the prodigious decreaſe in the one, and increaſe in the other, will be more conſpicuons.</note>
                     <hi>ten thouſand</hi> would have produced in the ſame period, under common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and in a country congenial to their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions?</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>receivers</hi> have probably great merit on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Let us therefore ſet it down to their humanity. Let us ſuppoſe for once, that this incredible waſte of the human ſpecies proceeds from a benevolent deſign; that, ſenſible of the miſeries of a ſervile ſtate, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to wear out, as faſt as they poſſibly can, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſlaves, that their miſeries may the ſooner end, and that a wretched poſterity may be prevented from ſharing their parental condition. Now, whether this is the plan of reaſoning which the <hi>receivers</hi> adopt, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take upon us to decide; but true it is, that the effect produced is exactly the ſame, as if they had reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly on this <hi>benevolent</hi> principle.</p>

                  <p>We have now taken a ſurvey of the treatment which the unfortunate <hi>Africans</hi> undergo, when they are put into the hands of the <hi>receivers.</hi> This treatment, by the four firſt chapters of the preſent part of this Eſſay, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be wholly inſupportable, and to be ſuch as no human being can apply to another, without the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch crimes, as ſhould make him tremble.— But as many arguments are uſually advanced by thoſe
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:019561_0143_0FAC03089040CFF8"/>who have any intereſt in the practice, by which they would either exculpate the treatment, or diminiſh its ſeverity, we allotted the remaining chapters for their diſcuſſion. In theſe we conſidered the probability of ſuch a treatment againſt the motives of intereſt; the credit that was to be given to thoſe diſintereſted writers on the ſubject, who have recorded particular inſtances of barbarity; the inferiority of the <hi>Africans</hi> to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies; the compariſons that are generally made with reſpect to their ſituation; the poſitive ſcenes of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which they are ſaid to enjoy, and every other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſhort, that we have found to have ever been advanced in the defence of ſlavery. Theſe have been all conſidered, and we may venture to pronounce, that, inſtead of anſwering the purpoſe for which they were intended, they ſerve only to bring ſuch circumſtances to light, as clearly ſhew, that if ingenuity were racked to invent a ſituation, that would be the moſt diſtreſſing and inſupportable to the human race; it could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent one, that would ſuit the deſcription better, than the—<hi>colonial ſlavery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this then be the caſe, and if ſlaves, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the arguments to the contrary, are exquiſitely miſerable, we aſk you <hi>receivers, by what right</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to ſo wretched a ſituation?</p>
                  <p>You reply, that you <hi>buy them;</hi> that your <hi>money</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes your <hi>right,</hi> and that, like all other things which you purchaſe, they are wholly at your own diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>Upon this principle alone it was, that we profeſſed to view your treatment, or examine your right, when we ſaid, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 49.</note> the queſtion reſolved itſelf into two ſeparate <q>parts for diſcuſſion; into the <hi>African</hi> commerce, as explained in the hiſtory of ſlavery, and the ſubſequent ſlavery in the colonies, <hi>as founded on the equity of the commerce.</hi>
                     </q> Now, ſince it appears that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, upon the fulleſt inveſtigation, is contrary to <q>

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:019561_0144_0FAC0308EE8D5BC0"/>the admonitions of conſcience, and, in ſhort, the whole doctrine of natural religion,</hi>
                     </q> it is evident that the <hi>right,</hi> which is founded upon it, muſt be the ſame; and that if thoſe things only are lawful in the ſight of God, which are either virtuous in themſelves, or proceed from vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous principles, you <hi>have no right over them at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You yourſelves alſo confeſs this. For when we aſk you, whether any human being has a right to ſell you, you immediately anſwer, No; as if nature revolted at the thought, and as if it was ſo contradictory to your own feelings, as not to require conſideration. But who are you, that have this excluſive charter of trading in the liberties of mankind? When did nature, or rather the Author of nature, make ſo partial a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and them? When did He ſay, that you ſhould have the privilege of ſelling others, and that others ſhould not have the privilege of ſelling you?</p>
                  <p>Now ſince you confeſs, that no perſon whatever has a right to diſpoſe of you in this manner, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs alſo, that thoſe things are unlawful to be done to you, which are uſually done in conſequence of the ſale. Let us ſuppoſe then, that in conſequence of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> you were forced into a ſhip; that you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to another country; that you were ſold there; that you were confined to inceſſant labour; that you were pinched by continual hunger and thirſt; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be whipped, cut, and mangled at diſcretion, and all this at the hands of thoſe, whom you had never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; would you not think that you had a right to reſiſt their treatment? Would you not reſiſt it with a ſafe conſcience? And would you not be ſurprized, if your reſiſtance ſhould be termed rebellion?—By the former premiſes you muſt anſwer, Yes—Such then is the caſe with the wretched <hi>Africans.</hi> They have a right to reſiſt your proceedings. They can reſiſt them, and yet they cannot juſtly be conſidered as rebellious. For though we ſuppoſe them to have been guilty of crimes to one another; though we ſuppoſe them to have been the moſt abandoned and execrable of men, yet are they perfectly innocent with reſpect to you <hi>receivers.</hi> You have no
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:019561_0145_0FAC0309B7041758"/>right to touch even the hair of their heads without their own conſent. It is not your money, that can inveſt you with a right. Human liberty can neither be bought nor ſold. Every laſh that you give them is unjuſt. It is a laſh againſt nature and religion, and will ſurely ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded againſt you, ſince they are all, with reſpect to your <hi>impious</hi> ſelves, in a ſtate of nature; in a ſtate of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal diſſociation; perfectly free.</p>

                  <p>Having now conſidered both the <hi>commerce</hi> and <hi>ſlavery,</hi> it remains only to collect ſuch arguments as are ſcattered in different parts of the work, and to make ſuch addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional remarks, as preſent themſelves on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, let us aſk you, who have ſtudied the law of nature, and you, who are learned in the law of the land, if all property muſt not be inferiour in its nature to its poſſeſſor, or, in other words, (for it is a caſe, which every perſon muſt bring home to his own breaſt) if you ſuppoſe that any human being can have <hi>a property in yourſelves?</hi> Let us aſk you appraiſers, who ſcientifically know the value of things, if any human creature is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent only to any of the trinkets that you wear, or at moſt, to any of the horſes that you ride: or in other words, if you have ever conſidered the moſt coſtly things that you have valued, as <hi>equivalent to yourſelves?</hi> Let us aſk you rationaliſts, if man, as a reaſonable being, is not <hi>accountable</hi> for his actions, and let us put the ſame queſtion to you, who have ſtudied the divine writings? Let us aſk you parents, if ever you thought that you poſſeſſed an <hi>authority</hi> as ſuch, or if ever you expected a <hi>duty</hi> from your ſons; and let us aſk you ſons, if ever you felt an impulſe in your own breaſts to <hi>obey</hi> your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Now, if you ſhould all anſwer as we could wiſh, if you ſhould all anſwer conſiſtently with reaſon, nature, and the revealed voice of God, what a dreadful argument will preſent itſelf againſt the commerce and ſlavery of the human ſpecies, when we reflect, that no man whatever
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:019561_0146_0FAC030A72778E40"/>can be bought or reduced to the ſituation of a ſlave, <hi>but he muſt inſtantly become a brute, he muſt inſtantly be reduced to the value of thoſe things, which were made for his own uſe and convenience; he muſt inſtantly ceaſe to be accountable for his actions, and his authority as a parent, and his duty as a ſon, muſt be inſtantly no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither does it eſcape our notice, when we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fatal wound which every ſocial duty muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how conſiderably Chriſtianity ſuffers by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of you <hi>receivers.</hi> For by proſecuting this impious commerce, you keep the <hi>Africans</hi> in a ſtate of perpetual ferocity and barbariſm; and by proſecuting it in ſuch a manner, as muſt repreſent your religion, as a ſyſtem of robbery and oppreſſion, you not only oppoſe the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the goſpel, as far as you are able yourſelves, but throw the moſt certain impediments in the way of others, who might attempt the glorious and important taſk.</p>
                  <p>Such alſo is the effect, which the ſubſequent ſlavery in the colonies muſt produce. For by your inhuman treatment of the unfortunate <hi>Africans</hi> there, you create the ſame inſuperable impediments to a converſion. For how muſt they deteſt the very name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when you <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are deformed by ſo many and dreadful vices? How muſt they deteſt that ſyſtem of religion, which appears to reſiſt the natural rights of men, and to give a ſanction to brutality and murder?</p>
                  <p>But, as we are now mentioning Chriſtianity, we muſt pauſe for a little time, to make a few remarks on the arguments which are uſually deduced from thence by the <hi>receivers,</hi> in defence of their ſyſtem of oppreſſion. For the reader may readily ſuppoſe, that, if they did not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to bring the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament in ſupport of their barbarities, they would hardly let the <hi>New</hi> eſcape them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Paul,</hi> having converted <hi>Oncſimus</hi> to the Chriſtian faith, who was a fugitive ſlave of <hi>Philemon,</hi> ſent him back to his maſter. This circumſtance has furniſhed the <hi>receivers</hi> with a plea, that Chriſtianity encourages ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But they have not only ſtrained the paſſages which
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:019561_0147_0FAC030B2AFF56E8"/>they produce in ſupport of their aſſertions, but are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of hiſtorical facts. The benevolent apoſtle, in the letter which he wrote to <hi>Philemon,</hi> the maſter of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> addreſſes him to the following effect: <q>I ſend him back to you, but not in his former capacity,<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. to Philemon.</note>
                        <hi>not now as a ſervant, but above a ſervant, a brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi> In this manner I beſeech you to receive him, for though I could <hi>enjoin</hi> you to do it, yet I had rather it ſhould be a matter of your <hi>own will,</hi> than of <hi>neceſſity.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears that the ſame <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> when he was ſent back, was no longer <hi>a ſlave,</hi> that he was a miniſter of the goſpel, that he was joined with <hi>Tychicus</hi> in an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical commiſſion to the church of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and was afterwards biſhop of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> If language there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has any meaning, and if hiſtory has recorded a fact which may be believed, there is no caſe more oppoſite to the doctrine of the <hi>receivers,</hi> than this which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in its ſupport.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid again, that Chriſtianity, among the many important precepts which it contains, does not furniſh us with one for the abolition of ſlavery. But the reaſon is obvious. Slavery at the time of the introduction of the goſpel was univerſally prevalent, and if Chriſtianity had abruptly declared, that the millions of ſlaves ſhould have been made free, who were then in the world, it would have been univerſally rejected, as containing doctrines that were dangerous, it not deſtructive, to ſociety. In order therefore that it might be univerſally received, it never meddled, by any poſitive precept, with the civil inſtitutions of the times: but though it does not expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that <q>you ſhall neither buy, nor ſell, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a ſlave,</q> it is evident that, in its general tenour, it ſufficiently militates againſt the cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>The firſt doctrine which it inculcates, is that of <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love.</hi> It commands good will towards men. It enjoins us to love our neighbours as ourſelves, and to do unto all men, as we would that they ſhould do unto us. And how can any man fulfil this ſcheme of univerſal
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:019561_0148_0FAC030BEA30DB88"/>benevolence, who reduces an unfortunate perſon <hi>againſt his will,</hi> to the <hi>moſt inſupportable</hi> of all human conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; who conſiders him as his <hi>private property,</hi> and treats him, not as a brother, nor as one of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage with himſelf, but as an <hi>animal of the brute cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the moſt important doctrine is that, by which we are aſſured that mankind are to exiſt in a future ſtate, and to give an account of thoſe actions, which they have ſeverally done in the fleſh. This ſtrikes at the very root of ſlavery. For how can any man be juſtly called to an account for his actions, whoſe actions are not <hi>at his own diſpoſal?</hi> This is the caſe with the<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>African</hi> ſlave is of this deſcription; and we could wiſh in all our arguments on the preſent ſubject, to be underſtood as having ſpoken only of <hi>proper ſlaves.</hi> The ſlave who is condemned to the oar, to the fortifications, and other publick works, is in a different predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His liberty is not <hi>appropriated,</hi> and therefore none of thoſe conſequences can be juſtly drawn, which have been deduced in the preſent caſe.</note>
                     <hi>proper</hi> ſlave. His liberty is abſolutely bought and <hi>appropriated;</hi> and if the purchaſe is <hi>juſt and equitable,</hi> he is <hi>under the neceſſity</hi> of pertetrating any crime, which the purchaſer may order him to commit, or, in other words, of ceſing to be <hi>accountable for his actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe doctrines therefore are ſufficient to ſhew, that ſlavery is incompatible with the Chriſtian ſyſtem. The <hi>Europeans</hi> conſidered them as ſuch, when, at the cloſe of the twelfth century, they reſiſted their hereditary prejudices, and occaſioned its abolition. Hence one, among many other proofs, that Chriſtianity was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of infinite wiſdom; that though it did not take ſuch expreſs cognizance of the wicked national inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the times, as ſhould hinder its reception, it ſhould yet contain ſuch doctrines, as, when it ſhould be fully eſtabliſhed, would be ſufficient for the abolition of them all.</p>
                  <p>Thus then is the argument of you <hi>receivers</hi> ineffectual, and your conduct impious. For, by the proſecution of
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:019561_0149_0FAC030E285A0848"/>this wicked ſlavery and commerce, you not only oppoſe the propagation of that goſpel which was ordered to be preached unto every creature, and bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but you oppoſe its tenets alſo: firſt, becauſe you violate that law of <hi>univerſal benevolence,</hi> which was to take away thoſe hateful diſtinctions of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, Greek</hi> and <hi>Barbarian, bood</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> which prevailed when the goſpel was introduced; and ſecondly, becauſe, as every man is to give an account of his actions hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is neceſſary that he ſhould be <hi>free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another argument yet remains, which, though nature will abſolutely turn pale at the recital, cannot poſſibly be omitted. In thoſe wars, which are made for the ſake of procuring ſlaves, it is evident that the conteſt muſt be generally obſtinate, and that great numbers muſt be ſlain on both ſides, before the event can be determined. This we may reaſonably apprehend to be the caſe: and we have<note n="*" place="bottom">See the deſcription of an African battle, p. 72.</note> ſhewn, that there have not been wanting inſtances, where the conquerors have been ſo incenſed at the reſiſtance they have found, that their ſpirit of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance has entirely got the better of their avarice, and they have murdered, in cool blood, every individual, without diſcrimination, either of age or ſex. From theſe and other circumſtances, we thought we had ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that, where <hi>ten</hi> were ſuppoſed to be taken, an <hi>hundred,</hi> including the victors and vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might be ſuppoſed to periſh. Now, as the annual exportation from <hi>Africa</hi> conſiſts of an hundred thouſand men, and as the two orders, of thoſe who are privately kidnapped by individuals, and of thoſe, who are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſeized by virtue of the authority of their prince, compoſe together, at leaſt, nine-tenths of the <hi>African</hi> ſlaves, it follows, that about ten thouſand conſiſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs and priſoners of war. The laſt order is the moſt numerous. Let us ſuppoſe then that only ſix thouſand of this order are annually ſent into ſervitude, and it will immediately appear that no leſs than <hi>ſixty thouſand</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="unknown:019561_0150_0FAC030E324F8828"/>people annually periſh in thoſe wars, which are made only for the purpoſe of procuring ſlaves. But that this number, which we believe to be by no means exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. may be free from all objection, we will include thoſe in the eſtimate, who die as they are travelling to the ſhips. Many of theſe unfortunate people have a journey of one thouſand miles to perform on foot, and are driven like ſheep through inhoſpitable woods and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, where they frequently die in great numbers, from fatigue and want. Now if to thoſe, who thus periſh on the <hi>African</hi> continent, by war and travelling, we ſubjoin<note n="*" place="bottom">The loweſt computation is 40,000, ſee p. 93.</note> thoſe, who afterwards periſh on the voyage, and in the ſeaſoning together, it will appear that, in every yearly attempt to ſupply the colonies, an <hi>hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> muſt periſh, even before <hi>one</hi> uſeful individual can be obtained.</p>
                  <p>Gracious God! how wicked, how beyond all exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple impious, muſt be that ſervitude, which cannot be carried on without the continual murder of ſo many and innocent perſons! What puniſhment is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch monſtrous and unparalleled barbarities! For if the blood of one man, unjuſtly ſhed, cries with ſo loud a voice for the divine vengeance, how ſhall the cries and groans of an <hi>hundred thouſand</hi> men, <hi>annually mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> aſcend the celeſtial manſions, and bring down that puniſhment, which ſuch enormities deſerve! But do we mention puniſhment? Do we allude to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which ſhall be inflicted on men as individuals, in a future life? Do we allude to that awful day, which ſhall ſurely come, when the maſter ſhall behold his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered negroe face to face? When a train of mutilated ſlaves ſhall be brought againſt him? When he ſhall ſtand confounded and abaſhed? Or, do we allude to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which may be inflicted on them here, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a wicked community? For as a body politick, if its members are ever ſo numerous, may be conſidered as an whole, acting of itſelf, and by itſelf, in all affairs
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:019561_0151_0FAC030F19765368"/>in which it is concerned, ſo it is accountable, as ſuch, for its conduct; and as theſe kinds of polities have only their exiſtence here, ſo it is only in this world, that, as ſuch, they can be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now, whether we conſider the crime, with reſpect to the individuals immediately concerned in this moſt barbarous and cruel traffick, or whether we conſider it as<note n="*" place="bottom">The legiſlature has ſquandered away more money in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſlave trade, within twenty years, than in any other trade whatever, having granted from the year 1750, to the year 1770, the ſum of 300.000 pounds.</note> patronized and encouraged by the laws of the land, it preſents to our view an equal degree of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. A crime, founded on a dreadful pre-eminence in wickedneſs,—a crime, which being both of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals and the nation, muſt ſometime draw down upon us the heavieſt judgment of Almighty God, who made of one blood all the ſons of men, and who gave to all equally a natural right to liberty; and who, ruling all the kingdoms of the earth with equal providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial juſtice, cannot ſuffer ſuch deliberate, ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous iniquity, to paſs long unpuniſhed.</q>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Sermon preached before the Univerſity of Cambridge, by the Rev. Peter Peckard.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alas! he ſeems already to have interfered on the occaſion! The<note n="†" place="bottom">The firſt noted earthquake at Jamaica, happened June the 7th 1692, when Port Royal was totally ſunk. This was ſucceeded by one in the year 1697, and by another in the year 1722, from which time to the preſent, theſe regions of the globe ſeem to have been ſeverely viſited, but particularly during the laſt ſix or ſeven years. See a general account of he calamities, occaſioned by the late tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous hurricanes and earthquakes in the Weſt-Indian iſlands, by Mr. Fowler.</note> violent and ſupernatural agitations of all the elements, which, for a ſeries of years, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in thoſe European ſettlements, where the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Africans</hi> are retained in a ſtate of ſlavery, and which have brought unſpeakable calamities on the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and publick loſſes on the ſtates to which they ſeverally belong, are ſo many awful viſitations of God
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:019561_0152_0FAC0310DA9920B8"/>for this inhuman violation of his laws. And it is not perhaps unworthy of remark, that as the ſubjects of Great-Britain have two thirds of this impious commerce in their own hands, ſo they have ſuffered in the ſame proportion, or<note n="*" place="bottom">The many ſhips of war belonging to the Britiſh navy, which were loſt with all their crews in theſe dreadful hurricanes, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove the fact.</note> more ſeverely than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>How far theſe misfortunes may appear to be acts of providence, and to create an alarm to thoſe who have been accuſtomed to refer every effect to its apparent cauſe; who have been habituated to ſtop there, and to overlook the finger of God, becauſe it is ſlightly covered under the veil of ſecondary laws, we will not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? but this we will aſſert with confidence, that the <hi>Europeans</hi> have richly deſerved them all; that the tear of ſympathy, which can hardly be reſtrained on other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy occaſions, ſeems to forget to flow at the relation of theſe; and that we can never, with any ſhadow of juſtice, wiſh proſperity to the undertakings of thoſe, whoſe ſucceſs muſt be at the expence of the happineſs of millions of their fellow-creatures.</p>
                  <p>But this is ſufficient. For if liberty is only an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious right; if men are by no means ſuperiour to brutes; if every ſocial duty is a curſe; if cruelty is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be eſteemed; if murder is ſtrictly honourable, and Chriſtianity is a lye; then it is evident, that the <hi>African</hi> ſlavery may be purſued, without either the remorſe of conſcience, or the imputation of a crime. But if the contrary of this is true, which reaſon muſt immediately evince, it is evident that no cuſtom eſtabliſhed among men was ever more impious; ſince it is contrary to <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, juſtice, nature, the principles of law and government, the whole doctrine, in ſhort, of natural religion, and the revealed voice of God.</hi>
