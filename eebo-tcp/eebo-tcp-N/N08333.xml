            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE corruption and folly of man appears not more remarkable in any thing, than in preferring the empty enjoyments of this world, to glory, honour and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the world to come. The moſt careful diligence and pains are thought well beſtowed, in making proviſion for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and delight of the body; but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of our eternal peace, the coldeſt wiſhes and feebleſt endeavours commonly ſuffice; notwithſtanding our future intereſts are as much more important than our preſent, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are higher than the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:010643_0003_0F81BDA8C8FDE528"/>AND becauſe this is a very common as well as dangerous error, we find many reproofs and cautions pointed againſt it in the word of God; but in no part of theſe ſacred writings more, than in the diſcourſes of our bleſſed Saviour, who came into the world to redeem us from our iniquities, deliver us from this preſent evil world, and teach us the words of eternal life.—He it is who ſpeaketh in the words which have now been read, which, whether we conſider the authority with which they are enforced, or the importance of the inſtruction therein contained, deſerve our ſerious and particular attention.</p>
            <p>THAT we may underſtand the true meaning and purport of our text, ſo as to receive that inſtruction which it is deſigned, and adapted to convey to us, it is proper that we take notice,</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, to whom theſe words were addreſſed.—And our context informs us, that theſe were Jews, who followed Chriſt in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes with great profeſſions of reſpect; but their notions of his character were quite wrong, and their views or expectations mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. They were no true believers in him, but were influenced in their whole conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him by carnal motives. In this view Chriſt regards them, in this character he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes them in our text. The primary inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, we are ſure then, was not to inſtruct his diſciples, but the carnal Jews, who followed him for the loaves. This appears from the verſe immediately foregoing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord, like a faithful teacher, who ſought
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010643_0004_0F81BDA98CD7EEF0"/>
to be ſerviceable to them in their beſt intereſts, rather than ingratiate himſelf with them by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular artifices, charges their hypocriſy upon them freely and plainly—"Ye ſeek me not," ſays he, <q>becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.</q> Ver. 26. q. d —Though you pretend to honour me as a teacher come from God, becauſe you have ſeen the miracles I have wrought before you, yet I know this is not the true ſpring of your zeal to find me, and reſort to me; but it is becauſe you have been fed with my proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any coſt or expence of yours. Your view is not to be inſtructed by me, but that you may again eat your fill of bread.</p>
            <p>WE may note in the ſecond place, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and matter of the inſtruction, which our Lord here gives them. He preſcribes duty, expreſſed both negatively and poſitively—<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that which endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> The phraſe implies a ſerious concern, and diligent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as has been remarked by critics.<note n="*" place="bottom">Leigh's critica ſacra.</note> It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes an active exertment of ourſelves, in order to obtain the end, or good propoſed. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this command, is not only to declare to the Jews, to whom it was given, what was their duty, but alſo to encourage and perſuade them to a practical attendance thereunto. There is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging motive or inducement couched in the command, and plainly intimated in the manner in which it was delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010643_0005_0F81BDAA576BBE28"/>IT will be proper to remark once more, the object of thoſe endeavours here enjoyned, or what it was that the perſons addreſſed in the text were required to labour for—<hi>Not for the meat that periſheth.</hi> There is a Hebraiſm in this phraſe. The negative particle is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not abſolutely, but comparatively.—The ſenſe is, <hi>Labour not SO MUCH BY FAR for the meat that periſheth.</hi> Meat here is to be taken by a Synecdoche, for all kind of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the ſupport, and refreſhment of the body. Theſe things ſhould not be ſought after, in compariſon with the <hi>meat which endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> What is intended by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical expreſſion, <hi>the meat which endureth to everlaſting life,</hi> we may learn from the following context, ver. 32. and onward. <q>Moſes gave you not that bread from heaven, but my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. I am the bread of life: He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</q> The meaning of which is, that the doctrine concerning Chriſt, received by faith, is thro' the influence of the Holy Spirit, the ſupport of the divine life; the ſpiritual food, whereby our ſouls are nouriſhed unto life eternal. The immediate object of faith is Chriſt, as exhibited in the divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning him. In receiving this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine into our hearts we receive Chriſt, and as it were feed upon him, to our ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; or as it is expreſſed in ver. 53. we
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010643_0006_0F81BDAE375D9580"/>
eat his fleſh, and drink his blood: That is, we feaſt our ſouls with the doctrine of his atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That this is the true meaning of theſe expreſſions, appears from ver. 35. where after aſſerting that he was the bread of life, he quits the metaphor he had been purſuing, and ſays, "he that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt." Believing on Chriſt, and coming to him, and eating the bread of life, are expreſſions of the ſame import, mutually illuſtrating each other. The plain ſenſe of which is, receiving him as propoſed to us, in the goſpel-doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. This ſpiritual food then, which our text exhorts to labour for, is Chriſt with his benefits, exhibited in the goſpel as the object of faith, or, which comes to the ſame thing, it is the divine teſtimony, admitted into the mind and heart, or it is faith objectively conſidered. To labour for this meat then, is to labour that the ſaving truth concerning Chriſt, may have acceſs to the heart; or, in other words, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that faith by which the juſt live, and which is, as it were, the food of their ſouls; that faith whereby the divine life is ingenerated, and whereby it is ſupported. For this bread of life not only preſerves, but gives life to the world. Tis the ſame thing that Peter calls the incorruptible ſeed of the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever, whereby, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the heart by faith, we are born again. It may be added, that as man's natural life ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not by bread alone, but by God's word of bleſſing, ſo the benedictive influence of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010643_0007_0F81BDAF7AB44260"/>
Holy Spirit muſt accompany the bread of life, that our ſouls may be in health and thrive and proſper.</p>
            <p>THE ſenſe of our text then may be given in the following paraphraſe, q. d. <q>This meat for which you take ſo much pains will periſh, as well as the life that is ſupported by it: It ought not therefore to be the chief object or end of your cares and labours. Spend not your thoughts and ſtrength for the empty ſhort-liv'd enjoyments of this world, which will never ſatisfy, and ſoon will fail you. But as you have an eternal intereſt at ſtake, let that be minded in ſome proportion to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Let it be your principal concern and endeavour, to obtain that ſpiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and belief of the truth, which I have declared unto you (wherein I the bread of life have been exhibited, as the object of faith) and thoſe influences of the Holy Spirit in and with the ſame, by which that divine life may be ingenerated, and ſupported, which faileth not, but endureth forever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE text thus opened will naturally ſuggeſt to us theſe two doctrinal truths, viz.</p>
            <p>FIRST. That the ſoul is to be preferred to the body, or the intereſts of the world to come, are vaſtly more important than all the intereſts and enjoyments of this life.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. That it ought to be the chief concern and endeavour of thoſe who hear the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010643_0008_0F81BDAF88B8E900"/>
call of the goſpel, to ſecure their eternal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and in order thereunto, obtain that faith in Chriſt, and that grace or influence of the Holy Spirit, which are neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe points, tho' it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably be enlarged upon, I ſhall wholly paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; as I think it muſt be readily owned by all, who have any ſerious regard for the plaineſt dictates of reaſon or ſcripture.<note n="*" place="bottom">They who would ſee this conſidered at large may read what Dr. Evans has written on this text, in his very uſeful diſcourſes on the Chriſtian Temper.</note> The ſecond will alſo, I think, be allowed, at leaſt as to the ſubſtance of it, ſo far as it reſpects true believers. But whether the goſpel has any commands or encouragements, for ſinners to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, previous to regeneration, and ſaving faith, is a point in which profeſſed chriſtians have not been ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agreed. And they who have profeſſed an agreement in the ſimple affirmation of it, have yet differed conſiderably in their manner of explaining and defending it. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought, that it might be of good uſe, for the direction and ſatisfaction of ſerious minds, that this matter be carefully enquired into, and the ſcriptures diligently ſearched upon it. And this is what I have propoſed, by divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to attend unto, in this and ſome following diſcourſes. I shall therefore endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and confirm this propoſition, which I think appears plainly to be implied in, and grounded upon our text; viz. That the hearers of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010643_0009_0F81BDB0672A3308"/>
goſpel, antecedent to their believing in Chriſt ſavingly, are commanded and encouraged, to make it their chief concern and endeavour, to obtain that faith and grace of the Holy Spirit, which is neceſſary to juſtification, and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>IT would not be foreign to my text, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is the nature of ſaving faith, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered objectively, as the meat itſelf which gives and ſupports that life of which believers are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker; and ſubjectively, as it denotes our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this ſpiritual food; as alſo how faith under both theſe conſiderations is the means of our obtaining and enjoying life, judicially, in our juſtification, and adoption; ſpiritually, in regeneration and ſanctification: But it is not my deſign, at preſent, to proſecute the ſubject in this extent.—What I propoſe is to conſider the obligation, and encouragement of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, to labour, or uſe endeavours, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation; and in order thereunto, to ſeek for converting grace, and ſaving faith.—And the method in which, I ſhall proſecute this deſign, is as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I WOULD ſhew what thoſe endeavours are,
which are here intended.</p>
            <p n="2">II. ENQUIRE whether men, without regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace and ſaving faith, have any power or capacity for ſuch endeavours.</p>
            <p n="3">III. CONSIDER why theſe endeavours are ſuppoſed to be preſcribed, or what good ends they may ſubſerve.</p>
            <p n="4">

            <p n="5">V. ANSWER objections.</p>
            <p n="1">I. OUR firſt buſineſs is to declare what are thoſe endeavours or duties which are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And as it is not my deſign under this head to vindicate the obligation of theſe duties, or inculcate an attendance to them, but only ſhew what I would be underſtood to mean by thoſe performances, which are ſuppoſed to be required of men unregenerate, I ſhall aim at brevity.</p>
            <p>THE duties or endeavours, which are now to be enquired into, are manifeſtly ſuppoſed to be antecedent to a man's firſt converſion;, and to have ſome ſubſerviency to his obtaining the meat which endureth to everlaſting life: They are ſome way conducive to his obtaining a ſaving underſtanding and belief of the goſpel. And therefore, theſe duties muſt of neceſſity be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be of ſuch a kind, as men are capable of performing before they are converted. To ſpeak of duties required in order to converſion, which none are capable of performing till they are converted, is groſly abſurd. If any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are required of men as in any reſpect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to their obtaining juſtifying faith, theſe muſt be understood to be of ſuch a kind, as they are by divine aſſiſtance capable of, before they are in a juſtified ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010643_0011_0F81BDB1CCFEB4B8"/>BUT to give ſome further opening to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, let it be obſerved, that as the duties or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours we are now conſidering are not of the nature of true holineſs, ſo they do not infer any moral fitneſs for, or worthineſs of the ſaving or effectual grace of God. Their ſubſerviency to our converſion is in a quite different way; that is, by "removing thoſe impediments in us which would otherwiſe unavoidably hinder our receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this grace," as one expreſſes it;<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Willard.</note> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the ſoul for the reception, and exerciſe of the ſpiritual life; and by bringing and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in the way of God's bleſſing; that is, in an attendance to thoſe means, by which it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily conveyed to the children of men, as ſhall, by God's help, be hereafter more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and proved. In the mean time, a few hints may throw ſome light upon our preſent enquiry.</p>
            <p>THERE are three things eſpecially which have a manifeſt tendency to hinder a man's turning to God, thro' faith in Chriſt; namely, groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and error—ſtupid inconſiderateneſs—and wilful oppoſition to the dictates of conſcience.</p>
            <p>AS it is the truth revealed in the word of God that is the object of faith, and means or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of converſion, ſo it is plain that he who is groſly ignorant of, or miſtaken about the great doctrines or precepts of divine revelation, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, ſo long as he remains in this ſtate, of perceiving the ſpiritual glory of the goſpel, which is that peculiar evidence of its truth and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010643_0012_0F81BDB359332048"/>
divinity which ſaving faith is grounded upon. And it is equally plain that ſuch a one is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being begotten again, in the ordinary manner of the Spirit's operation, even by the incorruptible ſeed of the word of God, till the truth there revealed is admitted into his mind.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER a ſtupid and inconſiderate diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great concerns of religion, is a fatal obſtacle in the way of a ſinner's converſion, not only as it naturally tends to ſettle him down in ignorance and error, but alſo becauſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that his attention and ſerious concern be awakened, in order to his perceiving the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and feeling the influence of the goſpel. No adult perſon is brought into a ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till he is firſt rouſed, from his careleſs ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and becomes ſeriouſly ſolicitous about the concerns of eternity.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, wilful oppoſition to the light and dictates of conſcience, eſpecially when long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in, leads on, in its natural tendency, and by the righteous judgment of God, to hardneſs of heart, and a reprobate mind. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in conſequence of ſuch outrageous violence and oppoſition to its dictates, becomes feared as with an hot iron. The apoſtle ſpeaking of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this character, ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. 2.11.</note> "For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they may believe a lie; that they all might be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs." And ſpeaking of himſelf, tho' he magnifies exceedingly the grace mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010643_0013_0F81BDB407E414A0"/>
in his converſion, and intimates that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the chief of ſinners need not deſpair, yet in the boſom of this declaration, he gives a very alarming hint to thoſe who preſume to ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in oppoſition to the conviction of their own minds, when he ſays, "I was a blaſphemer, &amp;c. but I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in unbelief."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.13, compare Luke 23.34.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To prepare the ſoul for the introduction and exerciſe of a new and ſpiritual principle, tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly requiſite that there be ſome competent doctrinal acquaintance with the main articles of the chriſtian religion, together with a conviction of our own character and condition: There muſt be a ſerious concern to be delivered from the miſery of a ſtate of ſin and guilt, and obtain eternal life: And a diligent care to comply with the dictates of conſcience, and improve that grace and influence of the Holy Spirit, which is ordinarily granted to thoſe who have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of chriſtian knowledge. Of this a ſinner is capable before he is renewed by the ſpecial operation of the Holy Spirit; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order which God is pleaſed to obſerve in diſpenſing ſpiritual bleſſings, this preparatory work of grace, with thoſe duties or exerciſes which are connected with, and prompted by it, are ordinarily neceſſary, to make way for thoſe ſpecial and ſaving influences of the Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are effectually renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, and ſo enabled to believe in Chriſt to the ſaving of our ſouls, and turn to God thro' him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:010643_0014_0F81BDB71CFCAF50"/>BUT theſe things muſt be called over again, and examined more diſtinctly in another place; ſo I do but hint briefly, ſo far as may ſerve to give ſome light to the point now under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For it is in the uſe of inſtituted means, or in the way of attendance to preſcribed duties, that ignorant and ſecure ſinners are awakened, convinced and humbled, and then ſavingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and converted to God, thro' ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.—And hence we may be in ſome meaſure directed in our preſent enquiry, what are thoſe means and endeavours for obtaining the meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life, which are primarily intended, and preſcribed to ſinners in our text.</p>
            <p>IN general then, whatever tends to confirm them in their ignorance and errors, in their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and inconſiderateneſs, and in their courſes of preſumptuous ſinning, muſt be carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; and whatever conduces to enlighten their minds, to enlarge, clear and rectify their apprehenſions of divine things, to impreſs ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiments or convictions upon their hearts, to call them off from their ſinful courſes, and produce a reformation of their lives, muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attended to and improved for this end. More particularly, they muſt guard againſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, or an exceſſive indulgence to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights of the body. Theſe will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſink them into ſloth and ſecurity, draw off the thoughts and attention from the concerns of another life, and beget an inſenſibility of the miſery of a ſtate of ſin and guilt, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010643_0015_0F81BDB832800638"/>
of being at peace and favour with God, and in a word, confirm an habitual inattention to, and unmindfulneſs of, the important motives which the goſpel propoſes, to awaken a concern about their ſouls ſalvation. And for the ſame reaſon, an immoderate carefulneſs about, and eager purſuit after any worldly or temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, muſt alſo be avoided. This will ſoon ſtifle convictions, quench the Spirit, and obſtruct the good effect of the means of grace: It will choke the good ſeed ſown in their hearts, and lead on to many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. Evil company is another dangerous ſnare they ought carefully to ſhun. Experience abundantly proves that this has a mighty tendency to abate our earneſtneſs, and diligence in ſeeking the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs; and leads on to the moſt deſtructive and heart-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening courſes. In fine, all ſinful diverſions or amuſements do ſtupify the conſcience, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the ſoul for ſerious exerciſes: Theſe muſt therefore be renounced, as of moſt dangerous tendency.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, there are outward means and duties to be attended to, together with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exerciſes of the mind in and upon them, in order to remove our ignorance, correct our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, excite and cheriſh conviction and religious concern, produce a reformation in our lives, and lead us to that faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, to which the ſpecial promiſe of the goſpel are annexed. We muſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010643_0016_0F81BDB90122A640"/>
read and hear the word of God, which is the great ordinance or inſtrument, whereby the knowledge of the truth, and ſaving belief of it is conveyed to our minds: We muſt alſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on what we read and hear agreable to theſe holy oracles, and conſider the evidences of their divine authority. We muſt examine our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate by this rule, and reflect upon our ſins in their ſeveral aggravations, together with the dreadful wages annexed to them. And that this may be done in the moſt ſerious and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, we muſt pray to God for that grace and mercy we need, with humble confeſſions of our ſins, and juſt condemnation. This is a moſt ſolemn way of meditation, excellently adapted to impreſs the great truths of religion deeply on our ſouls, and ſo affect our hearts with a moſt ſenſible conviction of their infinite importance, and render them powerfully influential on the temper and practice. Theſe duties are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be obſerved at thoſe times and ſeaſons, which are peculiarly appropriated to religious exerciſes. In particular the Lord's day muſt be remembred and kept holy, agreable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of its inſtitution. I might alſo mention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious faſting and humiliation, as an ordinance recommended by ſcripture, and the practice of holy men in all ages. But I need not enlarge any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on theſe things. What is ordinarily meant by the means of grace, is well enough underſtood. A diligent attendance on theſe, with a proper exerciſe of mind therein, comprehends the ſum of thoſe endeavours which are ſuppoſed to be primarily required of ſinners in the text, and of which this diſcourſe is chiefly to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:010643_0017_0F81BDB94C8EC090"/>BUT it may be enquired, has a man any power or capacity to perform theſe duties or exerciſes, till he be endowed with the grace of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that faith which is the principle of all acceptable obedience, as well as the means or condition of juſtification?—Are not unrenewed ſinners in a ſtate of ſpiritual death, utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any power or will unto any thing that is good, without any ſincere deſires of the goſpel-ſalvation, and therefore morally incapable of ſeeking for it?</p>
            <p>THIS is an enquiry of great importance. A right reſolution of it will go far towards deciding the diſpute concerning the obligation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the unregenerate, to a diligent uſe of the means of grace, in order to obtain ſalvation. Our ſecond head will be chiefly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in examining, and ſtating this point: And accordingly I ſhall now proceed to it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I AM to conſider what power, or principle of action, there is in a natural or unregenerate man, whereby he may be ſuppoſed capable of thoſe endeavours, which have been deſcribed.</p>
            <p>AND that we may have a more clear and diſtinct view of this point, I ſhall endeavour, in the firſt place, to explain and fix the ſenſe, in which this enquiry, concerning the power of men unregenerate, is to be underſtood.—Then I ſhall conſider briefly, what is the ſtate of fallen man, previous to regeneration and converſion.—After that we may be able to determine whether man, in his lapſed and depraved ſtate, before he is born again, has any power to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, in the manner that has been declared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010643_0018_0F81BDBA2AB2D8E0"/>THE meaning of this enquiry, concerning the power of fallen man to labour, endeavour, &amp;c. muſt in the firſt place be explained; becauſe it is more than poſſible, that the conceptions of ſome concerning the true ſtate of this queſtion, are not ſufficiently determinate. We are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve then, that the queſtion is not, whether we have an independant power of our own, to do any thing that may be available to our obtaining e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life. For not only fallen man, but all other creatures, are every moment dependant upon God intirely for their being and all their powers. Nor are we to underſtand the enquiry to be about what is commonly called the natural power or capacity of fallen man, for thoſe performances, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, before mentioned. For in this reſpect, there is no eſſential difference, between the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and the regenerate. The ſame faculties of underſtanding and will, and executive power, phyſically conſidered, belong to both. No one I think can or will pretend, that theſe duties are beyond the natural ability of a ſinner, provided he has a diſpoſition or will to obſerve them. He is undoubtedly as able to read and hear the word of God, as he is to read and hear diſcourſes upon different ſubjects: To think or meditate upon the concerns of his ſalvation, as to be muſing on things of no conſequence: To conſider and enquire how he may be ſaved, as to put the moſt trifling and impertinent queſtions: To implore the mercy of God upon him, as to petition for a favour from any of his fellow men: To attend diligently to the religious duties of the Lord's day, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it by idleneſs, by worldly converſation, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful diverſions. The point then to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010643_0019_0F81BDBAC7DA6FE0"/>
by us, I think is this, <hi>Whether man, in his fallen and depraved ſtate, has any moral power to perform theſe duties?</hi>—Or to ſpeak in more plain and determinate language, <hi>Whether there be in men unregenerate any principle, which may be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their having a will to endeavour and ſtrive to be delivered from a ſtate of ſin and miſery, and obtain eternal life and ſalvation, and accordingly uſe means for this purpoſe?</hi> Or to vary the expreſſion yet again, <hi>Is it conſiſtent with a ſtate of ſin, that a man ſhould deſire to be ſaved, and ſo become diſpoſed to ſeek ſalvation by attending theſe inſtrumental du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſcribed for this end?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND that we may be able to give a just and plain reſolution of this important enquiry, it will be needful that we conſider, what is the ſtate of fallen man unregenerate?</p>
            <p>THIS is what I propoſed in the next place to enquire into, and declare. I cannot now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to diſcuſs this point fully and minutely, but muſt only hint a few things, ſo far as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>AND here it is readily granted that unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinners are ſpiritually dead, or in other words dead in ſin. What this expreſſion imports, will be conſidered immediately:—But that this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter belongs to all men, except thoſe who are born again, and ſo endowed with a vital princple by the Holy Ghoſt, I think cannot be denyed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome medium can be found between life and death. In regeneration there is communicated to the ſoul that ſpiritual life and power, whereby we are prompted and enabled ſincerely to repent of, and turn from ſin unto God, and live to him in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010643_0020_0F81BDBB9E981F70"/>
the exerciſe or practice of evangelical holineſs. All who are the ſubjects of this ſpiritual life and power, are born of the Spirit, and according to the ſcripture phraſe, are quickned, or made alive to God: And of conſequence all who are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute hereof, are in that reſpect dead. There is then no reaſon for confining this character to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and the moſt abandoned ſinners, unleſs we will ſay, that all beſides ſuch are raiſed from the death of ſin, and have the ſpiritual or divine life begun in their ſouls; that is, unleſs all beſides heathen Idolaters are born of God. For I think it muſt be allowed, that theſe are expreſſions of the ſame import, at leaſt that they neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply each other.</p>
            <p>SINCE then every man before regeneration is in a ſtate of ſpiritual death, it muſt now be enquired, what is the true notion of ſuch a ſtate, and how are we to conceive of the impotency and indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of fallen man to that which is good?</p>
            <p>SPIRITUAL death then conſiſts primarily and formally in the want of that holy rectitude or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of nature, that habitual conformity of ſoul to the will of God, which is the principle, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of thoſe views, affections and exerciſes, which have the ſpecific nature of true holineſs. There is a divine beauty and excellency in true holineſs, and in contraſt hereunto a correſpondent evil and turpitude in ſin, which they who are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually dead are inſenſible of. There is ſuch a change wrought in the ſoul of a ſinner in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he has apprehenſions, affections, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and acts, which are new, and of a different kind from what he had before. The proof of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010643_0021_0F81BDBC6B31F008"/>
this cannot now be entred upon. It will not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſuppoſe be denyed by any, who allow that true holineſs differs in its nature from all other endowments, or affections, or exerciſes of a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal being. This, all who are ſpiritually dead, or under the power of ſin, are, while in ſuch a ſtate, morally indiſpoſed unto and incapable of.</p>
            <p>BUT though the ſtrict or preciſe notion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death be the loſs of this uprightneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it muſt be added, that it implies more than a bare privation of ſpiritual life and power. A poſitive depravity of nature, or a prevailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to that which is evil, will of courſe enſue upon the loſs of habitual integrity. There is no need of ſuppoſing that any vicious taint is infuſed, or any principles ſimply and poſitively evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, in order to account for the corruption of human nature. As ſoon as that union of the ſoul to God, whereby the divine life ſubſiſts is broken, the vital principle with all its acts or exerciſes will ceaſe:—Of conſequence, the ſinner will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in his conduct by ſelf-love, with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural appetites and affections. And hence he will not favour the things of God, but become alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the divine life, prone to, and full of vanity, folly and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>IT cannot then be ſuppoſed, that while a man is dead in ſin, blind to the beauties of holineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed and diſinclined to that which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, he ſhould have any direct deſire to be freed from the power of ſin, and renewed after the image of God, in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or ſhould uſe any means or endeavours with a direct intention to obtain that of which he has
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010643_0022_0F81BDBD0C49ACF8"/>
no juſt idea, and which he does not truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly deſire, or delight in. It would be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſurd to ſuppoſe that any one ſhould deſire and endeavour after any thing, which is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or conſidered as good or agreable, in that reſpect in which it is deſired and endeavoured after. While a man is ignorant and inſenſible of the ſpiritual excellency of the new creature, and of the dignity and happineſs of the divine life in the ſoul, but on the contrary is diſinclined to, and alienated from it, this will not be regarded by him as a proper object of his deſires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. To deſire grace <hi>ſincerely,</hi> is the effect and exerciſe of a gracious principle; even as it is a ſign and effect of a vital principle, to deſire and ſtruggle for life.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS mankind, however depraved in all their faculties, are capable of feeling the force of moral obligation. A ſinner may have ſuch a ſenſe of the, reaſonableneſs of thoſe duties which are required of him, the authority of God over him, and the duty and wiſdom of ſubmitting to it, as that he may really deſire, and endeavour to obey the divine commands, as to matter and ſubſtance of them. It cannot be denyed, that the worſt of men have ſome ſenſe of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fitneſs of virtue, and the moral evil or turpitude of vice. For it is plain they have a ſenſe of deſert: Their conſciences teſtify that piety and benevolence, with all proper practical expreſſions thereof, are right and good; and that when they ſin wilfully, they are worthy of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They who have no holy love to God and his laws, are yet ſenſible, from the dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it is their duty to be obedient to the great creator and lawgiver, who is able to ſave
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010643_0023_0F81BDBDE4222328"/>
and deſtroy; and that his commands are juſt and righteous: Otherwiſe they would not feel remorſe and ſelf-condemnation when they tranſgreſs them. They have ſome natural notions of moral good and evil; and tho' theſe natural principles, and that obedience which flows merely from them are not ſpiritually good, as wanting what is eſſential to evangelical holineſs, they are yet good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſeveral reſpects; as we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew more fully hereafter. To this purpoſe ſpeaks a learned and eminent author,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Owen.</note> 
               <q>Under the aſhes of our collapſed nature there are yet remaining certain ſparks of celeſtial fire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in inbred notices of good and evil, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, of the preſence and all-ſeeing eye of God, of help and aſſiſtance to be had from him, with a dread of his excellency where any thing is apprehended unworthy of him or provoking to him.</q> They who are incapable of perceiving the moſt divine excellency of true holineſs, who are not ſtruck with thoſe motives and reaſons of duty which are of the ſublimeſt kind, and fitted to produce the moſt noble and divine movements of the heart, are yet capable of perceiving ſo much of the reaſonableneſs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of God's commands, as that their temper and conduct may be much influenced thereby. There is in human nature a ſenſe of duty or moral obligation, a conſcience which directs us what we ought to do, and warns us what we are to expect: And theſe natural principles may be ſo wrought upon by motives, as that men may really deſire and endeavour, in ſome ſort, to obey the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, previous to regeneration. Moreover,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010643_0024_0F81BDBE8CD66C38"/>AS there is in human nature a deſire of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dread of miſery, mankind are capable of being moved by the promiſes and threatenings of the goſpel, to deſire deliverance from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, and be happy hereafter in the favour of God; and hence they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to uſe means and endeavours for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Many without queſtion are excited from this principle to do much in religion, and ſtrive very earneſtly for ſalvation. There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which a man may not be perſuaded to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as to the matter of it, merely from ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: And tho' what is done merely from this principle is not true holineſs, yet the principle is good, uſeful and neceſſary in itſelf, and may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough have its influence in all our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the divine commands.</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add, that theſe natural principles we have mentioned, which are all good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves, may be much improved and ſtrengthned by inſtruction, exerciſe, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon influence of the Holy Spirit. Mankind are capable of a doctrinal or theoretic knowledge of the truths and duties of the goſpel. By a ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exerciſe of their minds in attending to the outward means of knowledge, they may obtain daily a clearer, and more extenſive view of the doctrines and precepts of revelation. And there is a common influence of the Spirit, in a work of illumination, conviction, &amp;c. which men may experience while in an unconverted ſtate, as ſhall be proved in the ſequel. By theſe means, the conſcience or moral ſenſe, the deſire of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and dread of miſery, implanted in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may become more quick, and have a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er influence on the heart and life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010643_0025_0F81BDBF5618AD60"/>THE ſubſtance of what has been offered on this point is, that mankind by the fall have loſt that holy rectitude or uprightneſs of nature, wherein conſiſts the moral image of God; and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo corrupted and dead in ſin, that until they are born again of the Spirit, they are indiſpoſed to, and morally incapable of any affections or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, which are ſpiritually good and holy. Nor have they ſtrictly ſpeaking any ſincere deſires to be delivered from this ſtate of ſpiritual death, and have a principle of divine life communicated to them. But yet there are other principles or ſprings of action in human nature, whereby they may be moved and excited to perform many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required by God, though not in a holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor for holy ends. They may from a ſenſe of the equity of God's commands, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations they are under to be ſubject to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and from a natural deſire of happineſs, be induced to endeavour carefully to frame their lives according to the rules of religion, and that not in mere pretence and groſs hypocriſy, but with ſerious engagedneſs of mind.</p>
            <p>AND hence we may eaſily reſolve our <hi>third en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> viz. whether man in his lapſed and deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate, before he is born again, and has a ſaving and ſpiritual underſtanding and belief of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, has any power or capacity to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life. That mankind have a natural power, by the ordinary aſſiſtance of God, to perform theſe duties, if they are ſo inclined, I ſuppoſe muſt be readily allowed; that men unregenerate are morally incapable of doing any thing in religion in a holy manner, muſt alſo be granted, if the principle we have laid
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010643_0026_0F81BDC01A76A498"/>
down be true, that that ſupernatural life, power and grace, which is communicated to the ſoul in regeneration, is neceſſary unto all acts of holy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical obedience. But I think no one who underſtands himſelf, can deny that the natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon, conſcience, and ſelf-preſervation, when improved and excited by inſtruction, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and the common influences of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are a ſufficient foundation for thoſe deſires and endeavours to obtain ſalvation, which have been deſcribed under the foregoing head: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unregenerate men have a moral power in this manner, to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life. In plainer words, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inclined and willing ſo to do.</p>
            <p>THIS appears not only from what has been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from the nature of man, but alſo from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable fact. Is it not certain that many while unregenerate, have ſought to enter in at the ſtrait gate? Common obſervation, as well as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's expreſs words,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 13.24.</note> will warrant us to aſſert this. Yea perhaps it may appear in the ſequel, that it is in the way of diligent ſeeking, in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the duties before ſpecified, that the grace of regeneration, and the ſaving knowledge of the truth are ordinarily obtained. Though man in a ſtate of ſin is not in a preſent moral capacity to perform religious duties in a holy manner, yet the performance itſelf is plainly within his power, by God's common aſſiſtance. Our natural principles of reaſon, conſcience and ſelf-preſervation, when informed with ſuch knowledge of religion as men unregenerate are capable of, and excited by the common influence of the Spirit, are a ſufficient
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010643_0027_0F81BDC1D041E168"/>
foundation for ſuch a compliance with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and matter of preſcribed duties, as is here intended. If men have not a will to attend the common means of converſion, it is not becauſe an unregenerate ſtate is incapable of it, but becauſe the voice of reaſon and conſcience is not hearkned to, becauſe thoſe notices of truth and duty which they have received are not regarded, and becauſe they will not purſue their own intereſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">The new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And though it cannot produce itſelf, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not your reaſonable ſoul in which it is to be formed, uſe God's appointed means in order to that bleſſed change?

            </p>
            <p>BUT it will here be objected, that ſalvation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in freedom from ſin, and perfection in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as exemption from the curſe: But this is what no one in a ſtate of ſin deſires. Is it not abſurd then to ſuppoſe, that a man ſhould ſeek that which he has no deſire to obtain? And labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, when he has no appetite or reliſh for it?</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, how abſurd ſoever ſome may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it is to ſpeak of ſinners ſeeking ſalvation, this is the expreſs language of ſcripture, which ought to have ſcreened the expreſſion from that cenſure, which ſome cricical refiners have preſumed to paſs upon it. "A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſdom and findeth it not."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 14.6.</note> "When he ſlew them then they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early after God."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 78.34.</note> "Many ſhall ſeek to enter in (at the ſtrait gate) and ſhall not be able."<note n="§" place="bottom">Luk. 13.24.</note> Yet
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010643_0028_0F81BDC246B59338"/>
it will not be allowed, I think, that a ſcorner has a direct ſincere deſire of true wiſdom; or that they whoſe hearts were not right with God, ſought him in truth; or that ſuch as fail of entring in at the ſtrait gate, do ſeek for an entrance with that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of deſire and endeavour, which ariſes from a ſpiritual renovation of heart. We may then without ſcruple adhere to the ſtile of the ſacred oracles, let men criticize and cavil as they pleaſe. And as to the objected abſurdity, of ſuppoſing that men may ſeek ſalvation at the ſame time that they refuſe it, and deſire it not, a little attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſhew that it is of no force in the preſent caſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A MAN may be willing and inclined to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe means, which are by the appointment of God conducive to his converſion, though he may have no juſt conception of the nature of this divine change, nor any direct ſincere deſire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it. The prompting motive with ſuch a one to uſe theſe means, is not indeed their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſubſerviency to an end which he has not in view, nor wiſhes to obtain: But he may do it from a regard to other ends, which he may really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire &amp; aim at. Yea he may act from ſuch ends as are lawful and good in ſome reſpects, and in their proper place, as may be ſhewn hereafter. And his endeavours may, by the will and appointment of God, land him happily at a point which at firſt he thought not of arriving at. We may illuſtrate this matter in ſome meaſure perhaps by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſimile, however it may halt in ſome of its members. A man who is ſick and delirious, and who has conceived an averſion to his father, may be perſuaded for fear of his anger, and in hopes
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010643_0029_0F81BDC594919C18"/>
of an inheritance, to follow ſuch directions as are deſigned and ſuited to reſtore him to his health, his reaſon, and dutiful affections: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by this means may find himſelf at length happily recovered from all his indiſpoſitions, tho' in his diſordered ſtate he was neither ſenſible of his miſerable condition, nor had thoſe benefits in view, which he has found. So though men in a ſtate of ſin or ſpiritual death have not a ſpiritual apprehenſion of the nature and excellency of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in its full extent, as revealed in the goſpel, and ſo cannot have a direct aim at obtaining what they have no reliſh for, yet it is very ſuppoſable, that they may, in obedience to the dictates of conſcience, and the natural principle of ſelf-love, be induced to a diligent uſe of thoſe outward and ordinary means whereby the benefits of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ordinarily applied; and in this way may come to the ſaving knowledge of the truth, and be born again of this incorrupible ſeed. Moreover,</p>
            <p n="2">2. AN unregenerate man may attend to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary preſcribed means of grace, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that he may obtain the end which they are ordained to ſubſerve: He may, in ſome ſort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſire and hope that, in the uſe of theſe means, he ſhall receive further light and influence from the Holy Spirit, that ſo his feet may be guided in the way of peace, and he may find reſt to his ſoul. Tis true indeed, ſuch a one has no direct and ſincere will and purpoſe to obtain that faith and repentance which the goſpel requires, ſo long as he is inſenſible of the ſpiritual glory of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and does not acquieſce in the method of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace therein revealed. But he may have real deſires to obtain further degrees of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010643_0030_0F81BDC67353F420"/>
light and grace, which is ordinarily prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to converſion: Yea, he may have real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of ſalvation, not indeed in its full extent, nor on account of the ſpiritual excellency of the bleſſings propoſed in the goſpel, but becauſe of their natural ſuitableneſs to his wants, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinful creature.</p>
            <p>I TAKE it for granted, that a man who is not ſavingly enlightned and renewed, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he is a ſinner, that the wages of ſin is death, and that the goſpel contains a revelation of mercy to the ungodly. Now theſe ſparks of light, if I may ſo ſpeak, which are in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, theſe notices of truth, which by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon influence of the divine Spirit, are conveyed to the mind, either from the works or word of God, may excite the attention to further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of divine truth. An imperfect view of the goſpel doctrine, however indiſtinct and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, may awaken an enquiry after a fuller and clearer knowledge; and that not to amuſe a vain curioſity, but from a ſerious concern to eſcape the wrath to come. And though no one will take pains to find himſelf guilty and miſerable, ſince it is contrary to nature to ſeek miſery, yet a general apprehenſion and partial conviction of guilt, may put a man upon a ſerious enquiry into his ſpiritual ſtate: It may fully convince him, than he ought not to ſhake off thoſe diſquieting apprehenſions which have begun to ariſe in his mind: That it would be moſt dangerous preſumption to indulge himſelf in ſecurity and inconſiderateneſs, while he has ſo much reaſon to fear that he is in a bad caſe. And hence he may be prompted to ſeek a more thorough acquaintance with himſelf, and with the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010643_0031_0F81BDC6E77A8588"/>
word of God, the rule by which he is to judge of his own caſe, and which opens the only way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the guilty. Thus, as Solomon ſpeaks, "he may cry for knowledge, and lift up his voice for underſtanding, ſeek for it as ſilver, and ſearch for it as for hid treaſure;" and ſo obtain further degrees of knowledge, conviction, humiliation, and be in a nearer capacity for ſaving illumination, faith and converſion; as will be more fully explained and proved hereafter. And accordingly it is certain from fact, that when ſinners begin to be awakened, they ſometimes cheriſh ſerious thoughtfulneſs, and lay to heart their miſerable caſe: They are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the revelation of grace and truth in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine word: And ſo a religious concern is more deeply impreſſed, and the ſenſibility of their heart increaſes. And ſometimes when they are made to tremble, as Felix did at the preaching of Paul, they practically ſay with him, "go thy way for this time, and at a more convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee." They take pains to wear off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy impreſſion among vain companions, worldly cares, or carnal pleaſures, ſo quench the Spirit, and become more hardned and ſecure than ever.</p>
            <p>NOW though it muſt be aſcribed to the agency of the good Spirit, that a ſecure ſinner is firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, and then directed and inclined to think upon his ways, to attend the common means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſo ſeek further light and aids from God, yet it cannot be ſaid that the reverſe conduct of other ſinners is owing to any natural or moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity inſeperably connected with an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate. Tis voluntary wickedneſs and folly, which indeed flows from the corruption of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed nature, but is an accidental, not a neceſſary or univerſal effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:010643_0032_0F81BDC794F4D670"/>EVERY kind and degree of knowledge and grace whether common or ſpecial, which God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to communicate to mankind, conveys a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſeek for more. And the firſt end of men's attendance to the means of grace, is ordinarily that they may be excited and enabled in this way to ſeek for further influence and grace of the ſame kind with that which has awakened their attention and endeavours. And tho' this be not what is commonly meant by converting grace,<note n="*" place="bottom">I uſe the word grace here, and in many places in this diſcourſe, to ſignify a divine influence upon the ſoul, of a ſalutary tendency. In this ſenſe the word has been commonly uſed by Chriſtian Writers, for about 1400 years at leaſt; ſo I ſuppoſe it will be well enough underſtood. Whether this be a ſcriptural or the moſt proper ſignification, is a grammatical queſtion which I leave to the critics.</note> yet it has a tendency to converſion, and is preparatory for it, as will be proved in its proper place.</p>
            <p>IT may be added, that men unregenerate may and often do, in ſome ſort, really deſire ſalvation, or the bleſſings which are thro' Chriſt propoſed to men in the goſpel. They have not indeed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect immediate and intuitive perception of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual glory and excellency, as true believers have, who are ſpiritually enlightned and quickned; ſo their deſire of ſalvation has not preciſely the ſame objective ground. But goſpel bleſſings have an excellency and ſuitableneſs to the nature &amp; wants of man, which the unregenerate are capable of perceiving. Every one who is pained with a ſenſe of guilt, and fear of puniſhment, naturally deſires pardon and the favour of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:010643_0033_0F81BDC84A6D7EA0"/>EVERY one who believes that the heavenly ſtate will be happy, naturally deſires to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, whether he has a true notion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this happineſs or not. Yea an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man may in ſome ſort really deſire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of vicious habits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and practice his duty as to the ſubſtance and matter of it. The natural conſcience when well informed acknowledges and approves the righteouſneſs of all God's commands, &amp; condemns every tranſgreſſion of them. This moral ſenſe ſees and feels the obligation of a creature to be obedient to the laws of God. Tho' this natural principle be diſtinct from that divine ſupernatural inſtinct or taſte, which is the foundation of thoſe affections and actions which are holy or ſpiritually good, yet it is a ſubjective ground of men's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the matter of their duty. There is a beauty in virtue, and an uglineſs in vice, which is an immediate object of complacency or diſgſt to mankind in general. Now a man may really deſire to be freed from ſin, and practice his duty, in that view in which his conſcience approves the one and diſapproves the other.<note n="*" place="bottom">That the unregenerate act merely from ſelf love in all their religious performances, has been confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by ſome. An aſſertion which is either imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, or falſe! If it only means, that the ultimate end of their acting is the obtainment of ſomething which they regard as good and agreable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, in this ſenſe we may as truly ſay, that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acts merely from ſelf love. But if the meaning be, that in all that they do they have nothing in view but to advance their own private intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this is contrary to ſcripture, reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There is in human nature a moral taſte, or ſenſe of moral good and evil, which does not ariſe from ſelf love, as the late Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has obſerved, after <hi>Butler, Hutcheſon,</hi> and others. See his diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the nature of virtue.—This doubtleſs has its influence on the conduct of men in general, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on their religious conduct. And to ſay that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners act only from ſelf love in the latter ſenſe, has a direct tendency to ſtrengthen many in a falſe hope: For it will lead them to conclude at once that they are regenerate, when they find that in ſundry inſtances they act from a conſciencious regard to duty, a ſenſe of the equity and reaſonableneſs of God's commands, a natural love of juſtice, a kind concern for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their neighbours, &amp;c. all which may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupernatural principles. The moral ſenſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the ſocial affections, are as natural to man as ſelf-preſervation: And they are evidently diſtinct from each other, notwithſtanding all that has been urged to the contrary by <hi>Hobbes,</hi> or any other. For it is to be obſerved, that the impleaded notion is no other than one of the exploded tenets of <hi>Hobbes,</hi> new vamped. But it is no ſervice to the cauſe of truth, for any one to belie human nature, in order to prove that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved; and diſown thoſe "ſparks of celeſtial fire, which (as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> expreſſes) remain under the aſhes of the apoſtacy."</note>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:010643_0034_0F81BDC979124A60"/>UPON the whole, we may I think reaſſume our concluſion with confidence, that men unregenerate have a power to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, in the ſenſe explained, which is all that has here been contended for. Whether theſe endeavours are better in any reſpect, than a total neglect of them, will be enquired into under the next head.</p>
            <p>TO conclude; we do not pretend that any thing done by a man while in a ſtate of ſin, is of the nature of goſpel holineſs; or that an unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner ever will or can of himſelf ſeek ſalvation
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010643_0035_0F81BDC9DA604DD8"/>
to any purpoſe, without a divine influence prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſiſting him thereunto. It is further granted, that the firſt knowledge and inſtruction we receive in religion, and the firſt influences of the Holy Spirit, are preventive of our deſires, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries or endeavours. And therefore they who are utterly ignorant of the truths of religion, and with whom the Holy Spirit ſtrives not at all, are in their preſent ſtate morally incapable of ſeeking ſalvation. They have indeed a remote capacity for it, in the faculties of their mind, but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power they have not, till their active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and principles are excited, by ſome notices of their need of ſalvation, accompanied with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the good Spirit, moving them to ſeek for it in attendance to the means of grace. But he who has ſo much knowledge and belief of the goſpel as to be convinced that he needs ſalvation, and does not abſolutely deſpair of obtaining it, (which ſurely an unregenerate man may have) ſuch a one has not only a natural power to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, in the manner that has been declared, but his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles or ſprings of action may, by the common influence of the Holy Spirit, be ſo touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and waked up by motives and moral ſuaſion, as that he may have a deſire and will ſo to do; notwithſtanding his impotency, while dead in ſin, to perform any religious duties in a holy ſpiritual manner.</p>

            <head>SERMON II. The Ends for which Duties are requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Unregenerate, and to be performed by them.</head>
            <p>THE nature of the duties ſuppoſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of men in order to converſion, and their power for the performance of them have been conſidered. It will be obſerved, that I have not hitherto offered any direct proof, that theſe duties are preſcribed to the unregenerate, for ſuch an end. Concerning this I ſhall only ſay at preſent, that I think this ſuppoſition is at leaſt countenanced by our text. But be this as it may, it is not my intention to paſs a naked ſuppoſition upon any one in the place of a proof. The truth of this point ſhall in its proper place be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly examined. And in the mean time begging the patience of thoſe who are diſſatisfied (if there, be any ſuch) I ſhall proceed to explain the ſubject a little further, and endeavour to relieve ſome
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010643_0037_0F81BDCB4E4F96E8"/>
further doubts and difficulties, that ſo the way may be better prepared for a more direct confirmation of our capital point.</p>
            <p>AND a very material enquiry will now ariſe, which I muſt endeavour to anſwer as well as I can, viz. Is it reaſonable to think that a man's eternal intereſt can be ſerved by thoſe performances which have not the nature of holy obedience? Can the ſinful doings of the unregenerate be of any avail, except to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their guilt?</p>
            <p>TO this I ſcruple not to ſay, that mens obſerving the duties required of them in the goſpel from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles, is much better than a total neglect and contempt of them; and may be conducive to very valuable purpoſe, no leſs than the ſalvation of their ſouls; as I hope to make appear under the</p>
            <p n="3">III. GENERAL head, which was to conſider why ſinners are to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, and what good end it can be ſuppoſed to anſwer. It is of no ſmall importance that we have right conceptions of this matter: And yet it is more than probable that ſome have wrong notions concerning the ends of mens endeavours in ſeeking ſalvation. I ſhall therefore conſider this point both negatively and poſitively. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SHALL mention ſome wrong ends which men often propoſe in religious duties. There are many, who will do much in religion, and take great pains to frame their lives according to the rules of God's word, while their deſigns herein are ſuch as the goſpel ſtrongly militates againſt. This is the caſe of thoſe who perform duties for ſelf-righteous purpoſes. And though I deny not but that ſelf-righteous endeavours may be a means of good to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010643_0038_0F81BDCC10183188"/>
men, by giving them an experimental conviction of the inſufficiency of their own righteouſneſs and ſtrength, yet no one muſt be encouraged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties for ſuch ends as ought not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or cannot be obtained. On the contrary it ſhould be the care of every one who would ſpeak as it becomes the oracles of God, while exhorting men to the obſervance of duties, to caution againſt all dangerous miſtakes as to the place and uſe of human endeavours. But to be more particular.</p>
            <p>NO one is required to do any thing to atone or ſatisfy for his paſt offences. The goſpel utterly diſallows our attempting the performance of any duty for ſuch an intention. And yet it is natural to mankind, when preſſed with a conviction of guilt, to endeavour the expiation of their paſt crimes, by their future obedience. This has given riſe to a world of ſuperſtition, not only among Pagans, but nominal Chriſtians. Witneſs the auſterities and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory penances impoſed and practiſed in the church of Rome. Nor have Proteſtants been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways free from this error. Many no doubt have thought that their charitable diſtributions to the poor would cover a multitude of ſins. Hence almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and hoſpitals have been erected and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and large ſums given away to the indigent by people in the laſt moments of life, in hopes that this would compenſate for their former miſcarriages. Others have had the ſame intention in their faſtings, prayers and devotional exerciſes. But this is a vain thought. God requires nothing of ſinners as an atonement for ſin. The beſt ſervices of the holieſt man upon earth, yea of the holieſt angel in heaven, will not expiate the guilt of one tranſgreſſion.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010643_0039_0F81BDCD232BEBE8"/>
Surely then unholy performances will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a fit ſatisfaction for multiplied and heinous offences. Our beſt and our worſt actions are alike unavailable in this caſe. Tis the peculiar honour of Chriſt's obedience and ſacrifice to take away the guilt of ſin. His work is fully ſufficient for this purpoſe; none of ours are required, or may be added as coefficient with it.</p>
            <p>NOR are theſe duties required, or to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as meritorious of the favour and kindneſs of God, or as rendring us worthy objects of his mercy. This is the end that ſome have in their religious ſervices. They may indeed own, that it is only the blood of Chriſt the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world: Yet they have a notion of rendring themſelves worthy to have the benefits purchaſed by Chriſt, applied or beſtowed upon them. They have a ſecret thought (tho' they may diſclaim the pretence of merit) that by their reading, hearing, praying, attending ordinances, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reform their manners, there will be ſuch a change in them for the better, ſuch a difference from the profane, that they will hereby become worthy of a favourable regard: And that after they have ſhewn ſo good a diſpoſition, and ſo much reſpect to God's commands, they may be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to advance ſome peculiar claim upon the divine mercy, as ſubjects morally qualified for it, and in ſome ſenſe worthy of it.</p>
            <p>BUT the ſcriptures will juſtify no ſuch concluſions. There we are taught, "that by grace we are ſaved, thro' ſaith, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt." The meritorious procurement of ſalvation is the work of Chriſt, and was finiſhed when he roſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010643_0040_0F81BDCDA33FAA98"/>
from the dead. The gracious purpoſes of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fallen man, had their riſe from his infinite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign mercy, and not from any worthineſs beheld in the ſubject. And after God had decreed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the riches of his grace in ſaving ſome of the lapſed race of men, the atonement and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and not any abſolute or comparative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of ours, is the moral ground or conſideration of the beſtowment of ſalvation upon the veſſels of mercy. It ſeemed meet to infinite wiſdom, that eternal life ſhould be purchaſed for men by a price of ſufficient value, that his holineſs as well as mercy might be glorified, in his beſtowing the greateſt bleſſings upon the ungodly. But no obedience of ours is of any value to purchaſe eternal life. If we had done all that is required of us, we ſhould ſtill have reaſon to ſay that we were unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and deſerved no thanks. For the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience which our natural faculties are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of attaining to, is no more than our preſent duty requires. Muſt it not then be great vanity and preſumption in a ſinner, to think himſelf at all worthy of eternal life, on account of ſuch corrupt and ſinful ſervices as his beſt actions are? Tis not from reſpect to any works of righteouſneſs that we have done, but according to God's mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, that we are delivered from a ſtate of ſin and miſery, and brought into a ſtate of ſalvation. And when men apply themſelves to the practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, that they may thereby recommend themſelves to God, as worthy objects of his ſaving mercy, they, as much as in them lies, fruſtrate the divine grace, and ſubſtitute their own righteouſneſs in that place which the goſpel aſſigns ſolely to the work and atonement of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:010643_0041_0F81BDCE52864F40"/>IT muſt be further added, that theſe duties, of which we are now treating, are not required of men unregenerate as a covenant term or condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God; ſo as that upon their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, they ſhould become intitled, by virtue of God's promiſe, to juſtification and eternal life. We have no covenant-right to eternal life and ſalvation, unleſs we ſtand right according to that rule, by which we are directed to examine ourſelves, whether we are in a ſtate of peace with God, and heirs of ſalvation; and by which mankind will be judged, and their ſtate determined by Chriſt, at the laſt day: That is the goſpel. But no actions or exerciſes of the unconverted anſwer the requirements of the goſpel. All who are in ſuch a ſtate, far from having a promiſe of eternal life, are expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be under condemnation and the wrath of God. Nothing that is wrought in; or done by an impenitent unconverted ſinner, antecedent to faith and converſion, will give him an intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation, according to the goſpel which is (more properly than faith) the inſtrument of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or the rule, according to which the benefits of redemption are applied to, and beſtowed upon men. How diligent and conſcientious ſoever a man may be in ſeeking and ſtriving to obtain ſalvation, till he is truly and effectually converted, he is under condemnation; and then ſurely the promiſes of ſalvation, which are conſtantly limited to believers and penitents, cannot poſſibly belong to him.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, theſe duties are not enjoined on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, nor to be performed by them, as having a promiſe of faith, or the grace of regeneration an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them. We cannot ſay, that God has aſſured impenitent ſinners by any promiſe, that if
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010643_0042_0F81BDCF0692ADA0"/>
they attend to the preſcribed means of grace, they ſhall certainly be born again of the Spirit, and ſo enter into his heavenly kingdom. I know there have been great controverſies, and of long ſtanding, concerning promiſes to the endeavours of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted. It is not my preſent buſineſs to diſpute this point: Others have done it ſufficiently already. I ſhall only ſay, that though there is abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for awakened ſinners to attend the common means of converſion, as ſhall hereafter be proved, yet I muſt acknowledge that I know of no promiſes of regeneration, or effectual grace, that are claimable by any unconverted man. Nor can I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that if there were indeed ſuch promiſes as ſome plead for, they would give any ſatisfaction to thoſe who are thoroughly pained with a conviction of their ſin and guilt. It will not I think be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by any, that there is a promiſe of a ſinner's finding mercy, if his endeavours are cold and ſlack; or if he long delays the buſineſs of ſeeking ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after having been earneſtly called and urged thereunto. But how will a man be able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to the ſatisfaction of an awakened conſcience, with what degree of earneſtneſs a ſinner muſt ſtrive, in order to fulfil the condition of the promiſe; and how ſoon he muſt begin to mind in earneſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of eternity; and whether he may not already have deſerved the matter ſo long, that the promiſed grace may be forfeited irrecoverably. Such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries have, I think, never been anſwered clearly and pertinently; and therefore the ſuppoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they are founded ſeems to have a tendency rather to perplex and diſcourage the moſt ſerious minds, than to give any relief or excitement to duty. For what man whoſe conſcience is not greatly ſeared,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010643_0043_0F81BDD205986F20"/>
but muſt own, that he has given God high provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to caſt him off, and ſhew him no mercy, becauſe he has ſo long neglected the great ſalvation that has been propoſed to him, and ſtill continues not to regard it in any proportion to its importance? I think it will be very preſumptuous for a ſinner to conclude, that God has bound himſelf by promiſe, to extend his ſaving mercy to one who has been ſo dilatory and ſlack, in labouring for the meat which endureth to eternal life, as every unregenerate man, who is thoroughly awakened, muſt be convinced that himſelf has been.</p>
            <p>TO proceed, theſe duties and endeavours of which we now treat, are not preſcribed to us as the means and way to move the divine mercy and pity towards us. No one ought to be encouraged to ſtrive for eternal life, from an expectation that he ſhall hereby excite God's compaſſion towards him. God's mercy is infinite. The communications and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of his goodneſs and grace, are free. Divine mercy does not wait for any good diſpoſitions in us to draw it forth into exerciſe. When God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to manifeſt the glory of his mercy and grace in ſaving ſome of mankind from ſin and death, and accordingly provided and appointed a redeemer for them, he regarded them as miſerable creatures, and at the ſame time moſt unworthy. And in carrying his gracious decree into execution, by applying the benefits of redemption to the veſſels of mercy, his grace prevents all amiable qualifications in them. And if any one is made ſenſible of the danger and miſery of a ſinful ſtate, ſo as that he ſeeks earneſtly to God for deliverance, this muſt be conſidered as an effect of divine mercy, in opening his eyes to ſee his periſhing condition while there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010643_0044_0F81BDD2AEE6ED70"/>
and hope of his being happily ſaved from it. For, as has been already noted, it is owing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace that ſinners are prompted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do any thing, that has any tendency to their ſpiritual advantage.</p>
            <p>I MUST only add, that the duties or endeavours which God has preſcribed to the unregenerate, are not preſcribed becauſe there is any ſpiritual goodneſs in the performances of ſuch perſons. We ought not to think, that actions flowing merely from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles are goſpel holineſs, or will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved accepted and rewarded by God as ſuch. Men cannot rightly take encouragement to attend the means of converſion, by imagining that ſuch an attendance as they while unconverted are capable of giving, will be regarded by God, as having the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of holy obedience. On the contrary they ſhould be humbly ſenſible, that till their natures are ſavingly renewed, their moſt ſerious and earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are ſinful, thro' a defect in the principle and end. Indeed the beſt actions of men unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are good in ſome reſpects, and in their proper place; and from this conſideration, among others, they may with propriety be exhorted to duties; as ſhall be ſhewn preſently. But nothing done by men antecedent to converſion, is in the eſtimation of God evangelical holineſs.</p>
            <p>THUS far I have endeavoured to ſhew for what purpoſes the duties we are now treating of are not required, and am willing to acknowledge we ought not to think that any endeavours of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate will avail to expiate their paſt ſins, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to God as worthy objects of his favour, or give them a covenant title to ſalvation, or the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010643_0045_0F81BDD386406EF0"/>
grace of regeneration, or move the divine pity and mercy towards them, nor are they of the nature of goſpel holineſs. And whoever conſiders the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a practical view, will I hope indulge my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging a little on the negative part, ſince tis likely that many are in danger of acting from ſuch miſtaken ends and views as have here been mentioned. And hence inſtead of being guided to Chriſt, and having their eyes directed to him, as the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world, they are turned and fixed on a deluſion; and ſo are in danger of ſpending their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which will not ſatisfy them.</p>
            <p>BUT the enquiry ſtill remains, why then are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners commanded to labour for the meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life? Of what benefit can their endeavours be to them with regard to their eternal intereſt? I muſt therefore attempt a more direct and poſitive anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>AND in general, our obſervance of theſe duties is required as the ordinary method and means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is pleaſed to prepare a ſinner for, and then communicate to him that ſaving grace, light and life, whereby he becomes a new creature, and is enabled and diſpoſed unto theſe exerciſes and acts which are ſpiritually good, and with which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the goſpel promiſes, eternal life is connected. And accordingly a ſinner ought to attend to them as the way or means in which God has required and encouraged him to ſeek an intereſt in theſe benefits and bleſſings.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be proper to examine this matter more cloſely and particularly. I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider firſt, why God requires ſinners to labour for
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010643_0046_0F81BDD44B015E18"/>
the meat which endureth to everlaſting life. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why ſinners are to obſerve and do what is thus required of them. Theſe are quite different conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, &amp; muſt be diſtinguiſhed accordingly. The former reſpects God's end in commanding, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our end in obeying. The one will lead us to enquire into the reaſons and deſigns of infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in giving theſe precepts to men; the other will give us occaſion to examine the motives and views upon which men are perſuaded and influenced to practiſe the duties therein preſcribed. God's ends in commanding are moſt wiſe, holy and good; but unregenerate ſinners are morally incapable of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for holy ends, till they are endowed with new and ſupernatural principles. By following out and carrying in mind this diſtinction between God's end in requiring, and our end in performing the duties, we are treating of, we may be able to anſwer our preſent enquiry diſtinctly. Whence it will appear, that as it is agreable to the divine perfections to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire theſe duties of ſinners, ſo the obſervance of them may and ought to be inculcated upon all the hearers of the goſpel, and that from ſuch motives as are ſuited to reach their conſciences, and influence their practice.</p>
            <p>FIRST, What are thoſe ends for which God has required ſinners to labour, in a diligent uſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed means, for the meat which endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life? I anſwer, that in ſubordination to his own glory, God has a twofold end in preſcribing theſe duties to men. His primary deſign herein is that he may glorify the riches of his goodneſs and mercy, in calling and recovering ſinners from the corruption and miſery of their fallen ſtate, to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of thoſe benefits, which Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010643_0047_0F81BDD522C8FBC8"/>
for the veſſels of mercy. Or in the Apoſtle's words, "that they may be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth." And in caſe men neglect or refuſe to attend to theſe preſcribed means, and ſo fail of obtaining that grace and ſalvation which is propoſed to them, to be by them ſought in this way, then it is God's deſign, that they being left without excuſe, having no cloak for their ſin, his juſtice may be glorified in their condemnation.</p>
            <p>AS human endeavours are the appointed means by which God gives and we obtain the meat that periſheth, ſo human endeavours are alſo the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means in and by which God beſtows and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of eternal life. And he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſinners to read and hear, and meditate on his word, to implore his mercy, to avoid wilful ſins, and temptations thereunto, becauſe it is his will that they ſhould be awakened to conſideration, convinced of their miſerable ſtate by ſin, taken off from falſe confidences, and, deſpairing of help in themſelves, attend to, believe, and acquieſce joyfully in, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation or propoſal of mercy in the goſpel, thro' the obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt, and be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thro' the truth and Holy Spirit. And it is God's will to awaken and humble them, to work faith and holineſs in them, in the way of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to theſe preſcribed duties. Theſe are, by the appointment and bleſſing of God, means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the work of converſion is effected. They are accordingly made uſe of by him in fulfilling the good pleaſure of his goodneſs. And he has commanded and encouraged men to uſe theſe means, becauſe he has deſigned that his commands &amp; encouragements ſhould influence and perſuade them ſo to do, that they may hereby receive that benefit, and his grace
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010643_0048_0F81BDD5C9E4DE10"/>
that glory, which is ultimately aimed at in and by them. And if ſinners ſet at nought theſe counſels and commands, ſtill his word ſhall accompliſh his pleaſure, and not return to him void. The mouth of the impenitent ſhall hereby be ſtopped; they ſhall be left without excuſe; and God ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when he ſpeaketh, and clear when he judgeth.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be further enquired, why God is pleaſed to preſcribe and uſe theſe means in effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating his holy and gracious purpoſes? It may be ſufficient to anſwer, becauſe thus it has ſeemed good in his ſight. If it ſhall appear (as I truſt it will in its proper place) that this is in fact God's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary method in the diſpenſation of ſaving bleſſings, we ought to be ſatisfied, tho' we ſhould not be able to enter into the reaſons of the divine appointment herein. But beſides, there are ſeveral conſiderations which may lead us to conclude, that it was wiſe and fit that God ſhould have an eſtabliſhed method of working in the kingdom of grace, as well as nature: That he ſhould make uſe of means in the converſion, as well as preſervation of men: And that this method which he hath eſtabliſhed, and theſe means which he makes uſe of are wiſely choſen, being well adapted to ſubſerve the deſigns of his mercy. As there is a beauty and wiſdom apparent in that regular ſubordination of cauſes and effects which is eſtabliſhed in the natural world, ſo the ſame appears in a higher degree in that connection and dependance of antecedents and conſequents, means and ends, which is conſtituted in the government of the intelligent and moral world. And this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of dealing with and working upon mankind; which we plead for, appears to be well ſuited to the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010643_0049_0F81BDD6941791E8"/>
nature of rational and active beings; and will ſerve to diſplay abundantly not only the grace of God in the ſalvation of his elect, but alſo his juſtice in the condemnation of impenitent ſinners, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting an eaſy account of that increaſe of guilt and puniſhment, which they will in the coming world be the ſubjects of, who reject the offers of ſalvation in the goſpel. But to enquire into theſe things is beſide our preſent purpoſe. If it ſhall appear that this is the method in which the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of redemption are applied or conveyed to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we ought to be ſatisfied, without diſputing the fitneſs of God's appointments.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall now, in the ſecond place, conſider for what ends ſinners are to attend to theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed means.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it is granted that men ought always to act for holy ends, from that love which is the prime effect of a ſpiritual view of divine glory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the goſpel; inaſmuch as the want here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is owing to a criminal blindneſs; yet tis eaſy to ſee, that this anſwer does not ſatisfy our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enquiry. For ſince the unregenerate are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of this blindneſs, they are plainly in a moral incapacity of acting for holy ends, till the eyes of their underſtanding are ſavingly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If then no kind or manner of acting be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired or encouraged at all in the word of God, but what neceſſarily includes or preſuppoſes faith and regeneration, then all enquiries about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and encouragements to duty, as means of obtaining faith, or the grace of regeneration, are plainly at an end. A ſuppoſition which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will not allow. Wherefore, that I may
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010643_0050_0F81BDD80EEF5958"/>
give as clear an anſwer to this enquiry as I can, I would obſerve—</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) No man may do any acts of religious obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for ſuch ends as are ſimply and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unlawful. Such ſacrifices are in a peculiar ſenſe an abomination to the Lord; and will high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke his wrath and jealouſy againſt ſuch as preſume to offer them. This was what rendred the long prayers of the Phariſees ſo odious in God's ſight, that they uſed and deſigned them as a cloak to their unmerciful and unrighteous practices, <hi>in devouring widows houſes,</hi> and <hi>neglecting the weightier points of the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THOUGH men unregenerate are morally incapable of obeying any divine precept for holy ends, they are yet capable of acting from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſuch ends as, however deficient, are not ſimply unlawful, but in their place and kind are good and worthy to be regarded. They may have ſo much knowledge of God, and his will, and their obligations to obedience, as to be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced hereby to do many things good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and commanded by God. They may for inſtance be perſuaded that an attendance to the preſcribed means of grace is their wiſeſt courſe, in order to obtain further light and inſtruction, that ſo they may eſcape the wrath and curſe of God, and obtain that happineſs which nature prompts all men to ſeek for. A regard to their own future and eternal intereſt, may influence them to an obſervance of theſe duties, and ſo keep them waiting upon God in the appointed ways, in which he is pleaſed to grant his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:010643_0051_0F81BDD8C66E5108"/>NOW though there be an eſſential defect in the obedience of the unregenerate, with reſpect to the ends of their actions, ſo that they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated holy, yet we cannot ſay, that it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unlawful for men to have a regard to their own happineſs, and endeavour to eſcape thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils with which they are threatned. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for men to act agreable to the preſent light and conviction of their mind concerning their duty and intereſt, though their minds be not ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly enlightned; yea it is undoubtedly the duty of every one to do ſo. The natural conſcience of man bears witneſs to the obligation he is under to obey the commands of God. When therefore the mind of a ſinner is ſo far enlightned, as that he is perſuaded, and convinced that God has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to attend to the ordinary means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and converſion, though he may not have a juſt conception of the nature, and divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that change of heart, which theſe means are deſigned to effect, thro' the bleſſing of God, and influence of the good Spirit, certainly it is lawful, yea it is his duty, to act from a regard to ſuch a conviction and perſuaſion. When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine call in the word has reached his ears, and the truth therein revealed has found acceſs to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo far as to produce a conviction that the goſpel is a divine revelation of mercy to mankind, tis certainly lawful, yea an indiſpenſable duty, that he attend to it; though he may have no ſpiritual apprehenſion of the nature of the bleſſings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in propoſed, or the way in which men come to the enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p>TRUE holineſs implies a regard to higher and nobler ends, than any which an unregenerate man
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010643_0052_0F81BDDDACC66700"/>
aims at; but it does not exclude a regard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ends in a due ſubordination: Which ſhews, clearly that it is not ſimply unlawful to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to inferior ends in our actions. Such ends are in their place right and good. To inſtance in ſelf-love. Tis not ſimply unlawful for a man to ſeek his own happineſs: Yea tis fit and right that he should do ſo. But if he aims at nothing more than to ſecure his own private intereſt, tho' he may uſe no unlawful means, there is nothing of holineſs or true virtue in his conduct; yea it is ſinfully deficient in reſpect of the end. But the fault does not conſiſt in his acting for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful end, but in neglecting thoſe ends which ought to have been regarded. The goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes rewards and puniſhments as motives to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which are directly ſuited and deſigned by God, to work upon the natural principle of ſelf-love; whence tis evident that our own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs may and ought to be regarded by us, in the higheſt acts of holy obedience. Yea God has enforced his precepts by much lower motives, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven temporal promiſes and threatnings; and that not only to Jew, but Chriſtians. Says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is.</hi> And again,<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 6.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>Honour thy father and mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayeſt live long upon the earth.</hi> Says another,<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3.10—13.</note> 
               <hi>For he that will love life, and ſee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they ſpeak no guile; let him eſchew evil and do good; let him ſeek peace and enſue it. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers, but the face of the Lord is againſt them that
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010643_0053_0F81BDDE6C3E6698"/>
do evil. And who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> If there be any pertinency and force in theſe arguments and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to chriſtian duties, then it is not unſuitable for chriſtians to have reſpect to temporal bleſſings, in their obedience to the laws of Chriſt. Indeed theſe things are not the higheſt end we are to act for; but this is doubtleſs a lawful end, yea a good end in its place. In ſhort, if what men aim at be lawful &amp; good in itſelf, whether of a higher or lower kind, they then act for a lawful and good end, though through a ſinful defect, their actions may be unholy. To proceed—</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) DUTIES performed in ſuch a manner, and for ſuch ends as the unregenerate are capable of, are preferable to a total omiſſion and wilful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them. That men obſerve the matter of God's commands from natural principles, from common light, grace and aſſiſtance, and for infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ends, is better than not to do it at all. Such actions are as to their matter and ſubſtance (as Divines ſpeak) agreable to the command of God, therefore good; but the neglect is contrary to the divine precept, therefore ſimply evil, every way wrong, having no goodneſs belonging to it. And as to the end which ſinners have regard to in the performance of commanded duties, from which actions take their form, this is indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and ſo unholy. Yet the end of ſuch actions is not ſo oppoſite to true holineſs, as the end of neglecting &amp; deſpiſing the matter of God's commands. It diſcovers extreme malignity and contempt of God, when men wilfully act in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the preſent light of their minds, and convictions of conſcience. Moreover, actions
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010643_0054_0F81BDDED44A0010"/>
good in themſelves, tho' defective in their end, are better in their tendency &amp; effects, than thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are every way evil. God and his laws are not thereby ſo much diſhonoured. There is leſs abuſe, and outrageous violence done to our rational and moral faculties, our reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The Holy Spirit is not ſo deſpitefully reſiſted. There is not ſo much miſchief done to our fellow creatures. The virtuous and religious actions of unſanctified perſons, have a good and happy tendency in divers reſpects. They are good and profitable to the world: And they are attended with manifold advantages to the perſons who do them.

               </note> Though it muſt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010643_0056_0F81BDE04BABD6B8"/>
be owned that one thing is wanting, yet we muſt ſay alſo, that there is in them leſs evil and more good, than in a total, wilful and malicious neglect of them.</p>
            <p>IT is the duty of the unregenerate to obſerve and practice the duties, which God has in his word enjoined on them, from ſuch principles, and for ſuch ends as have been mentioned, rather than not at all. This is a plain inference from what has been before obſerved. The divine command binds upon us both the matter and end of the duties it preſcribes. However then the end and manner of action in the unregenerate be defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, they are undoubtedly bound to perform the matter of the duty required of them. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of commanded duties is good in itſelf, and as ſuch is bound upon all men, conſidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly from the manner and end of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. We ought indeed to act for holy ends, but we ought to do what God has commanded for inferior and defective ends, provided they are not in their own nature ſimply unlawful, rather than not do it at all. To neglect doing any thing that God has commanded, or to do what he has forbidden, is in itſelf evil. Whoever then does
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010643_0057_0F81BDE108958A50"/>
what is materially good, and commanded by God, therein does as he ought to do: That is, he does his duty ſo far, he avoids ſin; for if he had done contrary, he had done what is directly forbidden, and ſinful. Nor does this imply that it is a man's duty of two ſins to chuſe the leaſt. He ought in ſuch a caſe to chuſe neither. But he ought to do what is good, tho' in a defective unholy manner, rather than do what is every way ſinful.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, we may give a diſtinct anſwer to our preſent enquiry, viz. why, or for what reaſons or ends are ſinners to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, in a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance to the preſcribed means of grace before declared. They ought to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel, and obey all the precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, from a true faith in God, and in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt the redeemer, from a holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, love &amp; gratitude, for the majeſty and grace diſplayed in the work of redemption. But they are morally incapable of acting from ſuch views and ends as theſe, till they have a ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; yet they are capable of performing the matter of the duties required, from lower views, from natural principles, and a different kind of light and influence from the Holy Spirit. And it is their duty, and they have encouragement to do what God has required of them, in ſuch a manner and for ſuch ends as theſe, however defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, rather than not at all. Till their hearts are divinely renewed, and their minds ſavingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, they are to attend upon the inſtituted means of grace, from a conviction of conscience that God has commanded them to do ſo, and it
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010643_0058_0F81BDE2124E4780"/>
is their duty to obey. They are to do it from a deſire of further light and inſtruction, which God has directed them to ſeek for in this way. They are to do it from a ſerious concern, if it may be, to find reſt to their weary ſouls, to flee from the wrath to come, &amp; obtain reconciliation with God.</p>
            <p>AND if the foregoing concluſions are juſt, we may infer, that ſinners, however incapable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a holy manner, are to be exhorted to the duties preſcribed to them in the word of God. Theſe things are to be inforced upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences by the authority of God; by the terrors of his wrath againſt preſumptuous tranſgreſſors; the riches of his grace, and the excellency of the bleſſings revealed in the goſpel. All the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which the ſcripture holds forth to thoſe who wait upon God in his appointed ways, and the danger of reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart againſt conviction muſt be declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We muſt bear witneſs to the truth revealed in the goſpel, concerning Jeſus Chriſt, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and work, his power, merits and grace, appearing in what he has done, and ſaid, and in his name beſeech you to be reconciled to God. In brief, we muſt addreſs their reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, their hopes and fears, with all thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful motives, whereby the precepts of the goſpel come recommended and enforced.</p>
            <p>IF it be aſked, to what purpoſe it is to exhort and preſs men to acts of religious obedience, while they are incapable of complying in a holy manner? I anſwer, that if God has required theſe things, for ſuch ends as have been declared, then chriſtians muſt inculcate the practice of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on all who hear the call of the goſpel, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their moral impotency to do any thing
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010643_0059_0F81BDE295A14310"/>
that is ſpiritually good. For it is the will and command of God that his precepts be inculcated on thoſe to whom they are given, whether they have a preſent power to obey in a right manner or not. If he has required and encouraged his ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thus to wait upon him for his mercy, they ought certainly to be exhorted ſo to do. I ſay not that they are to be exhorted to perform duties in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, but however they ought to do them in ſuch a manner as they can; and not indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a neglect of what God has commanded, tho' they are morally unable to obey as they ought. There is encouragement (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) for ſinners to ſeek ſalvation by attending thoſe means which God has preſcribed. And this is a ſufficient reaſon why preachers ſhould direct and exhort them to ſuch a conduct, and lay before them all the encouraging and quickning motives that their caſe admits of.</p>
            <p>NOR have they any reaſon to conclude that their labour will be in vain. Such exhortations may have a happy effect, nothwithſtanding the moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of thoſe to whom they are addreſſed. For, Firſt, it will not be denyed, that ſinners may hereby be perſuaded to obſerve the ſubſtance and matter of God's commands, from thoſe principles before ſpoken of. So much as this may be effected in men unregenerate by moral ſuaſion alone. And ſuch a performance of duties as this is much better than a total neglect and contempt of them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are reſtrained from ſuch courſes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous wickedneſs, as not only inhance their guilt, but induce and ſtrengthen vicious habits, ſear the conſcience, quench the Spirit, and ſo render their converſion in a manner hopeleſs. And by
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010643_0060_0F81BDE3E0B4FC60"/>
attending theſe duties, ſinners are kept in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of God's bleſſing; but by neglecting them, they put far away the ordinary means of converſion, But beſides theſe advantages which were mentioned before, it muſt be conſidered, that in and by thoſe calls and exhortations to duty, which are addreſſed to men in the miniſtry of the word, God is pleaſed to communicate that grace and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his good Spirit, whereby ſinners are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and perſuaded to believe and repent, and turn to God through Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>There is a double end in preſſing on men the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of duties with the ſuppoſition of the ſtate of impotency. (1.) To prevent them from ſuch courſes of ſin as would harden them, and ſo render their converſion more difficult, if not deſperate.— (2.) To exerciſe a means appointed of God for their converſion, or the communication of ſaving grace unto them. Such are God's commands, and ſuch are the duties required in them. In and by them God doth use to communicate of his grace to the ſouls of men, not with reſpect to them as their duties, but as they are ways appointed and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him unto ſuch ends. And hence it follows, that even ſuch duties as are vitiated in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, yet are of advantage to them by whom they are performed. For (1.) By attendance to them, they are preſerved from many ſins. (2.) In an eſpecial manner from the great ſin of deſpiſing God, which ends commonly in that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. (3.) They are hereby made uſeful to others, and many ends of God's glory in the world. (4.) They are kept in God's way, wherein they may gradually be brought over to a real converſion to him.</q>

                     <hi>Owen on the Spirit,</hi> pag. 249.</bibl>
               </note> And hence, the calls and exhortations of the goſpel are termed the vehicles or conveyances of grace. However un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men may be to perform aright the duties to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010643_0061_0F81BDE406401518"/>
which they are exhorted, chriſtians have yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to inculcate theſe duties on all the hearers of the goſpel; and theſe have alſo great encouragement to attend ſeriouſly, and endeavour to obey ſuch calls and exhortations to duty, ſince the ſalutary influences of the good Spirit of grace and truth are ordinarily communicated by this medium.</p>
            <p>NOW of the things which have been ſpoken, this is the ſum. God has holy and gracious ends in commanding and encouraging unregenerate perſons, as well as others, to attend diligently the outward means, wherein the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth is conveyed, and the benefits of redemption applied to the ſouls of his people. Theſe commands and encouragements are given to ſinners, that they might hereby be perſuaded to wait upon him for his mercy, in this way which infinite wiſdom has appointed; that ſo God may glorify the riches of his free grace, in their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>AND though it muſt be owned, that ſinners are incapable of acting for holy ends, yet they are capable of acting from a regard to ſuch ends as are ſo far right and good, that they may and ought to be exhorted and encouraged to perform duties in ſuch a manner, rather than not at all. Such performances are preferable to a total neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God's commands. Notwithſtanding what is amiſs or defective, they may be, and ordinarily are a means of good to men, both in this world, and the world to come. It is not becauſe men perform theſe duties in a right manner, and with a holy intention, that they have ſo deſirable an iſſue, but becauſe this is the way in which God
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010643_0062_0F81BDE79F789C30"/>
has thought fit to fulfil the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and carry into execution the purpoſes of his grace towards the ſons of men. God's deſigns in giving theſe commands are indeed different from theirs in obeying them. They are by a ſecret influence led in a way that they know not, and find themſelves at laſt conducted whither at their firſt ſetting out they thought not of arriving. In the progreſs of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they find their apprehenſions and views much altered from what they were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. When the light of the glorious goſpel ſhines with a transforming power into their hearts, it diſcovers to them their former darkneſs and miſtakes. The charm is now diſſolved (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) whereby ſatan held them under his dominion. Thoſe falſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with which they were deluded, vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: And they ſee that they have been walking upon inchanted ground. They are then ready to acknowledge, that however this bleſſed change may have been effected in the way of means, it is God who worketh all in all: Who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, and tranſlated them from the kingdom of ſatan, into the kingdom of his dear ſon.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus largely explained the ſubject, and ſtated ſeveral preliminary points, which ſeemed neceſſary to be enquired into in order to prepare the way for what is propoſed to be mainly inſiſted on, I ſhall in the next place enter upon the direct proof and vindication of our doctrine, which ſhall be the buſineſs of ſome following diſcourſes.</p>

            <head>SERMON III. That the Converſion and Salvation of ſome Sinners, is more probable than of others.</head>
            <p>IT is now time that we proceed to the fourth general head, which was to prove that unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are bound and encouraged to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life. As this is the main point I undertook to defend, and the pertinency and practical uſe of what has hitherto been offered depends upon the truth of it, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to examine this matter ſomething largely.</p>
            <p>I JOIN obligation and encouragement together; for I ſhall inſiſt upon no arguments, but ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and carry encouragement, as well as obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obedience. To preſs duties upon ſinners only with legal reaſons, and for legal ends, that they may hereby work out a perfect righteouſneſs by which they may be juſtified in the ſight of God, will have no tendency to excite their endeavours to comply with them, but only fill them with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010643_0064_0F81BDE885FA9038"/>
diſquietments. Such reaſons will only prove reaſons of deſpair, to him who knows that he has already ſinned, and that it is abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould ſo comply with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as to obtain juſtification and eternal life by the deeds of the law. Tis not ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe to ſhew that men ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe duties, unleſs we can propoſe ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable end which may be attained by ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them as they are capable of; that ſo they may be induced thereunto by the hope and proſpect of obtaining it.</p>
            <p>THIS being premiſed, in order to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the true ſtate of the queſtion, I ſhall proceed to the proof of the doctrine propoſed to be defended.</p>
            <p>AND the firſt argument ſhall be taken from the probability and hope there is that they who ſeek ſalvation in the way of attendance to the duties before ſpoken of ſhall obtain it, and the danger that they will periſh in their ſin who neglect them. If they are moſt likely to obtain eternal life who thus ſtrive for it, and they are in greateſt: danger of everlaſting perdition who will not in this way endeavour to eſcape it, then it is the duty and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all, to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, and ſtrive earneſtly to flee from the wrath to come. Every one who apprehends that there is any hope or poſſibility that he may be ſaved, and that any thing which he is able to do will tend either to promote or hinder his ſalvation, is bound and encouraged to ſuch a conduct as will have the moſt hopeful aſpect on his final happineſs. This I think no man will or can deny. All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is neceſſary to be proved in this place is,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010643_0065_0F81BDE962D5E090"/>
that ſuch as attend the common means of grace and ſalvation, have a probability of obtaining it; and they who refuſe ſo to do, are in peculiar hazard of periſhing in their ſins.</p>
            <p>BUT before I proceed to the proof of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I would offer one word by way of expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. That when we ſpeak of probability in any caſe, it muſt be underſtood only in reference to the judgment which men make concerning things; or the view in which things are preſented to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the human mind. There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability with God. He beholds every thing as it is, with a certain and intuitive view. He knows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly all things that ever have been, are, or will be through the immeaſurable ages of an endleſs dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Tis not at all uncertain with him who will have everlaſting life. But we can judge of things only from ſuch degrees of evidence as our limited and feeble faculties can diſcern, which in moſt caſes is too ſmall to ſupport a certain and infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. This lower degree of evidence is called probability. When therefore we ſay there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that ſuch as diligently ſeek ſalvation in the uſe of preſcribed means ſhall obtain it, and that they who do not ſhall fail of it, the meaning is, that theſe things commonly go together; that God oftener extends his ſaving mercy to thoſe who thus wait upon him, than to thoſe who neglect ſo to do. And therefore that there is more ground to hope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in one caſe, than in the other. What the degree of probability is, is another queſtion, which we may perhaps be better able to judge of when we come to the cloſe of the preſent argument. The propoſition before us will, I ſuppoſe, be ſufficiently proved, if it ſhall be made to appear—</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:010643_0066_0F81BDEA43394D58"/>I. THAT ſome who are not in a ſtate of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, are more likely to attain thereunto than others.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT what manifeſts the ſtate of ſome to be more hopeful, than that of others, either conſiſts in, or is connected with, and depends upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in attending the ordinary means of grace.</p>
            <p n="1">I. SOME who are not in a ſtate of acceptance with God, are more likely to arrive at it than others. Some who are not yet ſavingly converted, may be much more likely than many others to attain to this happy change. To illuſtrate this, I ſhall firſt prove from ſcripture that it is true; and then ſecondly ſhew in what reſpects ſome are in a more hopeful caſe than others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SHALL ſhew that it is agreable to ſcripture to ſay that the caſe of ſome is more hopeful, and their converſion and ſalvation more probable than that of others. This is ſo manifeſt, that they who are moſt inclined to oppoſe it are, I think, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times compelled to acknowledge it, when its evidence ſhines full in their face. Some plain ſcripture teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſhall be briefly called over in its confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ſuch remarks as may ſhew their perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>WE are expreſly taught by our Saviour's words to the Scribe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mark 12.34.</note> that a man who is not yet a ſubject of his ſpiritual kingdom, may be not far from it. "When Jeſus ſaw that he anſwered diſcreetly, he ſaid to him, thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Which words moſt naturally carry this meaning, that he had juſter notions of religion; and the ſtate of his mind was ſuch, that it was more
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:010643_0067_0F81BDEAD3D0F7B0"/>
likely according to human rules of probability, that he ſhould attain to a true underſtanding and belief of the doctrines of the goſpel, and ſo become his diſciple, than the other Scribes and Phariſees, whoſe religious ſentiments were ſo corrupt, their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt Chriſt: and his doctrine ſo ſtrong and rooted, and who oppoſed the cleareſt evidences of his divine miſſion with moſt unreaſonable perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and blaſphemous malice. I think that nothing but a ſtrong attachment to prejudicate notions would incline any one to accommodate an oppoſite inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to ſo plain an expreſſion. But yet our Saviour's words carry a ſtrong intimation that this ſcribe was not at that time a true believer in him. We have here then an example of one who, by the teſtimony of Chriſt, was comparatively near to the kingdom of God; one who though not ſavingly converted to the faith of Chriſt, had made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards it.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>THIS may alſo be inferred from what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach concerning the kingdom of God coming to a place and people. <q>It is a great bleſſing to mankind to have the ſcripture among them.</q> When the light of the goſpel ſhines among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are highly favoured in compariſon with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010643_0068_0F81BDEB874E54B0"/>
who are left in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death. If the Jew had the advantage of the Gentile much every way, becauſe they were favoured with peculiar religious privileges, and chiefly becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them were committed the oracles of God; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the advantage of having the divine oracles is greater now, inaſmuch as the light and inſtruction they are fitted to diffuſe, is much clearer than the Jews enjoyed. But why is this to be accounted a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege? Is it not plainly becauſe they who enjoy theſe outward means are more likely than others to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth? Where God is pleaſed in his providence to ſend and ſet up the light of the goſpel, we have good grounds to conclude, that he has deſigned that it ſhall be effectual to the converſion &amp; ſalvation of ſome who hear it. Accordingly the apoſtle Paul was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to preach the goſpel at Corinth boldly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was aſſured by the Lord, that he had much people in that city. Can any one, who conſiders the matter with attention, really believe, that the moſt ignorant pagan is as near the kingdom of God, and as likely to underſtand &amp; believe the truth ſavingly, as that ſinner to whom God has ſent the word of ſalvation, and whoſe attention to it is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, that he ſtudies it diligently, and with a great concern about his ſoul's ſalvation, though he is not yet a true believer? Or, that a child who is brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, is altogether as likely to periſh eternally, as he who is inſtructed in nothing but corrupt principles, and lewd practices?<note n="*" place="bottom">

aſſert this muſt not only ſhut his eyes againſt the cleareſt light of his own reaſon, and all appearances of fact, but alſo blot out this plain text, with many others, from his bible, "Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 22.6.</note> He muſt ſay, in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the apoſtle, that a man who hears not the outward call of the goſpel, is as likely to obtain faith, as one who does. For if faith comes by hearing,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 10.17.</note> then they to whom the word of faith is preached, and who hear it, are in a more hopeful caſe than they whom the found of the goſpel has never reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and according to human probability never will. How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? The form of expreſſion plainly intimates the impoſſibility of ſuch a ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>WE find alſo that it is ſpoken of as a moſt awful judgment, when the kingdom of God is taken from a people. But why is this ſo terrible a judgment, but becauſe when men are deprived of the means of grace, they are given up, as it were, to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of ſatan, left without hope, and without God in the world? But if no one ſinner is nearer the kingdom of God than another, with what propriety can it be ſaid to be ſent to, or taken away from any? If the caſe of one is every whit as hopeful, and his ſalvation as probable as that of any other who is not actually juſtified, then thoſe unhappy creatures, who are in awful judgment thus abandoned as it were to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010643_0070_0F81BDEDE88E2038"/>
perdition, are as likely to be ſaved as any perſons in the world who are not now in a ſtate of ſalvation. Which is a ſuppoſition ſo repugnant to ſcripture, reaſon and obſervation, that I think it needleſs to ſay any thing more in confutation of it.</p>
            <p>WE learn alſo from the ſcriptures, that ſinners are ſometimes given up by God to judicial hardneſs of heart. The Holy Spirit which once ſtrove with them, enlightning their minds, awakening their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencies, and exciting ſerious thoughts and concern about their eternal intereſts, after having been often reſiſted and quenched, at length departs, and ſtrives with them no longer. Of ſuch the apoſtle ſpeaks,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. 2.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Of like import are the words of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me; ſo I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 81.11, 12.</note> We read alſo of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin and blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which ſhall never be forgiven.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. 12.31.</note>

Yea ſhould it be ſuppoſed that the caſe of no man is abſolutely deſperate ſo long as he lives, yet theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions muſt imply, that the caſe of ſome is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly dangerous; which is ſufficient for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe.</p>

               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Upon theſe words we have this remark (in the Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary correſpondence between S. P. and R. S letter 6.) "The great reaſon why this exchange of honour or charity hindered men from believing, and humanly ſpeaking rendred it impoſſible for them to admit the ſaving truth, was, that it ſeared their conſciences with a conceit of their excellency above other men before God, ſo rendred it impoſſible for them to admit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin."—And again. "Among people zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous about faith, where the buſineſs of believing is their very righteouſneſs, and where the great emulation is, who ſhall be the moſt dexterous believers, it muſt be the hardeſt of all things to faſten a conviction of unbelief." I do not think that it is intended in theſe remarks to intimate either that the conviction &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſome is more difficult than that of others, in reſpect of the power of God, or that without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine agency and influence, it is in the power of man either to admit the ſaving truth into his own mind, or faſten a conviction of ſin and unbelief upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of any. I think both the text and gloſs ought to be underſtood as ſpoken in accommodation to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man views of things, and human rules of probability. But at any rate I ſhould conclude that this ſentiment is fully implied in both, viz. That ſome are in a more dangerous caſe than others, leſs likely to admit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, and of the ſaving truth.</note> And on another occaſion he tells the

               <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and harlots believed him; and ye when ye had ſeen it repented not afterwards, that ye might believe him.</hi> Theſe Jews, as appears by the evangelical hiſtory, oppoſed with the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs all means of conviction. They were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately prejudiced againſt Chriſt and his doctrine. Their hearts were hardned, and their conſcience ſeared more than looſe and ſcandalous ſinners. And therefore Chriſt told them, that they were farther from the kingdom of God, and leſs likely to enter in than they whoſe characters they accounted moſt infamous. But with what propriety this could be ſaid, if no one unbeliever is more likely than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enter into the kingdom of God, I cannot underſtand.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtles declare plainly, that the caſe of ſome ſinners, particularly apoſtates from the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, after great degrees of common il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, joy, and ſpiritual gifts, is peculiarly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010643_0073_0F81BDF179F4CEA8"/>
and in a manner deſperate. Thus we read,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 6.4.</note> 
               <hi>It is impoſſible for thoſe who have been once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, ſeeing they crucify to themſelves the ſon of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> And again,<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 10. 26.</note> 
               <hi>If we ſin wilfully after that we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin; but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adverſaries.</hi> Much of the ſame import are the words of Peter,<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>If after they have eſcaped the pollution of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning.

               <hi>That when the unclean Spirit, after having been caſt out of a man, returns and enters into him again with ſeven worſe ſpirits, the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.</hi> Can any one after reading, and duly weighing theſe paſſages of ſcripture, really think that it was the intent of Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to ſignify that perſons of ſuch characters were in as hopeful a caſe, and as likely to be ſaved, humanly ſpeaking, as any others who are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally juſtified. If any ſuch there be, methinks it were ſomewhat inconſiſtent for them to ſuggeſt that
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010643_0074_0F81BDF187E7BE20"/>
ſelf-righteous ſinners are twofold more the children of hell than the profane. For if ſo, it ſeems that in reſpect of probability of ſalvation, there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the caſe of the fervent devotee, and the ringleader in profaneneſs and exceſs. And there is ground to ſuggeſt to the latter ſome favourable ſymptom in his condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I PROCEED now in the next place, to conſider, as was propoſed, what it is that renders, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts the condition of one ſinner more hopeful than that of another. It is neceſſary that we examine this matter carefully, and have clear and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate conceptions of it, in order to judge whether human endeavours have here any place and uſe, and if they have, in what reſpect, and how far they are uſeful and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>IN general, whatever it be that renders the caſe of mankind more or leſs hopeful, 'tis ſomething that lies open to human obſervation, either immediately, or by means of its effects or concomitants. For it is to be remembred, that probability reſpects the views and judgments of men, and not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or decrees of God. When therefore the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak of events as more or leſs probable, it is neceſſarily implied, that there is in the caſe ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſented to the human mind, as a ſufficient ground of a probable judgment. There is then in the caſe and condition of ſome who are not yet in a ſtate of acceptance with God, that which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be regarded as a favourable ſymptom, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating that there is more probability that they will attain to a ſaving converſion, than many others. There is a viſible ground for a comfortable hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. If it be now enquired what that is, I anſwer, it is a work of the Holy Spirit preparatory
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010643_0075_0F81BDF259A02670"/>
to converſion. This therefore is now, by the light of ſcripture, to be enquired into. Accordingly I ſhall endeavour—Firſt, <hi>To declare and open the nature and properties of it.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Prove the truth and reality of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the nature of this preparatory work which is now to be treated of, it may be noted, that taken in its full extent, it comprehends whatever is done for us, wrought in us, or performed by us, that has any kind or degree of ſubſerviency to our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or regeneration. But that we may have a more diſtinct view of it, I ſhall conſider it, firſt, as it is more general; ſecondly, as it is more ſpecial.</p>
            <p>FIRST, <hi>There is a general work of the Holy Spirit preparatory to converſion.</hi> Indeed the eternal love of God the Father, the purpoſes of his grace towards man, his providing a mediator, and commiſſionating him to his part of the work of redemption, as alſo the whole work of Chriſt, in obeying the precepts, and bearing the curſe of the law, may properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be ſaid to be preparatory to the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or converſion. But I ſhall here conſider that work which is eſpecially aſcribed to the Holy Spirit, and which belongs to the application of the redemption, ordained by God the Father, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the Son. This general preparatory work of the Holy Spirit conſiſts in giving a revelation of God's gracious and merciful deſigns towards fallen man, and the way in which he has purpoſed to carry theſe deſigns into execution, through the mediation of Chriſt; that the Mediator by his obedience and ſufferings has wrought out a righteouſneſs, and made an atonement for ſin, in which God is well pleaſed; and in conſideration of which, whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010643_0076_0F81BDF3105F5478"/>
is contained in the goſpel, which was given by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, and confirmed by miracles wrought by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, thro' the inſtrumentality of thoſe who were firſt choſen to bear witneſs to the truth. And ever ſince there have been witneſſes to the ſame raiſed up from time to time, who have been furniſhed, aſſiſted, and moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to publiſh the glad tidings of ſalvation to men, and proclaim theſe general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of mercy and grace to all and upon all that believe, without diſtinction, &amp; ſo call ſinners to faith and repentance. Now this is in its natural tendency, and by the appointment of God, preparatory, and ſubſervient to the converſion and ſalvation of men, and carries an encouraging aſpect towards every one.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides this, there is, ſecondly, <hi>a more ſpecial preparation for faith and converſion, which ſome are the ſubjects of in diſtinction from others;</hi> in reſpect of which the caſe of ſome is more hopeful, and their ſalvation more probable in various degrees. This is what our preſent deſign requires to be carefully explained. And that may be able to take a diſtinct and orderly view hereof, I ſhall endeavour to repreſent this preparatory work of the Holy Spirit in its gradual progreſs, according as the connection and ſubordination of cauſes and effects, means and ends, will most naturally direct. In the first place, <hi>the ſending of the Goſpel-call to ſome in diſtinction from others, belongs to this work of the Holy Spirit, which is preparatory to converſion.</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general declarations of grace to ſinners thro' Chriſt, there are many who hear not the report of the goſpel. Such are not in ſo near a capacity of obtaining faith, as they who are diſtinguiſhed by the outward call of the goſpel, nor is it ſo likely
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010643_0077_0F81BDF3D795D398"/>
that they will come to the knowledge of the truth. When God in his providence favours a perſon or people with the outward means of chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is more reaſon to hope that they will believe and be ſaved, than that others will, who have not theſe advantages.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, <hi>It is alſo the work of the Holy Spirit to awaken the attention of men to the outward call of the goſpel.</hi> There are many who hear words of eternal life, as though they heard them not. They are ſo careleſs and thoughtleſs, their minds are ſo filled with vanity, with worldly proſpects or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, that they do not mind nor attend to the import and weight of the words that are ſounding in their ears. But the good Spirit ſo awakens the attention of ſome, that they liſten greedily to what they hear. The truths which are declared ſink into their ears. This is a further degree of that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory work of the Holy Spirit, which we are now enquiring into. And they who are enabled and influenced to give attention to the revelation of grace and truth in the diſpenſation of the word, are more likely to underſtand and believe it, than they, who, while the call of the goſpel is ſounding in their ears, have their minds and thoughts occupied with cares or amuſements foreign to the ſerious import of what they hear.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, <hi>Another effect of the Spirit's agency preparatory to converſion is, the illumination of the mind by a common doctrinal underſtanding and belief of the truth.</hi> This is what men are capable of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to regeneration. They may in ſome meaſure apprehend the import, and perceive the evidence of the chriſtian doctrine. I grant that theſe things appear in a new light, to thoſe whoſe underſtanding
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010643_0078_0F81BDF487EDF3F8"/>
is ſo enlightned, as to diſcern ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual manner. But it is certain that men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate may &amp; often do underſtand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and are convinced of the truth, of many of the doctrines of the goſpel. And therefore ſuch are in ſcripture ſaid to be enlightned, to believe, to receive the knowledge of the truth, and to know the way of righteouſneſs. The Holy Spirit not only makes them attentive to the outward call of the goſpel, but alſo conveys into their mind by means hereof ſome knowledge of divine things. They are enabled to take in a true idea of what is objectively revealed, and are alſo perſuaded on good grounds that it is true. This common il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination admits of very different degrees, both in reſpect of the objects or truths hereby diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the mind, and alſo in reſpect of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of evidence by which they are diſcovered. And hence ſome have a much more extenſive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the great doctrines of revelation than others have, &amp; their aſſent is ſtronger. Some have only a weak and wavering perſuaſion that the goſpel may perhaps be true: Others are fully ſatisfied of it. The minds of men may be much enlightned, without any ſaving renovation of the heart: Yet this common illumination is ordinarily ſubordinate to, and preparative for that ſpecial and effectual work, whereby we are created anew in Chriſt Jeſus. For by this means ſinners are kept in the ordinary way of God's bleſſing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from many dangerous ſnares, and their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is kept up to thoſe outward means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſaving knowledge of the truth is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the minds and hearts of the children of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:010643_0079_0F81BDF56767EFB8"/>FOURTHLY, By means of this light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which by the word and ſpirit of God enters into the mind, <hi>a diſquieting ſenſe of the guilt of ſin is excited, with fear of puniſhment, and ſome kind of ſorrow and compunction, accompanied with anxious thoughts and contrivances how to obtain pardon and deliverance.</hi> This alſo belongs to that prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory work we are now conſidering. The Holy Spirit impreſſes upon the ſoul ſuch a conviction of its ſin, guilt and danger, as excites ſome pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of the miſery of ſuch ſtate, with earnest deſires to be delivered from it. The degrees of this preparatory trouble and ſorrow, are indeed very different in different perſons, in whom it has a happy iſſue. And therefore we ought not to preſcribe certain meaſures and degrees of theſe fears and diſquietudes, either as matter of duty, or neceſſary to converſion. But conviction of ſin is a duty, &amp; a neceſſary requiſite to our believing in Chriſt. And ſo is humiliation, that is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of deliverance and ſalvation in thoſe falſe ways, which God has not appointed. And this conviction will unavoidably produce trouble of mind in ſome degree, which will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved effectually, while the conviction which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited it remains, till the revelation of divine mercy in the goſpel is fully believed, and the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation therein propoſed is embraced with hearty acquieſcence. When therefore any appear to be convinced of their ſin and guilt, and humbled out of their falſe confidences, though we cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly determine where theſe convictions will land them at laſt, yet we muſt ſay that they are a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſymptom, and have in their place a good ſubſerviency to ſaving converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:010643_0080_0F81BDF618C464A0"/>LASTLY, <hi>This preparatory work extends to the inward purpoſes and reſolutions, and the outward conduct.</hi> The Holy Spirit by means of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon illumination &amp; conviction before mentioned, worketh in men to will and to do many things, which have a tendency and ſubſerviency to their obtaining faith and the grace of regeneration. Of this kind are all thoſe duties which have been ſpoken of. Such as the avoiding wilful known ſins, which tend to harden the heart, ſear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and quench the ſpirit: And practiſing thoſe moral and religious duties, whereby a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of conſience may be preſerved and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, further degrees of knowledge acquired, and the influences of the Holy Spirit cheriſhed.</p>
            <p>BUT having thus far explained what I mean by this preparation for converſion, which where it appears is a hopeful ſymptom. I ſhall now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>prove the reality of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I THINK it will not be denyed, that the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of grace and truth in the goſpel was given by inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, "that men might be turned from darkneſs to light, from the power of ſatan to God, and ſo obtain forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified, through faith in Chriſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 26.18.</note> And that the word of ſalvation, is by the direction of divine providence ſent to thoſe that hear it, that they may be called to faith and repentance. And that ſome are influenced to attend to it by him, "who has the hearts of all men in his hands, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them as the rivers of water whither ſoever he pleaſeth." Thus far I ſuppoſe a work of the Holy Spirit, preparatory to converſion, will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all profeſſed chriſtians; therefore I ſhall not ſpend time to prove it.</p>

This is what I muſt now endeavour to prove. But to prevent miſtake I would repeat here, what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, that I do not ſuppoſe that there is any true holineſs in thoſe convictions or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which I plead for as preparatory to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: Or that the ſubjects of them are hereby rendred in any degree worthy of the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. But the point which is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to confirmation is, that before God ſavingly reveals to a ſinner the goſpel way of ſalvation, in its excellency and ſuitableneſs, ſo as that he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquieſces in it, and repenting ſincerely of his ſins, turns to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, the Holy Spirit, by means of the word of God, ordinarily enlightens his mind with ſome knowledge of the moſt important doctrines of revealed religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces him of his ſin, guilt and condemnation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens ſome ſerious ſolicitude about his eternal ſtate, and excites in him ſerious purpoſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to forſake his ſins, and reform his life; and particularly prompts and enables him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the common means of converſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:010643_0083_0F81BDFA9B0FCBA0"/>
All who are dead are it is true equally void of life: But every portion of lifeleſs matter is not alike fitted and diſpoſed for the reception of a vital principle, and to be a proper inſtrument or organ for perception &amp; action, according to thoſe laws of nature which God has eſtabliſhed. So though we acknowledge that every unregenerate man is equally deſtitute of ſpiritual life, yet ſome are better prepared than others for the reception, and exerciſe of ſupernatural principles and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. "Some," ſays Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> 
               <q>may be in a greater forwardneſs and preparation for the work itſelf, of regeneration, and thereby in a greater nearneſs to the ſtate of it than others.</q> Of this we have a very lively emblem in the 37th chap. of Ezekiel: Where the Prophet deſcribes the viſion he had of a multitude of dry bones ſcattered abroad in a valley. Upon his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying to them there was firſt a great ſhaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and they came together each bone in its proper place, then the ſinews came upon them, after that they were covered with fleſh and ſkin: But till the breath of life entred into the bodies, they were as incapable of perception and action as the rocks, yet they were better prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be receptacles of living ſouls. Nor was life communicated, till the body which was to be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated was thus prepared, and made a proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and organ, in and by which the ſoul might receive ideas, and exert itſelf in actions agreable to its nature.</p>
            <p>THUS though nothing that is wrought in or done by a ſinner before regeneration, either ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or manifeſts him to be more worthy of this grace than another, yet by theſe effects of the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010643_0084_0F81BDFB4BBB20C8"/>
word and ſpirit upon him, which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, he is more prepared for that new ſtate, to which in regeneration he is introduced, and ſo becomes a more meet ſubject of this grace.<note n="*" place="bottom">That vital principle which is communicated in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is to the ſoul, as the ſoul is to the body; its dignity, its quickning and governing principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it becomes capable of anſwering the end for which it was made. The body may ſubſiſt with all its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eſſential properties, without the ſoul; ſo may the ſoul, without this divine principle. But in this caſe the body is naturally, and the ſoul ſpiritually dead; the one tending to a ſtate of natural corruption, the other to a ſtate of moral depravity. Keeping theſe things in mind, we may illuſtrate in ſome meaſure, how and in what reſpect the ſoul is ſaid to be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for regeneration and converſion, by a previous work of the ſpirit. For it is eaſy to ſee that this preparation may be conſidered is being either <hi>external,</hi> or <hi>internal.</hi> There is an <hi>external preparation</hi> for the union of a ſoul to a body, which conſiſts in providing ſuitable objects for the ſoul to converſe with by means of the body, and placing them ſo near, as that the organs of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may be impreſſed by them, and the nerves or animal ſpirits put in motion. The eye would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the ſoul without viſible objects, or light; and the ſame may be ſaid of the other ſenſes. So we read that the heavens and earth were created, before God made living creatures. Thus in the new creation, God has made preparation for the work of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by providing (if I may so ſpeak) and revealing outwardly in the goſpel, thoſe great and divine objects which are ſuited to the new nature. The revelation of grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt, preſents to view thoſe glorious objects, in the knowledge, choice, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and enjoyment of which, conſiſts the proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the divine life. And theſe things are bro't near to men, in the report of the goſpel. Again, there is alſo an <hi>internal preparation,</hi> or a work of the Holy Spirit in and upon the ſoul, whereby it is fitted and diſpoſed for the reception and exerciſe of the divine life. A body that is frozen and ſtiff, whoſe nerves and fluids are motionleſs and not eaſily moved, is not in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition ſo fit a receptacle of a living ſoul, as one that is warm and ſupple, and eſpecially if we ſhould ſuppoſe the blood actually circulating in the veins, and the other organs performing their ſeveral offices. And we might truly ſay that the one has a nearer capacity of vital action than the other. For according to the laws of nature which God has eſtabliſhed, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal motions of the fluids and nerves, are neceſſary to all acts of the natural life. If we ſhould ſuppoſe a living ſoul to be united to a ſtiff and motionleſs body, it would be impriſoned, as it were, in a ſtate of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and inactivity. Thus the internal effects of the word and ſpirit upon the mind and heart previous to converſion, prepare the ſoul to receive and exerciſe the principle of ſpiritual life. They are to the ſoul, as internal motion and warmth to the body. Tho' they be not life, yet they include a nearer capacity of vital exerciſes. For ſuppoſe a man were endowed, by an immediate phyſical operation of divine power, with that ſupernatural <hi>ſenſe or inſtinct</hi> which is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in regeneration, yet if he had no knowledge of the will of God, no conviction or ſenſe of ſin, &amp;c. how could he diſcern the ſpiritual glory of the goſpel, ſo as to believe it becauſe of this lively evidence of divinity in ſtamped upon it? How could he acquieſce in the way of ſalvation therein revealed? How could he repent of ſin, and obey the commands of Chriſt?—Thoſe ſpeculative ideas of the truth revealed in the goſpel, and conveyed to the underſtanding, are the immediate objects about which the new creature is occupied. As therefore there can be no exerciſe of ſenſitive life, without a previous impreſſion upon the organs of ſenſation; ſo there can be no exerciſe of ſpiritual life, without a previous perception of divine truth by the natural faculty of the understanding;—which is (if I may ſo ſpeak) the organ of the ſpiritual ſenſe. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> calls this internal preparation for the work of regeneration a material diſpoſition for or unto it; which he thus explains: <q>A material diſpoſition is that which diſpoſeth, and ſome way maketh a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fit for the reception of that which ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, added, or infuſed into it as its form. So wood by dryneſs and a due compoſure is made fit and ready to admit of firing, or continual fire. A formal diſpoſition is where one degree of the ſame kind, diſpoſeth the ſubject unto farther degrees of it. The former we allow here, not the latter.</q>

<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010643_0086_0F81BDFD2F6ED668"/>
they are in a periſhing caſe, before their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are quieted by a ſaving belief of the mercy of God to ſinners, thro' the mediation of Chriſt? Will they who are inſenſible of their maladies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the remedy which Chriſt has provided and offers to them? Will they attend to the meſſages of grace which God ſends to comfort and raiſe the hearts of thoſe who are overwhelmed with a ſenſe of guilt and unworthineſs? No ſurely. Till we are thoroughly convinced of our need of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we ſhall neglect and ſlight God's calls and counſels in the goſpel. They who are in their own apprehenſion, rich and increaſed in goods and in need of nothing, will have no ear for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Chriſt, "to buy of him gold tried in the fire that they may be rich, and white raiment that they may be cloathed, and to anoint their eyes with eye-ſalve that they may ſee."</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, it is neceſſary that men be bro't and kept in the way of God's bleſſing, and that their attention to the call of the goſpel be awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:010643_0087_0F81BDFD9289AAA0"/>
and kept up, till through the influence of the ſpirit it has accompliſhed its end and effect in their converſion. Now the attention of ſinners to the call of the goſpel is awakened, and they are kept in the uſe of thoſe means, whereby the ſaving knowledge of the truth is obtained, by this preparatory work which is here contended for. To excite and keep up mens attention to thoſe outward means, whereby God is ordinarily pleaſed to effectuate his gracious purpoſes towards mankind, the Holy Spirit makes uſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and exhortations, together with thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal evidences of the truth and divine authority of the goſpel, which are propoſed to all the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof in the miniſtry of the word. So that before men are enabled to believe ſavingly in Chriſt, and turn to God through him, there is a ſubordinate work of the Holy Spirit by the word, in and upon the ſoul, which has a tendency and ſubſerviency to this happy change.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD <hi>ordinarily gives the new heart only to thoſe who are prepared for it in the manner before mentioned.</hi> It is his uſual way in the converſion, of ſinners, to make them firſt ſenſible in ſome meaſure of their miſerable helpleſs ſtate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their dependance upon his ſovereign favour for deliverance, and then comfort them wih a ſpiritual view of the glorious foundation of hope and joy which the goſpel preſents.</p>
            <p>IN proof of this we may bring an argument by no means contemptible from analogy. I own ſuch kind of reaſoning are oftentimes very ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and uncertain: But in ſome caſes they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have great weight. In particular our preſent point I think will receive illuſtration and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010643_0088_0F81BDFE48E6B3A8"/>
evidence, by our conſidering in what manner God has been wont to work, in carrying his purpoſes into execution.</p>
            <p>IT has been God's uſual method, when about to accompliſh any ſignal work for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his glory, to proceed gradually, and make way for the completion thereof by previous ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Thus in the firſt creation, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an orderly progreſſion in God's working. Every thing effected in its proper order. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done, makes way for what is to follow. The heavens and earth, the ſun, moon and ſtars, the trees and herbs were firſt made, and then liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creatures to move upon the face of the earth, or fly in the heavens. And laſt of all man who was to have dominion over the other creatures, and for whoſe uſe this world was eſpecially cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. And in the creation of man, firſt his body was formed of the duſt of the earth, and then the breath of life was breathed into his noſtrils, and man became a living ſoul. The crowning act of creating efficiency which gave the material world its chief importance was not introduced, till the Creator by ſix days working had made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it. Almighty power could have begun and conſummated his work in a moment. But divine wiſdom ſaw meet to proceed in a gradual and regular order, every ſtep of the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs making way for the next, till the whole was finiſhed. And herein he has given us a view of his ordinary method of working. In particular the creation of man may properly be looked upon as in this reſpect analogous to his regeneration, and therefore this is called the new creation. Yea the word regeneration alludes plainly to natural
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:010643_0089_0F81BDFF88338490"/>
generation, in which are previous diſpoſitions of matter before the vital principle is infuſed. And there is reaſon to think that an analogy in this reſpect is intended hereby to be intimated to us.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER inſtance to our preſent purpoſe is the deliverance of Iſrael's poſterity from their Egyptian bondage, and ſettlement in the land of promiſe. We have good reaſon to look upon this deliverance as typical of the deliverance of particular perſons from the ſlavery of ſatan, and their introduction to the privileges and happineſs of God's ſpiritual kingdom. The Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiders it in this view in the epiſtle to the Hebrews. And accordingly thoſe paſſages of ſcripture which had a primary reference to the Iſraelites, and their ſettlement in that reſt which was promiſed to them in the land of Canaan, are applied and addreſſed to chriſtians for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and inſtruction, in purſuit of that reſt in heaven which remains for the people of God. Such an application of theſe texts is proper and pertinent, ſuppoſing the events immediately point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in them had a typical reference to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſalvation of men by Chriſt: And I ſee not how the Apoſtle's reaſoning from them can appear ſolid upon any other ſuppoſition. We may therefore expect to find in the manner of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's deliverance from the houſe of bondage, a repreſentation of the method of divine grace, in tranſlating ſinners from the kingdom of ſatan, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of the dear Son of God.</p>
            <p>IF now we turn our eyes to the hiſtory of this memorable tranſaction, we ſhall find that they were firſt made ſenſible of their evil caſe under
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010643_0090_0F81BE0009D17D20"/>
the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and cryed unto God by reaſon of their hard bondage, before he delivered them from it. Hereby they were prepared to hearken with joy to the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of liberty. So at the Red ſea, they were firſt convinced that unleſs God would ſave them they muſt periſh: The impaſſible mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each ſide, the ſea before them, and the Egyptian army in their rear, and then God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them a wonderful way of eſcape.</p>
            <p>AND if we look thro' the ſcriptures, we ſhall I think find, that it has been God's ordinary method to prepare his people for the reception of remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble favours, by making them ſenſible of their need of them, and thereby exciting them to look to him for them. And as a late writer of our own has obſerved, <q>there is an analogy obſervable in God's diſpenſations and deliverances which he works for his people, and the manifeſtations which he makes of himſelf to them, both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Edwards</hi> on religious affections, pag. 52,—56.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND perhaps ſomething may be argued by way of analogy in favour of a work of conviction and humiliation preparatory to ſaving faith, from God's conduct towards his church, conſidered as a collective body. Says the author laſt quoted; <q>There is all reaſon to ſuppoſe that God deals with particular believers as he dealt with his church, which he firſt made to hear his voice in the law with terrible thunders and lightnings, and kept her under that ſchool-maſter to prepare her for Chriſt; and then comforted her with the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound of the goſpel from mount Sion.</q> In a way ſomewhat ſimilar, the law is ſtill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:010643_0091_0F81BE00B3A8EE08"/>
perſons, as it was formerly to the church, a ſchool maſter to bring them to Chriſt, that they may be juſtified by faith.</p>
            <p>BUT the account we have in the evangelical hiſtory, of the manner in which the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was introduced, is I think more plainly to our purpoſe. When the Lord Jeſus was about to open the kind commiſſion upon which he was ſent into the world, <hi>to preach the goſpel to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, and to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. 4.18.</note> John the Baptiſt was ſent before him, to prepare the minds of the people for thoſe gracious words. And this he did by a very awakening manner of preaching, charging their ſins home upon their conſciences, and warning them of their danger of the wrath to come, and of being cut down and caſt into the fire, by the ax which even then lay at the root of the tree. He was a meſſenger ſent before his face in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, by awakening their conſciences, convincing them of ſin, that ſo they might be in a fit diſpoſition of mind, to attend unto, and receive the revelation of grace &amp; truth by Jeſus Chriſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">That ſinners may hearken to this word of ſalvation, they muſt know that they have deſtroyed themſelves. And becauſe they do not eaſily entertain ſuch a tho't of themſelves, and ſo ſlight the glad news of ſalvation, they are awakened to hear them by the voice of the law, and its work upon their consciences, the Lord Chriſt by his Spirit making the law ſubſervient to the goſpel, by this means ſhutting up ſinners to the faith, and ſtopping their mouths, that they may be ſubject to the judgment of God, and ſo hearken to the glad tidings of ſalvation." <hi>Glas's Teſtimony of the King of Martyrs,</hi> chap. 5. ſect. 3.</note>

               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:010643_0092_0F81BE0146204878"/>AND that this is the general method and order in which the work of converſion is accompliſhed, may be more directly argued from ſeveral of our Saviour's parables. It may be obſerved in the parable of the prodigal ſon, which is commonly thought to exhibit the method of divine grace in calling ſinners into his goſpel kingdom, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was received and feaſted by his father, he came to himſelf, ſo far as to be ſenſible of, and affected with his indigent ſtarving condition, and own himſelf to be an undutiful ſinner, unworthy to be called his ſon. And in the parable of the ſervant who owed his king ten thouſand talents, we are told that his lord called him to a reckoning, charged him with the debt, demanded payment, and in default hereof commanded him to be ſold, and his wife, &amp; children, &amp; all that he had. By this means he is made to humble himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging himſelf bound to him in the whole ſum, and then receives a full acquittance of the free mercy and bounty of his Lord.</p>
            <p>AND are there not particular calls and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the goſpel, directed to awakened ſinners? Is it not moſt natural thus to underſtand theſe words of our Saviour, as well as other parallel texts,<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. 11.30.</note> 
               <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt?</hi> I think the perſons here deſigned are ſuch as not only are in a miſerable periſhing condition, but alſo ſenſible of their miſery. Such as feel themſelves wearied,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010643_0093_0F81BE045EB1CDA8"/>
and burdened with guilt, ſo that their hearts are ſinking within them, theſe are invited to come to Chriſt for reſt. Nothing can give them effectual relief, but the grace of the goſpel; and ſuch is the ſtate of their mind that the news of a Saviour will be welcome and refreſhing to them, as cold waters to a thirſty ſoul. And therefore they are called and invited, as thoſe whoſe immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it is to come to Chris;t, and caſt their burden upon him. The grace of the goſpel indeed is freely propoſed to all. The call is, "whoſoever will let him come." But no man will have an ear for it, till he is convinced of his guilt and miſery, as a ſinner. It is therefore the next or immediate concern of the ignorant and ſecure, to awake to conſideration, and admit that conviction of ſin and miſery which is offered to them from the word of God, through the influence of the Holy Spirit, whoſe office it is to convince the world of ſin. And when they are thus prepared to hear and receive the report of the goſpel, then they are called and directed to behold the "Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world." No righteouſneſs or qualifications of ours are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as recommendations to the mercy of God, but a conviction of ſin and miſery is needful to awaken our attention to the revelation of God's grace, to keep us in the uſe of thoſe means by which the Holy Spirit ordinarily works ſaving faith in the ſoul, and to render the goſpel, agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the proper import of the word, "glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to us."</p>

The promiſe is to <hi>you,</hi> &amp;c. has intimated that theſe Jews were true believers when they ſaid to the Apoſtles, men and brethren what ſhall we do? I freely concur with him in rejecting the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, but am diſſatisfied with the turn he has given to this paſſage, Peter ſeeing the effects of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the convictions and diſquietude of mind it had produced among his hearers, might hope that God was leading many of them to repentance. But I think this author cannot, upon his own principles, pretend that they gave any evidence that they were true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt. They profeſſed no ſuch faith, nor were comforted by what they believed, nor were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the practice of the peculiar precepts of the goſpel. Nothing appeared from their words or actions but that their hearts were pricked with conviction. But he is ſo far from allowing this to be an evidence of ſaving faith, that he will not allow that it is ſo much as a favourable ſymptom in the caſe of any one. For he ſays—<q>We cannot have the leaſt ground to ſuggeſt to any man any hopeful ſymptom in his condition, from the diſquiet produced in his mind by a ſenſe of guilt.</q>

But what need is there of the unnatural ſuppoſition that the Apoſtle addreſſed them in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of believers. Methinks a man of ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity would take the import of the Apoſtle's words to be this. Repent of your ſins, and be baptiſed with the chriſtian baptiſm, that your ſins may be forgiven: and then you ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe (of pardon and the Holy Spirit upon the conditions before mentioned) is (directed or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed) to you, and to your children, and to thoſe that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, (by ſending the word of ſalvation to them.)</note> The Philippian jaylor

alſo <hi>came trembling,</hi> under conviction of guilt and fear of puniſhment, no doubt, <hi>and fell down before Paul and Silas, and ſaid, ſirs what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> He applies to them for inſtruction and direction in this most important affair, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it is likely by conſidering what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince their arrival at the city, that <hi>they were the ſervants of God, who could ſhew unto man the way of ſalvation.</hi> And though it ſeems that he was not firſt awakened to a ſenſe of ſin by the miniſtration of the word, yet we have reaſon to think that his concern about ſalvation was excited by the influence of the Holy Spirit, by means of thoſe extraordinary occurrences which he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take notice of, and by thoſe traces of the law of nature which were imprinted on his heart. Nor is the converſion of Paul any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt what we are pleading for, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a confirmation. For, 1. We have no reaſon that I know of to conclude that he was a true believer in Chriſt, upon his being firſt awakened, when he was upon the road to Damaſcus. Tho' the manner in which he was awaken'd to a ſenſe of his ſin in perſecuting the church was miraculous,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:010643_0096_0F81BE06930677D8"/>
yet, for any thing we know, he might after that be gradually prepared for the new birth, by a work of conviction &amp; humiliation. But 2. was Paul converted in an extraordinary and miraculous manner. Perhaps there never was an inſtance ſo remarkable in all reſpects before or ſince. So far from truth is what has lately been hinted by ſome, that, in reſpect of the manner of his converſion, he was deſigned for a pattern to all that ſhould hereafter believe. If the merciful truth (as ſome chuſe to ſpeak) ſurprized him upon the road, then the knowledge of it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to him by a miraculous objective revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and not by means of the ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God's word. But this ſame Apoſtle will ſupport us in ſaying that faith ordinarily is obtained in another way, even by means of the reading or preaching of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>I MIGHT further confirm the point in hand, from the common experience and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who have given the beſt evidences of ſincerity in their profeſſions of faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt. But this, with other things, which might have been introduced, muſt not be inſiſted on; as this diſcourſe has already exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what I firſt propoſed, and I have yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able work before me. But the further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this argument, muſt be deferred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity.</p>

            <head>SERMON IV. That thoſe who attend to the Means of Grace, are more likely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation.</head>
            <p>I AM ſtill upon the firſt argument to prove the obligation and encouragement of mankind in general, who hear the call of the goſpel to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life. The argument is briefly this: That they who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the common means of grace are more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obtain ſalvation, than they who neglect them. In confirmation of this I have proved, that ſome who are not in a ſtate of acceptance with God, are more likely to attain to it than others. Wherein this probability appears, has been alſo declared and vindicated. I am therefore now ready to proceed to the SECOND POINT propoſed to confirmation, which compleats our preſent argument, <hi>That what manifeſts the ſtate of ſome to be more hopeful than that of others, either conſiſts in, or depends upon, and is obtained by, their endeavours in attending the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of grace.</hi> Our attending to theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:010643_0098_0F81BE080CAB6498"/>
has a tendency, by the appointment and bleſſing of God, to promote that work of illumination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and reformation, which is ordinarily prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to converſion. Yea it is in the way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to theſe duties that the work itſelf, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>AS this contains the ſubſtance of what is to be pleaded for in the enſuing diſcourſe, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the firſt place to ſtate the matter a little more exactly, to prevent exception or miſtake. Let it then be obſerved, <hi>that I acknowledge there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory work of divine grace which prevents or is before-hand of all human endeavours.</hi> Thus it is in no degree owing to any thing in us, or done by us, that we are born in a part of the world that is enlightned by the goſpel—that we have in our early days had wiſe and faithful inſtructors, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſuch whoſe converſation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample were adapted to direct and quicken us in our duty—and that we were taught and required to read the ſcriptures. It is alſo to be aſcribed, many times at leaſt, to a directing providence, without any deſign or intention of ours, that we read, or hear ſuch diſcourſes as are in a ſpecial manner cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to inſtruct and awaken us, and that we are ſometimes viſited with remarkable afflictions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, which tend to rouſe men to ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and often prove the occaſion of ſaving good to them. Beſides it has been allowed that the firſt motions of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, are before any deſires and endeavours after ſalvation in us, inaſmuch as all our ſeeking is prompted by a previous influence of grace. In theſe reſpects ſome are brought nearer than others to the kingdom of God, without any concurring endeavours of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:010643_0099_0F81BCEB089259E8"/>
All this belongs to what may be called the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God.</p>
            <p>BUT though the work of divine grace in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſoul for regeneration is begun without any act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive concurrence of ours, yet our active compliance, and endeavours in a way of attendance to preſcribed duties, is ordinarily neceſſary to the progreſs and completion of it. The firſt kindly impreſſions are indeed from preventing grace; but the continuance and increaſe of the Spirit's influence, with the effects thereof in illumination, conviction and converſion, are uſually found only in thoſe who are previouſly moved and excited to anſwerable exertments of their active faculties. Herein it is true God worketh in us to will and to do, as well as in the work of ſanctification. But our will and endeavour is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in both caſes, in order to our attaining the end, which the operations of God's grace have a tendency unto. God's firſt end in uſing means with ſinners, and communicating the influences of his Spirit in and with them, is to awaken their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and put them upon diligent obſervance of thoſe duties which he has appointed to be means of their obtaining further communications of light and grace, whereby they may be thoroughly awakened, convinced of their ſin and guilt, and led to true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and converſion. If then men reſiſt the Spirit in his firſt ſtriving with them, and will not awake to conſideration, nor attend to the means of further light and grace, they then receive the grace of God in vain.</p>
            <p>BUT that we may underſtand more clearly and diſtinctly, how far, and in what reſpects a man is brought nearer the kingdom of God, and his caſe rendred more hopeful, by means of his endeavours
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:010643_0100_0F81BCEBCE2C3838"/>
in a way of attendance to preſcribed duties, we muſt call over briefly ſome things that were offered in the laſt diſcourſe, ſhewing in what reſpects ſome are ſaid to be more likely than others to obtain ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now whatever may be thought to have a favourable aſpect and tendency may, ſo far as the point in hand is concerned, be reduced to theſe three heads, viz. Outward means and privileges,—the agency and influence of the Holy Spirit in and by theſe means—And the effects produced hereby, in the mind, heart and life. If then human endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are of any uſe or advantage in all, or any of theſe reſpects, then theſe endeavours have a good uſe and tendency, and ſinners ought to be preſſed and encouraged thereunto, as conducive to their obtaining eternal life. I ſhall therefore conſider, each of theſe points diſtinctly, And</p>
            <p n="1">I. HAVE <hi>any doings or endeavours of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate a tendency to render their outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances either better or worſe in reſpect of ſpiritual privileges?</hi>—A caſe ſo plain as this appears to be, will, I think, be eaſily reſolved. Is it not moſt manifeſt that our outward condition depends very much, under God, upon our own choice? Some it is true are by the kindneſs of providence more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſituated than others in reſpect of outward means of grace, antecedently to any choice of their own. Some are born in places that are peculiarly favoured in this reſpect: Others are conducted to ſuch places by a ſecret influence, not knowing whither they go: And others have the means ſent to them without their deſire or procurement, as has been obſerved:—And herein the ſovereignty of God is manifeſted. But it is as evidently true that people are very much at liberty to chuſe, whether they will put themſelves,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010643_0101_0F81BCECA3E506A0"/>
or continue in the way of chriſtian inſtruction or not. Our Saviour's maxim holds true in this caſe, "whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away." The Jews might have all along enjoyed the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of divine knowledge, if they had not refuſed them and as far as they were able put the word of God far from them, ſo judged themſelves unworthy of eternal life. Is it not owing to men's hating and rejecting inſtruction, that the goſpel is not at this day preached among all the nations of the world?—Their oppoſing the means of grace at a diſtance, is the great cauſe and occaſion why they are not brought near to them. And where God ſends the word of ſalvation, and ſets up the light of the goſpel, is it not plain, that ſome by their wilful refuſal of it keep out of the way of being ſavingly benefited by it, and on the contrary ruſh greedily into the way of all kind of ſin, error and temptation, whereby their ſtate is rendred deplorable, and in a manner deſperate? But when men are willing, and take pains to have and attend to the outward means of grace, they are ordinarily continued and increaſed to them. If it be the care and endeavour of any one to avoid the converſation of thoſe who have no regard for religion, and to ſhun thoſe places where nothing is to be learned but impiety and wickedneſs, this will tend to preſerve him from theſe dangers and temptations. If he deſire to be inſtructed in the doctrines and precepts of the goſpel, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſeeks for, and attends upon the beſt means he can have acceſs to, he will be likely to have his preſent advantages continued, yea, and have further helps, and greater opportunities than he at preſent enjoys. We who live where the chriſtian religion is profeſſed, have peculiar outward aſſiſtances offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:010643_0102_0F81BCED5289D980"/>
to us, whereby we may come to the knowledge of the truth, and experience its renewing and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying influence upon our hearts. But if we refuſe, and endeavour to ſhun them, we may effectually deprive ourſelves of them in a great meaſure; and on the contrary if we improve them, we ſhall hereby find ourſelves led and conducted into the way of further helps and advantages of this kind. We have the ſcriptures in our hands; but how can they be a means of making us wiſe to ſalvation, if we will not read them? The goſpel is preached among us; but this cannot be a means of converting us, unleſs we will hear it. This then appears to be the true ſtate of the caſe: The firſt outward means which God uſes for the converſion of ſinners, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents all their endeavours; but then there are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward privileges which God ordinarily vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to thoſe who deſire and endeavour to obtain, and hold them; from which they who deſpiſe and reject them, are excluded. The Jews at Antioch, to whom Paul preached the goſpel, might have had the privilege of further inſtruction, if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it, and been willing to receive it; but when they were filled with envy, and ſpake againſt thoſe things which they had heard, contradicting and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, yea proceeded ſo far in their oppoſition, as to raiſe a perſecution againſt the apoſtles, and expel them from their coaſts, they were juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived afterwards, of thoſe advantages which they wilfully refuſed. Upon the whole, if men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to attend the means of grace, they are uſually favoured with the continuance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of their ſpiritual privileges; but if they refuſe inſtruction, and reject the counſel of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, they are juſtly left to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of that darkneſs which they love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010643_0103_0F81BCEE17E48420"/>
than light. It is true we ought to aſcribe it to the grace of God, that any are influenced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled ſo to improve their outward advantages, as to receive further helps of this kind. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, it is owing to men's wickedneſs that they hate the light, and oppoſe the outward means of grace, as we have formerly had occaſion to obſerve. But whatever be the occaſion of this difference of conduct, the conſequences are of great importance.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Theſe things (that is an outward attendance unto the diſpenſation of the word of God, with thoſe other external means of grace which accompany it, or are appointed therein, and a diligent intention of mind in attendance on theſe means, to underſtand and receive the things revealed and declared as the mind and will of God) are required of us in order to regeneration, and it is in the power of our own wills to comply with them, and we may obſerve concerning them, that the omiſſion of them, the neglect of men in them, is the principal occaſion and cauſe of the eternal ruin of the ſouls of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them to whom or amongſt whom the goſpel is preached. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil, John 3.19. The generality of men know full well, that they do in this matter no more what they are able, than what they ſhould. All plead—able pretences of inability and weakneſs are far from them. They cannot but know here, and they ſhall be forced to confeſs hereafter, that it was merely from their own curſed ſloth, with love of the world and ſin, that they were diverted from a diligent attendance on the means of converſion, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous exerciſe of their minds about them.</q>

               </note> For by a due improvement of our outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, we ſhall be likely to have them increaſed and prolonged, and ſo in this reſpect be brought near
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010643_0104_0F81BCEF0F46CC10"/>
to the kingdom of God: But by neglecting and refuſing them, we forſake our own mercies, and as far as in us lies, keep ourſelves out of the reach of that grace, which God is wont to convey in and by theſe means to the children of men.</p>
            <p>LET us now, in the 2d place, conſider, <hi>whether men's conduct has any kind or degree of conduciveneſs to further or hinder their receiving inward influences, and aſſiſtances from the Holy spirit?</hi>—Whether the continuance and increaſe of thoſe common influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of grace, which are communicated to men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, with and by the outward means before ſpoken of, depends at all upon the improvement they make of theſe means? And whether the withdraw of this grace, and the with-holding of further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of it, be occaſioned by, and owing to, their neglecting, and reſiſting what they have received? Now this, I think, both ſcripture and experience will warrant us to affirm. It is always in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of men's grieving and quenching the Spirit, that he withdraws his kindly influences from them. This is an awful, but juſt puniſhment, for their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neglect of, and oppoſition to thoſe gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſolicitations which they have experienced. To this purpoſe the Divines at Dort argue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude—<q>God forſakes not thoſe whom he thus works upon (by his word and Spirit) nor ceaſes to further them in the true way to converſion, till he is forſaken by them, by a voluntary neglect or repulſe of this firſt grace. The talent of grace, once given by God, is taken away from no one, except him who by his own fault firſt buried it. Mat. 25.28. Hence it is that we are often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed in ſcripture, that we reſiſt not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we quench not the Spirit, that we receive
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:010643_0105_0F81BCEFB68FD988"/>
not the grace of God in vain, that we depart not from God, Heb. 27. Yea this is moſt manifeſtly pointed out as the reaſon of God's forſaking men, that God is firſt forſaken by men. Prov. 1.24. Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed, I alſo will laugh at your deſtruction. 2 Chron. 24.20. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have forſaken the Lord, he hath forſaken you. But there is not the leaſt hint in ſcripture, that God is wont, or hath a will ever without the previous fault of man, to take away from any one the help of his exciting grace, or any aſſiſtance ordained for the converſion of man, which he hath once conferred.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Act. Synodi Dordract. part 2. pag. 167. quarto.</note>
            </p>
            <p>OUR conduct, in improving or reſiſting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Spirit, is therefore of great importance in its tendency and effects. If men do not quench the Spirit of grace, but comply with his motions, he will continue ſtriving, moving and breathing upon their ſouls. Yea by improving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the grace they have received, they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain further degrees. Though I do not plead for a promiſe of regeneration to the endeavours of the unconverted, yet we have, I think, reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they who comply with the motions of God's Spirit, in that preparatory work which has been diſcourſed of, ſhall receive further influences and aſſiſtances of the ſame kind, whereby they may become more and more prepared for the reception, and exerciſe of the divine life, and ſo advance gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually towards the kingdom of God. Hereby they may attain to more divine knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, and be taken off more and more from ſelf dependance, and falſe confidences. Yea they may at length be ſo convinced of the inſufficiency
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:010643_0106_0F81BCF04DA32A48"/>
of thoſe falſe refuges, to which they uſed to betake themſelves when preſſed with a ſenſe of their guilt, as to abandon them all. For this belongs to that work of humiliation, which is antecedent to ſaving converſion.</p>
            <p>NOW I apprehend that it is not obſcurely ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the holy ſcriptures, that ſinners ſhall receive further degrees of grace and aſſiſtance from the Spirit of God, if they do not wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his gracious operations, and thereby quench his kindly influences upon their hearts. Thoſe words of our Lord, which we find ſeveral times repeated, ſeem to imply as much. "Whoſoever hath" (that is whoſoever holds, or improves what he hath, for ſo the word is ſometimes underſtood, ſee Heb. 12.28.) "to him ſhall be given: And whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way." This is delivered as a univerſal rule or maxim, applicable to every kind of gifts and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents conferred upon mankind: And it imports, that the way to have them increaſed is to improve them. That this is the true intent of the words, will I think plainly appear, to every one that will examine the ſeveral occaſions on which they were ſpoken. And I ſee no reaſon why that paſſage, in Mat. 7.7—10. may not properly be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner. "Aſk and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you: For every one that aſketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened. If ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven give good things (that is, as Luke expreſſes it, give the Holy Spirit) to them that aſk him."
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:010643_0107_0F81BCF10992D228"/>
Theſe words undoubtedly contain a promiſe of an increaſe of grace to believers, upon their ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it. But this does not hinder but that we pay properly underſtand them as ſignifying alſo, that there ſhall be an increaſe of that common grace, which men may be the ſubjects of previous to converſion, upon their ſeeking for it with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering diligence and importunity. And there ſeems to be the more reaſon to receive this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, becauſe it appears from the two laſt verſes of this chapter, that Chriſt's ſermon on the mount was addreſſed to the multitude, as well as to his diſciples. Now as it is the duty of all to aſk of God the gift of the Holy Spirit, ſo it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conclude, that it was our Saviour's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in theſe words to propoſe unto his hearers in general an encouraging motive unto this duty.<note n="*" place="bottom">Many of the conditional promiſes in ſcripture are, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, to be underſtood in the ſame manner. God's deſign in giving them ſeems to me to have been to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage mankind to ſeek unto him for that common light and grace of his Spirit which is antecedent and preparatory to converſion, as well as for thoſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which are ſpecial and ſanctifying, and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected with ſalvation. It will not be eaſy to ſhew how theſe promiſes can give any encouragement to the endeavours of men unregenerate, if this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be not allowed. And yet it is certain that they have commonly been quoted as motives and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to the unconverted in ſeeking the grace of God, even by thoſe who have never been ſuſpected to favour the Pelagians. I ſhall only recite one paſſage from a noted writer of our own. It is the late Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Edwards, in his ſermon on preſſing into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. It is plain from many paſſages in this diſcourſe, that by preſſing into the kingdom of God, he means the ſtriving of an unconverted ſinner to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an intereſt in Chriſt. And he ſays, <q>Perſons thus engaged in their hearts will ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and will be violent for heaven.

Not that it is our duty to ſeek in unbelief, but it is the duty of thoſe to whom the word of ſalvation is ſent, to ſeek for the grace of God's Holy Spirit with ſerious minds in the exerciſe of that faith, and that grace which they are the ſubjects of, whether it be ſaving or not. And if they do ſo, their endeavours will not be in vain.</p>
            <p>AND that our cheriſhing and complying with the motions of God's Spirit, in his common as well is ſpecial operations, ſhould be the way to have them continued and increaſed, is agreable to the experience of mankind, and the manner of God's diſpenſations. We ſee that they commonly make gradual advances in knowledge of any kind, who uſe diligently the means and advantages for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency which they enjoy, and improve thoſe meaſures to which they have attained. The ſame may be ſaid of our wealth and outward eſtate. By improving our preſent ſtock induſtriouſly, and huſbanding it carefully, it will gradually increaſe.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010643_0109_0F81BCF40CD21EA8"/>
All the bleſſings of providence, all our mental endowments and ſpiritual gifts, though they are the free bounties of our heavenly Father, yet we ſee, that they are continued and increaſed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily unto ſuch as diligently uſe what they have received, and ſeek for further degrees, by thoſe means which God has preſcribed. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they who neglect to improve the price that is in their hands do often loſe it, and always loſe the benefit of it. And do we not accordingly find in experience, that the effects of the Spirit's, influence upon our hearts continue, and become more ſenſible ſo long as we comply with theſe motions, and improve that grace which is given us; and on the contrary are interrupted and weakned, when we reſiſt and quench the Spirit by negligence and wickedneſs; as will be further ſhewn under the next enquiry.</p>
            <p>BUT here ariſes a queſtion or two of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we muſt conſider briefly before we proceed any further. It will be aſked, may one who is not ſavingly united to Chriſt by faith, take encouragement from any promiſe to hope for favours and bleſſings of any kind from God?</p>
            <p>I ANSWER firſt, It is a certain and undeniable fact, that ſinners do receive favours and bleſſings from God, before they are in a ſtate of accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him, by a ſpecial and ſaving intereſt in Chriſt. The common gifts of providence of which mankind in general are partakers, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently favours and inſtances of the goodneſs and kindneſs of God. Many are further favoured with the outward call of the goſpel. They have means and advantages for attaining to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way of ſalvation by Chriſt. They
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010643_0110_0F81BCF4C70A9108"/>
have a perfect revelation of the whole matter of their faith and duty, and enjoy thoſe ordinances, and outward means of grace, whereby the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of redemption are communicated and applied to man. And there are ſome, who beſides theſe outward privileges are the ſubjects of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Holy Spirit, whereby they are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and enlightned in various degrees, though they are not true believers in Chriſt, nor ſo united to him as to be in a ſtate of ſalvation, in the moſt important ſenſe. Now all theſe things are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the goodneſs and mercy of God to ſinners. The ſcriptures will warrant us to conſider and ſpeak of them in this view, notwithſtanding ſome by abuſing the bleſſings of God turn them into curſes, and make them the occaſions of inhancing their guilt, and future puniſhment. This has, I think, never been denyed by any. Moreover,</p>
            <p>IT is alſo generally acknowledged that theſe common favours were purchaſed for men by Chriſt. To him the world in general is beholden for all the good they enjoy. To this purpoſe are the words of Mr. Charnock—"Had not Chriſt," ſays he, <q>interpoſed to ſatisfy the juſtice of God, man upon his ſin would have actually been bound over to puniſhment as well as the fallen angels were upon their's, and been fettered in chains as ſtrong as thoſe ſpirits feel. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why man was not hurled to the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition upon his ſin, as they were, is Chriſt's promiſe of taking our nature, and not their's. In regard of thoſe fruits of this patience, Chriſt is ſaid to buy the wickedeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates from him. 2 Pet. 2.1. Denying the Lord that bought them. Such were bought
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:010643_0111_0F81BCF7844527A8"/>
by him, as bring upon themſelves juſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whoſe damnation ſlumbers not. ver. 3. He purchaſed the continuance of their lives, and the ſtay of their execution, that offers of grace might be made to them. This patience muſt be either upon the account of the law, or the goſpel; for there are no other rules where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God governs the world. A fruit of the law it was not; that ſpake nothing but curſes after diſobedience. It muſt be therefore upon the account of the goſpel, and a fruit of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</q>—Thus far this learned author. [Vol. 1. pag. 478.]</p>
            <p>HENCE it will follow, that by the death of Chriſt, bleſſings have been purchaſed for mankind in general. Common bleſſings are beſtowed on the world for his ſake. There is therefore, a common relation, or union of men to Chriſt, which is the ground of their receiving theſe benefits which he purchaſed for them. All are in ſome ſenſe intereſted in Chriſt, who receive any benefits for his ſake. We may then without any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency allow that theſe benefits are founded upon the merits of Chriſt, and purchaſed by him, and that they who partake of them are in ſome ſenſe related to Chriſt, and intereſted in him.—Yea this muſt be the caſe, unleſs theſe benefits are conferred on ſinners without any regard to the redemption of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND if any ſhould inſiſt that theſe are not the fruits of Chriſt's merits, and that no one is in any reſpects intereſted in Chriſt, until he ſavingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on him, then they muſt acknowledge that God may and does confer his favours and grace on thoſe who are not in any ſenſe united to Chriſt.
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:010643_0112_0F81BCF8355C5EB0"/>
So that upon either ſuppoſition the difficulty will come to nothing. God does in fact beſtow theſe favours, in what manner ſoever it is done. And if he may without any diſhonour to his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſtow them, then there is no difficulty in ſuppoſing that he may (if, he thinks fit) declare unto ſinners for their encouragement, that they ſhall not ſeek for them in vain. If it be thought unſuitable that God ſhould <hi>promiſe</hi> any kind of favours to thoſe who are not ſo in Chriſt as to be in a ſtate of juſtification, then it is unſuitable for him to <hi>confer</hi> any kind of favours on ſuch perſons. For it is to be obſerved, that the weight of the objection, as it is commonly urged, does not lie ſo much againſt the promiſe of bleſſings to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as againſt the beſtowment. No conſiderate perſon will find any difficulty in allowing that what is fit to be done by God, may if he thinks proper be the matter of promiſe. A ſpecial and ſaving union to Chriſt is not neceſſary as an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ground of God's beſtowing upon us the common bounties of his providence, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace of his ſpirit, or even that grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are enabled to believe unto ſalvation. For it is by faith that we are firſt ſavingly united to Chriſt. Our ſpecial intereſt in him is therefore the conſequence, and not the ground of our firſt believing on him. In other words, our firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting into Chriſt, is a favour inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with juſtification and ſalvation, and yet it would be a contradiction to ſay that the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this favour was founded on our being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently in Chriſt by a ſpecial and ſaving union.</p>
            <p>THERE is then, I apprehend, as good as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe tho' not of ſalvation, or converting grace,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:010643_0113_0F81BCF887ACC860"/>
to the endeavours of the unconverted, yet of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace and influence of the Holy Spirit to thoſe who improve what they have received.—Only this muſt be underſtood with one limitation, viz. that it holds true only during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of mens probationary ſtate in this life, which depends intirely upon the ſovereign pleaſure of God, to determine. Nor is it any objection that the Apoſtle ſays, "all the promiſes are in Chriſt." This is readily granted in the utmoſt extent, to which the univerſal term, can with any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of truth be underſtood. All the promiſes, or encouragements which God has ever given to fallen man, yea I will add, all the unpromiſed mercy that he has ever viſited mankind with, muſt be considered as the fruit of Chriſt's redemption, and therefore the Redeemer ſtands in a common relation to and connection with the race of Adam. But I conceive however that the Apoſtle in the words above quoted, means the ſpecial promiſes of the covenant of grace, which preſuppoſe a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial relation to Chriſt, as the ground and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our partaking of them; and then nothing can be argued from them againſt promiſes of a different kind, to perſons in a different ſtate. But theſe things may come under conſideration again in another place.</p>
            <p>IT may be further enquired—Do not men always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt in this common operation, till they are overcome by that grace which is irreſiſtably efficacious? I anſwer, it is true, that the natural tendency of this grace is reſiſted by every one who ſtill remains uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. For the tendency of it is to influence men to repent ſincerely of their ſins, and turn to God. But ſo far as any good effects are wrought
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:010643_0114_0F81BCF94B57E670"/>
in and upon us by the Holy Spirit, his agency is not reſiſted. There is no compulſion or violence offered to the liberty of the will, either in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or that conviction, and humiliation, and reformation which is ordinarily antecedent and preparatory thereunto. To enquire then whether a ſinner does always and univerſally reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt until he is regenerated, is the ſame as to aſk, whether the agency of the Spirit, previous to regeneration, be ever productive of any good effect. Or, (which comes to the ſame thing) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any duties performed by, or inward effects wrought in a ſinner, by the common grace of the Spirit, preparatory to converſion. But this has been already, conſidered, and the reality of this preparatory work, I truſt, has been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved from ſcripture and experience. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever oppoſite the corrupted nature of man is to that which is good, our actual reſiſtance to the work of the Holy Spirit ceaſes, and without any force upon our natural liberty is overcome, ſo far forth as the Spirit's agency proves effectual to the production of any good effect in and upon our ſouls. He then who receives the light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction which is objectively propoſed in the word, and is thereupon affected with a ſenſe of his ſinful and wretched eſtate, and cheriſhes a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about the ſalvation of his ſoul, and guards againſt thoſe ſins and temptations which tend to harden him in ſecurity and impenitence, ſuch an one does ſo far comply with the motions of the Holy Spirit. Whereas he who oppoſes convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who counteracts the dictates of conſcience, who caſts off fear, and will walk in the way of his heart, and the ſight of his own eyes, he who
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010643_0115_0F81BCFA1E0CCB78"/>
does thus, reſiſteth the grace of God, and as the Apoſtle ſays, receives it in vain.</p>
            <p>AND however the unregenerate do oppoſe the tendency of thoſe means whereby the Spirit ſtrives with them, inaſmuch as theſe are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fitted to lead them to a ſaving converſion, it will not follow, that a ſinner may not ſo comply with, and improve that grace which he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as that there may be reaſon to hope, from the word of God, that he will receive further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. The regenerate do always in this world reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſo that the means which are uſed with them for their ſanctification, have not that effect, which in their own nature they tend unto. Were it not for this, they would be perfectly holy in heart and life. But it will not be denyed, that they may ſo improve that grace which is given to them, as that they may take encouragement from the promiſes of the goſpel, to hope and truſt that he who has begun a good work, will carry it to perfection; and that in the way of waiting upon God, they ſhall renew their ſtrength, through continued ſupplies of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo to be remembred, that it is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method of the Spirit to work upon the ſouls of men, with and by the outward means of grace. It is by the word of truth, as the inſtrument, that ſinners are awakened, enlightned, humbled and converted. They therefore who diligently attend thereto, are in this reſpect in the way of receiving divine aids and influences, and of having them continued and increaſed; and on the contrary, they who neglect the outward means, do thereby
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:010643_0116_0F81BCFAD1ED7658"/>
keep themſelves, as it were, out of the way of theſe bleſſings. The heathen are more unlikely to enjoy the ſalutary beams of the ſun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, than we on whom it is riſen. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not the outward means of divine knowledge, they are in ſcripture ſpoken of as far off from God. And with equal truth it may be ſaid, that where the chriſtian religion is profeſſed, and its ordinances adminiſtred, they who through careleſſneſs will not improve their ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and ſo continue in groſs ignorance and wickedneſs, are farther from the kingdom of God, than they who ſeriouſly and diligently improve them. As the Spirit is wont to enlighten, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and convert men only by and with the word, ſo they only to whom the word is ſent, and who attend unto it, are in any probability of knowing the truth, and turning from darkneſs to light. How clearly ſoever the light ſhines round a man, if he keeps himſelf always ſhut up in the dark, he will not enjoy the benefit of its influence, any more than if the ſun were not riſen upon the earth. Nor will any other means, with which the Spirit uſeth to work, be of any better effect, any farther than they are attended to by us. Upon the whole, our conduct in this caſe is of moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conſequence, and according as we improve the grace we have received, there is reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it will either be continued &amp; increaſed, or ſuſpended and withdrawn. But it is time to proceed to the third enquiry, viz.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ARE any endeavours or exertments of a ſinner conducive to his being in a more deſirable and hopeful ſtate, in regard of his inward diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and qualifications?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:010643_0117_0F81BCFB8FE17DA0"/>I ANSWER, this point is already in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, if the reaſoning above be juſt. For it has been proved at large, that ſome who have not yet attained to the ſtate of regeneration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, may be nearer thereto than others, in the diſpoſition of their minds, and are therefore more likely to obtain that faith and repentance with which ſalvation is connected. It has alſo been proved, that theſe preparatory diſpoſitions are wrought in us by the power of the word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And that our conduct is of important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration with reſpect to our having the outward means of grace, and inward influences of the Spirit—It follows then plainly from theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that thoſe inward effects of the word and Spirit which are now under conſideration, have a like connection with, and dependance upon our conduct. Without ſome exerciſe of our active faculties, we ſhall never, underſtand the doctrines and precepts of the goſpel, nor be duly convinced that we have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, nor have a juſt ſenſe of the danger and miſery of a ſtate of guilt and condemnation, nor caſt about in our minds whether there be any way, of ſalvation, and what ground of hope there is for one in ſuch a caſe, nor ſhall we look to heaven for that help which none but God can give us. Such a work of conviction is neceſſary to prepare the ſoul for the grace revealed in the goſpel; and it is not effected without our active concurrence, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the ordinary means whereby the Holy Spirit worketh in the minds of men.</p>
            <p>IT may be added, that our own experience and obſervation further confirms the truth of what has been above argued. By complying carefully
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:010643_0118_0F81BCFC4C4B3B68"/>
with the dictates of conſcience, it will become more tender and perceptive.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Earneſtneſs of mind and diligence of endeavour, tend to promote each other. He that has an heart earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly engaged, will take pains; and he that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and painful in all duty, probably won't be ſo long, before he finds the ſenſibleneſs of his heart, and earneſtneſs of his ſpirit greatly increaſed.</q>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>THE effects of the Spirit's agency in and upon our hearts will be more ſenſibly perceived, in ſome proportion to our care to improve that grace, and thoſe means of grace which we are favoured with. Every one who has attended with care to the ſtate and frame of his own mind muſt, I believe, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that if he has at any time attended with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and diligence on the means of grace, and cheriſhed the motions, of God's Spirit in and with them, it has commonly been followed with ſome ſenſible effect on his mind and converſation. He has found ſome check given to his vain and ſinful purſuits, and a conviction of the neceſſity of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſoul's concerns, and ſecuring the things of his eternal peace, has been more deeply imprinted on his mind and heart. And they who have worn off thoſe ſerious impreſſions which they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had, I doubt not, have a witneſs in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt themſelves, that they have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and quenched the Spirit ſtriving with them, by indulging to ſloth, wilful ſin, love of the world, and vain amuſements. As believers by improving the grace and aſſiſtance afforded to them, receive freſh ſupplies, whereby they make progreſs in the work of ſanctification, ſo the awakened ſinner, who improves the ſtrength and influence communicated to him by God in and with his ordinances, ſhall
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:010643_0119_0F81BCFD0C9D1870"/>
hereby attain to further degrees of light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and be more and more reclaimed from thoſe evil courſes, which tend to blind and harden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſo obſtruct his effectual converſion.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now finiſhed what I propoſed to offer in confirmation of the ſecond part of this argument, that what renders the ſtate of one man more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than that of another, is ordinarily connected with human endeavours, in a diligent uſe of the outward means of grace. And hence the concluſion is plain and undeniable, that ſinners are encouraged, as well as bound in duty, to labour for the meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth unto everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>IF no more could be offered for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners in ſeeking ſalvation than what has been inſiſted on, this ought in all reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their reſolution, and animate their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. But we may go further and ſay, that it is in the way of attending the inſtituted means of grace that faith, and all the benefits of redemption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with connected are obtained. I have been ſhewing that it is by the Spirit's concurrence with our active endeavours, that we acquire ſuch degrees of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge, conviction of ſin, concern about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, &amp;c. as are requiſite to prepare us to give a due entertainment to the grace of God revealed in the goſpel. And that none but they who are thus previouſly enlightned, awakened and humbled, do receive and acquieſce in the meſſage of life and peace by Jeſus Chriſt: And of conſequence, ſuch are more likely than others to partake of this grace and ſalvation. But it is to be added for the further encouragement of human endeavours, that it is in the way of attending the preſcribed means of grace that the ſaving benefits of redemption are ordinarily
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:010643_0120_0F81BCFE25DEF240"/>
obtained by &amp; applied to us. It is by our attending the preaching of the word, in particular, that we obtain faith, according to the expreſs words of the Apoſtle. "It is of the incorruptible ſeed of the word of God, that we are born again."</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be objected, that however the word may in ſome ſenſe be the means of faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, yet there is no room for any endeavours of ours in order to obtain it. For a ſinner is wholly paſſive in hearing underſtanding and believing the report of the goſpel. I would anſwer.—That it is a commanded duty that ſinners ſhould attend to the preaching of the word, as ſhall be proved in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. That they are capable of obeying this and ſuch-like commands in ſome manner, even from a regard to the authority of God.—That theſe commands were given as a motive to obedience.—And that whatever is done in obedience to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ever implies ſome active exerciſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. So that however paſſive the mind may be ſuppoſed to be in the very inſtance of believing, yet we may be and are active in hearing, which is a neceſſary prerequiſite and condition of faith. I might further ſay, that the ſcripture notion of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, conſidered ſubjectively, is more than a paſſive perception. But to propoſe and vindicate the evidence of this truth, would require more room than can here be allowed for an incidental point: Nor does our argument require us to diſpute this queſtion.</p>
            <p>IT is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe, that we have plain ſcripture to aſſure us, that in the times of Chriſt and the apoſtles, human endeavours were the way in which men obtained faith, and entred into the kingdom of God. We have to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010643_0121_0F81BCFEDC6AFA88"/>
the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelf—<hi>Since the days of John the Baptiſt, the kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 11.12.</note> The ſenſe of which words is more plainly expreſſed in the parallel text: "The kingdom of God is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every man preſſeth into it."<note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. 16.16.</note> Theſe words certainly imply much more than that men were paſſively wrought upon. They denote a ſtrong deſire, and earneſt endeavour. In this manner ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then entred into the kingdom of God; into a ſtate of grace and acceptance with him. They ſtruggled and contended reſolutely for ſalvation, and like ſoldiers ſtorming a city, or forcing an entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſtrove as it were who ſhould be the firſt to ruſh in. And the account which the inſpired hiſtorian gives of the ſucceſs of Paul's preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Bereans, is worthy of ſpecial remark.—<hi>Theſe were more noble than thoſe of Theſſalonica, in that they received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the ſcriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo: Therefore many of them believed.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Act. 17.11.</note> They uſed the appointed means to underſtand the nature and evidences of the chriſtian doctrine: This is recorded with a particular commendation; and it was owing to this, as the hiſtorian informs us, that ſo many believed.</p>
            <p>IN this manner men were converted to the faith and obedience of the goſpel, under the preaching of John Baptiſt, Chriſt and the apoſtles. And if it be enquired concerning thoſe, who have in every ſucceeding age given the beſt evidences of ſincerity in their profeſſions of faith in, and obedience to Chriſt, how they were called out of darkneſs into God's marvellous light, and tranſlated from the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:010643_0122_0F81BD01D8D2E390"/>
kingdom of ſatan, into the kingdom of his dear Son, they would, I doubt not, all agree in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; that they were firſt awakened to a ſenſe of the miſery and danger of a ſtate of ſin, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of obtaining pardon, and being reinſtated in his favour: And hence they have been excited to a diligent improvement of the outward means of grace. Thus they have been led into all that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and ſatisfaction in the goſpel, and the way of ſalvation therein delineated, to which they have attained. If we conſider the accounts, which the moſt exemplary profeſſors of the chriſtian religion have given of the manner of their converſion, we ſhall find them thus far agreed, how much ſoever they may differ in other circumſtances.</p>
            <p>FROM the whole that has been offered under this argument, may I not venture to ſay, it is evident, that they who labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, in the manner which has been declared, are much more likely to obtain it, than they who wilfully deſpiſe it, and put far from their thoughts the things of their eternal peace. To deny this will, I think, unavoidably run us into the groſſeſt abſurdities.</p>
            <p>IF the diligent improvement of the means of grace (as we commonly ſpeak) has no ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciveneſs to mens obtaining of ſalvation, it is then no priviledge to be in the way of theſe means, and they who are brought up and live all their days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſavages of Africa, have as deſirable a lot, as we who are born in a chriſtian land, educated in the profeſſion of the true religion, having the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in our hands, with liberty and capacity to read them, and the goſpel faithfully preached to us.—For the outward means will be of no advantage to
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:010643_0123_0F81BD029A0437A0"/>
any one who will not attend to and improve them. How plainly ſoever the truth with its evidences may be declared, no man will be the wiſer or better or happier for it, unleſs he can be ſome way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to exerciſe his active faculties, in conſidering and judging of theſe things, and applying them to himſelf, that he may ſee his own perſonal concern in them. To perſuade and enable a ſinner to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto and uſe the outward means of faith and converſion, is the firſt work of the Holy Spirit; and is the foundation of every conſequent effect wrought in the ſoul by the influence of the word and Spirit of God. But there is one ſcruple which we muſt endeavour to remove, before we diſmiſs this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For though it does not directly militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our reaſoning under this head, yet it tends to weaken its perſuaſive force, and damp the zeal of mens endeavours.</p>
            <p>IT may be ſaid, That ſince there are no promiſes of ſalvation or effectual grace, to any thing wrought in or done by a ſinner before he ſavingly believes in Chriſt, he may notwithſtanding all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and all that light and conviction, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to which an unregenerate man may attain, periſh at laſt with hypocrites and unbelievers: And then not only all his pains will be loſt, but his guilt and puniſhment will thereby be greatly inhanced. That grace which was inſufficient for his converſion, will ſubject him to a more fearful doom than he would have been liable to, if he had always lived in ignorance, and a careleſs neglect of religion.—There ſeems therefore to be but ſmall encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an unregenerate man to ſtrive for ſalvation, upon ſuch uncertainty of ſucceſs, when there is ſo much danger that his caſe will hereby be rendred more deplorable.—I anſwer,—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:010643_0124_0F81BD034DED8D40"/>ALLOWING that there are no promiſes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or effectual grace to any thing, which a ſinner, remaining unconverted, is capable of attaining to, yet I ſee little reaſon for ſo ſad a concluſion, as that any one ſhall be left to periſh forever, who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres in ſtriving and preſſing to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and through the agency of the Spirit, with the outward means of grace, is awakened, enlightned, and brought off from falſe confidences, all which is attainable previous to converſion. Does not God every day diſpenſe numberleſs unpromiſed favours among mankind? What promiſe is there that the next morſel of food that we ſhall take, will not have the effect of poiſon? Yet who is there in his right mind, that would ſcruple to eat and drink when prompted thereunto by the neceſſities of his nature? Who is there that was denyed a bleſſing if he continued ſeeking for it in God's appointed way? Is there any inſtance upon ſcripture record of one who ſought God's favour and bleſſing in vain? Or is there any intimation of ſuch a thing in the word of God? Tis true we are told,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. 13.24.</note> "that many ſhall ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and not be able." But it is plain from the occaſion and connection of the words, that it was a cold, faint, ſlothful way of ſeeking, which is here ſpoken of as ineffectual—"ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many I ſay unto you ſhall ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able." In theſe words Chriſt exhorts to earneſtneſs of endeavour for ſalvation. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enforcing the exhortation muſt then be taken in ſuch a ſenſe as will carry a perſuaſive force. Now tis a ſtrong argument for earneſt ſtriving, that many will take ſome pains, and yet fail for want of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and perſeverance. But if we ſay that many
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:010643_0125_0F81BD03D8A3EC20"/>
who ſtruggle and agonize to the utmoſt of their power to enter in at the ſtrait gate ſhall yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, this will tend to diſcourage, rather than ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the earneſtneſs of our endeavours.</p>
            <p>THOUGH God is not bound to ſave an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinner, yet there is great reaſon to hope, that he will be found of thoſe who by his grace are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced to ſeek him, in that way in which he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily diſpenſes his bleſſings. And if this be not enough to awaken our diligence in labouring for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, I do not think that even a promiſe would have a better effect. That man is ſurely very perverſe, who will be at no pains to know and ſecure the things of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace, unleſs he has a promiſe that his attempt ſhall certainly be ſucceſsful.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Think how many take ſome pains for ſalvation, and yet periſh becauſe they do not take enough. Many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. The reaſon why many come ſhort of grace and glory, is becauſe they reſt in a lazy ſeeking of that, which will not be attained without a laborious ſtriving. They have a good mind of happineſs, and a good opinion of holineſs, and will take ſome good ſteps towards both, but their convictions are weak, they do not conſider what they know and believe, and conſequently their deſires are cold, and their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours feeble, and there is no ſtrength or ſteadineſs in their reſolutions, and thus they come ſhort and loſe becauſe they do not preſs forward.</q>

               </note> Such a reſolution very ill becomes a ſinner, who has nothing to hope for but from unmerited mercy. We labour for the meat that periſheth, without any promiſe of ſucceſs.

No one is neceſſitated to abuſe theſe favours and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to the aggravation of his miſery.

Though I dare not ſay there is any direct promiſe made to humiliation in ſcripture, yet univerſal experience does confirm it. It ſeems to be in this caſe as in the work of nature; when a child in the womb is prepared for a ſoul, God does always infuſe a ſoul into it, though there be no ſuch promiſe: So where a ſinner is prepared for faith, God does infuſe that.</q>

               </note> And whoſoever improves what he hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance. It is not then from any incapacity, or want of power neceſſarily connected with a ſtate of ſpiritual death, that ſinners refuſe, neglect and oppoſe that light and grace, which is either given, or immediately offered, to the inhancement of their future miſery. Theſe favours have in their own nature a good tendency, and are often ſubſervient to the converſion and eternal ſalvation of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. Did men attend to, and improve the outward means of grace, and inward influences and
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:010643_0127_0F81BD0569E8E1C0"/>
aids of the Holy Spirit, diligently, and ſeriouſly, as they might do previous to regeneration, it would be much otherwiſe with them than it is: And for any thing I know, it might conſtantly iſſue in their ſaving converſion.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, how abſurdly does he act who neglects and refuſes the favours and grace of God, becauſe they may be abuſed, and their good tendency and deſign counteracted, to the increaſe of his guilt and woe. A man who will practiſe upon this maxim, muſt ſtop his ears againſt all inſtruction; ſhut his eyes againſt all light, and baniſh all ſerious thought if poſſible from his mind: Not only ſo, but he muſt reſolutely refuſe all the common bleſſings of providence which are tendred to him, and put an end to his life without delay. For as long as a ſinner lives, he is treaſuring up to himſelf wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath, unleſs the goodneſs of God leads him to repentance. But who except a mad man would think it prudent, to involve himſelf in certain and immediate guilt, to avoid that which is only poſſible, and chuſe certain perdition, rather than a probable hope of ſalvation. And what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance have we that wilful, choſen ignorance will be any excuſe or extenuation of ſin? How do we know that mens refuſing the knowledge of God's ways is not as offenſive to him, or will not receive as many and heavy ſtripes, as if they had known his will and not done it? Are we ſure that ſinners will not be reckoned with for thoſe advantages and privileges that were tendred to them, whether they received them, or made any uſe of them or not? The ſcriptures no where inform us that this will not be the caſe, but rather intimate that it will be ſo. Be this as it may, ſince there is ſo much
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:010643_0128_0F81BD06CB80BF78"/>
encouragement that the ſinner who diligently perſeveres in labouring for the meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life ſhall obtain it, it muſt be the height of folly and madneſs for any one to deſpiſe and reject this, and chuſe to ſit down with the forlorn hope of a more tolerable doom in hell.</p>
            <p>AND now to ſhut up this argument, every one who deſires ſalvation is bound and encouraged to take that courſe in order to ſecure the ſame wherein there is the greateſt probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. And that courſe has the greateſt probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſucceſs, in which both ſcripture and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teach us that ſalvation is ordinarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. That is the diligent uſe of thoſe means which God has preſcribed, and is commonly pleaſed to accompany with his bleſſing. We have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence, that he has been found of many, who have thus ſought and enquired after him: And it does not appear that any one was ever ſavingly converted, till he was firſt brought thus to ſeek to God for converting grace: Nor does it appear that any one who perſevered in thus waiting on God for his mercy, was ever finally rejected by him. From all which it appears, that it is the duty of all who are concerned to obtain the meat which endureth to eternal life, to labour for it, in ſuch ways as God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: And to this they have abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.

            <p>ANOTHER argument in proof of our doctrine may be taken from the command of God, enjoining upon ſinners an attendance to the inſtrumental duties before mentioned. And that I may ſtate this matter plainly, and ſhew how perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the argument from hence is to our preſent purpoſe, I propoſe—</p>

            <p n="2">II. SHEW that it follows from hence, that they are bound and encouraged to obſerve theſe duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SHALL prove that theſe inſtrumental duties before deſcribed, are in ſcripture enjoined on the unregenerate. It will not I think be neceſſary to labour this point. If we look into our bibles with any attention, it can hardly eſcape our obſervation.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:010643_0130_0F81BD0859D2B3D8"/>
It will be ſufficient, I think, briefly to recite and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate a few plain texts to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>ALL to whom the call of the goſpel is ſent are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend to it. The divine proclamation thus beſpeaks ſinners of mankind, <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark 4.9.</note> Theſe are the words of Chriſt to the multitudes, which reſorted to him from the cities and towns round about. The greateſt part, no doubt, went to ſee and hear him chiefly out of curioſity, from the fame they had heard of him; and not becauſe they believed that he was the Son of God, the promiſed Saviour, or even a teacher come from God; which yet many of the rulers and chief prieſts did in ſome ſort believe, who would not confeſs him for fear of the Jews: For they loved the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God. Not only the profeſſed diſciples of Jeſus, but all who were capable of hearing, are called,—and commanded to hear.</p>
            <p>THE ſame is ſuggeſted in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 16.</note> When the former is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as calling to Abraham, and praying that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus might be ſent to warn his brethren, leſt they ſhould come to the place of torment; the anſwer is, <hi>they have Moſes and the prophets, let them hear them.</hi> It was plainly our Saviour's deſign in theſe words, to inſinuate a command to all who have the word of God in their hands, that they attend to the reading and preaching of it, as means of eſcaping the puniſhment of the world to come. There is no intimation that theſe five brethren were true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or that no one was required to hear the word of God till he was firſt a believer. The whole ſcope of the parable has quite a contrary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:010643_0131_0F81BD090C4E3CF0"/>
If it ſhould be thought, that the words above quoted direct men to a practical attention, or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the doctrines, and precepts of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, rather than require the duty of hearing the word, I am well content with this interpretation; but would obſerve upon it, that this is as much to our purpoſe as the other. For here is plainly a command to make uſe of the holy ſcriptures, as means of avoiding the place of torment: And this preſuppoſes our reading or hearing them. Here is an expreſs injunction of the uſe of means: Yea the duty of hearing the word, is by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quence enjoined upon ſinners, as the way to eſcape the pains of hell.</p>
            <p>THE words of the apoſtle James may, I think, be not improperly added,<note n="*" place="bottom">James 1.19</note> 
               <hi>Let every man be ſwift to hear.</hi> Every man who has capacity and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, is here commanded to give diligent attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to hearing the word. If any ſhould object, that theſe words were addreſſed only to believers, <hi>in profeſſion, and the acceptation of the Apoſtle;</hi> I anſwer, if this be granted, yet the obligation of this precept ought not to be limited to believers, or thoſe who profeſs faith in Chriſt. The univerſal term, every man, <hi>(pas anthropos)</hi> methinks muſt ſignify, that it is the duty of every one, to whom the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call of the goſpel is ſent, to hearken to it, conſider the nature and evidence of the chriſtian doctrine, and improve all proper opportunities of hearing the goſpel preached. Beſides, ſhould we ſuppoſe, that this precept belongs only to perſons of the ſame character with thoſe to whom this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle was directed, it will I apprehend infer an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of obedience, on thoſe who are not true
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:010643_0132_0F81BD0B287861D0"/>
believers. There is great reaſon to conclude, from ſeveral paſſages in this epiſtle, that St. James did not conſider them all as true chriſtians, however they might profeſs faith. Many of them it ſeems held very corrupt opinions, as that a dead faith would ſave them, tho' they were looſe in their lives: And their practice was agreable to this opinion. It is ſcarce credible, that perſons whoſe principles and practices were ſo corrupt, were all in the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the apoſtle, the true diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND if it be the duty of ſinners to hear, we might juſtly conclude, from analogy, that it is their duty to read the word of God. Beſides we have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs direction to this purpoſe in ſcripture. Says Chriſt to the unbelieving Jews, of whom he teſtifies, <hi>that they would not come to him that they might have life; ſearch the ſcriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they that teſtify of me.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 5.39.</note> It was not certainly the primary deſign of theſe words to inſtruct believers in the duties of the cbriſtian life, but to recommend to unbelievers the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, as means of obtaining faith in Chriſt. For to him all the prophets gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and if they would receive their teſtimony, they could not reaſonably reject him.</p>
            <p>GOD has alſo commanded men in a ſtate of ſin to remember, and conſider thoſe things which he declares and ſpeaks to them. <hi>Remember now and ſhew yourſelves men, bring it again to mind O ye tranſgreſſors</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. 46.8.</note> And the Pſalmiſt having declared the awful doom of the wicked, the judgment which God will pronounce and execute upon them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with a ſolemn admonition to ſuch, that they attend to it, and lay it to heart. <hi>Conſider this ye
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:010643_0133_0F81BD0B962B6658"/>
that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi> Here is a plain command to ſinners to reflect and meditate ſeriouſly upon the ſolemn truths revealed in the word of God, and ſuffer them to ſink deep into their heart, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that this is a means of their eſcaping the deſtruction, with which they are threatned.</p>
            <p>THAT prayer is a duty enjoined on the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, appears from the words of Peter to Simon the magician. That he was a wicked man, in the judgment of the apoſtle, no one can doubt, who attends to the apoſtle's words. <hi>Thou haſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right with God. I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity.</hi> Yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts him to <hi>pray to God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him.</hi> Should it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was not directed to pray unleſs he firſt repented ſincerely, ſo was converted: I anſwer, though it was doubtleſs his duty to repent of his ſin with godly ſorrow, and pray in true faith, yet we cannot conclude from the order of the words, that he was not bound and encouraged to pray, unleſs he firſt was a true penitent and believer. Yea the apoſtle's words obviouſly intimate the contrary.—For there is a ſure promiſe of pardon to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in godly ſincerity, and pray in faith. Such ſhall <hi>without peradventure</hi> be forgiven: Whereas the apoſtle's words, "pray to God IF PERHAPS the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee," im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that it was his duty and wiſdom to pray for pardon, though he ſhould not do it with that repentance and faith which has a certain connection with forgiveneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Act. 8.21.22, 23.</note>

               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:010643_0134_0F81BD0D9BCE6498"/>AND our text ſo expreſly requires ſinners to uſe endeavours for obtaining ſalvation, that with it I ſhall cloſe theſe ſcripture teſtimonies. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life.</hi> But theſe words have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſufficiently opened, and their pertinency to our preſent purpoſe, ſhewn at large in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, which I ſhall not here repeat. To theſe direct proofs, I will add two or three conſequential arguments, and ſo finiſh this head.</p>
            <p>THE ſcriptures teach us, that they who will not improve their ſpiritual privileges, ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed for ſuch neglect. When Jeſus ſent his apoſtles to preach the goſpel,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 10:14, 15.</note> he ſaid to them, <hi>Whoſoever will not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or city, ſhake off the duſt of your feet: Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</hi> If any to whom the call of the goſpel is ſent will not hear it, nor attend to it, their refuſal will be charged to them as their great ſin, and will procure them a moſt intolerable puniſhment. It is then a plain and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſequence, that it is the duty of ſinners to attend to the means of grace. No one ſurely would be threatned, and puniſhed, for not doing what he was not required to do.</p>
            <p>THIS may be alſo inferred from God's giving mankind a revelation of his will, and appointing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means for the converſion of ſinners. When God ſpeaks to men, it is certainly their duty to be attentive. His inſtituting the ordinance of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, infers the duty of hearing. There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary connection between them. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:010643_0135_0F81BD0D023CCCB8"/>
that the counſels and inſtructions of God's word are addreſſed to unrenewed ſinners, as well as ſaints. The preaching of the goſpel is, by the appointment of God, a converting, as well as edifying ordinance. It is therefore the duty of the unconverted to attend thereto; otherwiſe they turn away from God, who in his word is calling and ſpeaking to them from heaven, ſo oppoſe his will, and condemn his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, the obligation of ſinners to attend to the ordinary means of grace, may be inferred from God's commanding them to believe, and repent. <hi>This is the work of God,</hi> "that is the work which he requires of us," (ſo Dr. Owen paraphraſes the words) <hi>that we ſhould believe on him whom he hath ſent.<note n="a" place="bottom">Joh. 6.29.</note> This is his commandment, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt.<note n="b" place="bottom">1 Joh. 3.23.</note> Jeſus preached the goſpel, ſaying, the time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand, repent ye and believe the goſpel.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Mark 1.14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>God hath now commanded all men every where to repent.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">Acts 17.31.</note> 
               <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi>
               <note n="e" place="bottom">Acts 3.19.</note> But the ſcriptures teach us that faith, repentance, and converſion, are ordinarily no otherwiſe obtained, than by attending to the preſcribed means of grace. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Rom. 10.17.</note> So does repentance. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the prophets,</hi> (ſays Abraham in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>neither will they be perſuaded</hi> (to repent) <hi>though one aroſe from the dead</hi>
               <note n="g" place="bottom">Luk. 16.31.</note> Conſideration is alſo a means of converſion. <hi>I thought on my ways</hi> (ſays David) <hi>and turned my feet into thy teſtimonies</hi>
               <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſal. 119.59.</note>—When therefore we are commanded to believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn to God, we are virtually, and by

            <p n="2">2. TO ſhew at follows from hence, that they are bound, and encouraged to a practical attendance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe duties. It will not be denyed that it is the duty of all to obey the commands of God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the ordinances he has preſcribed to them. Nor will it be denyed that believers have encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as obligation to obedience. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will alſo be acknowledged on all hands, that ſinners are bound and encouraged, to believe in the ſon of God, and then yield the obedience of faith, to theſe and all other precepts of the goſpel. So I ſhall not inſiſt upon the proof of theſe things. But the great point which is here to be enquired into is, Whether theſe commands oblige and encourage men to obedience, while they are deſtitute of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith and the grace of regeneration?</p>
            <p>TO this I anſwer, that ſuch obedience to theſe commands, as ſinners are capable of antecedent to faith and regeneration, is required and encouraged in theſe precepts. It is required, becauſe as to the ſubſtance and matter of the performance it is good, and agreable to the divine precept. Though it be not the whole requirement of the command, yet it is part of what is required; conſequently carries an obligation of obedience with it. It is required, becauſe the neglect and omiſſion of the ſubſtance of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:010643_0137_0F81BD10B33475A0"/>
commanded duties, as well as the want of right principles is ſin, and as ſuch is ſeverely threatned and puniſhed by God. Every one is commanded to depart from evil as well as do good: And ſuch actions as are materially as well as formally contrary to God's commands, are every way evil. And finally it is required, becauſe it is the way &amp; means, in attendance to which faith and a new heart are ordinarily obtained. When therefore ſinners are commanded to believe, and repent, they are by neceſſary implication commanded to attend the means of faith and repentance.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, ſuch obedience to theſe commands as men are capable of before regeneration and ſaving faith, <hi>is also encouraged.</hi> All the precepts which God has given to mankind in his word, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned not only to make them know their duty, but alſo influence them to practiſe it. The end of God's giving commands to men, has always been to encourage, as well as bind them to obedience. They are founded upon a diſpenſation of grace; ſo are deſigned and adapted to ſubſerve this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful plan of divine mercy. And this is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement enough to ſinful men to endeavour a compliance with them. It is alſo a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a diligent improvement of the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and gracious influences which God vouchſafes to ſinners, that this is the way to have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and encreaſed: For whoſoever improves what he hath, to him ſhall be given. Acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obedience performed by the unregenerate; though defective and unholy, tend to and often iſſue in their everlaſting good Hereby they are with-held from many ſins, kept in the way of God's bleſſing, in the uſe of thoſe means by which faith is
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:010643_0138_0F81BD120DA685A8"/>
obtained. But in order to clear up and vindicate the evidence of this propoſition, <hi>that ſinners are bound and encouraged, by the commands of God in his word, to ſeek ſalvation, in the way of attendance to the preſcribed means of grace, even while they are deſtitute of that faith and repentance which is unto life,</hi> it will be proper that we conſider the ſeveral ways in which ſome have endeavoured to evade this concluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT may be ſaid, all unbelievers are under the covenant of works. And therefore all the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of duty which they are under, are only the obligations of a covenant requiring perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the condition of life. Though it be their duty to read and hear and pray, ſince God has commanded theſe things, yet till they are ſet free from the law by being married to Chriſt by faith, there is no other obligation or encouragement to endeavour obedience in theſe inſtances, than there is to keep all the commandments with ſinleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in order to juſtification. Tis vain to urge duties on men, while under the law, as a covenant of life, unleſs we will inculcate perfect obedience to the law of works. But ſince no man is able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain juſtification and eternal life in this way, though obedience is the duty of unbelievers, yet there is no encouragement to any attempts in this way. In oppoſition to this I undertake to prove,</p>
            <p>THAT theſe duties, which in the word of God are required of fallen man, are not required upon the foundation of a covenant of works; or as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the condition of a covenant of life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding perfect obedience to the law of works, in order to juſtification. I grant that the law of God obliges all mankind to obſerve every command
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:010643_0139_0F81BD12CDA2E010"/>
which God is ever pleaſed to give them. Our diſobeying any divine precept, even the poſitive precepts of the goſpel, is truly a breach of the law, and puniſhable as ſuch. But what is here aſſerted is, that the END of God's giving theſe commands to ſinners, is not that any one ſhould be juſtified by his obedience to them; they do not belong to a covenant of works, requiring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the law, as the condition of life: But they are given upon quite a different foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and for quite a different purpoſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) IT does not appear from ſcripture, that perfect obedience to the moral law, or law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ever was made the covenant condition of life to man. The word of God does not inform us, that Adam was put upon trial for life, under a covenant requiring perfect obedience to the whole moral law, as the condition of immortality: But the whole account we have of that primitive conſtitution has quite a contrary appearance. I know many have ſuppoſed, that Adam was under ſuch a covenant of works; but upon what grounds I know not. There is nothing in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to build ſuch a ſuppoſition upon that ever I could find; and we can know nothing about this matter beyond what we are taught by revelation. The condition of life was abſtaining from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit. No other is mentioned, or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Had our firſt parents been obedient in this inſtance, they and their poſterity had been hereby juſtified, and inherited immortal life.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>By the account we have of this matter in ſcripture, the death or life of our firſt parents, and their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, was wholly put upon their eating or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to eat the forbidden fruit. The law of nature is not, that I know of, any where mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a part of this covenant tranſaction. The tenor of this covenant in its firſt exhibition was, <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> And accordingly after the fall, God only demands of Adam, who told thee that thou waſt naked? Haſt thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat? Agreable to this we find the ſentence was inflicted on Adam for this cauſe, without mention of any other, becauſe thou haſt eaten of the tree,</q> &amp;c. <bibl>

               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:010643_0140_0F81BD13947CA4E8"/>BUT it may be aſked, would they not have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under condemnation, if they had committed any other ſin? I anſwer, if they had believed God, and not tranſgreſſed that poſitive prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was the condition of life to them, we have no reaſon to think that they would have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any other inſtance; but by the providence and grace of God, they would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the prevailing power of every other temptation. In other words, they would have been confirmed in a ſtate of ſinleſs rectitude, as a reward of their obedience in that inſtance, upon which the promiſe of life was ſuſpended; in like manner as the ſaints in heaven will be confirmed in holineſs, through the favour of God, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their being juſtified, and intitled to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, by the righteouſneſs of the ſecond Adam Jeſus Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) WHATEVER covenant man was under before his fall, it laid no obligations of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>as a covenant,</hi> after it was broken. And that for this plain reaſon, becauſe a covenant is at an end as ſoon as it is broken, unleſs it be renewed. Mankind are indeed bound to ſuffer the penalty their breach of covenant was threatned with. But it would be groſly abſurd, to ſuppoſe
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:010643_0141_0F81BD1468C4AD10"/>
that after a covenant was effectually broken, and its promiſe irrecoverably forfeited, man ſhould yet be bound by virtue of it to fulfil the duty therein required, in order thereby to obtain juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication &amp; eternal life. The covenant with Adam, as Mr. Stoddard has juſtly obſerved, was at an end, upon his eating the forbidden fruit. After this it had no further commands upon him. The obligation he was now under, by virtue of this conſtitution, was not to do, but to ſuffer. So that if Adam were ſuppoſed to be a probationer for immortality under a covenant of works, or upon condition of perfect obedience to the law of nature, yet I think it cannot and will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that after he had ſinned, broken covenant, and he with his poſterity were condemned to die, he was ſtill a probationer for life on the terms of ſinleſs obedience, by virtue of this primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS it will now be enquired, are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then bound to keep the law? Does their firſt tranſgreſſion ſet them at liberty ever after from all obligations of duty or active obedience? I anſwer, every man is doubtleſs eternally oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep the law of God. For the law is a perfect unchangeable rule of righteouſneſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the authority of God our maker and ſovereign. Tho' ſin expoſes us to puniſhment, it does not looſe our obligations to obey for time to come. But we muſt diſtinguiſh between the divine law as a rule of righteouſneſs, and a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life. This ſeems not to have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by ſome, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ought. We are always bound to obey the law; but we are no longer bound to keep a covenant that while it is in
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:010643_0142_0F81BD1507425E30"/>
force: And it is no longer in force after it is broken. We may illuſtrate this diſtinction by the following ſimile. Suppoſe a man ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with his ſervant, that if he would ſerve him faithfully for a limited rime, ſay a year, he would then give him his liberty, and a ſettlement for life: But if he was unfaithful, he ſhould not only forfeit and loſe theſe privileges, but be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed according to his deſerts. It is plain he is now put upon probation for liberty by virtue of this covenant, and conſequently is bound to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by the promiſe and threatning. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſhould be unfaithful, and ſteal from his maſter what he was forbidden to take, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant would now be broken, the promiſe utterly void, and he would be expoſed to deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. In this caſe, every one ſees that he is no longer upon probation, nor is he any longer bound to faithfulneſs under the notion of fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of a covenant. That is plainly impoſſible. Yet he will ſtill be bound to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faithfulneſs, becauſe he is ſuppoſed to be under obligations to his maſter, diſtinct from, and antecedent to this particular agreement.—Theſe therefore remain upon him in full force. Thus the divine law binds man to obedience, abſtract from the conſideration of any covenant tranſaction. Had there never been any ſuch tranſaction, man would have been obliged in duty to love and obey God. And after he had broken the covenant which God had made with him, ſo the promiſe was forfeited, ſtill it was his duty to love and obey God. Yet 'tis plainly abſurd to imagine, that duties are ſtill required of him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of a covenant which is broken effectually, and ſo is at an end. If we do not
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:010643_0143_0F81BD1609228810"/>
duly attend to the diſtinction between a duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by law, and a condition annexed to a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we cannot rightly apprehend the nature and ground of obligations to duty.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) MANKIND have never ſince the original lapſe been put upon probation for life under a covenant of works. They have never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to obey the law perfectly, as the covenant condition of life. The whole account we have in the ſcriptures, of God's dealings with fallen man, is plainly contrary to this notion. Immediately after the fall of man, a promiſe of the Saviour was given, and another conſtitution, inconſiſtent with the impleaded ſuppoſition, was eſtabliſhed and revealed, even before ſentence was paſt upon the tranſgreſſors. The covenant with Noah con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no intimations of ſuch a covenant of works. The Abrahamic covenant was a covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or grace, by the expreſs teſtimony of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. The Sinai covenant was I grant in ſome reſpects a covenant of works. And by the way it was this covenant, that in the new teſtament is called the firſt or old covenant, in oppoſition to that new covenant of which Chriſt is the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and not any covenant of works with Adam, or with mankind in general. Every one who will be at the pains to examine the ſeveral places where the word occurs, will I think be immediately ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this. But tis certain that God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in this national covenant with the children of Iſrael, to propoſe to them a way of obtaining juſtification, and eternal life by their own works of righteouſneſs The rewards of obedience were temporal bleſſings, which however were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to their obtaining bleſſings ſpiritual and
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:010643_0144_0F81BD16B9519580"/>
eternal. For by poſſeſſing the land of promiſe, they had not only a fruitful country to live in, but alſo lived in the valley of viſion, where were much greater advantages and privileges of a ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than any others enjoyed. While this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was in force, they were indeed juſtified before God as their political king, by their own works.—See Deut. 6.24, 25. But with regard to a title to eternal life, no one was ever juſtified by his obed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ience to the precepts of this national covenant. For if eternal life had been to be obtained in this way, the covenant of grace which had been revealed to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (and I may ſay to Adam) long before, muſt of conſequence have been annulled; the contrary to which is ſtrongly aſſerted and proved by Paul, in diſputing againſt the judaizing chriſtians.—(See Gal. 3.15, 17.) ſays he, <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſannulleth or addeth thereto. And this I ſay, that the covenant of God in Chriſt, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect.</hi> Beſides, the Sinai covenant was given only to one nation. The Gentiles were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to obſerve it. Did Chriſt or his Apoſtles then propoſe a covenant of works, requiring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the law as the condition of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and life? This will hardly be pretended. Upon the whole, the ſcriptures no where inform us, that mankind have ſince the original lapſe been put upon probation for life under a covenant, requiring perfect perſonal obedience, as its condition, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the ſtate of man before the fall: Yea I think the ſuppoſition of God's putting man under ſuch a covenant, in his preſent depraved ſtate, is ſcarce reconcileable with divine wiſdom. It is then
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:010643_0145_0F81BD17B6D12078"/>
certain that the commands and exhortations to duty, which we find in the ſcriptures, are none of them on the foundation of a covenant of works.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.12. Lev. 18.5. "The man that doth theſe things ſhall live in them." Theſe words are evidently to be referred to the Sinai law, which was a covenant of works, but contained no promiſes of eternal life to obedience. The error of the Jews and judaizers, which the Apoſtle diſputes againſt, was, that juſtification, and a title to eternal life, were to be obtained by obedience to the Sinai covenant. The Apoſtle's argument imports, that this could not be, becauſe the Sinai covenant was a law or covenant of works, whereas the ſcriptures teach plainly that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have from the beginning been juſtified and ſaved by faith. The covenant of promiſe was before the covenant of Sinai; ſo could not be annulled by it. The law was given for other ends, Mat. 19.17. Jeſus ſaid to the young ruler, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." And to the lawyer, Luk. 10.28. "This do and thou ſhalt live." Obedience to the commands of God, has in the goſpel a promiſe of eternal life. "Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord." And "bleſſed are they that do his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have a right to the tree of life." But this does not imply that our obedience may be our juſtifying righteouſneſs. The promiſe of life is on the foundation of the covenant of grace: Nor is there any holy obedience: without faith in Chriſt, the end of the law for righteouſneſs.—See Henry's expoſition. The law requires duty, the goſpel promiſes eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the works of faith and love, and declares that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. If we love God and our neighbour, we ſhall have eternal life, not by the law, which contains no promiſe of eternal life upon any condition whatever, but by that faith which has wrought by love. And without faith we have no holy love to God or our neighbour. Indeed the young ruler and lawyer, it ſeems, were under the ſame miſtake, ſo common among the Jews at that time, viz. that upon the foundation of the Sinai covenant, which was a covenant of works, eternal life was obtainable by obedience to the law, ſo they might be juſtified by their own righteouſneſs. And nothing could be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuited to give an effectual wound to the very root of this ſelf-righteous fancy, than to lead them to a juſt view of the breadth of the divine law, in the ſpirit and not in the letter. And this appears plainly to be the ſcope and deſign of Chriſt's anſwers to them. They could not but be conſcious that their obedience had been defective: Yea that they had not obeyed one command in the true ſpirit and extent of it, upon their having juſt apprehenſions of the divine law; conſequently muſt fall under its curſe. But to ſet theſe things in a juſt light, a full diſſertation would be neceſſary, inſtead of a ſhort incidental note.—Upon the whole, I can ſee no reaſon to infer from theſe texts, or any other, that mankind are, previous to their believing in Chriſt, under ſuch a covenant of works as ſome have pretended; much leſs that they are under a conſtitution promiſing pardon and eternal life to peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unbelievers, without their being indebted to Chriſt, or the grace of the goſpel. And it is an eaſy, but I think a needleſs taſk, to ſhew that all thoſe texts of ſcripture, which have been quoted in confirmation of this notion, have been quite miſunderſtood. Beſides, that ſuch a conſtitution would be contrary to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, it would be repugnant I conceive to the divine perfections. For, as Mr. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>kine ſays, in his diſſertation on the Sinai covenant, <q>To ſuppoſe God formally entring into a covenant, the condition of which he knew could not poſſibly be performed, is a ſhocking abſurdity.</q>
               </note>

               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:010643_0146_0F81BD1B123B7EE8"/>(4.) SUPPOSING perfect perſonal obedience would intitle a man to eternal life, yet God's end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in preſcribing duty to men in his word, was not to direct and require them to work out a legal righteouſneſs, whereby they might be juſtified. The divine commands in ſcripture, we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> are not upon the foundation of a covenant of works,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:010643_0147_0F81BD1BDA7A6970"/>
for this obvious reaſon, that men are conſidered and addreſſed all along as ſinners, actually &amp; practically ſo. It is then as impoſſible in the nature of things for ſuch a one to be juſtified by a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own, as it is for him to recall paſt time, and cauſe that never to have been, which has been. "Conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces." Many other texts there are of the ſame import. They who forget God are by the law condemned already, ſo cannot obtain eternal life by a covenant of works. It is too late to call upon condemned criminals to conſider and beware of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crimes leſt they die, if perfect obedience be the only condition upon which they can live: And a covenant of works gives life upon no other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The commands and counſels of God to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, cannot without ſhocking abſurdity be referred to any ſuch covenant. Beſides, ſuch commands as God has given to ſinners, cannot poſſibly belong to a covenant of works. It has no place or room for ſuch duties as God calls men to, ſuch as repentance, prayer for pardon, turning from ſin to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on Chriſt and truſting in him for ſalvation, attending the means of grace, &amp;c. Theſe duties imply or preſuppoſe that the ſubjects are ſinners. Therefore the requirement of theſe things muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be upon the foundation or foot of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtitution than a covenant of works, and for ſome other end than to obtain juſtification and a title to eternal life by ſinleſs obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I SHALL now proceed to conſider another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the concluſion, pleaded for. It may be ſaid, allowing that theſe commands to ſinners do not ſtand upon the foundation of a covenant of works, yet they are all comprehended in the divine law,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:010643_0148_0F81BD1C8A5F4DD0"/>
whoſe obligation lies upon every ſoul. The law of nature obliges to obey every command of God, as ſoon as it is made known to us: And therefore no man can tranſgreſs a poſitive precept, or an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional command, without breaking the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which requires godlineſs and humanity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But till ſinners are juſtified by faith, they are under the curſe of the law; nor will their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to obey any divine command (however it be their duty) have the leaſt tendency to looſe them from their obligation to puniſhment; much leſs will a meer ſhadow of obedience which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the ſight of God. Therefore as all men who are not united to Chriſt by faith, are at the ſame time bound by the precept and the curſe of the law, though it be their duty to keep all God's command, yet they have no other encouragement to hope to obtain eternal bleſſings in this way, than the law will give: That is none at at all.</p>
            <p>TO this I anſwer. It is granted the obligation of the divine law is unchangeable: That ſinners are bound to obey every command; Yet till juſtified by faith they are obnoxious to the curſe: And that the law though it requires duty, yet gives no hope of life to a ſinner. Whatever encouragement then any one may have, to hope that his endeavours in a way of obedience to the divine commands may iſſue in his eternal advantage, it muſt be drawn from ſome other conſideration, than barely his legal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to duty. But yet it may be maintained, that every precept contained in God's word, was deſigned by God to be not only a declaration of duty to thoſe who are ſubject to it, but alſo to convey an encouraging motive to endeavours of obedience. If then there are any commands, exhortations and
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:010643_0149_0F81BD1D4E694520"/>
counſels to men unregenerate in ſcripture (as we have ſeen there are) then we may aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, not only that it is their duty to obey, but that there is encouragement thereunto; and that for this reaſon that all theſe commands, counſels and exhortations, ſtand upon the foundation of a gracious conſtitution, which God has eſtabliſhed for the ſalvation of fallen man.—This important point I will firſt prove, and then ſhew that this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration infers an encouraging motive to endeavours of obedience.</p>
            <p>FIRST. The commands and exhortations to duty directed to the unregenerate in the holy ſcripture, are founded upon a divine conſtitution of grace, for the recovery and ſalvation of fallen man. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God's will to man, ſtands intirely upon this baſis, and is fitted and deſigned in every part to ſubſerve this wonderful ſcheme of mercy. After the original apoſtacy God would have had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commands on ſinners, he would have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed no more duties to them by ſupernatural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, had he not determined to treat with them on the foundation of a new and gracious covenant. The obvious ſcope and tenor of the ſcriptures will clearly evidence, that God had a merciful deſign in revealing therein his will to mankind. The firſt revelation made to man after the fall contained a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of grace, and in effect ſet every thing which followed upon a new bottom. The media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial diſpenſation was hereby eſtabliſhed in the world. Adam with all his poſterity became ſo far the ſubjects of the mediatorial kingdom, that all the commands which they afterwards received from God, directing them in the great concerns of eternal life, were given through Chriſt, and upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

of his mediatorial undertaking: In other words, they were properly laws of the mediator—They were all founded upon that famous promiſe, (in Gen. 3.15.) <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpent's head.</hi> All the ſubſequent revelations of God's will, which mankind were favoured with from time to time, always ſuppoſed that God had deſigns of mercy towards the human race. The divine oracles held forth this important truth, as it were in the frontiſpiece, as the grand CAPITAL POINT to which the other parts referred, that the Son of God was to deſtroy the work of the devil. This is the key of the bible, that opens to us the deſign of the inſtructions, counſels and commands, which God has given to man. They all belong to, and are founded upon that gracious conſtitution which is here revealed; and are adapted and intended to ſubſerve this ſcheme of divine mercy. And that this is true in particular of the duties preſcribed to the unregenerate will appear, if we conſider what the ſcriptures teach concerning the nature, and end of theſe requirements.</p>
            <p>AS to the nature or matter of the duties required of ſinners, it is in brief, that they attend to the call of the goſpel: conſider the import and evidence of its doctrines and precepts; receive that conviction of ſin and miſery which is there laid before them; look to heaven for mercy; behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world; believe on him; truſt in him; love him; repent of ſin, and ſhew their faith, hope, love and repentance, by obedience to all his commands. I do not ſay that men are to do all theſe things while unregenerate: That would be plainly abſurd. But ſinners are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to hear, and attend, and conſider, and pray,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:010643_0151_0F81BD1F2A2C3808"/>
and ſtrive, that they may believe, repent, and obey the goſpel. Now we may obſerve, that all theſe things belong in due ſubordination to the means of ſalvation, according to that gracious diſpenſation which God has eſtabliſhed in the world. Since then God has preſcribed to men, as matter of duty, the uſe of thoſe means, by which the benefits of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are applied, and conveyed to the veſſels of mercy; the requirement of theſe duties is doubtleſs upon the foundation of that gracious plan, which the performance of them is evidently fitted to ſubſerve.</p>
            <p>AND this will be yet more manifeſt, if we conſider the end for which theſe duties are enjoined. If we can collect from ſcripture what end they have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, this will clearly determine the point. If the ends, to which theſe duties are ſubordinated, can have no place except upon the gracious conſtitution beforementioned, then the requirement of duties for ſuch ends ſtands upon that foundation. Now it is certain, that ſinners are commanded and exhorted to hear, and conſider, and believe, and repent, &amp;c. in order to ſalvation. And it is certain that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is obtainable by ſinners only upon the plan of grace.</p>
            <p>WHEN Jeſus in the text exhorts the Jews to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the meat which endureth to <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> it is obvious what end he directs their views to, and what their endeavours were required for, even ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining everlaſting life. When Peter directs the Sorcerer <hi>to pray to God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven,</hi> the end for which he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to pray, was that he might obtain pardon. When God calls ſecure ſinners to <hi>conſider</hi> the doom of the wicked, <hi>leſt he tear them in pieces,</hi> the end why they are called to conſideration, is plainly that
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:010643_0152_0F81BD1FE26FE330"/>
they may eſcape deſtruction. When Abraham in the parable ſays to the rich man concerning his five brethren, <hi>they have Moſes and the prophets let them hear them,</hi> the end why they were required to hear them, was that they might <hi>repent,</hi> ſo <hi>not come to the place of torment.</hi> When Chriſt bids the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures,</hi> which contain the words of <hi>eternal life becauſe they teſtify of him,</hi> it is not to be doubted that the end of this direction was, that they might be perſuaded by the teſtimony of the ſcriptures to believe on him. Finally, when Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that hath ears let him hear,</hi> we muſt conclude that men are therefore commanded to hear the call of the goſpel, that they may <hi>underſtand and believe,</hi> ſo <hi>be converted and healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT appears then, that theſe things are preſcribed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſinners, as means, in the uſe of which they are to ſeek, and may obtain eternal life &amp; ſalvation. God would not direct men to uſe means in order to an end, which they had no ſort of connection with, and were no way fitted to obſerve. His preſcribing duties to men in order to their obtaining ſalvation, plainly implies or ſuppoſes that ſalvation is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Conſequently theſe precepts are all upon the foundation of that gracious conſtitution, according to which ſinners may be pardoned and ſaved. It is then an obvious inference, that theſe things are not required as the condition of a covenant of works, requiring perfect obedience to the law, in order to juſtification: Nor are theſe commands mere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of law and duty, becauſe a ſinner's future o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to a law of works will not conduce at all to intitle him to eternal life in this way, however perfect we ſhould ſuppoſe his obedience to be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his paſt; guilt, which he can never expiate,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:010643_0153_0F81BD20483C9CB0"/>
binds the curſe upon him. And it is yet more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that defective and unholy performances will avail nothing to this end. God's requiring duties of ſinners, in order to their eſcaping his wrath and curſe, and having everlaſting life, is a virtual decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of grace and mercy:—Unleſs we will be ſo profane as to charge God fooliſhly; and ſay that he preſcribes means in order to an end, which they have no connection with, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuitableneſs for.—I proceed now to ſay—</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. If theſe commands which God has given to ſinners belong to the diſpenſation of grace, or in other words are precepts of the goſpel, then they carry with them not only obligation, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to endeavours of obedience.—For we may hence conclude, that God has deſigns of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards fallen man; and it is in order to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and accompliſh his gracious purpoſes, that he ſends the call of his goſpel to thoſe who are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſins, and requires them to hear and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, to conſider the import of his meſſage to them, and the evidence that is propoſed to them, that it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. There is encouragement to pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to that God who is gracious and merciful, with whom there is forgiveneſs. There is encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, to call upon him while he is near. To cry for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and lift up our voice for underſtanding, to ſeek for it as ſilver, and ſearch for it as for hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: To wait, upon him for further light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, in the uſe of thoſe means by which he is ordinarily wont to convey his bleſſings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the benefits of redemption to the children of men. Every juſt diſcouragement is removed.
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:010643_0154_0F81BD2439280CB0"/>
Should the ſinner object, theſe endeavours will not expiate my guilt, or juſtify me in the ſight of a holy God: It may be replied, they are not required for any ſuch end, but as the way and means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the knowledge of, and faith in an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that taketh away the ſin of the world. Should he object further, I am dead in ſin, unable to do any duty in a holy manner; it may be anſwered, that God may and often does make the unholy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the unregenerate to ſubſerve his gracious deſigns towards them. For the efficacy of the means does not depend at all upon the holineſs of a ſinner's attending upon them, but upon the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bleſſing of God. He bleſſes his own means, though there be no ſpiritual goodneſs in our performances to recommend us to his favour. He has not directed ſinners to wait upon him in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, that they might hereby make themſelves worthy of a favourable regard, but that they might hereby be brought and kept in the way of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Many have been regenerated and converted in the uſe of the appointed means of grace, but no ſinner was ever regenerated and converted by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to theſe means in a holy manner.—But I paſs to conſider a third evaſion, which may be thus expreſſed:—</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) ALLOWING that the commands which God has in his word given to ſinners are precepts of the goſpel, ſo carry encouragement as well as obligation to obedience, yet ſince all encouraging motives to obedience are derived from the goſpel, or revelation of mercy to the ungodly, through Chriſt, they can have no acceſs to the minds of thoſe who do not believe the goſpel, which is the caſe of every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man. For whoever believes the goſpel,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:010643_0155_0F81BD250834F3C0"/>
is poſſeſſed of that faith which juſtifies the guilty, purifies the heart, works by love, and is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of evangelical obedience. When therefore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are commanded to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life, this implies and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes faith, as the principle of obedience. They are firſt to believe unto juſtification, and then obey all the commands of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, The queſtion we are now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not whether ſinners ought to obey the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the goſpel from faith? That is readily owned: But the whole diſpute here, ſo far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, may be reduced to two points.</p>
            <p>WHETHER the commands to duty, which are directed to ſinners in the goſpel, bind them to obey in ſuch a manner as they are capable of before they believe to juſtification. And,</p>
            <p>WHETHER the word of God does or can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any encouraging motive to ſuch obedience, to the conſcience of one who does not believe to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>THE firſt enquiry has been anſwered already.—For it has been ſhewn, that as the unregenerate are capable of obſerving the ſubſtance and matter of thoſe duties we are now ſpeaking of, ſo the divine command binds this upon them. And though ſuch obedience be defective in principle and end, yet tis good in its proper place and kind, and has a happy tendency in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p>THESE things have been particularly conſidered, and need not be repeated. There is certainly more good, and leſs evil, in attending the means of grace from natural principle, than neglecting them utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And this infers an obligation on the conſcience,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:010643_0156_0F81BD25C6BD72D8"/>
to chuſe the good, and avoid the evil. But if any are not ſatisfied, I would further aſk, Is it not a ſin to reject and refuſe the means of grace?—If ſo, does it not plainly follow, that it is a duty to attend to them? Is it not the duty of thoſe (for inſtance) to whom the outward call of the goſpel is ſent, to hear and attend to it, and not oppoſe the means of grace at a diſtance, ſo put the word of God far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Did not the deputy Sergius Paulus do as he ought to do, when he called the Apoſtles Barnabas and Saul, and deſired to hear the word? And did not Elymas the Sorcerer ſin in oppoſing it? And was not the conduct of the Bereans commendable in attending chearfully and candidly to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Paul, and ſearching the ſcriptures daily to ſee whether thoſe things were ſo? Yet it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and not the principle and cauſe of their doing ſo, that many believed. Beſides, are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners exhorted to duties, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FAITH? Was it not for this end that Chriſt directs the Jews to ſearch the ſcriptures, which teſtified of him? And calls every one who has ears to hear? Is not the ſaving knowledge and belief of the truth concerning Chriſt, the meat which endureth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, the food by which the juſt live? And does not Chriſt exhort the Jews to labour for this? It is then the duty of men to attend to theſe precepts, before they have ſaving faith. For I think it muſt appear abſurd to the common ſenſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to ſay that when men are exhorted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to uſe means in order to a certain end, they muſt firſt obtain the end, before they are bound or warranted to uſe the means. I aſk further, Is not unbelief a ſin? If ſo, is it not the duty of thoſe to whom the goſpel is preached to believe in Chriſt? And does not this infer an obligation to the uſe of
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:010643_0157_0F81BD264D6BA370"/>
thoſe means by which faith comes antecedent to their obtaining it? Moreover, it will not be denyed that the word of ſalvation is to be declared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers (as well as others) as a means of faith and regeneration. The ſcriptures were written at firſt, and have been by a particular providence preſerved to this day, as a means of ingenerating, as well as confirming and increaſing faith and holineſs. Faith cometh by hearing, ſays one Apoſtle: And theſe things are written that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, ſays another. Whether men are to uſe means in order to obtain faith, or not, I think it has never been diſputed by any profeſt chriſtians, that God may and does uſe outward means, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his working faith in the elect. Now I deſire it may be conſidered, whether theſe means by which God worketh faith, do not imply and ſuppoſe an active attendance in us. Will the written word inſtruct us if we will not read it, or hear it read, or be attentive, and take notice of the import and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth there revealed? Or will the preached word have any ſaving effect, if we will not hear it with attention? That the word may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the end for which it is ſent, it muſ be heard, that is, the ſound muſt not only ſtrike our ears, but awake our attention, and put us upon conſidering the meaning, importance and proof of what is declared. And I am ſure that attention and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration imply active exertment. If faith comes by hearing, or by report (as ſome incline to tranſlate the word) I ſhould conclude, that before I receive this report, it behoves me to conſider, who is the reporter? Whether he is to be confided in? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the teſtimony be genuine or ſpurious? What does it import? And is it of any concernment to me? In this manner unbelievers are commanded to
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:010643_0158_0F81BD270C5ACBC8"/>
hear, and it is by hearing in this manner that faith is obtained, whereby we call upon the Lord unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>BESIDES it muſt be added, that before men believe to juſtification, they may be, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at leaſt are ſo far enlightned, by the divine word and ſpirit, as to be convinced, in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of the truth and authority of revelation.—There are ſuch evidences of the chriſtian religion, obvious to attentive minds, as are ſufficient to convince thoſe who are not ſpiritually enlightned, that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles were divinely authorized: Since no man could do ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as they did, except God were with them.—And therefore a conviction of their obligation, to obſerve the precepts of the goſpel to ſinners, may have ſuch acceſs to their conſciences, as to bind them to obedience. Now ſurely it is their duty, in this caſe, to obſerve the divine counſels and precepts, from <hi>ſuch</hi> faith, and <hi>ſuch</hi> principles (tho' not in the higheſt ſenſe ſupernatural and ſpiritual) rather than by preſumptuous diſobedience to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the convictions of their own conſcience, and deſpitefully reſiſt the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>LET us now proceed to the other point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſideration, viz. Whether any juſt or well grounded encouragement to obey the divine precepts directed to the unregenerate in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can have acceſs to the mind and conſcience, ſo as to influence the conduct of one who does not ſavingly believe in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>I ANSWER.—There may be a well grounded perſuaſion that God deals with men in this world in a way of mercy, and not according to the rigor of juſtice. The ordinary diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:010643_0159_0F81BD27CC2A1AF0"/>
give ſome intimations that God is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to ſinners, though not clear and diſtinct, and full enough to ſatisfy an awakened conſcience. God has not left himſelf without witneſs of his merciful deſigns, in that he has ſo kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us in this world, ſupplying our wants, and filling our hearts with food and gladneſs, as the Apoſtle has obſerved. He has alſo furniſhed us with a great variety of remedies, under thoſe calamities and diſeaſes, to which ſin has made us liable. The fallen angels are not dealt with in this manner. All this kindneſs and mercy which is exerciſed towards men, gives ſome comfortable intimation. And therefore the Apoſtle urges this as an argument, to perſuade the Lyſtrians to the chriſtian faith.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 14.17.</note> Theſe were an evidence that the ſtate of fallen man was not abſolutely deſperate. Upon theſe words of the Apoſtle, Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> has this reflection: <q>To imagine that God had no other deſign in his long-ſuffering, but that of vengeance, had been a notion unſuitable to the goodneſs and wiſdom of God. He would not have pretended himſelf to be a friend, if he had harboured nothing but enmity in his heart againſt them.</q> It is true death is the end of all men, and of all theſe mercies of providence: Yet this hinders not but that, they intimate the merciful diſpoſitions of God towards ſinful man: Otherwiſe how can we underſtand the Apoſtle's words, the goodneſs of God leadeth, that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth or allureth to repentance, if all the goodneſs of God to ſinful man, in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence, give no comfortable hint, not the leaſt relief againſt that terror and deſpair which a conviction of guilt tends to produce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="unknown:010643_0160_0F81BD2898AB52A8"/>MOREOVER, a perſon who does not believe to juſtification, may be perſuaded from the teſtimony of ſcripture, that God now commands every man to repent, and be converted, that their ſins may be blotted out; to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that they may be ſaved: And conſequently that ſinners are on probation for eternal life, under a conſtitution of grace. Many favours and privileges are granted to unbelievers, by virtue of that act of grace which has paſſed, through the mediation of the Son of God. A reprieve is granted to them, that they may be treated with, and called to repentance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of a covenant of grace. It is true, while they are unbelievers and impenitent, the condemning ſentence of the law ſtands in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and will be executed upon all who are not when they die united to Chriſt, and ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the ſaving benefits he has purchaſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new and gracious covenant. Yet this is not inconſiſtent with their being upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, under the gracious diſpenſation of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the new covenant. While God's forbearance, and their day of gracious viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſts, the door of mercy is open to them:—They are not excluded from hope. The ſentence of the law will not be executed upon them, unleſs they reject the grace of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>NOW this being the caſe, here is great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the unregenerate to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, by a diligent attendance to preſcribed means. For however they are not at preſent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the ſpecial benefits of the goſpel-covenant, there is gound to hope that they may obtain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein. God does not require them to ſeek for that good which he cannot honourably beſtow,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:010643_0161_0F81BD299DEBBE88"/>
or they are incapable of enjoying. The means God has required us to uſe for this end are wiſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to it: And men are able to attend to theſe means by God's common aſſiſtance, as has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore largely proved. There is, as has been ſhewn, a work of the Holy Spirit preparatory to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving to juſtification. And herein ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goſpel is conveyed to the mind, as not only convinces the ſinner that it is his duty to attend to the preſcribed means of grace, but alſo encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him in this way to wait upon God. And I doubt not but that in the work of converſion, the knowledge of the truth revealed in the goſpel, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the comfort and encouragement which it brings with it, does, many times at leaſt, if not commonly, enter the mind by ſuch gradual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it is impoſſible to determine with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, how far theſe illuminations and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were preparatory to converſion, and at what point of time the principle of ſpiritual life was firſt infuſed; or when we were firſt enabled to diſcern the things of the Spirit of God in a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and beholding his glory exhibited in the goſpel, were thereby changed into his image.</p>
            <p>THE ſum of what has been offered under this head of argument, is: The ſcriptures expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and direct the unregenerate to attend to the outward means, whereby men are ordinarily bro't to the ſaving knowledge of the truth. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are not founded upon a covenant of works, requiring perfcect obedience to the law of nature, in order to eternal life. Nor are they mere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of law or duty, without any encouragements to obedience; but are conſequent upon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that gracious conſtitution, which took place
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:010643_0162_0F81BD2AD42E4E38"/>
in the world upon the promiſe of a Saviour. Theſe duties are enjoined, as means of accompliſhing God's gracious purpoſes, in the ſalvation of ſinners, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that new and gracious covenant, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, to him that worketh not, but believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed for righteouſneſs. The divine command then, conſidered in the relation it bears to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of mercy, and the end for which it is given, not only lays an obligation of obedience upon the conſcience, of every one who hears the call of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but alſo carries an encouraging motive to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of obedience, antecedent to that faith in Chriſt, with which juſtification is connected by the divine promiſe. And there is therefore encouragement to the unregenerate to labour for the meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life, in ſuch a manner as they can, though they are morally unable to do ſo, in the manner they ought. Their endeavours in a way of attendance to preſcribed duties, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and unholy, have, by the appointment of God, a good tendency, and are well adapted to ſubſerve thoſe ends and purpoſes, for which they are deſigned and required by God. Indeed were it neceſſary, that they who obtain eternal life ſhould all work their way to it by perfect perſonal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the law, or were any holy qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to render us worthy objects of divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no endeavours of the unregenerate would avail to any ſuch purpoſes. But God's mercy is rich and free. It waits not for amiable qualifications in ſinners to draw it forth. God often bleſſes his own ordinances for ſaving good, to thoſe who do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon them in a worthy manner. Sinners are ordinarily regenerated in the uſe of appointed
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:010643_0163_0F81BD2B87809FB0"/>
means,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Ordinarily God in the effectual diſpenſation of his grace meeteth with them, who attend with diligence on the outward means of it. He doth ſo, I ſay, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, in compariſon of them who are deſpiſers and neglecters of them. Sometimes indeed he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were out of the way, to meet with and bring home to himſelf a perſecuting Saul, taking of him in, and taking him off, from a courſe of open ſin and rebellion. But ordinarily he diſpenſeth his peculiar eſpecial grace, among them who attend to the common means of it.

            <head>SERMON VI. Objections conſidered.</head>
            <p>MY propoſed method now leads me to conſider ſome of the principal objections to the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine which has thus far been contended for. Though a well eſtabliſhed truth is not to be parted with, becauſe it may ſeem to be preſſed with ſome difficulties not eaſily removed (for there may be very puzling queſtions ſtarted about the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable truths both in nature and religion) yet it is a good ſervice to the cauſe of true religion, to <hi>take up the ſtumbling block out of the way.</hi> And this is what will now be attempted. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT has been objected, that the duty which God requires of man, is either the righteouſneſs of the law, or goſpel holineſs: But the pretended du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which unbelievers are exhorted, are neither of theſe. They are not the righteouſneſs of the law: For that requires perfect obedience, and denounces death againſt the ſoul that ſins. They are not goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel holineſs: For that always flows from faith.—Theſe duties are then of an ambiguous kind, which have no encouragement or warrant in ſcripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="unknown:010643_0165_0F81BD2F6108AE28"/>HOWEVER plauſible this may appear, if it is cloſely examined, it will be found of no weight.—And that we may judge of the pertinency of this plea, we muſt endeavour to fix the meaning of the terms in which it is expreſſed.</p>
            <p>IF <hi>by the righteouſneſs of the law</hi> is meant <hi>a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to be wrought by man as the matter of his juſtification, and ground of his title to eternal life;</hi> then it is denyed that this is any duty required of man. God has not commanded or encouraged any one to ſeek juſtification and eternal life by his own works, as the meritorious ground or condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Chriſt indeed exhorts his diſciples to <hi>be perfect:</hi> So does Paul exhort the Corinthians to <hi>perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Yet neither of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort to ſelf-juſtifying duties. Chriſt ſays alſo to the young ruler, <hi>if thou wilt enter into life, keep he commandments:</hi> And to the lawyer, <hi>love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> But whatever was his deſign herein, it was not to enjoin or countenance an impoſſible, I may ſay, a criminal attempt, to merit eternal life by their own works. The Apoſtles teach us, that keeping the commands of God from faith in Chriſt, is the way to enter into the kingdom of God. But they never teach us to ſeek juſtification in the ſight of God by our own righteouſneſs. I allow then, yea I contend, that neither unbelievers nor believers are warranted by the holy ſcriptures to attempt any thing in a way of duty for the purpoſe above mentioned.</p>
            <p>IF <hi>by the righteouſneſs of the law is</hi> meant <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of God, from a regard to the authority of God;</hi> then I imagine that it is the duty of all, to whom theſe commands are made known,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:010643_0166_0F81BD3010782408"/>
to obey them, whether they are believers or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. And they are warranted and encouraged by the word of God to endeavour to obey them.—Goſpel holineſs is defined by the Apoſtle, <hi>keeping the commands of God,</hi> And when men unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attend to thoſe inſtrumental duties which are enjoined upon them, from a perſuaſion that God has commanded them to do ſo; then they ſo far obey the divine command, they do as they ought to do, and as they are encouraged to do, as has been proved at large.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, <hi>if we underſtand by the righteouſneſs of the law a perfect compliance with the perceptive will of God;</hi> then it muſt be ſaid that this is the duty of all, and that all are warranted and encouraged to aim at perfection, though it is certain that none will ever attain to it in this world.</p>
            <p>TO plead then in oppoſition to the arguments which have been offered in the preceeding diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that no endeavours of obedience, which fall ſhort of legal perfection, are required or warranted in ſcripture to be performed by men, antecedently to their believing to juſtification, is plainly begging the queſtion. The contrary has been proved, viz. that ſuch endeavours of obedience as men are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of before they are born again, though far ſhort of perfection, are by the divine command enjoined upon ſinners: And that there are encouraging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to ſuch endeavours in the word of God: And that theſe encouragements may be ſo far ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and believed by one who has not ſaving faith, that he ſhall be influenced thereby in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. There is ſomething required of men in a way of duty, which they are warranted and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to attend unto, previous to regeneration, and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:010643_0167_0F81BD30CD548190"/>
which they have a power by the common influence of the Holy Spirit ſo to perform, as that thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends, for the ſake of which it is required, may by this means be anſwered. And if any incline to expreſs their contempt of this aſſertion, by calling ſuch endeavours <hi>dubious or ambiguous, neither legal nor evangelical righteouſneſs,</hi> it need not move us. We are ſufficiently kept in countenance by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commands and exhortations to the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and by the commendation which the inſpired hiſtorian has given to the conduct of the <hi>prudent Deputy,</hi> and <hi>noble B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reans,</hi> which had a ſubſerviency to their obtaining faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is further objected, that to direct men to duties, as the way to obtain faith and regeneration, is to aſſert the expediency and neceſſity of a preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary righteouſneſs of our own, to qualify us for the divine mercy: Which will, in its neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſhut out thoſe who are utterly unworthy, from all comfort or benefit in and by the revelation of divine mercy by Jeſus Chriſt, deſigned for the relief and encouragement of the vileſt and guiltieſt of mankind.</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, If it were pretended that mens at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to the means of grace qualified them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for the divine mercy, or rendred them worthy of a favourable regard, ſo that it was expedient or neceſſary that a ſinner ſhould be conſcious of ſome change in himſelf for the better, as a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the mercy of God, before he has any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement or warrant to hope in the mercy of God, and come to Chriſt for life, then I own there would be ground for this exception. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence has been often rejected. Our aſſerting the obligation and advantage of attending the means of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:010643_0168_0F81BD3189C5FFB8"/>
grace, does not in the leaſt clog the divine procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of mercy in the goſpel, or forbid the guiltieſt of mankind to take that comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the ſaving truth is deſigned to convey to them, whenever it finds acceſs to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Still it muſt and may be maintained, that <hi>whoſoever will may come and take of the waters of life freely.</hi> But no one will have an ear for this revelation of mercy, ſo long as he is ſtupidly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the miſery of a ſtate of ſin and guilt, eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in a courſe of wilful rebellion againſt the light of his own conſcience, and in purſuit of the vanities of this preſent world. The ſaving truth will not be received into the mind and heart of thoſe, who never attend to thoſe means, whereby the knowledge of it is conveyed. And therefore God has commanded ſinners to uſe theſe outward means; and by the influence of his Spirit theſe commands are inſtrumental to bring and keep them in the way of his bleſſing. It is indeed the duty of the unregenerate, <hi>to labour for the meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life,</hi> for they are commanded ſo to do. Yet it does not follow from hence, that God accompanies their endeavours with a bleſſing, from a regard to their performances, conſidered as their duties, or as inferring a worthineſs of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but becauſe they are means of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To aſſert the neceſſity of human endeavours in this view, in order to converſion, is not ſurely to hold the neceſſity or expediency of a preliminary human righteouſneſs, to render us worthy of, or give us a right to the divine mercy thro' Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, if the guiltieſt and vileſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are ſhut out from hope or comfort by our aſſerting the obligation and encouragement of mens
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:010643_0169_0F81BD325699B0B8"/>
uſing the means of converſion, in order to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining converting grace. Methinks that doctrine is equally obnoxious to this objection, which teaches that the ſelf-righteous devotee is twofold more the child of hell, and in greater danger of damnation than the profane. If the goſpel doctrine muſt be ſet in ſuch a light as to carry a comfortable aſpect towards the ſecure and hardned ſinner, why not alſo towards the ſelf-righteous? But I forbear. The plain truth is, without ſubverting the goſpel procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or holding the neceſſity of a preliminary human righteouſneſs to recommend us to the divine mercy, we may maintain that the ſelf-righteous muſt be humbled, and the careleſs awakened, and both as periſhing ſinners, equally deſtitute of a claim up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's juſtice, wait upon him in the uſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means, for that free mercy, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>to all, and upon all that believe without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Chriſt will profit them nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is objected, that the beſt actions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, are ſinful; ſo are an abomination in the ſight of God: He neither approves nor will accept them. Is it not then abſurd to ſuppoſe that God ſhould command and encourage ſuch actions as he hates, and will not accept?—I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THOUGH the beſt actions of the unregenerate are ſinfully defective, yet there is in them ſomething good and right in its proper place and kind. This has been explained and proved under a former head; which I ſhall not repeat.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THOUGH God does not command and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſin, yet he may and does command and encourage men to ſuch actions, which he knows that if they are done at all will be done in a ſinful
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:010643_0170_0F81BD3313E44900"/>
manner. The beſt actions of believers have ſin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them: Yet I think it will not be denyed, that they are bound and encouraged to ſuch duties. If God's commands are in themſelves good, and he has good deſigns in giving them, there is nothing unworthy of the divine perfections in ſuppoſing that our obedience to them is required and encouraged, however defective it may be. This does not imply his countenancing evil. So far as our actions are conformable to his commands, they are good, tho' much evil may be mixed with them. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THESE actions which are materially good, and done according to the dictates of conſcience, are in ſome reſpects approved by God. Thus he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what Jehu did in cutting off the family of Ahab, and deſtroying Baal out of Iſrael. And he accepted the repentance and reformation of the Ninevites ſo far, that <hi>he repented of the evil</hi> with which he had threatned them, tho' it is not thought that their repentance was to eternal life. No acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the unregenerate are accepted as goſpel holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or <hi>as ſacrifices of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable with eternal bleſſings. But God uſually connects a bleſſing with their endeavours in a way of obedience to his commands, yea ſuch bleſſings as are ſubſervient to their eternal well-being. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of our reaſonings and concluſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what is agreable or diſagreable to the divine perfections, facts will and muſt ſtand. The plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wicked however ſinful, is commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the bleſſing of God's providence. And the reading, hearing, praying, &amp;c. of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, however unholy, is uſually followed with further knowledge, outward privileges, and inward influences of the Holy Spirit. We may be ſure
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:010643_0171_0F81BD34408335D8"/>
that there is ſame miſtake in ſuch reaſonings, as lead us to conclude, that it is repugnant to God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to do that, which is evidently and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably done by him.</p>
            <p>I WOULD not however intimate, that God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects his bleſſings with the actions of men unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, out of regard to any goodneſs or worthineſs in what they do, or as a reward of their obedience. This muſt be reſolved into his ſovereign pleaſure. When the man who was born blind, in obedience to the command of Chriſt, went and waſhed in the pool of Siloam, he did ſurely as he ought to do: And his conduct was approved. Yet his cure was not the reward of his obedience, though he had juſtly remained blind, had he refuſed to uſe the means preſcribed. It was ſovereign unmerited goodneſs that ordained both the end and means. So it is free grace that connects a bleſſing with our attending the means of converſion, and not the worthineſs of our performances. We do well to uſe the means of God's appointment: Yet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing is not the reward of our well doing, but flows from the meer favour and mercy of God. The caſe is plain enough, if we would not puzzle ourſelves with fooliſh ſubtilties. If our uſing the means of faith and converſion were as certainly and conſtantly connected with our underſtanding and believing the ſaving truth, as faith is with juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation, yea if ſuch a connection was as plainly declared by a divine promiſe, there would be no more ground to infer, that God gives us faith as the reward of our uſing the means, than that we are juſtified by the merit or as the reward of our believing. The divine bleſſing however conveyed to us, whether mediately or immediately, flows from
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:010643_0172_0F81BD3487B89000"/>
God's free grace, and not from a regard to any thing either done by us, or wrought in us. The idea of merit may as well be ſeperated from our actions, as from our paſſive perception.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is further objected, that if God prompts and aſſiſts and bleſſes our endeavours, then our friendly correſpondence with God is begun. But before men are united to Chriſt, and ſo juſtified by faith, there is no friendly correſpondence, between them and God:—They are the objects of his wrath and curſe. All the exerciſes of ſaving mercy to ſinners are thro' Chriſt, in conſideration of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and conſequently preſuppoſe our union to and intereſt in him.</p>
            <p>THE weakneſs and abſurdity of this objection, will appear from the following remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF all exerciſes of ſaving mercy towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners preſuppoſe their union to and intereſt in Chriſt, then mankind were intereſted in Chriſt before a Mediator was provided. For I think it will not be denyed that the appointment of Chriſt to the office and work of Mediator, was an exerciſe of ſaving mercy towards men. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEN ſinners are united to Chriſt before they believe on him. For certainly it is an exerciſe of divine mercy to ſend the call of the goſpel to men, and make them attentive to it, and thereby work faith in them. Yet I think it is granted on all hands, that it is by faith that we become united to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THEN we are united to Chriſt before we are united to Chriſt. For when ſoever, and however we are united to him, it cannot be refuſed, that our firſt ingrafting into him, is an exerciſe of ſaving mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="unknown:010643_0173_0F81BD359A9AC698"/>THE truth is, the promiſes of the goſpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, viz. of pardon, ſanctification, and ſalvation, are made only to thoſe who are in Chriſt by a ſpecial and ſaving union: Which union takes place in and upon our believing. Till then we are under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and children of wrath. Yet God does in various ways exerciſe his mercy towards ſinners, before they are juſtified by faith in Chriſt. He gives them the good things of this life. He ſends the goſpel to them. He grants them ſpiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. He ſtrives with them by his Spirit, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and aſſiſt their attendance to the means of grace. And ſome he regenerates, and works faith in, ſo they are united to Chriſt federally and vitally, and inherit the promiſes of juſtification, and ſanctifying grace. In a word, God takes various methods, as ſeemeth good in his ſight, with ſinners, to draw them to Chriſt, that they may be ſaved. If this be what is meant by a friendly correſpondence between God and man, it is certain that this is begun before men are ſavingly united to Chriſt, and juſtified by faith in him. I deny not that theſe things are the fruits of Chriſt's mediation; or that ſo far as men are partakers of theſe favours, they are intereſted in Chriſt. But I maintain that theſe things do not preſuppoſe a ſaving union to, and intereſt in Chriſt. So the objection muſt unavoidably fall, as being pointed againſt undeniable fact.</p>
            <p>OBJ. 5. BUT till ſinners are born again and believe in Chriſt, they are in a ſtate of condemnation. Is it not then a glaring abſurdity, to ſay that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which expreſly excludes all ſuch from the kingdom of God, ſhould contain encouragements to them to hope for ſalvation? A ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation cuts off all encouragements, as well as promiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:010643_0174_0F81BD36138BD860"/>I ANSWER.—It is granted that there is neither promiſe nor encouragement to an unregenerate unbelieving ſinner, that he may be ſaved, while he continues unregenerate and unbelieving. But it does not follow, becauſe a man is in a ſtate of condemnation, that there is no reaſon to hope that he may believe unto juſtification, and ſo paſs out of a ſtate of condemnation into a ſtate of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For then the condition of every unbeliever would be abſolutely deſperate. The cloſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection that ever any one ſuppoſed there was, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween a ſinner's attending the means of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obtaining converting grace, is perfectly conſiſtent with the goſpel declaration, "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not is condemned already." Theſe words only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that faith is neceſſary to ſalvation, or that there are no promiſes of ſalvation to unbelievers; which I think was never denyed by any profeſt chriſtian; and concludes nothing againſt the ſtrongeſt aſſurance (even by a divine promiſe) of converting grace to the unregenerate, upon their ſeeking for it in the uſe of appointed means, which is however more than is here pleaded for. A promiſe of converting grace is not a promiſe of juſtification and ſalvation, nor is it inconſiſtent with a ſtate of condemnation: Eſpecially if (as we have been told) there are no promiſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the grace of regeneration, (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperably therewith connected) but to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the new nature in faith and repentance.—God promiſed his people, when under correction for their ſins, that he would give them a new heart: Yet I think no one will pretend that they were pardoned, or delivered from a ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, till they repented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="unknown:010643_0175_0F81BD36C6E98BE8"/>OBJ. 6. Unbelievers do with their whole heart reject ſalvation by Chriſt; all their endeavours are acts of oppoſition to the way of life by him. Is it not then moſt unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that ſuch endeavours ſhould conduce to their obtaining faith, or a new heart?</p>
            <p>ANSWER I. This is not true without reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In ſome ſenſe perſons unregenerate may ſeek regenerating grace and ſalvation, as has been explained and proved at large formally. And they may alſo in ſome reſpects chuſe the way, or uſe the means in which theſe bleſſings are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. This they do when they attend to thoſe inſtrumental duties of reading, hearing, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, prayer, which are the way and means, in and by which God is pleaſed to enlighten, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and convert ſinners, and ſo bring them into a ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>ANSW. 2. Such endeavours as imply a reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of ſalvation, and the way of ſalvation, in ſome reſpects, may be a means of obtaining that divine light and influence, which ſhall effectually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all our oppoſition to the goſpel, and cauſe us to embrace it with all our hearts, <hi>as a faithful ſaying and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> This is not hard to conceive of. Many by examining the evidences of the truth in order to oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, have by this means been happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. Yea it is no abſurdity in the nature of things, to ſuppoſe that there may be the moſt certain and conſtant connection between theſe things. Though men may have no ſpiritual ſenſe of the glory of the goſpel, or ſpiritual deſire to experience its transforming power, yet their attending the means of grace and inſtruction,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:010643_0176_0F81BD3A6806AC70"/>
may have a connection with, and conduciveneſs to this happy effect.</p>
            <p>OBJ. 7. IF God has encouraged all thoſe to hope in his mercy who heartily deſire it, and aſk for it, the encouragement is as great as can be. Mercy is offered on the loweſt terms poſſible.</p>
            <p>ANS. If a man muſt be conſcious of <hi>ſaving deſires,</hi> or in other words that his deſires of mercy are <hi>ſincere, holy and ſpiritual,</hi> before he can warrantably take any encouragement, or hope for any benefit in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the means of grace, then we muſt ſay, woe to that man whoſe confidence in the heartineſs and ſincerity of his deſires fails him.—If a <hi>ſaving deſire</hi> of mercy is neceſſary as a condition or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, for a man's obtaining any ſaving bleſſings from God, they ſurely are in a ſad caſe, who want this requiſite, and are unable to produce or create it in themſelves. Deplorable is the ſtate of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, if they muſt firſt have ſincere, that is, holy ſpiritual deſires of converting grace, before there is any ground to hope for their converſion, or any warrant or encouragement for their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means, in order to the effecting this bleſſed change.</p>
            <p>THERE is encouragement to the endeavours of the unregenerate on waiting upon God for his ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, yea ſuch encouragement as may reach, their minds, and influence their conduct, antecedent to their believing to juſtification, as has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewn. What the connection is between attending the means of converſion, and obtaining converting grace, depends merely upon the will of God: Its nature and degree are as God has ſeen, fit to ordain. And all reaſonings concerning this
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:010643_0177_0F81BD3B623CB5A0"/>
matter from the character or ſtate of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or the quality of their actions, are nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IT may be objected, that all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as promiſes of God to ſinners are in Chriſt. But they who with their whole heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt, as all unregenerate men do, are not in Chriſt. And it will overthrow the goſpel to ſay that there are any encouragements for ſuch.</p>
            <p>THIS has been in effect anſwered already. If it concludes any thing in oppoſition to the doctrine we are pleading for, it concludes againſt the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a ſinner's converſion or ſalvation. For I reckon it is a ſettled point, that a ſinner is not ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in Chriſt previous to faith and converſion. And when any one will tell me, how it is conſiſtent with the goſpel, for God to beſtow faith or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace upon one who is not in Chriſt, I will tell him, how it is conſiſtent with the goſpel, for God to connect the beſtowment of this favour with the uſe of means, yea and declare this connection too, for the encouragement of ſinners in waiting upon him.<note n="*" place="bottom">If the author ſhould be thought to need an apology, for taking notice of ſuch trifling abſurd objections, as ſeveral of thoſe above mentioned ſeem to be; he has this to ſay, that when ſuch kind of arguments are gravely offered to the public, though men of better abilities may find better employments, yet it may not be amiſs for writers of a lower claſs, to ſhew, if they can, that ſomething may be ſaid in anſwer to them.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. IT may be objected that the unregenerate are <hi>dead in ſin.</hi> They have no deſires of ſpiritual life. And to ſay that they may concur, or work with God
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:010643_0178_0F81BD3C0CDA19A0"/>
in introducing a vital principle, or preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it, is as abſurd as it would be to ſay, that dead Lazarus did ſomething towards his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>ANSWER. The nature and conſequences of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death have in a former diſcourſe been enquired into. [To which the reader is referred for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular anſwer to this objection.] And therefore 'tis ſufficient to ſay at preſent, that though an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is morally unable to do any acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obedience in a holy manner, yet he is able to attend the common means of converſion in ſuch a manner, that by the divine bleſſing, they may be effectual for thoſe good ends, for the ſake of which they are appointed and preſcribed.—</p>
            <p>OBJ. 10. To ſuppoſe that the unregenerate are commanded and encouraged to ſeek ſalvation in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to religious duties, and that the grace of regeneration is ordinarily obtained in this way, ſeems not conſiſtent with the goſpel doctrine of ſovereign free grace. For then, we muſt conclude, that the divine favour is turned toward the ſinner, becauſe of ſome comparative worthineſs beheld in him; and ſo he has whereof to glory.</p>
            <p>ANSWER. It is granted that God is ſovereign in the exerciſes of his mercy. His grace is freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. He owes his favour to none, but has a right to do what he will with his own. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt inconſiſtence with the ſcripture doctrine of ſovereign free grace, it may be maintained, that men are required to ſeek ſalvation in attendance to appointed means, and that there is ſuch a connection between ſeeking and obtaining, that they who uſe
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:010643_0179_0F81BD3CCEA8E630"/>
the means ſhould ordinarily attain to the end to which they are ſubordained. Yea if God be ſovereign in the exerciſes of his mercy, he may then certainly glorify his grace in ſuch a way, if he pleaſe, as well as in another. That doctrine rather detracts from the divine ſovereignty, which pretends from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſonings about antecedent fitneſs, to determine, that it is unſuitable for the great God, to extend his unmerited mercy to ſinful creatures, in ſuch a way as has here been pleaded for. This I think may properly be called limiting the Holy One. Not that we are to ſuppoſe that the exerciſe of wiſdom and holineſs has no place in God's ſovereign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. But we muſt not object our precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived notions of what is wiſe and fit, againſt the ways and diſpenſations of God.</p>
            <p>DIVINE ſovereignty is manifeſted in appointing the way and manner in which, as well as the objects upon whom, the riches of free grace are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. God's favours are not the leſs free, becauſe diſpenſed in a certain eſtabliſhed order or method, and in the way of means, rather than in any other manner. It is ſovereign goodneſs that confers on men common, as well as ſpiritual and ſaving bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: Yet we ſee, that in the common diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of providence, there is a connection between means and ends. It is ſovereign goodneſs that gives us the neceſſaries and comforts of life, with every other temporal mercy: Yet human endeavours are uſually requiſite, as means of acquiring theſe bleſſings.</p>
            <p>WE muſt then ſay, that ſpiritual bleſſings are the free gifts of God, notwithſtanding they are beſtowed by God and received by us in a ſimilar way; or
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:010643_0180_0F81BD3E092297B0"/>
elſe we muſt ſay, that the good things of providence are not free gifts. There is as much reaſon for our neglecting all care about providing for a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honeſt ſubſiſtence in this world, leſt we ſhould intrench upon the ſovereign freeneſs of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as to neglect the care of our ſouls, upon any ſuch plea, or pretence.— The common ſenſe of mankind would condemn his folly, who ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to labour for the meat that periſheth, or even eat or drink, or take any care of himſelf, leſt he ſhould diſown the free goodneſs of God in all his enjoyments. Why is it not then as abſurd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to labour for the meat which endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, in the uſe of God's appointed means, leſt it ſhould imply a denial of the ſovereign freeneſs of divine grace?</p>
            <p>WHATEVER connection there may be between our attending the means of grace, and receiving ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual influences from the divine Spirit, the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God in the exerciſes of mercy may be maintained to be fully conſiſtent therewith: And the glory of our ſalvation from firſt to laſt will be due to free grace. It was of God's free grace, that any of the children of men were choſen in Chriſt to ſalvation, before the foundation of the world. It was of grace that the mediator was provided, and his obedience and ſufferings accepted as the price of our redemption, and the way of reconciliation thro' him propoſed to us. It was by preventing grace that we have been prompted to attend to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, whereby the benefits of redemption are applied to the veſſels of mercy. And it is by the ſpecial grace and influence of the Holy Ghoſt, that they become effectual to converſion and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="unknown:010643_0181_0F81BD3E7A63C100"/>OBJ. II. To direct men to ſeek ſalvatlon by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the means of grace, (as they are called) will encourage them to depend upon their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and vainly attempt to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God by their duties: which will lead them away from Chriſt, and the grace of God revealed in the goſpel, to truſt in themſelves.</p>
            <p>ANSWER. Though it be true that ſelf dependence is very natural to fallen man, and though ſinners are perhaps always influenced in ſome degree by a ſelf-righteous ſpirit, in their acts of religious obedience, yet it is not true, that a diligent attendance to the means of grace has a tendency to confirm and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage an undue dependance upon their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and ſtrength. It has indeed a tendency to the very reverſe, to lead them to a right view of themſelves, which is the only effectual cure of a ſelf-righteous ſpirit. Many people ſeem to think, that ſinners which take moſt pains in religious duties, and ſtrive more earneſtly to enter into the kingdom of God, are the moſt ſelf-righteous, &amp; diſpoſed to truſt in their own performances. But this is a miſtake. They who are moſt ſerious and engaged in ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate are uſually more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their manifold defects, than ſuch as live in a ſtupid neglect of religious duties, or a careleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to them. They who are awakened, and earneſtly engaged in the concerns of their eternal ſtate, are more likely to be convinced of the breadth and ſpirituality of the divine law, the ſinfulneſs of their own hearts and lives, and that they have no righteouſneſs by which they can be juſtified in the ſight of the holy God. I grant that an awakened ſinner may be very much influenced by a ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſpirit, in his religious endeavours; but he is
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:010643_0182_0F81BD3F14B9B1D0"/>
not uſually ſo much under it, as they are, who are careleſs, and take little pains about the things of their eternal peace. And if he perſeveres with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and earneſtneſs, preſſing into, or towards the kingdom of God, there is a probability that he will at length be ſenſibly convinced of the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of his falſe confidences, in which he uſed to ſeek ſhelter when preſſed with conviction of ſin, as to abandon them all, and fly for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>FOR it is to be remembered, that the ordinances of Chriſt on which ſinners are called to attend, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and adapted, to convey that light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to their mind, whereby their miſtakes may be diſcovered and corrected. The reading and preaching of the word are means of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to turn men from darkneſs to light. The goſpel revelation is ſtrongly pointed againſt the error of thoſe who eſtabliſh and truſt in their own righteouſneſs, rejecting the righteouſneſs and grace of God. Now an attentive reading, hearing and meditating on the great doctrines of the goſpel, has a tendency, by the bleſſing of God, to lead them into juſt views of things, and detect thoſe errors which lay the bottom of their ſelf-righteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, we ought to conſider well what we mean, when we ſpeak of regarding or renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own doing. For it muſt be acknowledged, that our endeavours in attendance to duties are, in ſome reſpects, and in their proper place, uſeful and neceſſary, and ought ſo to be conſidered by us. In other reſpects our performances are of no account at all. We muſt not think that any thing which a
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:010643_0183_0F81BD3FD023B6C0"/>
ſinner can do will avail in the leaſt degree to atone for his ſin, or merit ſalvation, or move God's pity, &amp;c. But we muſt not ſay that human endeavours are uſeleſs in every reſpect. They have a ſubſerviency to the converſion and ſalvation of mankind, and are therefore required and encouraged by God. And we may warrantably hope for the divine bleſſing, when we are excited and enabled to uſe the means by which it is uſually obtained. I frankly own, that I cannot underſtand the conſiſtency of exhorting men to duties, and yet at the ſame time requiring them to diſregard and overlook them, as wholly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in every reſpect, abſolutely good for nothing. And however people may eſſay to do ſo, they will always find it an impoſſible attempt. They may be regarded in their proper place, of ſubſerviency to our eternal intereſt, without a ſelf-righteous depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on them. If any one is at a loſs how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of this, let him conſider, that the faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and good works of true chriſtians, are in their place uſeful and neceſſary to ſalvation, and may properly be attended to; and regarded by them in this view. Yet a ſelf-righteous attention and regard to our own character is always ſinful, and contrary to the goſpel: Which ſhows, that there may be a reſpect to our own works, which is not ſelf-righteous. Hence we find Paul <hi>rejoicing in the teſtimony of his conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, he had his converſation in the world;</hi> and exhorting profeſſed believers <hi>to prove their own work, that they might have rejoicing in themſelves, and not in another.</hi> It is not a ſelf-righteous dependance upon their own works, for men to hope for a bleſſing in the uſe of thoſe means which God has preſcribed and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them to, if their hope does not ſpring from
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:010643_0184_0F81BD40895A0718"/>
the ſuppoſed worthineſs or merit of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but from the will and gracious appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, the words of the Prophet Iſaiah may be objected, <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER I. The Prophet in theſe words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells the converſion of the Gentiles, this is the moſt obvious meaning they exhibit; and they are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly underſtood and applied by the Apoſtle. <hi>I am ſought of them,</hi> ſays God, <hi>that aſked not for me,</hi> that is by the heathen who once aſked not for me, nor knew me. <hi>I am found of them, that formerly ſought me not,</hi> but paid all their worſhip to idols and falſe gods. But theſe words do not imply that God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts himſelf ſavingly to men, before they ſeek him, by an attendance to thoſe means whereby he makes himſelf known: No more than the firſt clauſe of the verſe, <hi>I am ſought of them that aſked not for me,</hi> imply that God is ſought before he is aſked for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is granted that God viſits men with the call of the goſpel, and influence of his Spirit, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their ſeeking him. That is, divine grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents or is before hand of human endeavours. But this is not inconſiſtent with the doctrine I have here been defending. For there is a work of the divine word and Spirit preparatory to regeneration &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; whereby ſinners are influenced &amp; enabled to wait upon God in the uſe of means, and hear his voice ſpeaking peace to their conſciences in the goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="186" facs="unknown:010643_0185_0F81BD4148681980"/>3. THOUGH it be granted, that God may and does ſometimes work faith in the hearts of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any uſe of the common means of grace, as in the inſtance of Paul's converſion, yet this is plainly extraordinary; and is to be reckoned among his miraculous operations, as much as revealing his will by an audible voice from heaven. The ſame Saul, who was ſurprized on the road to Damaſcus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares expreſly, that this is not the ordinary way in which God calls ſinners to the faith and grace of the goſpel. Nothing can be concluded againſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of attending God's common preſcribed means, from ſuch extraordinary diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>THESE appear to me to be the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objections that we are at preſent concerned with. Whether they are of ſufficient weight to invalidate the foregoing arguments, let every one judge for himſelf in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity. And ſo I have in ſome manner conſidered and ſpoken to the ſeveral particulars propoſed, for the illuſtration and proof of the doctrine. The next diſcourſe will finiſh our preſent undertaking, with pointing out ſome of the uſes to which the truth thus far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on is to be applied.</p>

            <head>SERMON VII. The Uſes of the Doctrine.</head>
            <p>AS every truth of divine revelation is profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in righteouſneſs, ſo we may conclude, that thoſe truths are eſpecially uſeful, which are plainly declared, and frequently inculcated. Such I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend is the doctrine, which has thus far been treated of. To direct you to a right improvement and application of what has been delivered, ſhall be the buſineſs of this diſcourſe, with which I ſhall ſhut up the whole argument. And as I have dwelt longer upon it than was intended, or expected, what remains muſt be diſpatched, with all poſſible brevity. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE may hence learn, in what manner ſinners are to be addreſſed, in the diſpenſation of the word. In general, the doctrines and precepts of the goſpel muſt be opened, vindicated and applied. But then the ſpecial caſes of different perſons require particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applications ſuited to them. And it muſt be the concern of <hi>the faithful and wiſe ſteward, to give
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:010643_0187_0F81BD4315466170"/>
to every one his portion in due ſeaſon. He muſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſhew himſelf approved of God, a workman that neeaeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth</hi> He muſt endeavour to the beſt of his ſkill, that each one may receive that inſtruction, and attend to thoſe admonitions from the word of God, which are moſt ſuitable to his particular caſe. The hearers of the goſpel are very apt to make a wrong application of divine truths. Particularly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners often comfort themſelves with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which belong only to true believers. It is therefore neceſſary that men be urged unto, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the work of ſelf-examination; cautioned againſt falſe marks of grace, and the miſapplication of true ones: And then perſons are to he accuſſed according to their different characters, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and exhortations, as are beſt adapted to their caſe and circumſtances. If we attend to the diſcourſes of Chriſt and his apoſtles, (not to mention the prophets under the old teſtament) we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a plain difference in their addreſs, when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſinners, and ſaints. And we may and ought ſurely to aim at the imitation of ſuch unexeption<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able patterns.</p>
            <p>AS the caſe of thoſe who are in a ſtate of ſin and guilt, is greatly different from the caſe of thoſe, who <hi>being juſtified by faith have peace with God;</hi> ſo there is a manifeſt difference between the ſecure, and the awakened ſinner; which ought to be regarded in addreſſing the counſels of heaven to them. The firſt thing to be attempted with the careleſs ſinner, is to put him upon conſideration, and convince him of his ſin and danger. For 'till this is effected, the revelation of divine grace in the goſpel, deſigned for the comfort and relief of the guilty, will not be
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:010643_0188_0F81BD44239FEF20"/>
attended to, and cordially embraced. But when by the influence of the divine Spirit, a conviction of ſin is faſtened upon the conſcience, then the ſinner muſt be ſolemnly reminded of the danger of relapſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his former carnal ſecurity; and accordingly he is to be cautioned againſt whatever has a tendency to harden the heart, ſear the conſcience, and quench the Spirit. The goſpel way of ſalvation muſt be plainly declared, the evidence and excellency of the ſaving truth diſplayed, an hearty acquieſcence in the goſpel covenant urged, and the neceſſity of a ſupernatural influence in order to regeneration and converſion, muſt be aſſerted. In fine, a diligent attendance on the means of grace muſt be ſo incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and encouraged, as is beſt adapted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in preſcribing them viz. that conviction and humiliation may be promoted, and the ſinner led to Chriſt: Not that a ſelf-righteous peace and ſecurity of conſcience be encouraged, or divine mercy expected as a congruous reward of human endeavours.</p>
            <p>SOME it is likely will pervert ſuch counſels and directions to the encouragement of phariſaical pride, how cautious ſoever we may be to guard againſt ſuch an abuſe. But we ought notwithstanding <hi>to declare the whole counſel of God, and keep back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be profitable</hi> to the ſouls of men. The doctrine of free grace has alſo been abuſed into an encouragement to ſin; yet every chriſtian ought to aſſert it, and contend for it. Whoever ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the goſpel, as to encourage himſelf either in a proud dependance upon his own righteouſneſs and ſtrength, or a careleſs neglect of duty, does it as his peril, and muſt bear his iniquity.</p>

               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:010643_0189_0F81BD4448F66B18"/>2. FROM what has been offered in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſes, it appears that they are to be reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who indulge themſelves in a careleſs neglect of the means of grace, or labour for the meat which endureth to eternal life in other ways, or for other ends, than God has required; or who encourage others in ſuch neglects and miſtakes. To each of theſe caſes I ſhall ſay ſomething diſtinctly. And,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) TO thoſe who do not labour at all, who uſe no endeavours, to obtain the <hi>meat which endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> And how many are there of this character, careleſs ſinners, who live as if they had no ſouls to ſave or loſe; as if all that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach us, concerning the judgment to come, the joys of heaven and the ſorrows of hell, were idle dreams not to be regarded; and their only concern were to provide for the preſent life, having nothing to expect beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>I NEED not, I ought not to make any apology, for addreſſing you with all the boldneſs and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of reproof for your inexcuſable neglect of duty and intereſt. At the ſame time a poor ſinner, who muſt own, that the point and edge of the ſevere things he has to ſay to others falls deeply upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ought not to glory over the moſt obnoxious, or bring railing accuſations againſt them; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pay all men that honour and reſpect which is due to them; <hi>In meekneſs inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves, if peradventure God will give them repentance; and that they may recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the ſnare of the evil, who are led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by him at his will.</hi>

               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:010643_0190_0F81BD498D3D4458"/>WERE you indeed <hi>like the horſe and mule which have no underſtanding,</hi> you would not have ſin, tho' you ſhould live <hi>like the beaſts that periſh. But the inſpiration of the Almighty hath given you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> and made you capable of <hi>enquiring after God your maker.</hi> You have immortal ſouls, in danger of everlaſting deſtruction, but yet through the mercy of God, and the mediation of Chriſt, capable of eternal ſalvation. And <hi>now is your accepted time, and day of ſalvation.</hi> The door of hope now ſtands open to you; and you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to ſtrive to enter in; to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, to call upon him while he is near.</hi> You have all fit encouragement to do ſo. Is it not then folly and madneſs beyond the poſſibility of exaggeration, for creatures in ſuch a ſtate to compoſe themſelves in ſtupid ſecurity, ſinking to irretrievable ruin, and not endeavour, or uſe the means which God has preſcribed, to obtain a lot in the heavenly inheritance? Is it of more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or importance to you to <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> than to <hi>ſecure that better part which never ſhall be taken away.</hi> Thoſe objects you are now ſo eagerly purſuing, while you neglect the care of your ſouls, will ſoon fail you. <hi>Your life itſelf is a vapour, preſently vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away.</hi> All your acquiſitions of worldly goods, will ſoon be of no more advantage to you than your laſt night's dream.

            <p>I KNOW men are full of excuſes, when they neglect to comply with their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may perhaps plead, as I have ſometimes heard them, that they have no power to do any
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:010643_0191_0F81BD4A8136F578"/>
thing required of them in a right manner: That it were as well to attempt nothing in a way of religious obedience, as not to act from gracious principles: That the prayers of the wicked are an abomination; and that <hi>God is found of them that ſeek him not,</hi> &amp;c. And I wiſh there were no reaſon to complain of ſome profeſſed chriſtians, for teaching unſound doctrines upon this head. The moſt colourable pleas, whereby ſinners may be tempted to quiet themſelves in a careleſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of their ſouls ſalvation, have been in ſome manner conſidered and confuſed. And though I doubt not but ſome are ſo ingeniouſly wicked, as to be able to make ſhrewd replies to all that has been, or can be offered to this purpoſe, yet the day is coming, when all their vain pleas, will be effectually ſilenced, and their mouths ſtopped. And they will mourn in earneſt that they have <hi>hated inſtruction,</hi> and hardned their heart againſt reproof; and that when they had <hi>ſuch a price in their hand, they had no heart to improve it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) WHAT has been offered on our preſent ſubject, may be applied for the reproof and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of thoſe, who though they take pains in ſeeking ſalvation, yet do not ſeek in the way that God has preſcribed. They make uſe of means of human invention, and not of divine inſtitution. Of this error the church of Rome is to a great degree guilty, whoſe religious ſervice is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run with ſuperſtition &amp; will-worſhip, yea with idolatry, and abominable wickedneſs. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny othrrs are to be reproved, for leaving the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and commands of God, and betaking themſelves to human inventions. We have no reaſon to hope, that God will accompany with
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:010643_0192_0F81BD4B5EC401D0"/>
his bleſſing thoſe religious obſervances which he has not required. Theſe things will rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his jealouſy, and provoke him to withdraw his benedictive preſence from thoſe who are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied therein.</p>
            <p>THEY alſo are to be reproved, as not ſeeking in the way of God's appointment, who allow themſelves in the neglect of ſome means which they are commanded to attend to, though they do not wholly neglect all. Our attending pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ordinances, will not ſuperſede the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of the more private duties of reading, meditation, and prayer. Nor will our obſervance of theſe, excuſe our forſaking the aſſemblies for publick worſhip. And the moſt punctual and exact attendance to devotional exerciſes public and private, does not diſpenſe with our obligation to watch and guard againſt temptations, &amp;c. Surely it is preſumption for any to declare practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally a contempt of any divine ordinance, as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or unneceſſary. God will honour all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. And perhaps this is one great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on why <hi>many who ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait gate are not able,</hi> viz. that they are not careful to avoid every thing which may be an impediment to their entrance, and uſe all thoſe means which God has preſcribed, in order to their converſion and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THEIR error is alſo to be reproved, who propoſe wrong ends in their religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. This is a common miſtake, and of bad tendency. I grant that no unregenerate man acts

for holy ends: Yet it muſt be maintained, that they are capable of acting for ſuch ends as are in themſelves lawful and good, in their proper place, though corrupted by a ſinful defect. And tho' this defect muſt not in any meaſure be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, yet men may properly be exhorted and encouraged to do what is materially good from a defective end, rather than not do it at all; as has been formerly declared and vindicated.</p>
            <p>WHILE we inculcate the neceſſity of human en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, we muſt take care not to countenance or abet the abuſe of them. This muſt be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt and reproved with all confidence. And it ſhould be the concern of every one, as he tenders his ſoul's ſalvation to guard againſt ſo common and dangerous an error. In particular, they who by attending the means of grace are <hi>ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs,</hi> or acquire a peculiar claim to the divine mercy, as ſubjects morally qualified for it, or worthy of it, may find matter of reproof and correction in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſes. While you act with ſuch views as theſe, you do but <hi>ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> As the caſe is with you at preſent, God does not require you to endeavour after, or even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any perſonal worthineſs, as a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his favour, or meritorious ground of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſo fully and effectually anſwers the purpoſes of an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ranſom, and ground of acceptance, that all deſires of contributing any thing hereto by our own righteouſneſs, as co-efficient with
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:010643_0194_0F81BD4C98AD5260"/>
his merits, is now become not only vain, but criminal and pernicious.<note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps it will be ſaid, that if men unregenerate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing in a way of religious obedience, they will certainly and unavoidably act for ſelf-righteous purpoſes. For they can propoſe no other ends. And it is in vain to exhort men to act while we take away the end of action. I anſwer this is not the place to diſpute theſe matters, and indeed it is unhappy that a ſubject ſo important and practical has been ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed with diſputes. But however let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Firſt. Suppoſing that ſinners do always act for ſelf-righteous ends, their error is nevertheleſs to be reproved. This is the fault, and not merely the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of depraved nature. They are to be called to diligent endeavours, and at the ſame time every corruption or defect therein muſt be duly teſtified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Perhaps believers are never quite free from the influence of a ſelf-righteous ſpirit, in any acts of religious obedience. And it is certain that they are ſinfully deficient in their beſt duties. Yet they are to be preſſed to duties, notwithſtanding this corrupt alloy, which is however to be reproved, and they to be called upon to purge it out more and more. Secondly. Unregenerate men may, in attending the means of grace, act for other ends than to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, in oppoſition to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God; even for ſuch ends as however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, are not in themſelves ſimply unlawful. There are other motives to duty, beſides the hope of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a juſtifying righteouſneſs, which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man is capable of being influenced by. Thirdly. The work of conviction and humiliation uſually proceeds gradually, as well as the work of ſanctification. It is by degrees that men are brought off from their falſe confidences. In ſome a ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſpirit reigns without controul; in others it is much checked and diſturbed by conviction, and even wounded to death. A juſt view of the divine law will do this, without a ſaving belief of the goſpel. And when men begin to be convinced of the vanity of their falſe confidences, they are capable of receiving reproof for their paſt error, and of being upon their guard againſt deception for the time to come. And if they do ſo, and continue attentive to the means of further light and conviction, there is reaſon to hope that they will at length come out of the darkneſs and deluſion of a ſtate of ſin, into the light of a new and divine life. In fine, if the unregenerate are not to be directed to attend the appointed means of grace, leſt they ſhould act from a ſelf-righteous ſpirit, then neither ought they to neglect them, leſt their neglect ſpring from the ſame principle. Some men may take as much pride in ſitting ſtill, as others do in working. They may glory over phariſees with the ſame ſpirit, as phariſees did over publicans.</note>

If ever you receive any ſaving benefit by attending the means of grace, theſe falſe ends muſt ſooner or later be given up. Nor will you regret the loſs of ſuch deluſive hopes, when you find your endeavours animated by more comfortable views, than while engaged in fruitleſs ſelf-righteous labours, and <hi>your path, as the riſing light, ſhining more and more to the perfect day.</hi>

in ſpeculation, and plead for unſound opinions, contrary to their own experience, temper, and practice, though they are ſtrangely inattentive to it. But that charity which inclines us to think favourably of them, ſhould excite us with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to reprove their errors. They are earneſtly to be oppoſed, who teach that the ſcriptures do not require and encourage ſinners <hi>to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life.</hi> Such doctrines are falſe and dangerous, tending to quiet the moſt preſumptuous and hardned ſinners, in their deſtructive courſes. And O how dreadful muſt it appear, to every one who has any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of heart, to deceive poor ſinners to their deſtruction, and be curſed by miſerable wretches in the flames of hell, as the authors of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruin, by encouraging, under any pretence whatever, a diſregard to God's commands!</p>
            <p>AND if the abuſe of the preſcribed means of grace be ſo great and dangerous an evil as has been declared, then they are to be reproved, who encourage and confirm men herein; ſuch are herein <hi>phyſicians of no value.</hi> How unhappily are they employed, who inculcate duties upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only in a legal manner, and for legal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that they may hereby render themſelves worthy of ſalvation, and eſtabliſh their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in the place of the Redeemer's merits.

If you think to wait 'till a ſaving change is evidenced to you, by ſome immediate ſuggeſtion, or otherwiſe, before you give a practical attention to the precepts of the goſpel directed to you, there is danger of your being given up, either to enthuſiaſtic deluſion and a reprobate mind, or to greater hardneſs of heart. You will never attain to the aſſurance of hope, or be certain that your faith is ſincere, 'till its fruits appear, to the ſatisfaction of your own conſcience. Let no ſcruples about your good eſtate, keep you back from a ſerious compliance with your duty, according to your preſent light and ability.
