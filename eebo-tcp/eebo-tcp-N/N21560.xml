            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF J. P. BRISSOT.</head>
            <byline>By the Editor.</byline>
            <p>HE was born at the village of Ouarville, near Chatres, in Oreannois, on the 14th of January, 1754. His father was what the French called a <hi>Traiteur;</hi> that is, keeper of an eating houſe or an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. He was intended for the profeſſion of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w, and was articled to an attorney for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. But he grew diſguſted with the chicane and turpitude he was daily obliged to witneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after the five years of the articleſhip were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he left Chatres and went to Paris.</p>
            <p>An accident one night at the theatre at Paris plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the company of an Engliſh gentleman. They became intimate, and from this gentleman he obtained ſome knowledge of the Engliſh language; which he afterwards improved by a reſidence in London.</p>
            <p>He had received a regular claſſical education, and acquired, by ſtrict application, a tolerable knowledge of the German, Italian, and Spaniſh languages, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conſult the authors who have written in thoſe languages On his arrival at Paris, his firſt
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028343_0004_0FD8AEB4378E1F48"/>
ſtudy was juriſprudence, with an intention of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an advocate in parliament. No ſcience however eſcaped his attention. He attended lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and experiments in every branch of ſcience; wherein his active genius found ample exerciſe. Chymiſtry was his favourite object of purſuit; but his circumſtances were too limited to indulge much in it. The ſmall patrimony which he inherited from his father did not exceed forty pounds per annum.</p>
            <p>In the year 1777 he made his firſt tour to London. During his ſtay in London he became engaged in the conduct of a French newſpaper, at that time called the <hi>Courier de l' Europe,</hi> but ſince the <hi>Courier de Londres.</hi> Some miſunderſtanding having happened concerning the ſtamps (at the ſtamp-office in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) for this paper, the proprietor took a reſolution of printing it at Boulogne ſur-mer; and Briſſot was appointed the Editor, and reſided at Boulogne for that purpoſe. He continued in this capacity at Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne about two years. From thence he went to Paris, and was admitted Counſellor in Parliament.— Early in the year 1782 he went to Neuſchatel to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend the printing of one of his books (mentioned hereafter). This was the memorable period of the revolution at Geneva. Here he became acquainted with M. Claviere and M. du Rovray, who, with a numerous party, were expelled that city, and ſought an aſylum in Ireland.</p>
            <p>In the autumn of this year, he married a daughter of Madame Dupont of Boulogne. This young lady had been recommended to the celebrated Madame de Genlis, who obtained a ſituation for her in the nurſery of the Duke de Chartres, late Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, who ſuffered under the guillotine; in which ſituation ſhe continued ſome time after her marriage.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the year 1783, he viſited London a ſecond time. His view in this journey was to eſtabliſh in London, a Lyceum, or Academy
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028343_0005_0FD8AEB76C34D560"/>
of Arts and Sciences, together with an office of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral correſpondence. In this undertaking he was encouraged by ſome of the firſt literary men in France; and a Monſieur du Forge, muſician at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, was ſo captivated with the ſcheme, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced four thouſand livres, (166 l.) for one third ſhare of the profits. Briſſot was to have the ſole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and the other two thirds of the profits. He took a houſe in Newman-ſtreet, Oxford-ſtreet; and publiſhed a proſpectus of his undertaking. He ſent for his wife and his youngeſt brother (his eldeſt brother was a prieſt.) At this time he commenced his deſcription of the ſciences in England (mentioned hereafter) to be publiſhed monthly. Having in one of his publications taken occaſion to vindicate the Chevalier Launay, editor of the <hi>Courier du Nord,</hi> printed at Maeſtricht, the editor of the <hi>Courier de l' Europe,</hi> now M. du Morande, was ſo highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by it, that he became from that time Briſſot's moſt determined enemy. It is to be obſerved, that the Courier du Nord, and the Courier de l'Europe, were rival newſpapers. De Launay quitted Maeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricht, and went to Paris, where he was immediately put into the Baſtile, and was never more heard of.</p>
            <p>In the month of May, 1784, Briſſot was arreſted by his printer in London. Although he was at this time very well known to ſeveral perſons of rank and fortune, yet he was too delicate to apply to any of them for pecuniary aſſiſtance. But after remaining a day or two in a lock-up houſe in Gray's Inn Lane, he ſent his brother to an intimate friend, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly paid the printer his bill, and liberated him.</p>
            <p>The next morning Briſſot ſet out for France, leaving his wife and brother in England, aſſuring them he would quickly return, which he certainly intended. But in this he was ſeverely diſappointed. Thus ended his literary enterpriſe of eſtabliſhing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in London, in which he embarked his
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028343_0006_0FD8AEB8AC9452B0"/>
whole property with a degree of infatuation and zeal that ſeemed to border upon inſanity. During his reſidence in London he became acquainted with one Count de Pelleport, author of ſeveral pamphlets againſt the principal perſons of the French Court, particularly of one called <hi>Soirees d'Antoinette,</hi> for the apprehenſion of the author of which the French court offered a thouſand pounds (1000 Louis) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Briſſot, inſtead of proceeding directly to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ſtopped at Boulogne, and reſided there with his mother-in-law: here he reſolved to continue his publication on the original plan. Du M— know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Pelleport was the author of the offenſive pamphlet, and that Briſſot and Pelleport were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, reſolved to obtain the reward, and gratify his reſentment. He applied to Pelleport, offering him the ſuperintendance of a publication to be carried on at Bruges, (near Oſtend,) the ſalary of which was to be two hundred pounds per annum. Pelleport accepted the offer. But it was neceſſary to ſtop at Boulogne, where ſome final arrangements were to be made. In the month of July, Pelleport embarked for Boulogne with Captain Meredith. But the moment he landed, he was ſeized by the officers of the Police, who put him in chains and carried him to Paris, where he was ſent to the Baſtile. Du M— was an agent of the Police of Paris. Information being given to the Police, that Briſſot was at Boulogne, and that he was the intimate friend of Pelleport, he was immediately taken into cuſtody, carried to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and committed to the Baſtile. However, it is certain that Briſſot never wrote any thing againſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King or Queen of France. He was ſincere in his abhorrence of the arbitrary and deſpotic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the French government, but with reſpect to the private conduct of the King and Queen, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſtowed the ſmalleſt attention upon it. In this magazine of human victims, he continued about ſix
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028343_0007_0FD8AEBC78A40FA0"/>
weeks. His wife applied to Madame Genlis in his favour, and Madame Genlis moſt generouſly made a point of it with the Duke de Chartres to obtain his liberty. The Duke de Chartres's interference does not appear by any document; but Briſſot's acquittal of the charge brought againſt him appears in the following report of his examination, made to the French miniſter, M. Breteuil, on the 5th of September.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Sieur Briſſot de Warville was conveyed to the Baſtile on the day after the Sieur de Pelleport, who was arreſted at Boulogne ſur-mer, arrived at Paris. In conſequence of his connections with this man, guilty of writing libels, he was ſuſpected of having been his coadjutor. The atteſtation of a boy in the printing-office, from whence one of theſe libels iſſued, gave ſtrength to ſuſpicions; but this atteſtation, tranſmitted from London, is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of authenticity; and the Sieur Briſſot de Warville, who has very ſatisfactorily anſwered to the interrogatories which were put to him, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes his crimination to the animoſity of enemies whom he conceives to have plotted againſt him in London. The Sieur Briſſot de Warville is a man of talents, and of letters; he appears to have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſyſtems, and to entertain extraordinary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but it is certain that, for the laſt ſeven or eight months, his connections with the Sieur de Pelleport had ceaſed, and that he employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſolely upon a periodical paper, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion to circulate and ſell in France, after having ſubmitted it to the examination of a licenſer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is proper to obſerve, that the addition of <hi>de Warville,</hi> which Briſſot made to his name, (to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh himſelf from his elder brother) is a kind of local deſignation, not uncommon in many countries. William of Malmſbury, Geoffry of Monmouth, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin de Thoyras, Joan d'Arc, &amp;c. &amp;c. But in the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:028343_0008_0FD8AEBDDEB89020"/>
orthography he ſubſtituted the Engliſh <hi>W</hi> for the French dipthong <hi>Ou;</hi> the ſound of that dipthong being ſimilar to our W. Thus <hi>Ouarville</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Warville</hi> in both languages.</p>
            <p>In a very ſhort time after his releaſe from the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, he very honourably diſcharged his pecuniary obligation to his friend in London.</p>
            <p>In the year 1787, which was the era of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the French revolution, the Duke de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, now become Duke of Orleans by the death of his father, embraced the party of the parliament againſt the Court. Upon the principle of gratitude Briſſot attached himſelf to the Duke of Orleans. As an honeſt man he could not do otherwiſe.</p>

            <p>Upon his return to France he found that his cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity had not been diminiſhed by his abſence. He was elected a member of the Conſtituent Aſſembly, and was much engaged in the committees of reſearch, of which he was the reporter. He was alſo elected a member of the Legiſlative Aſſembly for the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris. It muſt be obſerved, that the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution caſt a veil over the crimes of all thoſe who had been obliged to leave their country. In this group who returned to France was Du M—. He oppoſed Briſſot in his election for Paris, but Briſſot was elected by a majority of more than three to one. However, Du M—'s party were exceſſively morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and they unceaſingly calumniated Briſſot in the moſt opprobrious terms. M. Petion, mayor of Paris, and who was Briſſot's friend and townſman, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to ſtrengthen his intereſt and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
            <p>Briſſot now diſtinguiſhed himſelf as one of the <hi>Amis des Noirs</hi> (friend of the Negroes) of whom he
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:028343_0009_0FD8AEBF9C0E8690"/>
was a moſt zealous advocate. In a ſpeech which he delivered in the Aſſembly in the year 1791, there is a ſtrong trait of philanthropy.</p>
            <p>Of this ſpeech the following is a ſhort extract: "You have heard of enormities that freeze you with horror; but Phalaris ſpoke not of his brazen bull, he lamented only the dagger that his own cruelty had raiſed againſt him. The coloniſts have related inſtances of ferocity; but give me, ſaid he, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed brute, and I will ſoon make a ferocious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of him. It was a white man who firſt threw a negro into a burning oven; who daſhed out the brains of a child in the preſence of its father; who fed a ſlave with its own proper fleſh. Theſe are the monſters that have to account for the barbarity of the revolted ſavages. Millions of Africans have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed on this ſoil of blood. You break, at every ſtep, the bones of the inhabitants, that nature has given to theſe iſlands: and you ſhudder at the relation of their vengeance. In this dreadful ſtruggle the crimes of the whites are yet the moſt horrible. They are the offspring of deſpotiſm: whilſt thoſe of the blacks originate in the hatred of ſlavery, and the thirſt of revenge. Is philoſophy chargeable with theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors?

In this general election Briſſot was elected one of the deputies from the department of Eure and Loire. His abilities and talents became every day more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. He was choſen the Reporter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Public Safety; in which ſituation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf without reproach, until the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conduct of Dumourier threw a ſuſpicion on the whole of the Gironde party.</p>
            <p>Although aſſailed on all ſides by his enemies, his character aſperſed and depreciated by the baſeſt of calumnies, Briſſot ſhewed himſelf conſiſtent with his public principles of philanthropy.</p>
            <p>In the dreadful maſſacre of the 3d of September, his opponents, particularly Du M—, ſought every opportunity to accompliſh his deſtruction, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him of being a principal inſtigator of thoſe horrors. And it muſt be owned, that theſe repeated and continual calumnies weakened him in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic eſteem. Du M— was perfectly acquainted with the Engliſh method of writing a man down.</p>
            <p>When Condorcet moved for the abolition of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, Briſſot was ſilent.</p>
            <p>When the motion was made to paſs ſentence of death on the King, Briſſot ſpoke and voted for the appeal to the primary aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>When Fayette was cenſured, Briſſot defended him.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of Orleans (M. de Egalité) was cenſured. Briſſot defended him.</p>

               <head>Of Briſſot's Writings; and particularly of this Work.</head>
               <p>Upon the ſettlement of the American government after the war, he became an enthuſiaſtic admirer of the new conſtitution of that great country. But ſome French perſons, who had been in America, and were returned to France, had publiſhed their thoughts and opinions of America, in a manner that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of illiberality. The reader will find the principal names of theſe writers in the thirty-ſecond chapter of the firſt volume. Briſſot was fired with indignation at this treatment of a people, whom he conceived could not in any wiſe have deſerved ſuch reproach; and, imagining that the general peace in 1783, had opened an honourable and free commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of reciprocal commercial advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween America and France, he wrote <hi>this volume</hi> with the view of ſupporting and eſtabliſhing that primary idea, or <hi>theory</hi> of a French commerce with the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States.</p>
               <p>Upon this point it is no more than ordinary can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to obſerve, that all which Briſſot recommends, explains, or relates, concerning a French commerce with the United States, applies equally, and in ſome points more than equally, to the Britiſh commerce with them. Every B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itiſh merchant and trader may derive ſome advantage from a general view of the principles which he has laid down for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and regulation of a reciprocal commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and America. The produce and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of England are infinitely better ſuited to the wants of America; and therefore all his theory, which is directed to the welfare and improvement of France, muſt ſtrongly attach the attention of the Britiſh merchant and mechanic: who, in this great point, have not at preſent any ſuperiors, but have ſeveral rivals. Briſſot's ambition was to make France
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:028343_0012_0FD8AEC6255D6630"/>
the greateſt and moſt powerful rival. And every candid perſon muſt allow that he deſerved much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his countrymen for the progreſs he made, in this firſt attempt, to open the eyes of the French nation to proſpects of new ſources of advantage. All that is further neceſſary to ſay of this work, is ſaid by Briſſot himſelf in the introduction, from the tenth to the twentieth pages. In the laſt French edition of Briſſot's Travels in America, publiſhed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, about ſeven or eight months before his decapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, this volume is placed the laſt of that work. We have followed the Author's arrangement, and collated the whole by the laſt Paris edition.</p>

He therefore, in two years afterwards, publiſhes his <hi>Philoſophical Library of the Criminal Laws.</hi> This work is now <hi>ten volumes.</hi> Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot's view in this work was, to diffuſe and explain thoſe grand principles of freedom which produced the revolution in England in the year 1688, and the revolution in America in the year 1775. Before the diſſolution of the monarchy in France, thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were almoſt unknown to the French, and are ſtill almoſt unknown to the other parts of Europe. But as ſeveral of the monarchs of Europe approved of the American revolution, it may be preſumed that their ſubjects will not long continue ignorant of the motives and grounds of a meaſure which was honoured with the patronage of their ſovereigns. This circumſtance alone ſhould convince the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that many of the powers of Europe behold with pleaſure the diminution of their greatneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and that very few of thoſe powers are ever friendly to them, except during the time they are receiving a bribe, by virtue of an inſtrument, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>a ſubſidiary treaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of Dr. Price of London he was an admirer; but of Dr. Prieſtley he was alſo an imitator, for he amuſed himſelf frequently with chymiſtry, phyſics, anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and religion. On the laſt ſubject there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that he wrote but little; for in his <hi>Letter to the Archbiſhop of Sons</hi> (the only tract on religion, by him, that has come to the Editor's knowledge) he ſays,
<q>That religious tyranny had been proſtrated by the blows of Voltaire, Rouſſeau, D'Alembert, and D'lderot.</q>
His mind was capacious, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion extenſive. In his zeal to become an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of Prieſtley, he publiſhed a volume <hi>Concerning Truth, or Thoughts on the Means of attaining Truth, in all the branches of Human Knowledge.</hi> Here was a wide field for the diſplay of Briſſot's talents and induſtry.
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:028343_0014_0FD8AECCA872DBC0"/>
His deſign was to have carried on the work to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral volumes, and to have invited the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the literati of all Europe, in all the different <hi>ſciences,</hi> and, it may be added, <hi>ſpeculations.</hi> But there was ſuch a freedom of ſentiment manifeſted in the firſt volume, that both the author and printer were alarmed with the terrors of the Baſtile. Filled with theſe apprehenſions, he left Paris, and went to Neuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatel. There he printed his proſpectus, and he cauſed it to be alſo printed in London. But when theſe copies were attempted to be circulated in France, they were ſeized. Not a ſingle number was permitted to be ſeen in any bookſeller's ſhop in France.</p>
               <p>Finding the execution of his project thus rendered impracticable, he left Neufchatel, and went to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; where, in order to give currency to his free opinions, he altered the title of his book. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to publiſh the remaining part periodically, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>A Deſcription of the Sciences and Arts in England;</hi> great part of which was intended to be devoted to an examination of, and to obſervations on, the Engliſh conſtitution. His friends ſolicited the French miniſtry to permit this work to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed at Paris. At firſt they obtained this favour; and the work went on as far as twelve numbers, or two volumes; after which it was prohibited, not more to the author's mortification than to the injury of his pocket. M. de Vergennes, who was at that time miniſter of France, had ſo ſtrong a diſlike to every thing that was Engliſh, that he would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſmalleſt commendation upon any part of the Engliſh conſtitution, or commerce, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated in France. He had begun to diſcover, that the favourite idea of his maſter, of ſeparating the Britiſh colonies from the Britiſh empire, might lead to an inveſtigation of the principles of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:028343_0015_0FD8AECDA336C540"/>
at home, and prove extremely dangerous to a deſpotic monarchy.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding he was thus diſappointed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, he ſtill purſued his deſign; but under a ſecond change of title. He publiſhed two volumes under the title of <hi>Philoſophical Letters on the Hiſtory of England.</hi> The title did not attract the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe two volumes under a ſimilar name had been publiſhed in London, and had, with ſome <hi>art,</hi> been impoſed on the public as the production of Lord Lyttleton; but they were written by Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, in ſupport of tyranny and ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>Every circumſtance of cruelty and oppreſſion met with the obſervation of Briſſot. When the late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Joſeph was puniſhing Horiah, the leader of the revolt in Walachia, and iſſuing his ſhocking edict againſt emigration, Briſſot addreſſed <hi>two letters to him</hi> upon thoſe ſubjects, which were read throughout Germany. In one letter he affirmed, that Horiah was juſtified in his revolt; in the other he held, that a privilege to emigrate from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne country to another, was a ſacred right derived from nature.</p>
               <p>He was an enthuſiaſt in his admiration of the American revolution, and of the conduct of the Americans in riſking every thing to emancipate themſelves from the tyranny of Great-Britain. Upon comparing the new conſtitution of America with that of England, he changed his opinion of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—<hi>he ceaſed to approve of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some French gentlemen, who had viſited America, having, when they returned to France, written ſome ſevere remarks on the Americans, Briſſot defended the Americans, particularly in his book called <hi>A Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Examination of the Travels of the Marquis of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleux.</hi> But as this work has been already mentioned in the preceding volume (ſee chapters 31 and 32), it is not neceſſary to ſay any thing more of it here.</p>
               <p>It muſt never be forgot, that during the period of
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:028343_0016_0FD8AECF1DCB8870"/>
the French monarchy there were more intrigues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways going on in the French court than in any court in Europe. At this time (the year 1787) the court was full of intrigues—libidinous as well as political; for though the King had no miſtreſſes, the Queen had her favourites and her party. Neckar was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, and Calonne was appointed by her influence. Montmorin ſucceeded Vergennes, and the Duke of Orleans was at the head of the party that ſought the overthrow of the new miniſtry. When Calonne aſſembled the Notables at Verſailles, Briſſot publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pamphlet entitled <hi>No Bankruptcy; or Letters to a Creditor of the State concerning the Impoſſibility of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Bankruptcy, and the Means of reſtoring Credit and Peace.</hi> This pamphlet, which contained many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere obſervations on Calonne's meaſures and plans, and ſome arguments in ſupport of certain privileges claimed by the people, the Duke of Orleans was highly pleaſed with. He made inquiry after the author, for the tract was anonymous, and having diſcovered him, he ordered his chancellor to provide a ſituation for him. He was made ſecretary-general of the Duke's chancery. This did not ſave him from miniſterial reſentment. A letter de cachet was made out againſt him; but having notice of it, he inſtantly eſcaped to the Netherlands. He was for ſeveral months editor of the <hi>Courier Belgique,</hi> printed at Mechlin. It was during this voluntary exile that he formed his project of viſiting America. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his deſign to the Philanthropic Society of the Friends of the Negroes at Paris, and was by them aſſiſted and recommended to ſeveral perſons in America. The produce of this viſit to America was the firſt volume of this work, written upon his return to France. The French miniſtry being changed before he left Europe, he embarked at Havre de Grace in the month of June, 1788.</p>
               <p>Intelligence having reached him in America of
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:028343_0017_0FD8AED416495A50"/>
the rapid progreſs liberty was making in France, he returned to his native country in 1789, in a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that his labours might become uſeful to the general intereſt.</p>
               <p>His firſt publication after his return (except the preceding volume of his travels in America) was, <hi>A Plan of Conduct for the Deputies of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His knowledge and admiration of America natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produced a friendſhip with the Marquis de la Fayette, who introduced him into the club of the Jacobins.</p>
               <p>We ſhall paſs by the ſeveral ſteps and meaſures of the revolution; for to give an account of all Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot's concern therein, would be to write a large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume upon that event only. But the mention of a few circumſtances which are attached to Briſſot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly, is indiſpenſible.</p>
               <p>By the intereſt, or rather influence, of Fayette, he was made a member of the Commune of Paris. He was agent of the Police, and a member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Inſpection at Paris; and afterwards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative for the department of Eure and Loire.</p>
               <p>He commenced a newſpaper, which he called <hi>Patriote Français</hi>; in which he conſtantly defended the conduct of la Fayette. He attached himſelf to the party called Girondiſts.</p>
               <p>To the Engliſh reader this name may require ſome explanation. The warm and moſt violent of the National Convention, having gained the confidence and ſupport of the city of Paris by various arts, but principally by declaring, upon every opportunity, that Paris muſt conſtantly be the place in which the National Repreſentation muſt hold their deliberations; to balance againſt this power of Paris, Condorcet, Petion, Vergniaux, Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot, Iſnard, and others, all members of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, endeavoured to gain the commercial cities in their intereſt. Bourdeaux was the principal of thoſe
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:028343_0018_0FD8AED547A36DD8"/>
cities which joined them; it is ſituated on the river Garonne, locally pronounced <hi>Gironde,</hi> which being the center of a department, named from the river, the appellation of Girondiſts was given to the whole party.</p>
               <p>The whole was a ſtruggle for power: there was no other object whatever. It is a fooliſh, and an idle aſſertion, in thoſe who ſay, that Briſſot and the party had engaged in a plot to reſtore the monarchy of France. Whatever their opinions might have been in ſome of the early ſtages of the revolution, perhaps from an apprehenſion that the people of France might heſitate at an abrupt propoſition of a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they were unqueſtionably innocent of the charge at the time it was made. Here follow, however, the documents as publiſhed by authority, in juſtification of the execution, which, like all other ſtate papers, in every country, conſiſt of the beſt apology, or moſt colourable pretence, for a thing that has been done by order of government.</p>

               <p>He began by ſtating, that, before he proceeded to the report which had been expected with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and would amply recompenſe the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able delay that had prevented a more ſpeedy gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the wiſhes of the people, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:028343_0019_0FD8AED6A4764638"/>
by the Committee of General Safety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that none of the members of the Convention ſhould be allowed to go out till the decree of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation had been adopted. This requeſt was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately complied with, and a decree being paſſed, the Preſident gave orders to the Commander of the National Guards to allow no members to go beyond the bar.</p>
               <p>Amar then affirmed that the gigantic arm of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been uplifted to ſtrike the repreſentative majeſty of the people, and to level with the ground the unity and indiviſibility of the French Republic.— The arm of treaſon had been nerved and ſupported by the united energies of Briſſot, Condorcet, Gaudet, Vergniaud, and the other Deputies.</p>
               <p>Briſſot, the leader of this traitorous band, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced his political career by being a Member of the Commune of Paris, to which he was introduced by La Fayette, to whoſe deſigns he had proſtituted his pen. At this aera of his life he made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance three times in the Jacobin Club. In the firſt viſit he propoſed thoſe meaſures which have proved ſo diſaſtrous to the Colonies; in the ſecond, he attempted to produce the aſſaſſination of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Champ de Mars; and in the third viſit he moved the declaration of war againſt Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>Introduced into the Legiſlative Aſſembly, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entered into a coalition with Condorcet and the Girondine faction, whoſe deſigns he approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported. The conſummation of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this coalition was to have been produced by the ſurrender of the Republican body to the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Allied Powers, and by the deſtruction of that unity and indiviſibility which can alone be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to combat with effect the tyrants who would undermine the proud pillar of Liberty, and deſtroy even the veſtige of freedom from the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xx" facs="unknown:028343_0020_0FD8AEDD99559880"/>The Court made uſe of their influence to declare war at a moment when the armies and the fortified places were in a ſtate of abſolute want, or entruſted to traitors choſen by a perjured King. They protected Narbonne, the miniſter, whom all France accuſed of the meaſures taken to render this war fatal to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in their Journals they calumniated the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots who had the courage to reſiſt them. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Dietriſch, convicted of being an accomplice with La Fayette, and of having offered to give up Straſbourg; and while the chiefs of that faction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the conſpirators and traitorous Generals, the patriotic ſoldiers were proſcribed, and the volunteers of Paris ſent to be butchered.</p>
               <p>During the time we were ſurrounded by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellites of deſpots, when the court was going to open the gates of France to them, after having cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the intrepid defenders of liberty to be murdered at Paris, Briſſot and his accomplices did all they could to counteract the generous efforts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to ſave the tyrant. During and after the unhappy inſurrection of the 10th of Auguſt, they endeavoured to prevent the abdication of Louis XVI. and to preſerve to him the crown.</p>
               <p>In the night of the 10th of Auguſt, Petion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhut up in the Thuilleries, conſulted with the ſatellites of tyrants the plan to maſſacre the people, and gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Mandat, Commander of the National Guards, to let the people come in, and then to cannonade them in the rear. A few days before, Genſonne and Vergniaud engaged to defend Louis XVI. on condition that the three miniſters, Roland, Claviere, and Servan were recalled.</p>
               <p>Petion and La Source made uſe of all their means to ſend the federates from Paris. Briſſot, Kerſaint, and Rouyer, according to the letters found in the Thuilleries, gave bad advice to the tyrant, and, in defiance of the laws, they dared to ſolicit places in
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:028343_0021_0FD8AEDFE36B3AF0"/>
the miniſtry, under a promiſe to extend the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authorities of the deſpot.</p>
               <p>The project to overturn the foundation of the Republic, and to murder the friends of Liberty, was put in practice in the Legiſlative Aſſembly, by Briſſot, in his inſidious harangue on the 20th of July, 1792, oppoſing the abdication of the throne. We have ſeen Briſſot and his accomplices Republicans under Monarchy, and Royaliſts under the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; always conſtant in their deſigns to ruin the French nation, and to abandon it to its enemies. At the time the hypocritical tyrant, Louis the XVI. came into the Aſſembly to accuſe the people, whoſe maſſacre he had prepared,—Vergniaud, like a true accomplice of the tyrant, told him—"That the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly held it to be one of their moſt ſacred duties to maintain all conſtituted authorities, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that of Royalty."</p>
               <p>When the Attorney-general, Raderer, came to announce, with the accent of grief, that the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in inſurrection had taken the reſolution not to ſeparate till the Aſſembly had pronounced the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Crown, Preſident Vergniaud ſilenced the applauſes from the gallaries by telling them, that they violated the laws in obſtructing the freedom of opinion; and he told Raderer, that the Aſſembly was going to take into immediate conſideration the propoſal which he, Vergniaud, had made, ſhewing the neceſſity of preſerving the exiſtence of the King.</p>
               <p>Kerſaint ſeconded the motion. Geradet propoſed to liberate Mandat, who was arreſted for having given orders to fire on the people; or, in the event that that commander was no more, to ſend a depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of twelve Girondiſt members, authoriſed to chooſe his ſucceſſor, in order by this means to keep the public force at the diſpoſition of that miſchievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In that memorable ſitting of the 10th of Auguſt,

the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ondiſt chiefs, Vergniaud, Guadet, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne, took by turns the chair, and went to the galleries to ſlacken the energy of the people, and to ſave Royalty, under the ſhield of the pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. They ſpoke of nothing but obedience to the conſtitutional laws to thoſe citizens that came to the bar to protect their newly acquired liberty.</p>
               <p>When the municipality came to invite the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſend the <hi>proces-verbal</hi> of the great operations of the 10th of Auguſt, in order to prevent the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the enemies of liberty, Guadet interrupted the members who made that demand, by making a motion to recommend anew to the magiſtrates the execution of the laws.—He blamed the Council of the Commune for having confined Petion in his own houſe; though they did it in order to render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for that impoſtor to make even inſurrection ſubſervient to act againſt liberty.</p>
               <p>When a deputation from the ſuburb St. Antoine came to announce the civic affliction of the widows and children maſſacred on that day, the perfidious Guadet cooly anſwered them, "That the Aſſembly hoped to reſtore public tranquillity and the reign of the laws."</p>
               <p>Vergniaud, in the name of the extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion directed by that faction, propoſed the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the King, who had been dethroned by the people, as a ſimple conſervatory act of royalty; and ſeemed greatly affected at the events which had ſaved the country, and operated the ruin of the tyrants. He oppoſed Choudieu's motion, tending to exclude from the Convention the members of both the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative and Conſtituent Aſſemblies; and with the ſame cunning he prevented the regiſters of the civil liſt from being depoſited on the table.</p>
               <p>Gaudet wiſhed to have a governor named to the ſon of the late King, whom he called the Prince Royal. Briſſot and his accomplices always affected
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:028343_0023_0FD8AEE4E14B1DF8"/>
to invoke the literal execution of the Conſtitution, while the people, in the name of the martyrs who fell before the caſtle of the Thuilleries, demanded the complete o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erthrow of the tyrant.</p>
               <p>Vergniaud oppoſed this demand, ſaying, that the people of Paris were but a ſection of the empire, and affected to oppoſe it in this manner to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments.—He likewiſe reſiſted the petition made by the Commons to put the tyrant under arreſt. He uſed all his efforts with Briſſot, Petion, and Manuel, to get Louis XVI. confined in the Luxembourg, from whence it would have been eaſier for him to eſcape than out of the tower of the temple.</p>
               <p>Genſonne and Gaudet had the ſervility to publiſh, at different times, that Louis XVI. had commanded the Swiſs not to fire upon the people. From that time, the leaders of the Girondiſts (Department of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux), compelled to praiſe the events of the 10th of Auguſt, continued, notwithſtanding, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Republic. They publiſhed the ſevereſt ſatires againſt the Jacobins, againſt the Commons and people of Paris, and in general againſt all thoſe who contributed to the deſtruction of monarchy. Roland's houſe was filled with packets of libels, which were to be diſtributed among the people, and ſent into the departments.</p>
               <p>Theſe guilty men protected all the conſpirators, favoured the progreſs of Brunſwick with all their power, and were the agents of the Engliſh faction which has exerted ſo fatal an influence during the courſe of our revolution. Carra was in league with certain characters of the court of Berlin. In his Journal Politique of the 25th of Auguſt, 1791, he formed a wiſh, on account of the marriage of the Duke of York with the Princeſs of Pruſſia, "that the Duke might become Grand Duke of Belgium, with all the powers of the King of the French." While Brunſwick was preparing to decide the fate of the
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:028343_0024_0FD8AEE688D81578"/>
French nation by the force of arms, Carra, in the ſame Journal, repreſented him as a great commander, the greateſt politician, the moſt amiable Prince in Europe, formed to be the reſtorer of liberty in all nations.—He publiſhed, that this Duke, on his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at Paris, would go to the Jacobins, and put on the red cap, in order to intereſt the people in favour of this ſatellite of tyrants. Finally, Carra was ſo audacious as to propoſe openly to the Jacobins, for the Duke of York to be King of the French.</p>
               <p>From theſe and many other facts, too tedious to mention, there reſults, that Carra and his aſſociates were iniquitous and deep diſſemblers, penſioned by England, Pruſſia, and Holland, to enable a Prince of that family which rules over thoſe countries to obtain the crown of France. This ſame Carra, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Sillery, the diſhonoured confidant of a contemptible Prince, was ſent by the then reigning faction to Dumourier, to complete that treaſon which ſaved the almoſt ruined army of the Pruſſian deſpot. Dumourier came ſuddenly to Paris to concert with Briſſot, Petion, Guadet, Genſonne, and Carra, the perſidious expedition into the Auſtrian Netherlands, which he undertook when the Pruſſian army, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, by contagious diſorders, was peaceably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring—while the French army was burning with indignation at the inaction in which they were kept.</p>
               <p>It was not the fault of this faction, if the motion often made by Carra to receive Brunſwick at Paris, was not realized. He meditated, in the beginning of September, 1792, to deliver up this city, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means of defence, by flying beyond the river Loire, with the Legiſlative Aſſembly, with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Council, and with the captive King. He was ſupported in it by Roland, Claviere, and le Brun, the creatures and inſtruments of Briſſot and his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices.</p>
               <p>But theſe perfidious miniſters, having been threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:028343_0025_0FD8AEEB0C6E57B0"/>
by one of their colleagues to be denounced to the people, it was then that Carra and Sillery were ſent to Dumourier, to authorize this General to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate with Frederick William, to enable this Prince to get out of the kingdom, on condition that he ſhould leave the Netherlands without the ſufficient means of defence, and deliver them up to the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and triumphant armies of France.</p>
               <p>The calumnious harangues that were made in the Tribunes were prepared or ſanctioned at Roland's, or in the meetings that were held at Valaze's and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's. They propoſed to ſurround the Convention with a pretorian guard, under the name of Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Force, which was to be the baſis of their foederal ſyſtem. In the Legiſlative Aſſembly they meditated a flight beyond the Loire, with the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Executive Council, the Royal Family, and the public treaſure. Kerſaint, at his return from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, dared to propoſe this project to the Executive Council; and it was ſupported by Roland, Claviere, and le Brun, the creatures and inſtruments of Briſſot.</p>
               <p>The faction ſtrove to put off the judgment of the tyrant by impeding the diſcuſſion. They appointed a commiſſion of twenty-four members to examine the papers found in the Thuilleres, in the guilt of which ſome of theſe members were implicated; and they endeavoured, in concert with Roland, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal thoſe which tended to diſcover their tranſaction with the court. They voted for the appeal to the people, which would have been a germ for civil war, and afterwards wanted a reſpite to the judgment.</p>
               <p>They inceſſantly repeated, that the Convention could do no good, and that it was not free. Theſe declamations miſled the departments, and induced them to form a coalition which was near being fatal to France.</p>
               <p>They patronized an incivic peace, entitled, <hi>L'am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:028343_0026_0FD8AEEC5EA74A40"/>On the 14th of January, Barbaroux and his friends had given orders to the battalion of Marſeillois to ſurround the Convention.</p>
               <p>On the 20th, Validi wrote to the other deputies, "To-morrow in arms to the Convention—he is a coward who does not appear there."</p>
               <p>Briſſot, after the condemnation of Louis Capet, cenſured the Convention, and threatened France with the vengeance of the European Kings. When it was his object to bring on war, he ſpoke in an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſenſe, and treated the downfal of all thrones, and the conqueſt of the univerſe, as the ſport of the French nation. Being the organ of the Diplomatic Committee, compoſed almoſt entirely of the ſame faction, he propoſed war ſuddenly againſt England, Holland, and all the powers that had not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves.</p>
               <p>This faction acted in coalition with perfidious Generals, particularly with Dumourier. Genſonne held a daily correſpondence with him: Petion was his friend. He avowed himſelf the Counſellor of the Orleans party, and had connection with Sillery and his wife.</p>
               <p>After the revolt of Dumourier, Vergniaud, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, Briſſot, and Genſonne, wiſhed to juſtify his conduct to the Committee of General Defence, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that the denunciations made againſt him by the Jacobins and the Mountain were the cauſe of his conduct; and that Dumourier was the protector of the <hi>ſound</hi> part of the Convention. This was the party of which Petion, Briſſot, Vergniaud, &amp;c. were the chiefs and the orators.</p>
               <p>When Dumourier was declared a traitor by the Convention, Briſſot, in the <hi>Patriote Françoiſe,</hi> as well as other writers, who were his accomplices, praiſed him, in defiance of the law. As members of the Committee of General Defence, they ought to have given information relative to the preparations that
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:028343_0027_0FD8AEF1AD888650"/>
were making in La Vendée. The Convention, however, was not made acquainted with them till the war became ſerious.</p>
               <p>They armed the Sections where Ariſtocracy reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, againſt thoſe where public ſpirit was triumphant.</p>
               <p>They affected to believe that a plot was meditated by the Republicans againſt the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the purpoſe of naming the commiſſion of twelve, who, in an arbitrary manner, impriſoned the magiſtrates of the people, and made war againſt the patriots.</p>
               <p>Iſnard developed the views of the conſpiracy, when he uſed this atrocious expreſſion: "The aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed traveller will ſeek on what banks of the Seine Paris once ſtood." The Convention diſſolved the commiſſion, which, however, reſumed its functions on its own authority, and continued to act.</p>
               <p>The faction, by the addreſſes which it ſent to the departments, armed them againſt Paris and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. The death of numbers of patriots in the ſouthern departments, and particularly at Marſeilles, where they periſhed on the ſcaffold, was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe fatal diviſions in the Convention, of which they were the authors.—The defection of Marſeilles ſoon produced that of Lyons. This important city became the central point of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-revolution in the South. The republican muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality was diſperſed by the rebels, and good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were maſſacred.—Every puniſhment that cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could deviſe to increaſe the torments of death was put in execution. The adminiſtrative bodies were leagued partly with Lyons, and partly with foreign Ariſtocrats, and with the Emigrants diſperſed through the Swiſs Cantons.</p>
               <p>The cabinet of London afforded life and energy to this rebellious league. Its pretext was the anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy that reigned at Paris—its leaders, the traitorous deputies of the Convention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:028343_0028_0FD8AEF3312275F0"/>Whilſt they made this powerful diverſion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the tyrants united againſt us, La Vendée continued to drink the blood of the patriots.</p>
               <p>Carra and Duchatel were ſent to this department in quality of Deputies from the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Carra publicly exhorted the adminiſtrators of the Maine and Loire to ſend troops againſt Paris. Both theſe deputies were at the ſame time connected with the Generals of the combined armies.</p>
               <p>Couſtard, ſent alſo as a commiſſioner, carried his treaſonable projects to ſuch a length, as even to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſupplies of proviſions and ſtores to the rebels. The miſſion of the agents of this faction, ſent to different parts of the republic, was marked by ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar traitorous meaſures.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the column of republican power would ere this have meaſured its length upon the ground, if the conſpirators had preſerved much longer their inordinate power. On the 10th of Auguſt, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the column was laid; on the 31ſt of May it was preſerved from deſtruction. The accuſed publiſhed a thouſand ſeditious addreſſes, a thouſand counter-revolutionary libels, ſuch as that addreſſed by Condorcet to the department of the Aiſne. They are the diſgraceful monuments of the treaſon by which they hoped to involve France in ruin.</p>
               <p>Ducos and Fonfrede formed the flame of the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, by their correſpondence and their ſpeeches, in which they celebrated the virtues of the conſpirators.</p>
               <p>Several of theſe conſpirators fled, and diſperſed themſelves through the departments—They eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there a kind of National Convention, and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the adminiſtration with independent powers— they encircled themſelves with guards and cannon, pillaged the public treaſuries, intercepted proviſions that were on the road to Paris, and ſent them to the revolted inhabitants of the former provinces of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny.
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:028343_0029_0FD8AEF4CCE9B1D0"/>
They levied a new army, and gave Wimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen, degraded by his attachment to tyranny, the command of this army.</p>
               <p>They attempted to effect a junction with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of la Vendée, and to ſurrender to the enemy the provinces of Britanny and Normandy.</p>
               <p>They deputed aſſaſſins to Paris, to murder the members of the Convention, and particularly Marat, whoſe deſtruction they had ſolemnly ſworn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. They put a poignard into the hands of a woman who was recommended to Duperret by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroux and his accomplices. She was conveyed into the gallery of the Convention by Fauchet.—The enemies of France exalted her as a heroine. Petion pronounced her apotheoſis at Caen, and threw over the blood ſtained form of aſſaſſination the ſnowy robe of virtue.</p>
               <p>Girey Dupre, the colleague of Briſſot, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the <hi>Patriote Français,</hi> printed at Caen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſongs, which invited, in a formal manner, the citizens of Caen to arm themſelves with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Briſſot fled with a lie added to his other crimes. Had he gone to Switzerland, as the falſe paſſport ſtated, it would have been for the purpoſe of excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new enemy againſt France.</p>
               <p>Rabaud St. Etierre, Rebecqui, Duprat, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiboul, carried the torch of ſedition into the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of le Gard and the neighbouring departments. Biroteau, Rouger, and Roland, projected their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible plots in Lyons, where they poured the ample ſtream of patriotic blood, by attaching to the friends of their country the appellation of anarchiſts and monopolizers.</p>
               <p>At Toulon theſe endeavours were ſucceſsful, and Toulon is now in the hands of the Engliſh. The ſame lot was reſerved for Bourdeaux and Marſeilles.
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:028343_0030_0FD8AEF62345B578"/>
The reigning faction had made ſome overtures to Lord Hood, whoſe fleet they expected. The entire execution of the conſpiracy in the South waited only for the junction of the Marſeilleſe and Lyoneſe, which was prevented by the victory gained by the Republican army which produced the reduction of Marſeilles.</p>
               <p>The meaſures of the conſpirators were exactly ſimilar to thoſe of the enemies of France, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Engliſh.—Their writings differed in nothing from thoſe of the Engliſh miniſters, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers in the pay of the Engliſh miniſters.</p>

            <p>THE Court of Great-Britain had no ſooner ſigned the Treaty acknowledging the Independence of her late Colonies in North America, than her merchants and political writers ſought the means of rendering to her by commerce an equivalent for her loſſes by the war.</p>
            <p>Lord Sheffield has predicted, in his Obſervations on the Commerce of America, "that England would always be the ſtorehouſe of the United States; that the Americans, conſtantly attracted by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of her manufactures, the long experienced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of her merchants, and the length of credit, which they only can give, would ſoon forget the wounds which the miniſterial deſpotiſm of London, as well as the ferocity of the Engliſh and German ſatellites, had given to America, to form with it new and durable connexions."<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe are not Lord Sheffield's words.

                  </gap>uſal of that Nobleman's Obſervations on the Commerce of America. EDIT.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This politician was the only one who appeared in that career; others followed it [Dr. Price, &amp;c.] and the debates, which the new regulations of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce propoſed for America, produced in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prove that the matter was known, diſcuſſed, and profoundly examined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:028343_0037_0FD8AF08F46EE5B8"/>The Engliſh nation reſembled at that time a man who, coming out of a long delirium (wherein he had broken every thing that he ought to have held moſt dear,) eagerly ſtrives to repair the ravages of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity.</p>
            <p>As for us, we have triumphed, and the honour of the triumph is almoſt the only benefit we have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tranquil under the ſhade of our laurels, we ſee with indifference the relations of commerce which nature has created between us and the <hi>United States</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> —whilſt, to uſe the language of vulgar policy, the Engliſh, of whom we are jealous as our rivals, whom we fear as our enemies, uſe the greateſt efforts to make it impoſſible for us to form new connexions with our new friends.</p>
            <p>That the Engliſh will ſucceed, there is no doubt, if our languor be not ſoon replaced by activity; if the greateſt and moſt generous faculties, on our part, do not ſmooth this commerce, new, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſy to be facilitated: finally, if our ignorance of the ſtate of America be not ſpeedily diſſipated by the conſtant ſtudy of her reſources of territory, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, finance, &amp;c. and affinities they may have with thoſe of their own.</p>
            <p>Our ignorance! This word will undoubtedly ſhock,—for we have the pride of an ancient people: We think we know every thing,—have exhauſted every thing:—Yes, we have exhauſted every thing; but in what? In futile ſciences, in frivolous arts, in modes, in luxury, in the art of pleaſing women, and the relaxation of morals. We make elegant courſes of chymiſtry, charming experiments, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious verſes, ſtrangers at home, little informed of any thing abroad: this is what we are; that is, we know every thing <hi>except that which is proper for us to know.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">This aſſertion will perhaps appear ſevere and falſe, even to perſons who think that we excel in phyſics and the exact ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But in granting this, is it theſe kinds of ſciences to which a man who reflects o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ought not this to intereſt him more than the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtars, or the order of chymical affinities?—It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the ſcience of which we think the leaſt. We are paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fond of poetry: we diſpute ſeriouſly about muſic; that is, we have a great conſideration far playthings, and make a plaything of our affairs.</note>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:028343_0038_0FD8AF0A5DDD2C10"/>It would be opening a vaſt field to ſhew what is proper for us to know, therefore I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. I confine myſelf to a ſingle point: I ſay that it concerns us eſſentially to have a thorough knowledge of the ſtate of America, and that, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, we have ſcarcely begun the alphabet which leads to it. What I advance has been ſaid before by Mr. Paine, a free American, and who has not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contributed, by his patriotic writings, to ſpread, ſupport, and exalt, among his fellow countrymen, the enthuſiaſm of liberty. I will remark, ſays he, in his judicious letter to the Abbé Raynal, <hi>that I have not yet ſeen a deſcription, given in Europe, of America, of which the fidelity can be relied on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In France, I ſay it with ſorrow, the ſcience of commerce is almoſt unknown, becauſe its practice has long been diſhonoured by prejudice; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the gentry from thinking of it. This preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which is improperly thought indeſtructible, becauſe the nobility are improperly thought one of the neceſſary elements of a monarchical conſtitution; this would alone be capable of preventing French commerce from having activity, energy, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were it not to be hoped, that ſound philoſophy, in deſtroying it inſenſibly, <hi>would bring men to the</hi> great idea <hi>of eſtimating individuals by their talents, and not by their birth:</hi> without this idea there can be no great national commerce, but ariſtocratical men will abound; that is, men incapable of conceiving any elevated view; and men contemptible, not in a ſtate to produce them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028343_0039_0FD8AF10165ACF10"/>Finally, another prejudice, quite as abſurd, which has been combated a thouſand times, and is always predominant in France, withholds from the eyes of the public precious memoirs, and intereſting diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which would inform France of her intereſts.</p>
            <p>Who is ignorant that it is to the freedom of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and public diſcuſſion that England owes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proſperity which, till lately, has followed her every where, in commerce, in arts, in manufactures, as well abroad as at home? a proſperity which ſhe may enjoy in ſpite of the faults of her miniſters; for none but theſe have ever endangered it: and it is to the freedom of debate that ſhe has often owed her ſalvation from ruin. Who doubts that this liberty would not produce the ſame happy effects in France; —that it would not deſtroy falſe appearances;—that it would not prevent the deſtructive enterprizes of perſonal intereſt;—that it would not alarm miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous indulgence, or the coalition of people in place with the enemies of the public welfare? Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſeems at preſent to do homage to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the freedom of diſcuſſion. At length, it appears to relax of its ſeverity in the laws of the preſs; it has ſuffered ſome ſhackles, which reſtrained diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, to be broken, eſpecially in political matters. But how far are we ſtill from feeling the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the liberty of the preſs, rather granted to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion, than encouraged by a real love of truth!</p>
            <p>By what fatality are energetic diſcourſes of truth ineffectual? This ought to be pointed out; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf invites us to do it; the abuſes which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der information uſeleſs in France, ought to be laid open.</p>
            <p>It is becauſe the liberty of thinking and writing on political matters is but of recent date.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the liberty of the preſs is environed with many diſguſting circumſtances; and that an honeſt man who diſdains libels, but loves frankneſs, is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

from the preſs by all thoſe humiliating formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſubject the fruit of his meditation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches to a cenſure neceſſarily ariſing from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>It is becauſe the cenſor, inſtituted to check the elevation of a generous liberty, thinks to flatter au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by even exceeding the end propoſed; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes truths, which would frequently have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for fear of letting too bold ones eſcape, with which he would have been reproached; multiplies objections, gives birth to fears, magnifies dangers, and thus diſcourages the man of probity, who would have enlightened his fellow citizens; whilſt this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſanctions ſcandalous productions, wherein reaſon is ſacrificed to ſarcaſms, and ſevere morality to ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vices.<note n="*" place="bottom">We may put in the rank of theſe productions which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the cenſorſhip, the comedy of Figaro, a ſcandal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It is becauſe there are but few writers virtuous enough, ſufficiently organized, or in proper ſituations to combat and ſurmount theſe obſtacles.</p>
            <p>Becauſe theſe writers, few in number, have but little influence; abuſes weakly attacked and ſtrongly defended, reſiſt every thing which is oppoſed to them.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the neceſſity of getting works printed in foreign preſſes, renders the publication difficult; but few of them eſcape from the hands of greedy hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who monopolize the ſale, to ſell at a dearer price; who poſt the myſtery, and a falſe rarity, to ſell dear for a longer time.</p>
            <p>Becauſe theſe books are wanting in the moment
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028343_0041_0FD8AF145EABC6B0"/>
when they would excite a happy fermentation, and direct it properly, in giving true principles.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they fall but ſucceſſively into the hands of well-informed men, who are but few in number, in the ſearch of new truths.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Journaliſts, who ought to render them a public homage, are obliged, through fear, to keep ſilence.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the general maſs, abandoned to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of frivolous literature, loſes the pleaſure of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and with it the love of profound truths.</p>
            <p>Finally, becauſe truth is by this fatal concurrence of circumſtances never ſown in a favourable ſoil, nor in a proper manner; that it is often ſtifled in its birth; and if it ſurvives all adverſe manoeuvres, it gathers ſtrength but ſlowly, and with difficulty; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its effects are too circumſcribed for inſtruction to become popular and national.</p>
            <p>Let government remove all theſe obſtacles: let it have the courage, or rather the found policy, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the preſs its liberty; and good works, ſuch as are really uſeful, will have more ſucceſs; from which there will reſult much benefit.</p>
            <p>Does it wiſh for an example? I will quote one, which is recent and well known: the law-ſuit of the monopolizing merchants againſt the coloniſts of the ſugar iſlands. Would not the laſt have, according to cuſtom, been cruſhed, if the diſpute had been carried on in obſcurity? They had the liberty of ſpeech, of writing, and of printing; the public voice was raiſed in their favour, truth was triumphant; and the wiſe miniſter, who had permitted a public diſcuſſion, that he might gain information, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced for humanity in pronouncing in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>Let us hope that this example will be followed; that government will more and more perceive the immenſe advantages which reſult from the liberty of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028343_0042_0FD8AF15CF1B9D60"/>
the preſs. There is one which, above all others, ought to induce it to accelerate this liberty, becauſe it nearly regards the intereſt of the preſent moment: this liberty is a powerful means to eſtabliſh, fortify, and maintain public credit, which is become, more than ever, neceſſary to great nations, ſince they have ſtood in need of loans. As long as the attempts of perſonal intereſt are feared by the obſcurity which covers them, public credit is never firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor does it riſe to its true height. It is no longer calculated upon the intrinſic ſtrength of its reſources, but upon the probability, upon the fear of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which may either divert them from their real employ, or render them ſterile. The liberty of the preſs keeps perſonal intereſt too much in awe not to fetter its meaſures; and then public credit ſupports itſelf if it be eſtabliſhed, is formed if it be ſtill to be conſtituted, and fortifies itſelf if it has been weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by error.</p>
            <p>Full of theſe ideas, as well as the love of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſurmounting the obſtacles to the liberty of printing, I have undertaken to throw ſome light upon our commercial affinities with the United States. This object is of the greateſt importance; the queſtion is, to develope the immenſe advantages which France may reap from the revolution which ſhe has ſo powerfully favoured, and to indicate the means of extending and conſolidating them.</p>
            <p>It appears to me that all the importance of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution has not been perceived; that it has not been ſufficiently conſidered by men of underſtanding. Let it, therefore, be permitted me to conſider it at preſent.</p>
            <p>I will not go into a detail of the advantages which the United States muſt reap from the revolution, which aſſures them liberty. I will not ſpeak of that regeneration of the phyſical and moral man, which muſt be an infallible conſequence of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028343_0043_0FD8AF171DB3D608"/>
of that perfection to which free America, left to its energy, without other bounds but its own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, muſt one day carry the arts and ſciences, America enjoys already the right of free debate, and it cannot be too often repeated, that without this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, perfection is but a mere chimera. In truth, almoſt every thing is yet to be done in the United States, but almoſt every thing is there underſtood: the general good is the common end of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual,—this end cheriſhed, implanted, ſo to ſpeak, by the conſtitution in every heart. With this end, this intelligence, and this liberty, the greateſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles muſt be performed.</p>
            <p>I will not ſpeak of the advantages which all Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica muſt one day reap from this revolution; nor of the impoſſibility that abſurd deſpotiſm ſhould reign for a long time in the neighbourhood of liberty.— I will confine myſelf to the examination of what advantages Europe, and France in particular, may draw from this change. There are two which are particularly ſtriking: the firſt, and greateſt of the revolution, at leaſt in the eyes of philoſophy, is that of its ſalutary influence on human knowledge, and on the reform of local prejudices; for this war has occaſioned diſcuſſions important to public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,—the diſcuſſion of the ſocial compact,—of civil liberty,—of the means which can render a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple independent, of the circumſtances which give ſanction to its inſurrection, and make it legal,—and which give this people a place among the powers of the earth.</p>
            <p>What good has not reſulted from the repeated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Engliſh conſtitution, and of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects? What good has not reſulted from the codes of Maſſachuſetts and New-York, publiſhed and ſpread every where? And what benefits will they ſtill produce? They will not be wholly taken for a model; but deſpotiſm will pay a greater reſpect,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028343_0044_0FD8AF1A3B6AB568"/>
either from neceſſity or reaſon, to the rights of men, which are ſo well known and eſtabliſhed. Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by this revolution, the governments of Europe will be inſenſibly obliged to reform their abuſes, and to diminiſh their burdens, in the juſt apprehenſion that their ſubjects, tired of bearing the weight, will take refuge in the aſylum offered to them by the United States.</p>
            <p>This revolution, favourable to the people, which is preparing in the cabinets of Europe, will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly accelerated, by that which its commerce will experience, and which we owe to the enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement of America. The war which procured it to her, has made known the influence of commerce on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ower, the neceſſity of public credit, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of public virtue, without which it cannot long ſubſiſt:—What raiſed the Engliſh to that height of power, from whence, in ſpite of the faults of their Miniſters, Generals, and Negociators, they braved, for ſo many years, the force of the moſt powerful nations? Their commerce, and their credit; which, loaded as they were with an enormous debt, put them in a ſtate to uſe all the efforts which nations, the moſt rich by their ſoil and population, could not have done in a like caſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the advantages which France, the world, and humanity, owe to the American Revolution; and when we conſider them, and add thoſe we are obliged to let remain in obſcurity, we are far from regretting the expences they occaſioned us.</p>
            <p>Were any thing to be regretted, ought not it to vaniſh at the appearance of the new and immenſe commerce which this revolution opens to the French? This is the moſt important point at preſent for us,— that on which we have the leaſt information, which conſequently makes it more neceſſary to gain all we can upon the ſubject; and ſuch is the object of this work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028343_0045_0FD8AF1D6FDD4008"/>In what more favourable moment could it appear, when every nation is in a ferment to extend its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſeeks new information and ſure principles? The mind is inceſſantly recalled in this book to the <hi>nature of things,</hi> the firſt principle of commerce.— At a time when people, which an ancient rivality, an antipathy, ſo falſely and unhappily called natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, kept at a diſtance one from the other, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to approach each other, and to extinguiſhed in the connexions of commerce the fire of diſcord; this work ſhews that theſe rivalities muſt be effaced by the immenſity of the career which is opened to all.—At a time when all the parts of univerſal poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are enlightened by the flambeau of philoſophy, even in governments which have hitherto profeſſed to be afraid of it, the author of this work has let ſlip no opportunity of attacking falſe notions and abuſes of every kind.</p>
            <p>Never was there a moment more favourable for publiſhing uſeful truths. Every nation does not only do homage to commerce, as to the vivifying ſpirit of ſociety; but they employ, in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe connexions and affinities, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic of facts, whoſe uſe characterizes the end of the preſent century,—that art truly philoſophical, of conſidering objects in their nature, and in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences:—Never had well informed men more contempt for thoſe chimerical ſyſtems ſolely founded upon the fancies of pride, upon the little conceptions of vanity, and upon the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the falſe political ſcience, which has too long balanced the deſtiny of States. Never were ſo many men ſeen united by the ſame deſire of an univerſal peace, and by the conviction of the misfortune and inutility of hateful rivalities. At length it appears, that men perceive that the field of induſtry is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; that it is open to every ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

thrive in it, provided that in each of them the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of individual liberty, and the preſervation of property, be the principal end of legation.</p>
            <p>This work ſtill concurs with the patriotic views which the ſovereign of France manifeſts at preſent: he meditates important reformations. He directs them towards the happineſs of the people; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults the moſt reſpectable members of this people, whom he wiſhes to render happy, upon the means of inſuring the ſucceſs of his good intentions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, could there be a more propitious moment to offer to the preſent arbitrators of the national proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, a work written with deliberation, on the means of eſtabliſhing a new commerce with a new people, who unites to an extenſive ſoil, and proper to nouriſh an immenſe population, laws which are the moſt favourable to its rapid increaſe?</p>
            <p>At firſt I had alone undertaken this work, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on my own ſtrength and laborious reſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: I had collected all the facts,—all the books,— all the proofs which could be certain guides to my ſteps; but I ſoon perceived the impoſſibility of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon objects of commerce a ſolid and uſeful theory, if it were not directed by the ſkill which practice only can give, and poſſeſſed by a man whoſe judgment had been long exerciſed by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whoſe decided love of truth and the public welfare had accuſtomed to generalize his ideas. I found this man, this co-operator, of whoſe aſſiſtance I ſtood in need, in a republican; to whom I am united by a ſimilarity of ideas, as well as by the moſt tender attachment. I have permiſſion to name him, —he conſents to it: I have conquered his modeſty by the conſideration of his intereſt, and of the law which the particular circumſtances of his ſituation impoſes on him: I have perſuaded him, that the beſt means of deſtroying calumny was to make known his principles and opinions on public matters.

It is M. Claviere, a Geneveſe, exiled without any form from his country, by the military ariſtocracy; which has ſubſtituted its illegel and deſtructive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen to the reaſonable and legitimate influence of a people, diſtinguiſhed by their natural good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, their knowledge, and their more ſimple manners. What was his crime? That of having defended the rights of theſe people, with a firmneſs and ability, which the implacable hatred of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies atteſt! This part does too much honour to my friend, not to confine myſelf to deſcribe him in this character, the only one which has ever been productive of public good.</p>
            <p>M. Claviere has, during his abode in France, given proofs of his knowledge in the philoſophical and political part of commerce. It is to his abode among us that the public is indebted for ſome uſeful works on theſe abſtract matters; works, as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their ſolidity of principle and truth of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, as for the clearneſs and preciſion of ideas; works, whoſe ſucceſs proves that minds may be led to the contemplation of theſe matters, by ſubſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an exact and clear analyſis to the metaphyſical and obſcure jargon which reſtrained them from it.</p>
            <p>Finally, the preſent work will prove at once the extent of his knowledge, and that of the ſincere philanthropy which animates him, even for the good of a country, where a man leſs generous would ſee nothing, perhaps, but the origin and cauſe of his misfortunes. Oh! how happy am I, to have it in my power to defend my friend againſt cowardly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators, in putting him under the ſafeguard of his own talents and virtues! And is it not a ſacred duty for me, as the calumny is public, to publiſh the part he has taken in this work, wherein it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible not to diſcover the honeſt man, in the man enlightened? the friend of mankind, in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the wiſeſt maxims? In the thinking phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſoper,

accuſtomed to a ſevere logic, to purſue the intereſts of public good, whenever the light of truth can clear up ſome of its aſpects? This is not a vague eulogium; people will be convinced of it in reading the two chapters which concern the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of commerce; a great number of notes in which he has had a part, and eſpecially the article of tobacco, which is entirely his own In general, he will be known in thoſe new conſiderations which the commercial man of reflection only can ſuggeſt to the philoſophical politician.</p>
            <p>The ſame motive has guided us both in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and publication of this work. It was the deſire of being uſeful to France, to Free America, to Humanity; for nothing which paſſes in the United States, neither ought to, nor can in future, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to humanity. America has revenged it by her revolution: ſhe ought to enlighten it by her le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, and become a perpetual leſſon to all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, as a conſolation to individuals.</p>
            <p>It remains to me now to ſpeak of the ſources to which we have had recourſe, in the order of this work, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We have joined the information of intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe abode in America has given them an opportunity of gaining information, to that with which the public papers, the acts of Congreſs, of different legiſlatures, and the different works pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the United States, have furniſhed us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore credit may be given to all the facts which we advance.</p>
            <p>In aſſociating our ideas, we have ſtriven to give them an uniformity: we have, above every thing, endeavoured to expreſs them with that clearneſs which is ſo difficult to introduce into matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and finance. The poverty of our language, and the ſingularity of new circumſtances which we had to deſcribe, has ſometimes led us to what is called
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028343_0049_0FD8AF29ADD94A18"/>
neology. We muſt create what we have not, and of which we ſtand in need, without giving ourſelves any trouble about thoſe grammarians, but triflingly philoſophical, whom Cicero deſcribes thus in his time: <hi>Controverſies about words torment theſe little Greeks, more deſirous of contention than of truth.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We have carefully avoided certain words much uſed in vulgar politics, and which give and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate falſe ideas and deceitful ſyſtems. Such are theſe expreſſions; <hi>powers fill the firſt character, hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe words, which ſtir up hatred and jealouſy, are only proper to feed petulant am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and, if I may uſe the expreſſion, to put the <hi>policy</hi> of <hi>diſturbance</hi> in the place of that happineſs. Miniſters, wearied of theſe words and ideas, will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach a greater price to real glory,—that of making the people happy.</p>
            <p>Many notes will be found in this work; we thought it neceſſary to give this form to all the ideas, which, thrown into the text, might have obſcured the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal one.</p>
            <p>A note relaxes the mind, in ſuſpending the chain of the principal thoughts; it excites curioſity, in announcing a new point of view; it forces the reader to a certain degree of attention, in obliging him to attach the note to the text, to reap any advantage from his reading.</p>
            <p>We have in theſe notes indicated, as often as it has been poſſible, the ideas of reform which may be uſeful to France. We have frequently quoted the Engliſh nation and government. Let not our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, be ſurpriſed at it. It is this nation which has made moſt progreſs in the practice of ſome good principles of political economy. To what nation in Europe can we better compare France? If a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vality
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028343_0050_0FD8AF2C228AC218"/>
ought to exiſt between them, is it not in that which is good? Ought not we from that moment to know all the good meaſures taken in England? Ought people to be diſpleaſed with us for mentioning theſe meaſures? The example of thoſe who have already quoted England has encouraged us. They have naturalized in France, happy inſtitutions, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated from her rival.</p>
            <p>If our criticiſm appears ſometimes roughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, our readers will be ſo good as to conſider, that friends to public welfare can but with difficulty refrain from being moved by the aſpect of certain abuſes, and from ſuffering the ſentiment of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it excites in them to break forth.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the numerous precautions we have taken to come at truth; notwithſtanding the extreme attention we have given to this work, errors will undoubtedly be ſound in ſome of the ſtatements, and perhaps in the reaſonings.

               <head>CHAPTER I. Of External Commerce; the circumſtances which lead to it, and the Means of aſſuring it to a Nation.</head>
               <p>COMMERCE ſignifies an exchange of produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either by barter, or by repreſentative ſigns of their value.</p>
               <p>External commerce is that carried on between two or more nations. It ſuppoſes in them mutual wants, and a ſurplus of productions correſpondent thereto.</p>
               <p>Nations, which nature or the force of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to a commercial intercourſe, are thoſe which have that correſpond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce of wants, and ſurplus of productions.</p>
               <p>This familiarity enables them to trade together, directly or indirectly; a direct commerce is that which exiſts between two nations, without the intervention of a third.</p>
               <p>Commerce is indirect when one nation trades with another by way of a third. This is the caſe of ſtates which have no ſea-ports, and yet wiſh to exchange their productions for thoſe of the Indies.</p>
               <p>That nation, which having it in its power to carry on a direct commerce with another, yet makes uſe of an intermediate one, is neceſſarily obliged to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028343_0052_0FD8AF33190A8D90"/>
its profits. However, this diſadvantage may ſometimes be compenſated by other conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Such, for inſtance, is the caſe of a nation which, in want of huſbandmen and manufacturers, prefers that ſtrangers ſhould themſelves come in ſearch of its ſuperfluities, and bring in exchange thoſe of others: its want of population impoſes this law, and whilſt theſe conſiderations exiſt, it is both morally and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically better that its inhabitants ſhould be employed in cultivation, than become carriers of their own national productions, or of thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible that nations which already have communications with each other, ſhould be ignorant of their mutual productions. Hence ariſes the deſire of acquiring them in thoſe where they do not exiſt. Hence direct or indirect commerce, which is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the inevitable reſult of the ſtate of things.</p>
               <p>From the ſame principle, it is the intereſt of each nation to render its exterior commerce direct as ſoon as poſſible, without doing an injury to its interior trade.</p>
               <p>Direct importations, not being ſubject to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and commiſſions of agents, procure things at a cheaper rate.</p>
               <p>A moderate price is the ſureſt means of obtaining an exterior commerce, the beſt reaſon for preference, and the guarantee of its continuation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is vulgarly ſaid that a thing is dear when once it is above the accuſtomed price; and it is eſteemed cheap the moment that price is diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>By this it ſeems that the dearneſs of a thing is the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its ſtated, with its uſual price. The laſt is determined by five principal circumſtances. 1ſt. The coſt of the raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral. 2d. That of the workmanſhip. 3d. The want the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer has of the thing. 4th. The means he has of paying for it. 5th. The proportion of its quantity with the demand there is for it. Theſe circumſtances increaſe or diminiſh the profit of the ſeller; ſometimes indeed they may prevent him from gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all. Circumſtances which influence the moſt are ſcarcity and abundance, expreſſions by which the proportion between the want and the quantity of productions are deſignated.</p>
                     <p>If there be a ſurplus of them, they are naturally ſold at a low price. Whence it appears, that nations having great quantities of raw materials, various manufactures and a numerous popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are more particularly invited to an exterior and continued commerce, becauſe they have it in their power to carry it on upon better terms.</p>
                     <p>An article may be ſold at a low price, and enrich him who furniſhes it; as it may be ſold dear, and ruin the ſeller. This depends upon the relation there is between its value and the means of its productions. Every nation diſpoſed to exterior commerce, in whatſoever article it may be, ought therefore to conſider two things, the price at which it can afford ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and that at which it is ſold by rival nations: if it cannot equal the laſt, it ought to abandon that part of its trade.</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:028343_0053_0FD8AF3482675758"/>The country which can produce and ſell a thing at the cheapeſt rate, is that which unites the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages of that production, whether it be with reſpect to its quality, manufacture, or its low rate of carriage.</p>
               <p>The advantages which render commodities and raw materials cheap, are a fertile ſoil, eaſy of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, climate favourable to the production, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which encourages induſtry, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates carriage by the conſtruction of public roads and navigable canals; finally, a population not too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous relative to the extent of country which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers itſelf to be cultivated.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſituation of the United States proves the laſt aſſertion, which may at firſt ſight appear paradoxical; things are cheap there, becauſe population is not in proportion to the extent of lands to be cultivated. In a good ſoil, a man may, by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, eaſily ſupply the conſumption of ten men, or even more. Theſe ten men may therefore be employed for exterior conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame circumſtances are ſtill more favourable to the manufacture of things common, ſimple, or little charged with faſhion, if the raw material be a natural production of the country, in plenty, and eaſy to be worked up; becauſe theſe manufactures require but few hands, or are carried on at that lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028343_0054_0FD8AF35DDB1CE80"/>
which agriculture affords. Nothing can equal the cheapneſs of this workmanſhip, and in general no induſtry is more lucrative, or better ſupported on eaſy terms, than that which is employed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of repoſe from cultivation: in that caſe cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is neither the product nor the ſign of miſery in the manufacturer; it is, on the contrary, the proof and conſequence of his eaſy circumſtances.<note n="*" place="bottom">Switzerland, and certain parts of Germany, offer a ſtriking example of this fact. Merchandiſe is fabricated there, at a lower rate than in any other country of Europe, by means of this employment of leiſure hours, and is capable of being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to diſtant countries, without loſing its original advantage; even acroſs great ſtates, where nature, left to her own energy, would be ſtill more favourable to the ſame manufactures.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt neceſſary conditions for manufacturing, at a cheap rate, articles complicated, or extremely fine and perfect, or which require the union of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of workmanſhip, are a conſtant and aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous application, and a numerous population; one half of which muſt be at a diſtance from the labours of the field, and applied to manufacture alone.</p>
               <p>Theſe manufactures ought, according to natural order, to be the productions of an exceſs of popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, which cannot give its induſtry to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſimple manufactures; but in general they are the reſult of the gathering together of the poor and wretched in great cities.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Theſe manufactures are crouded with individuals, who having no property, or hope of conſtant employ in the country, or who are induced by the allurements of gain and luxury, run into cities, and ſoon become obliged to ſell their induſtry at a mean price, proportioned to the number of thoſe who are in want of employ. When cheapneſs of workmanſhip comes from this afflicting concurrence of the want of money in men without employ, it is not a ſign of proſperity. On the contrary, it is the reſult and proof of a bad ſocial organization, of too unequal a diviſion of property, and conſequently of an unjuſt diſtribution of neceſſary employments, which compels induſtry to change, from the fabrication of what is neceſſary and uſeful, to that which is fantaſtic, forced, and pernicious. Hence it follows, that wretchedneſs in any country is in proportion to this cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of workmanſhip.</p>
                     <p>It is equally evident from theſe reaſonings, that new and well conſtituted ſtates ought not to deſire manufactures produced by things ſo badly arranged: they ought not to be anxious about them till the rate of population and exceſs of uſeful labour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally incline induſtry to apply itſelf to improve and carry them on. Theſe reaſonings againſt low priced workmanſhip do not hinder us from agreeing, that there is a real advantage in the means of exterior commerce; and that in the actu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028343_0055_0FD8AF3A1ECA8D98"/>Theſe manufactures cannot furniſh their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but with difficulty and uncertainty for exterior commerce, when they are eſtabliſhed and ſupported merely by forced means, ſuch as prohibitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive privileges, &amp;c. by which natural obſtacles, not to be deſtroyed, are pretended to be combated. Countries exempt from them prevail in the end, and obtain a preference.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, that obſtacles cauſed to manufactures by dearneſs of proviſions, burthenſome impoſts, diſtance from the raw material, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfulneſs, or ſmall number of hands, are ſurmounted by ingenuity, or the uſe of machines; which make the work of one man equal to that of many; and render a manufacture capable of ſupporting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of populous countries, where ſuch manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres and machines are not made uſe of, or known.</p>
               <p>But theſe means are precarious, and ſooner or later give way to a more happy ſituation, where climate, ſoil, and government eſpecially, concur in favouring, without effort, all the activity and induſtry of which men are ſuſceptible.<note n="*" place="bottom">FAVOURING, in political economy ſignifies, for the moſt part, not to ſhackle induſtry with too many regulations; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever favourable certain of theſe may be, they reſtrain it in ſome reſpect or other.

               <p>Exterior commerce, more than any other, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated by ſhackles, cuſtoms, viſits, chicaneries, and proceſſes; by the manner of deciding them, and the ſolicitations and delays they bring on.</p>
               <p>The ſtate which would favour ſuch a commerce ſhould, in the firſt place, deſtroy all theſe obſtacles. It is more to its intereſt ſo to do, as from exterior commerce reſults an augmentation of the national revenue.</p>
               <p>All things equal, relative to the price of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and to the facilities with which direct exterior commerce can be carried on, it is more readily eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between two nations which have a ſimilarity of political and religious principles,<note n="†" place="bottom">Religious conſiderations had formerly a conſiderable in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <head>CHAPTER II. Of External Commerce, conſidered in its Means of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and its Balance.</head>
               <p>WE are deceived in believing that commerce cannot be eſtabliſhed between two nations without gold or ſilver to balance their accounts. It will be intereſting to enter into ſome detail on this head, on account of the deficiency of coin in the United States, and the neceſſity of reducing themſelves to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of exchange, being the two principal objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ignorantly brought againſt a trade with them.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcarcity of money in the United States of America has been greatly exaggerated in France. It muſt be ſcarce in all new ſtates, where nothing ſhackles induſtry, where ſo many things are to be created, and where, in every quarter, there are ſuch quantities of lands to be cleared. In order that money ſhould be plenty in this ſtate of creation, mines would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and at the ſame time a want of hands, and induſtry clogged with impediments, circumſtances much more unfavourable to foreign commerce than the ſcarcity of money in an active and induſtrious country. One fact ſeems to prove to us, that in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent America money is found in the moſt deſirable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to population, at leaſt by taking Europe for the term of compariſon. Contracts eſteemed good, and of which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is regularly paid, are ſold there at the rate of ſix percent. per annum. Yet the clearing of lands muſt produce a much greater benefit; why then is not all the money ſwallowed up? why remains there enough of it to fulfil theſe contracts, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no more than five or ſix per cent? Is it not becauſe money is not ſo ſcarce there as people in France imagine, where the actual ſtate of the Americans is confounded with the diſtreſs in which they were when they combated for their liberty?</note>
               </p>
               <p>It has been frequently aſſerted that the balance will be againſt them; that they can only offer an exchange in merchandiſe. It is therefore neceſſary to prove that this great word, balance, is inſignificant; that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028343_0059_0FD8AF42A1C7B098"/>
a great commerce may be carried on without money, and that one of exchange is the moſt advantageous of any.</p>
               <p>When a nation pays with money the whole, or the balance of its importations, it is ſaid the balance of trade is againſt it, by which a diſadvantageous idea of its poſition is meant to be given. This is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice eaſy to be overturned, although entertained by men celebrated for their knowledge.</p>
               <p>In effect, whence comes to this country the gold it pays? It is either from its mines, and in that caſe it pays with one of its own productions; or it owes it to artificers who exerciſe their functions in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign country, and even then it pays with a produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which originates within its dominions. As long as a nation pays another, directly or indirectly, with its own productions, its poſition cannot be diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. Therefore, the unfavourable word ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, thus attached to the balance of an account paid in money, offers no exact and nice idea of the favourable or unfavourable ſtate of a nation.</p>
               <p>Gold is alſo a merchandiſe; and it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to one nation, according to its relations or connexions with another, to pay with money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its having, for that reaſon, an unfavourable ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt it.</p>
               <p>There is but one caſe wherein the balance againſt a nation can be declared; it is that when having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted its money and treaſures, it remains debtor to another nation. But things could not remain long in this ſtate; ſo wretched a ſoil, unequal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and exchange of its inhabitants, would ſoon be abandoned; this, however, cannot happen. Importation preſently becomes in proportion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; an equilibrium is eſtabliſhed, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unfavourable balance has not duration enough to give a right of ſuppoſing even its exiſtence.</p>
               <p>There is as little truth and juſtice in ſaying a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028343_0060_0FD8AF444AF99DB8"/>
has the balance of trade in its favour, when it receives in money balances due to it upon the amount of its exportations. This balance, exiſting for a certain time, would heap up ſpecie in the country, and at length render it very miſerable. This has never been the caſe; yet it would have happened if this ſyſtem had the leaſt foundation.</p>
               <p>The circulation of money depends on too many cauſes, to deduce from its abundance a certain ſign of a favourable commercial balance; a thouſand combinations and events, which have no relation to that balance, draw money from abroad or ſend it there; and in general, continued and various motions of commerce, the tables of exportation and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, according to which the ſign of a favourable or unfavourable balance is regulated, are too uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defective for the purpoſe, as well as for form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a judgment of the quantities of coin or riches of a nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I will give a ſtriking example of the deficiency of theſe calculations, of the eſtimation of a balance of trade, and of the quantity of money.

But according to the calculation of the ſecret committee, appointed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England, to examine the ſtate of Engliſh poſſeſſions in India, the ſums drawn from Bengal from 1757 to 1771, amount to 751,500,000 livres.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The detail of this calculation is given in The Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Indies, Vol. I. page 249.

                     <p>Finally, what will be the amount, if there be added to it the enormous ſums exported from the Indies by individuals, who have there enriched themſelves? The fortune of Lord Clive was beyond calculation; that of Mr. Haſtings, againſt whom a proſecution is now carrying on, is calculated at thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty millions. Another Governor has, according to ſeveral well-founded reports, recently paid upwards of two millions of livres to ſilence his accuſers. It is true that a part of theſe immenſe riches have been employed to defray the expences incurred by the Engliſh in guarding their poſſeſſions in India; that a more conſiderable one has been ſent into Europe under the form of merchandize; but it cannot be denied that a third part has been brought in gold and ſilver to our continent. What is the amount of it? This is impoſſible to ſtate. But whatever it may be, it renders the calculation of Mr. Neckar doubtful.—Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible riches of the Indies be judged of by one fact, and conſequently the immenſe ſource from which the Europeans have drawn them, and by another conſequence, the money which muſt have come into Europe.

Theſe events, unnoticed by political calculators, have certainly had great and univerſal influence upon the fluctuation and circulation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. That which makes it ſuppoſed that no metals come from India, is the opinion that their importation is diſadvantageous. But have the freebooters who have pillaged that country for the laſt thirty years calculated this diſadvantage?

                     <p>With reſpect to the ſtated ſums of money which paſs from Europe or India, there is the ſame defect in the calculations of Mr. Neckar.

                     <p>It is very probable there are a number of particular cauſes which inſenſibly diminiſh the quantity of coin in thoſe nations which have the balance of trade conſtantly in their favour.

If this ſenſibly augments, if eaſe and the conveniencies of life become more general, if the cauſes of indigence in an increaſing people be ſeen to diminiſh, or are confined to inability to work, occaſioned by accidental illneſſes; it is evident, that the revenues of that nation exceed its expences, and that the balance of trade is in its favour; for if the value of its exportation were inferior to that of its

It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by rational and well compoſed tables upon this ſubject only, that a miniſter of ſound judgment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and extended in his plans, will be prevailed upon to govern himſelf. It is by them he will judge of the increaſe and advantages of exterior commerce, as well as of national riches.</p>
               <p>He will be very cautious of decorating with this title the amaſſing of gold and ſilver, and equally ſo of making it the token of riches, or of judging of their extent by the quantity of thoſe metals. All ſuch ideas are ſordid, dangerous, and falſe; ſordid, becauſe they attach to this ſign the repreſentation of productions, and conſequently the extenſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; dangerous, becauſe they accuſtom men to look upon gold as real riches, to neglect the thing for its ſhadow,<note n="*" place="bottom">Could gold and ſilver be preſerved from adulteration and the attempts of tyranny and ignorance, they would have a much better title to be conſidered as real riches. Gold being an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal agent, he who poſſeſſes it may emigrate to wherever he pleaſes, and take his gold with him. This metal is therefore every thing with nations unhappy enough to make arbitrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to general maxims, upon which public credit is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But how dearly do they pay for their ignorance of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of public credit!

All their meaſures are forced—nature is liberal in vain; inceſſantly employed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing evils which continually preſent themſelves, ſhe has not time enough allowed her to add to our happineſs. When it was ſaid that money had no particular country, governments were emphatically told, that it was neceſſary to do without great quantities of it: it will never be rejected till the ineſtimable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſulting from a reſpect for public credit ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly known. The leſs individuals love and heap up money, the richer, more enlightened, and better governed will a nation be.

                     <p>In general, the maſs of gold or ſilver is divided into three principal parts.—The firſt under the form of money, ſerves for daily and unavoidable expences. Each individual, as ſoon as he is charged with the ſupport of himſelf and family, muſt have at leaſt ſome pieces of money for daily exigencies, and the payment of impoſts. To this muſt be added that ſum which is reſerved for caſualties.—This cuſtom is more or leſs obſerved in all countries, in proportion to the probability of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous events. It is impoſſible to calculate this firſt part.— It is however evident, that it ought to be in proportion to the population, and to increaſe with it; and that a decreaſe of population would ſoon take place, were many individuals total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of a pecuniary contingency ſufficient to procure them ſuch neceſſaries as cannot be diſpenſed with, and which they neither make nor receive themſelves. It appears alſo, that this part of the coin remains in the country by reaſon of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued application in little ſums to daily wants, and of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſtagnation of that which is laid up in reſerve.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part is deſtined, under the ſame form, to the great operations of commerce. It is equally impoſſible to fix its quantity, on account of an infinity of combinations which continually change and cauſe theſe metals to paſs from one country to another. Daily charges, cuſtoms, &amp;c. retain a part; but theſe objects belong equally to our firſt diviſion.</p>
                     <p>The third part contains uncoined gold and ſilver, under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever form they may have: it is, like the ſecond, ſubject to numbers of continual variations, which leave no ſatisfactory means of determining its quantity.</p>
                     <p>To pretend to aſcertain the quantity in the maſs, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of uncertain commercial balances, and by the addition of ſpecie produced from mints ſince a new coinage has taken place, is not a more certain means, becauſe it would be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to obſerve the continual action of commerce upon theſe metals, under all their forms, and of the combinations it produces, which ſucceſſively ariſe from one another. In thus eſtimating money it is forgotten, that it is an univerſal agent, which, by that character alone, muſt neceſſarily change its ſituation perpetually; ſince commerce has produced an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity among men, by wants, which they have created to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of their reciprocal productions. It is equally unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that different circumſtances reduce gold to the ſtate of an ingot; that conſequently the ſame piece may paſs ſeveral times under the die in the courſe of a certain number of years. This is a reflection which M. Neckar ſeems not to have made when he ſtated the money exiſting in France at ſo conſiderable a ſum. It will be known when the recoinage of the old Louis is finiſhed, what we ought to think of his calculations. But the ſum is far ſhort of 957 millions, as eſtimated by that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. It is more than probable, that it will never amount to more than two thirds of it.</p>
                     <p>At this moment, fourteen months after the arret for a new coinage, it amounts to no more than 550 millions, and every thing indicates a rapid decline.</p>

The taylor, ſhoe-maker, &amp;c. exerciſe their profeſſions in the houſe of the huſbandman who has occaſion for their commodities, and who, for the moſt part, furniſhes materials, and pays for the workmanſhip in proviſions, &amp;c.—This kind of exchange extends to many objects; each of theſe people write down what they receive and give, and at the end of the year they cloſe an account conſiſting of an infinity of articles, with a very ſmall ſum; this could not be effected in Europe, but with a great deal of money. Thus it appears, that an eaſy means of doing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſums of money is given to country people by inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in writing and arithmetic; that conſequently the ſovereign who ſhould eſtabliſh ſchools for the purpoſe of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this moſt neceſſary art and ſcience, would create a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means of circulation without the uſe of coin, and that this expence, which ſeems to alarm ſo many governments, is in fact one of the moſt lucrative ſpeculations which the treaſury could make.</note> What a vaſt field is this opened to induſtry!

them from abroad can put them. They are ſent out to ſeek materials for induſtry, new commodities, and eſpecially increaſe the number of citizens; of every ſpecies of riches this is the moſt ſure and fruitful. Thus, when gold is reduced to its exact value, that its real uſe is known, the advantageous purpoſes to which it is proper, are more juſtly calculated. It is then perceived that paper credit may have the ſame properties as gold itſelf; and to ſucceed in giving them to it, nothing more is neceſſary than to preſerve the moſt inviolable reſpect for the principles which ſupport public confidence; for upon what baſis reſts the value and general uſe of money, if it be not upon the certitude that it will be received every where in payment for things which men's wants may require, becauſe of its conventional value? Why ſhould a paper which preſents the ſame conventional value, the ſame certitude and ſolidity, be refuſed in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

               <head>CHAPTER III. Application of the foregoing general Principles to the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commerce of France and the United States.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That France has every Means of procuring a great Commerce, and thoſe which muſt aſſure it to her in the United States; that her Productions are proper for them; and that her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interior Circumſtances oblige her to engage in this Commerce.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THESE truths will not be conteſted when the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the ſoil of France ſhall be conſidered, her various and particular productions, and the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of her climate, which favours thoſe the moſt ſimple and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Theſe advantages conſtantly aſſure her workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at a lower price than thoſe of nations endowed with the ſame activity, but which have not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ſuch favourable circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Her manufactures are numerous, and her popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is conſiderable in compariſon with that of moſt other nations. Yet theſe are far from the degree to which they may be extended; for in conſidering France, room for a more extenſive population is ſoon diſcovered, and an immenſity of means for a great number of manufactures, which only wait for the will of government to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>What other nation has more activity? more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry? or unites to ſo great a degree, all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of civilization, and the matter and means of the moſt varied and extenſive interior and exterior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, independent of completion? What other
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028343_0073_0FD8AF63308E1D60"/>
would have been able to reſiſt, for ſo long a time, the chain of misfortunes, and repeated faults of which ſhe has been the victim? The force of her conſtitution, rather than her apparent proſperity, ought to be calculated by this reſiſtance. France is not what ſhe might and ought to be. There is no doubt but ſhe will become ſo if ſhe opens her eyes to her true intereſts, if, unſhackling her interior, ſhe does not neglect her exterior commerce, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that which the United States wiſh to open with her. The productions of her ſoil and induſtry are proper for them. She can export in exchange, from independent America, the raw materials for which ſhe may have occaſion. Theſe two countries may therefore carry on a <hi>direct</hi> commerce of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> between them, and ſo much the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, as the raw materials, which muſt conſtitute it, would coſt them more in any other place. Theſe truths will not be doubted when the double cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the reſpective wants of France and the United States, or of their importation and exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall have been examined.</p>
               <p>Intelligent patriots are of opinion, that it cannot be advantageous to France, in her preſent ſituation, to engage in the commerce of the United States.— They obſerve, that her manufactures being inferior to thoſe of the Engliſh, ſhe will be worſted in the American markets; they add, that inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging this commerce, government would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps act more wiſely by preventing the interior abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which ſtop the progreſs of cultivation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
               <p>I am far from denying the neceſſity there may be of ſtirring to reform ſuch abuſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to direct our efforts to culture and the improvement of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but it is eaſy to demonſtrate, that exterior commerce will in a very ſhort time infallibly bring
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028343_0074_0FD8AF6463A42540"/>
on ſuch a reform, and that France in her preſent ſtate is in the greateſt need of this exterior trade.</p>
               <p>In effect, an active and induſtrious nation, whoſe ſoil is fertile, ought always to have markets for the ſale of its commodities to animate its induſtry. Its culture and manufactures would languiſh if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of its conſumption were perceived. It is even neceſſary that theſe markets ſhould be ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; that one may ſucceed the other, in caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected events, which might cauſe a momentary change in the ordinary courſe of things.</p>
               <p>What cauſe has thrown Ireland into ſo continued a ſtate of languor, although one of thoſe countries the moſt favoured by nature, and the beſt ſituated for exterior commerce, if it is not the deprivation of that commerce? An embarraſſing exuberance of productions was feared: the cultivation of them was preſently neglected, and this negligence increaſed waſte lands. This iſland would at length have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a ſpectacle of the moſt deplorable miſery, of a complete depopulation, if, by a reſtitution of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of commerce, an end had not been put to ſo cruel a diſcouragement which choaked induſtry, by making it fear a want of markets for the vent of its productions.</p>
               <p>Let our patriots, therefore, ceaſe to look upon fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce as contrary to the reforms which are to revive our interior trade: to encourage the firſt is not to proſcribe the ſecond, becauſe one cannot ſucceed without the other. But, on the contrary, the ſeeds of activity are ſown in the latter, by extending the boundaries of conſumption.</p>
               <p>Alas! is not France evidently in need of them? Are not her magazines crouded with a ſuperfluity of the moſt neceſſary productions, for which ſhe has no market? Such as, amongſt others, her wines and brandies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the ſituation of Aunis and Saintonge—plentiful vintages are there literally feared, and theſe provinces are at this moment over-charged with wine, for which they have no exportation: the people are miſerable in the midſt of abundance. See Note, Chap. V. Sect. 1.</note> The United States offer to her an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028343_0075_0FD8AF65F386A4B0"/>
conſumption; why does ſhe refuſe to ſupply them?</p>
               <p>Even if her wines and brandies were not in ſuch ſuperfluity, it would be prejudicial not to ſupport the price of them by foreign conſumptions. The greateſt ſcourge of induſtry, and eſpecially of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, is the low price of thoſe liquors which are ſeducing by their ſtrength. On this account prudent manufacturers carefully avoid wine countries. It would be ſuperfluous to give a detail of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but certainly the politician, the moſt jealous of a free extention of individual enjoyments, will never become an advocate for the indulgence of men in thoſe articles which deprive them of their faculties and reaſon.</p>
               <p>France ought to deſire the commerce of the United States. She ought alſo to be anxious for it on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her manufactures, to employ her popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in want of work. Conſequently work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip is cheap; whence reſults indigence, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, and ſtrife.<note n="*" place="bottom">Means are every day ſought to diminiſh and prevent crimes —Let property or employ be given to thoſe who are without them: this is the ſecret—It muſt notwithſtanding be agreed, that property is preferable to employ in workſhops; under this point of view, commerce with the United States, in opening to us a great market, will be a means of diminiſhing mendicity and vices in France.</note> Work and productions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by opening new markets. Thus, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vineyards will remain, which a want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption would ſoon cauſe to be deſtroyed; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of labourers, who languiſh, will be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſociety will be increaſed by thouſands of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; more corn, more cloth, &amp;c. will be neceſſary: hence an increaſe of interior conſumption and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:028343_0076_0FD8AF6BCC606178"/>When we examine the queſtion, if exterior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce be advantageous and neceſſary to a nation; a newly conſtituted ſtate, whoſe population is far from being in proportion to its ſoil, where there is ſpace and property in land for every one, muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that which is ancient, rich in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as in men; or, to ſpeak with more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, a ſtate where the unequal diſtribution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty takes men from the fields, ſhuts them up in cities, and proſtitutes their faculties to the fancies of the rich.</p>
               <p>Certainly ſuch a new ſtate cannot increaſe its fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce before it has cleared great quantities of lands, and is become conſiderably peopled, and has a ſurplus of men and productions.</p>
               <p>Such a ſtate, while neceſſary, will undoubtedly follow this counſel.</p>
               <p>But this counſel would be improper to another ſtate, which, advanced in its civilization, covered with a population without property, having manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and money in abundance; whoſe induſtry and territorial riches wait for demands, and whoſe culture languiſhes for want of markets. A foreign commerce is neceſſary to this ſtate to vivify it.</p>
               <p>Such is the ſituation of France; neither ſoil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, activity, nor the thirſt of gain, is there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; other pernicious cauſes ſlacken her interior commerce. If the merchant has not a certainty of markets, he does not buy nor give orders; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer employs fewer hands, has leſs occaſion for the productions of the earth. Languor then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from manufactures to cultivation, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes population.</p>
               <p>The reverſe will be the caſe in the ſuppoſition of a vaſt exterior commerce, and will lead to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement even of our manufactures; for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of improving to obtain a preference will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige manufacturers to ſtudy the taſte of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028343_0077_0FD8AF6CA18C1AB0"/>
and to conform themſelves to it, to vary the productions of their induſtry; and will oblige them not to relax, that they may not be ſurpaſſed by rivals.</p>
               <p>It is here neceſſary to make ſome reflections on the general inferiority found in our manufactures, on comparing them with thoſe of the Engliſh. This fact has furniſhed Lord Sheffield with his principal argument, to maintain that America will always prefer the latter. It is neceſſary to clear up this point, which ſeems not to be well underſtood.</p>
               <p>Manufactures of luxury, of conveniency, and of neceſſity, muſt be diſtinguiſhed in a manner hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pointed out.

This will appear by the ſequel. It would be ridiculous and even dangerous to flatter the nation in this particular; the illuſion would keep it in a ſtate of mediocrity. It is for a better conſtituted patriotiſm to prove to the nation, that it may riſe above mediocrity, and to ſhew it by what means this is to be effected.

They pretend, that the ruin of republicaniſm in the United States can happen only from exterior commerce; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by great quantities of articles of luxury and a frivolous taſte, that commerce would corrupt their morals, and without pure morals a republic cannot exiſt.</p>

                  <q>Alas! what can the United States import from Europe, continues Dr. Price, except it be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I avow it, cries the Doctor, I tremble in thinking on the furor for exterior commerce, which is apparently going to turn the heads of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans. Every nation ſpreads nets around the United States, and careſſes them, in order to gain a preference; but their intereſt cautions them to beware of theſe ſeductions.</q>

               </p>
               <p>I am far from contradicting, <hi>in its baſis,</hi> the opinion of theſe politicians. Moreover, I think, with Dr. Price, that the United States will one day be able to produce every thing neceſſary and convenient; but I am alſo of opinion, that theſe two writers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the independent Americans in a falſe point of view; that they have not ſufficiently obſerved the ſtate of their circumſtances; in fine, that <hi>their circumſtances and actual wants oblige them to have recourſe to foreign commerce.</hi> This is a truth which I propoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; for I will prove that the independent Americans are in want of the neceſſaries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of life, and in ſome ſtates, of luxuries, and that their habits and nature, added to other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, will always prevent their renouncing them entirely.</p>
               <p>I will prove, that having no manufactures, they cannot themſelves ſupply theſe wants, and that they can have no manufactures for a long time to come.</p>
               <p>That although they already poſſeſſed them, they ought to prefer to national ones thoſe of exterior commerce, and that they ſhould rather invite Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028343_0082_0FD8AF7D23D124C8"/>
to their ports than frequent thoſe of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean ſtates.</p>
               <p>Finally, that by the ſame reaſon which makes it impoſſible to exclude exterior commerce, in caſe of wants which alone it can ſupply, it is equally ſo to fix its boundaries.</p>
               <p>When the nature of man is attentively conſidered, it is ſeen that it inceſſantly diſpoſes him to render his life agreeable. If he has a property, he ſtrives to improve it; if the ſoil he cultivates be fruitful, and demands but little in advance, the deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing his enjoyments ſtimulates him to torture his land to draw from it its various productions. One idea put in practice gives birth to another; one want ſatisfied creates a ſecond, to have the pleaſure of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying this alſo. Such is the nature of man; his activity, which leads him from deſires to enjoyments, from one change to another, is the ſource of what are called manufactures. A manufacture is but the means of giving to a production of the earth, a form which adds to it a new degree of agreeableneſs and utility. Want and deſire of manufactures are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the nature of man; ſo that if we ſuppoſed Europe entirely annihilated, manufactures would ſoon riſe up in America, becauſe each individual ſtrives to render his exiſtence agreeable by means the moſt ſpeedy and efficacious.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Perhaps the character and life of ſavages, who are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have no manufactures among them, will be oppoſed to theſe reaſonings? Men are deceived in judging thereby; for theſe people, which we look upon as only one degree removed from a ſtate of nature, work up and manufacture the earth's productions.

                     <p>The paſtoral life of the Arabians has conducted them one or two degrees farther in the art of manufacturing, becauſe that kind of life affords greater leiſure, and gives more uniform and conſtant productions. Thoſe ſhepherds, whoſe riches conſiſt but in their flocks, and who live on milk alone, and are clothed with their wool only, have a paſſionate deſire for coffee, ſherbet, and ſugar. The deſire of increaſing their enjoyments is the cauſe. Let it be therefore agreed, that man by his nature is inclined to enjoyment, and conſequently to manufactures.</p>

                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:028343_0083_0FD8AF7EAB0F9AF8"/>Manufactures, like the wants of civilized men, may (as was obſerved in the laſt chapter) be divided into three claſſes: 1ſt. thoſe of neceſſity; 2d. thoſe of convenience; 3d. thoſe of fancy or luxury. Food, and the natural exigencies of mankind, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the firſt claſs.</p>
               <p>It is from the wants of convenience eſpecially, that manufactures have their origin. Without doubt, ſkins of ſheep were ſufficient to defend men from the ſeverities of cold; a cabin or a hut from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature of the atmoſphere; but man is no ſooner preſerved from one evil than he ſeeks to get rid of another. Skins are inſuſceptible of being well join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; uſe makes them hard; a cabin is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown down, is confined and ſmoaky; whence ariſe the wants of conveniency, which are transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into enjoyments, whoſe accuſtomed uſe changes them into neceſſities.</p>
               <p>When man has every convenience, he then thinks of ornament. Hence the wants of luxury; they are entirely in the imagination, and procure imaginary pleaſures only. Therefore to wear any laced clothes, or drink coffee out of a china rather than a delfen cup, is a want created by luxury or fancy.</p>
               <p>The nature of theſe three kinds of want being pointed out, it is neceſſary to know what thoſe of the Americans are. They have the two firſt of them. Their habitudes contracted in their infancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from European emigrants, and their commerce with the Engliſh, have accuſtomed them to the kind of life and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028343_0084_0FD8AF8378BA4B08"/>
taſte of the latter, and it is well known that Engliſh induſtry has been particularly directed to neceſſary and uſeful arts.</p>
               <p>The independent Americans, at leaſt thoſe who inhabit great maritime cities, have borrowed from the Engliſh a taſte for luxuries; they ſeek for gauzes, blond lace, ſilks, &amp;c. It is however with pleaſure I obſerve, that if this taſte of modes has infected Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don within theſe few years, its ravages have not been extended with the ſame rapidity in the United States as in Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ope. Their ſituation, auſtere religion, morals, and ancient habits, their rural or marine life, prevent their ſeeking after elegance and dreſs, and keep them from oſtentation and voluptuouſneſs. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may perhaps be changed a few degrees, the evil is not yet ſenſible, at leaſt in the Northern States <note n="*" place="bottom">Luxury is certainly to be found in Virginia; and when we ſpeak of luxury with reſpect to free America, it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh carefully the Southern from the Northern States; cities from the country; maritime cities from interior ones. By theſe diſtinctions many contrarieties in the account of ſuperficial travel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers may be explained.</note> Therefore our obſervations ought princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to reſt upon the two firſt claſſes of wants. Now it is impoſſible that the Americans ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them; they will be perpetually led and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to them by their nature and habitudes, and by the manner in which their population is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>By their nature, becauſe they are men; and it has been proved, that man is endowed with that activity which perpetually diſpoſes him to add to his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>By their habitudes, becauſe, as it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they contracted that of all thoſe wants; and it is well known, that a taſte for pleaſure is not to be exterminated when rooted by habitude. How can it be required of man to deprive himſelf of wine and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028343_0085_0FD8AF8567103E80"/>
liquors to which he is accuſtomed, and in which he places a part of his enjoyments, except we would render him unhappy? I will not quote hermits, ſick perſons, or philoſophers, who have had that empire over themſelves; but let not a like prodigy be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a whole nation. An aſſociation of three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of philoſophers has not yet been, nor will be ſeen to confine themſelves to the regimen of Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not that we ought not to believe that one of the great means of regenerating the old people of the Continent, and of ſupporting republicaniſm in the United States, would be to give to children ſuch an education as Pythagoras exerciſed at Croto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.—SEE THE LIFE OF PYTHAGORAS.</note> or the diet of Cornaro.</p>
               <p>The ſevere ſacrifice of tea, which the independent Americans made at the beginning of the war, will perhaps be alſo quoted. The enthuſiaſm of liberty and influence of example were able, during ſome time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o overcome their habitudes;<note n="†" place="bottom">It is aſſured that abſtinence from tea was not every where faithfully obſerved, which appears very probable on reflecting that there was a party which fain would have violated it. I have known ſeveral perſons whom the deprivation of tea had made ill for a long time, although they had tried illuſive means, by ſubſtituting the infuſion of agreeable ſimples for that of the tea-leaf.</note> as religious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm has combated, ſometimes ſucceſsfully, the paſſions of an hermit. But there is no cauſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to produce a like effect, except in the criſis which makes the ſacrifice neceſſary and eaſy. The reaſon of the dependence in which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans would put themſelves with reſpect to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, and the fear of diſtant corruption, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives too feeble to carry men to that point of heroiſm! It is not ſufficiently demonſtrated to them that they cannot drink wine from Madeira without being ſome day corrupted by it, and without preparing the way for great calamities.</p>
               <p>The manner in which population is renewed and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028343_0086_0FD8AF87EBCD2E38"/>
increaſed in America, does not make it probable that its inhabitants will ever be able to renounce the want of European productions.</p>
               <p>A prodigious number of individuals emigrate every year from all parts of Europe to America, who carry with them wants and inclinations which they have from education and habit. If they find them in America, they continue to gratify them; if they are unknown there, they naturaliſe them, and it is the firſt thing they go about; for they do not ſo much perceive the new pleaſures they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enjoy, as thoſe of which they are deprived; ſo great is the force of our firſt habits and cuſtoms. Remembrance, although frequently mixed with the cruel idea of ſervitude, abandons man in the grave only.</p>
               <p>According to this inclination, natural to all men, let the immenſe variety of wants and appetites be calculated which are going to tranſplant themſelves from Europe to the United States; and let it be judged, whether it be poſſible to put bounds to or deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>To ſucceed in this, it would not only be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſhut out foreign commerce from all the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ports; American induſtry muſt be circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſource of their wants ſtopped up; it would be neceſſary to imitate the Lacedemonian law, which ordained that nothing ſhould be worked up but with the heavy hatchet, the more effectually to baniſh the luxury of elegant furniture. In a word, a miracle muſt be operated upon the Americans, to take from them all remembrance of what they have been, of all they have ſeen, ſmelt, or taſted; and the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment muſt deprive European emigrants of their ideas; as it would be abſurd to hope for a like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, <hi>the force of things,</hi> which drags the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Americans into exterior commerce, muſt be

It would be a ſmart ſtroke in politics; but this unhappily is no more than a dream.</note> All is reduced to two words: Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica has wants, and Europe has manufactures.</p>
               <p>In the United States ſome of the inhabitants fill up the leiſure afforded by agriculture (in which the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans cannot hope to become their rivals) with an attention to manufactures. And they have others confined to the moſt neceſſary arts; connected with cultivation, fiſheries, and the conſtruction of veſſels. But even theſe manufactures are but few in number, and inſufficient for the wants of the United States. They are therefore obliged to have recourſe to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. It is not that they neither have, nor can have almoſt all the raw materials employed in our own manufactures. They have hemp, flax and cotton.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The four Southern States gather great quantities of cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Their poor are clothed with it winter and ſummer. In winter they wear cotton ſhirts, and clothes of wool and cotton mixed. In ſummer their ſhirts are linen, and their outward clothes of cotton. Women's dreſs is entirely of cotton, and made up by themſelves, women of the richeſt claſs excepted; yet a woman of this claſs has a deal of cotton worked up in her houſe, and this callico equals in beauty that of Europe. Thoſe from the South furniſh a deal of cotton to the States of the North, which cannot grow it, the climate being too cold.</p>
                     <p>There is ſcarcely any part of the United States without good flour and ſaw mills. The Northern States have others for flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening iron. It is in the conſtruction of mills eſpecially, that the Americans diſtinguiſh themſelves, in varying their employ and utility, and in their diſtribution.</p>

                     <p>The Idea of property is one of the ſtrongeſt ties by which man is attached to life, to his country, to virtue, and I will add even to health.

                     <p>The labourer ſees, as he works, the poſſibility of increaſing the number of his children; and he has the pleaſing hope of leaving them after his death a little corner of earth which will keep them from indigence.</p>
                     <p>The labourer is happy becauſe his contracts are with the earth only, which gives liberally and diſintereſtedly, whilſt the intereſt of the maſter who pays the manufacturer embitters the wages which he receives.</p>

                     <p>The labourer is amiable and generous, becauſe it would be neceſſary to abandon all cultivation, if there was not between huſbandmen a reciprocity of ſervices and confidence.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it would not be difficult to prove that health and goodneſs are diminiſhed in proportion to the increaſe of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, cities, property, and the deſertion of rural life; and that vices and crimes are increaſed in the ſame proportion.</p>
                     <p>This is not the opinion of the ſenſible and intereſting author of the Study of Nature: "When I was at Moſcow," ſays he, (Vol. III.)
<q>an old Genevois, who was in that city, in the time of Peter I. told me, that ſince different means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence had been opened to the people by the eſtabliſhment of manufactures and commerce, ſeditions, aſſaſſinations, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and incendiaries, had been leſs frequent than formerly.</q>

Huſbandmen are honeſt people, ſays M. de St. Perre himſelf.—And workſhops, as I have juſt obſerved, do not offer that neceſſity of reciprocal ſervice which gives the habitude of goodneſs; they preſent intereſt ſtruggling againſt intereſt, rich and indolent ſtupidity ſtriving to cheat active indigence. If workſhops do not make men raſcals, they diſpoſe them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo; they make them egotiſts, inſenſible, uncouth, and bad fathers.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, the fact quoted by this author does not prove, that to prevent crimes, it is neceſſary to eſtabliſh manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but that it is better to have manufactures peopled with degraded workmen, than foreſts with banditti; it is a leſſer evil, but it is ſtill an evil.</p>

               <p>What is the cauſe? It has already been intimated ſo as to be foreſeen.</p>
               <p>Cities are built in all quarters;<note n="†" place="bottom">This is a great evil, as will be hereafter proved, and which will contribute more than any other to the ruin of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican ſpirit.</note> lands are cleared and eſtabliſhments made every where. In the ſtate of Kentucky, for inſtance, where, in 1771, there were ſcarcely one hundred inhabitants, there are now nearly thirty thouſand; and theſe men have emigrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from inhabited coaſts or countries. Thus hands are taken from the commerce and agriculture of theſe laſt, which is conſequently the cauſe of the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed price of workmanſhip.</p>
               <p>From this dearneſs it has been concluded in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, that the people in America were wretched; a contrary concluſion ought to have been drawn. Wherever workmen govern; wherever they are paid a high price, the people are neceſſarily happy; for it is of them that the various claſſes of workmen are compoſed.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, wherever workmanſhip is at a low price, the people are wretched; for this cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proves that there are more workmen than there is work to execute, more want of employ than can be ſupplied. This is what the rich deſire, that they may govern the workmen, and buy the ſweat of their brows at the loweſt rate poſſible.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>To be convinced of this truth, look at England and France; workmanſhip is very dear in London but cheap in Paris. The workman in London is well fed, clothed and paid; in Paris he is quite the contrary.</p>

               <p>This dearneſs of workmanſhip is prejudicial to manufactures, and ſtill ſo much the better. Theſe eſtabliſhments are ſo many tombs which ſwallow up generations entire.<note n="*" place="bottom">There are ſeveral manufactures at Amiens, and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the hoſpitals are more filled with manufacturers than with maſons or other like artizans. A manufacturing life makes more people ill and their complaints more dangerous; it is becauſe this kind of workmen becomes ſooner debauched, and goes ſooner to the hoſpital, being moſtly ſingle, and without any domeſtic attachment.</note> Agriculture, on the contrary, perpetually increaſes population.</p>
               <p>By preventing, or at leaſt retarding the riſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures within their provinces, the Americans will ſtop the decadency of morals and public ſpirit: for if manufactures bring gold into the States, they bring at the ſame time a poiſon which undermines them. They reſemble a number of individuals whoſe nature and morals are at once corrupted: they form and accuſtom men to ſervitude, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Therefore the independent Americans will do wiſely to leave to Europe the care of manufacturing for them, becauſe ſhe is irreſiſtibly dragged into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; and as their population and conſumption muſt rapidly increaſe, it is not impoſſible that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope may one day confine herſelf to this kind of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and that America may one day become her ſtorehouſe of grain and raw materials, of which ſhe will not be in need. In this caſe nothing will
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028343_0093_0FD8AF991C7C6F48"/>
be ſeen in Europe but cities and workſhops; in inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent America nothing but fields well cultivated. I will leave it to be decided which country would have the moſt happy fate.</p>
               <p>Under the ſame point of view, the independent Americans will ſtill act wiſely by leaving it to the Europeans to furniſh them with neceſſary articles; and in ſeldom frequenting the cities and ſea-ports of the ancient continent. In effect, an European tranſported to independent America is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of one to one hundred, and ſometimes to a thouſand.—His example has therefore but very little influence; the luxury of which he makes a parade in paſſing by, excites leſs conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or reſpect than contempt and ridicule. If he leaves a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of himſelf, it is ſoon effaced by the general motion: there are, moreover, ſome Europeans, who, ſtruck and edified by the manners and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of free America, have good ſenſe enough to reſpect and conform themſelves to them.</p>
               <p>It is the reverſe when an American goes on ſhore in Europe, almoſt alone, with his ſimplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the midſt of a vortex of men who eſteem the eclat of exterior appearance only; who, agitated and led by the general ton, ſacrifice every thing to the furor of making a great figure by the brilliance of dreſs, equipage, and pomp: this American muſt at firſt be torn down and tormented, becauſe he finds himſelf thrown into a circle of habitudes contrary to his own. Afterwards he becomes familiariſed by little and little, and if he does not quite get a taſte for them, at leaſt his attachment to a ſimplicity of life and manners is neceſſarily weakened. Carrying back with him to his own country this diſpoſition of mind, he introduces it inſenſibly into the minds of thoſe who are about him, upon which it has ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence—upon the minds of his children and friends. Their taſte for ſimplicity becomes lukewarm by his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028343_0094_0FD8AF9CF6484550"/>
example, and the following age ſees public virtues fall into indifference.</p>
               <p>It will be leſs dangerous to the public ſpirit of the independent Americans to admit the Europeans into the United States, than to go themſelves into Europe; from which it reſults that it would be very impolitic to encourage the former to become the carriers of their exterior commerce.</p>
               <p>I have inſiſted upon this reflection becauſe there ſeems to have appeared in ſome States a diſpoſition to give premiums for diſtant navigation. They ought to reflect, that they have but few hands, and that as few as poſſible ſhould be taken from culture. They are in the ſituation I have ſpoken of in my principles of exterior commerce, where a nation gains by making carriers of others having leſs ſoil or employ. They ſhould alſo recollect, that republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can morals are better preſerved in the boſom of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture than upon the ſea and in foreign voyages, which give to men communications with other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and governments.</p>
               <p>It is a general queſtion in the United States, by what means it is poſſible to put bounds to exterior commerce, and ſtop the progreſs of luxury: ſtay at home,—cultivate, cultivate, I will repeat to them; this is the ſecret whereby you will prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of luxury; a ſecret much preferable to ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary laws and prohibitory regulations, which ſome ſtates have it in contemplation to make.</p>
               <p>There is no power great enough to ſet, by regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch boundaries to exterior commerce as will not be exceeded: to circumſcribe it, for inſtance, to merchandizes of convenience, without the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe of luxury. The nature or force of things only has ſuch a power. That force has, as has been before explained, the union of the natural circumſtances of a nation; theſe circumſtances alone mark the limits of commerce. A nation which
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028343_0095_0FD8AF9E64CD3BF0"/>
cannot pay for luxuries with its own production, does not purchaſe them. The ſavage can only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure with his furs, brandy, gunpowder, and woollen coverings; he buys neither ſilks nor laces.</p>
               <p>If, therefore, the productions of the United States be ſcarcely ſufficient to pay for the importations of neceſſity and convenience from Europe, merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes of luxury will not be imported: if theſe be carried to it, 'tis becauſe it can pay for them. There is no merchant who likes to ruin himſelf.</p>
               <p>If, on the contrary, the United States have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions proper for the ancient continent, in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities ſufficient to procure, by their exchange, not only the moſt neceſſary and convenient things, but even thoſe of luxury, nothing can hinder the latter from being ſooner or later imported, by means of exterior commerce.</p>
               <p>In truth, to increaſe demands of this nature, the public opinion, which before treated opprobriouſly a taſte for modes, muſt totally change, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular opinions of certain ſects equally yield to it.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the powerful influence of opinion upon merchandizes of luxury, the fate of this kind of commerce will be more particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the ſtate of the independent Americans, for when rich they will adopt them. This fact will appear certain, if what has been ſaid on the nature of the human heart be recollected, and its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to improve man's ſituation, and to increaſe his enjoyments.</p>
               <p>Taſte for a rural life alone, if the Americans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, will retard the progreſs of luxury, which ſprings up in cities, from ſatiety, want of ſomething to do, and from laſſitude: employment preſerves the country from thoſe moral ills.</p>
               <p>There is one laſt conſideration, which ought to perſuade the independent Americans to employ themſelves in cultivation, and reject both manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028343_0096_0FD8AFA06028D960"/>
and exterior tranſports; which is, that in wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undertake every thing at once, the ſcarcity of money, neceſſary at leaſt for the mechanical part of theſe operations, will always be more perceived, whilſt, by giving themſelves up entirely to cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will procure from their ſoil productions ſufficient to pay for theſe manufactures from Europe, and to make up for the ſcarcity of coin.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The independent Americans have but little money; this ſcarcity ariſes from two cauſes; firſt, from the kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce they heretofore carried on with England, and afterwards from the ravages of a ſeven years war. As this commerce was purely one of exchange, and that in certain ſtates, as Virginia, the importations always ſurpaſſed the exportations; the reſult was, that they could not but be debtors to England, and could not draw money from that iſland.</p>
                     <p>It was a kind of commercial ſervitude, which the Engliſh looked upon as the pledge and guarantee of the dependence of the Colonies upon the mother country.</p>
                     <p>The money they had came from their illicit commerce with the Sugar Iſlands and European powers. The war, afterwards, by changing labourers into ſoldiers, cauſed a part of their lands to remain without cultivation. From that time exchanges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and money decreaſed. The little of it remaining in America, came firſt from money carried and expended there by the Engliſh and French armies, and afterwards by the loans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociated in Europe by Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>But it is eaſy to conceive, after what has been ſaid upon the quantity of coin, how a nation, which, by an extraordinary revolution, is all at once widely developed, its population ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly increaſed, and is thereby obliged to continual advances, for clearing of lands, for building, making of roads and canals, to pay foreign debts, moſtly in ſpecie, and which has no mines, muſt feel the ſcarcity of money, and the reaſon of it is clear: the want of it is at preſent ſupplied, in Connecticut, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of commodities, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>They appear to be alarmed at this; what has been ſaid upon the ſubject of money ought to remove their fears. It has been demonſtrated that a nation may carry on a very conſiderable commerce without its aid. It will hereafter be ſeen that the United States produce many raw materials eſſentially neceſſary to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028343_0097_0FD8AFA1DF7A6D08"/>
France, and that ſhe can make their exports with greater advantage than thoſe of any other country.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that theſe two countries may carry on together a direct trade of exchange without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, conſequently an advantageous one; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change between them of productions is more lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than an exchange of productions for money; although this opinion may not be adopted by men in general, who attach a greater price to gold than to merchandize, and continually forget its repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive value, to ſubſtitute for it a real one. It muſt be inceſſantly repeated to them that money would be abſolutely nothing without productions; that a rich people is that which, by its induſtry, increaſes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and has conſequently an abundance of productions; that the ſecret of increaſing the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of coin conſiſts only in the art of multiplying neceſſary productions, and it is this to which the United States ought to incline, without being anxious about the money which they may have at preſent or in future.</p>
               <p>Let us reſume the different queſtions contained in this chapter.</p>
               <p>My object has been to make it appear that the United States were forced by their neceſſity and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to engage in exterior commerce.</p>
               <p>To convince my readers of this, I have proved that the independent Americans had wants of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of convenience, and even ſome of luxury, which they could neither renounce nor ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with.</p>
               <p>That having no manufactures of their own, they were obliged to have recourſe to thoſe of Europe: that they could eſtabliſh none for a long time, having but few hands, and that cultivation ought to employ all their cares.</p>
               <p>That according to phyſical, political, and moral relations, they ought to perſevere in applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028343_0098_0FD8ADB6AC0EBB78"/>
to agriculture alone, and even give up all thoughts of tranſporting to Europe, by their own means, their proper productions.</p>
               <p>That this was the only means of preſerving their republican morals, and of retarding the progreſs of luxury.</p>
               <p>In fine, that by engaging in agriculture, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting manufactures, they will leſs perceive the want of money, and will find the means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that want, and of carrying on a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous exterior commerce of exchange of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>Theſe different points being firmly eſtabliſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE attentive reader will have already been able to judge, that if the independent Americans do not deviate from the career which is open to them, Europe will, for a long time, have to furniſh them with manufactured merchandize. It has been made to appear, that the clearing and cultivation of lands, and all that relates to inferior commerce, ſuch as roads and canals, offered to their induſtry the moſt

                  <head>SECTION I. Wines.</head>
                  <p>Wine becomes a real want of thoſe who have once been acquainted with it. Happy or miſerable, rich or poor, every body makes uſe of wine. Wine is the delight of the happy or of the rich: it helps the unfortunate to ſupport his ſorrow; the poor think they find it an equivalent for the food they are without.</p>
                  <p>Eaſe has lately been too general in the United States, not to have introduced the uſe of wine; and futurity, by augmenting their means, will only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their want of this liquor.</p>
                  <p>The wines which were moſt generally conſumed in the United States, were, as in England, Oporto, Madeira, and ſome from Spain. French wines, charged as in Britain, with enormous duties, were introduced by contraband only.</p>
                  <p>Liberty has cauſed thoſe Britannic ſhackles to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028343_0100_0FD8ADBCE998E148"/>
French wines are freely imported into the United States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pay but little duty.</p>
                  <p>Such is the ſtate of things, and it leads me to the dicuſſion of three queſtions:</p>
                  <p>Does it ſuit the United States to cultivate vines, and to make wine?</p>
                  <p>Ought they not, in renouncing this cultivation, to give the preference to French wines?</p>
                  <p>And what means ought the French to uſe, in order to obtain and preſerve this preference?</p>
                  <p>It would be abſurd to deny that the United States can produce wine, becauſe the experiments hitherto made have been fruitleſs. Extended as they are, and having countries as ſouthern as Europe, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould not be, in many places, a ſoil proper for the vine.</p>
                  <p>The little ſucceſs of attempts may therefore, without hazarding too much, be attributed either to the ignorance of the cultivator, his want of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, or a bad choice of plants.</p>
                  <p>However that may be, if the Americans will hearken to the counſels of able obſervers, and reap advant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ge from the errors of other nations, they will carefully avoid the cultivation of vines. In every country where they have been cultivated, for one rich man, they have made a number wretched.</p>
                  <p>The long and conſiderable advances which vines require, the preparation, preſervation, and ſale of their produce, have put all the good vineyard plots into the hands of rich people, who not cultivating theſe themſelves, pay the real cultivator very badly. The ſalary of the wretched vine-dreſſer is every where inevitably fixed; the time he does not work not being calculated, and few wine countries offer any employ by which loſt time may be filled up; and otherwiſe, the variations in the prices of the moſt neceſſary commodities occaſioned by a thouſand
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028343_0101_0FD8ADBE3B2A0EA0"/>
cauſes, by the abundance or even ſcarcity of wine, are not conſidered for him.</p>
                  <p>Would it be believed, that abundance is the moſt unfortunate thing that can happen, either to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor or the vine-dreſſer? In fact, the expence of gathering augments, and the price of the thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes.

Too much wine in the time of abundance, no bread in that of ſcarcity; theſe are the two alternatives which divide his life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore countries covered with vineyards are generally leſs peopled, and preſent a picture of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, weak, and wretched population. For the moſt part they want hands to cultivate the vineyard in a ſeaſon when work cannot be delayed. It is done by theſe bands of ſtrangers, of whom I have
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028343_0103_0FD8ADC442D91488"/>
already ſpoken, and who come to ſell ſome days work to the poor vine-dreſſer.</p>
                  <p>The cultivation of a vineyard cannot be better compared than to thoſe manufactures, of which the hopes of ſucceſs are founded upon the low price of workmanſhip, and which enrich none but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, and retailers or ſhopkeepers.</p>
                  <p>The pernicious influence of the vine is extended, in wine countries, to even thoſe who do not cultivate it; for the cheapneſs of wine leads to exceſſes, and conſequently it becomes a poiſon for all ranks of ſociety, for thoſe eſpecially who find in it a means of forgetting their ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, as I have already remarked, induſtry carefully avoids theſe dangerous vineyard plots. None of the great manufactures, whoſe ſucceſs is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of order, aſſiduity, and labour, are ſeen in the neighbourhood of them.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all theſe obſervations is, that the Americans ought to proſcribe the cultivation of the vine.</p>
                  <p>It would infallibly render miſerable that claſs of ſociety which ſhould apply itſelf to it, and in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public there ſhould be none who are wretched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe want obliges them to diſturb civil order, or, what is worſe, becauſe they are at the command of the rich, by whom they are paid, and who may make uſe of them to deſtroy republicaniſm.<note n="*" place="bottom">The mean language of ſhopkeepers, who humbly offer their merchandize, has already begun to find its way into the American papers.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſidered with reſpect to the proprietors, the vine ought ſtill to be proſcribed by the United States; becauſe every profeſſion or calling, ſuſceptible of too great a variation of fortune, which ſometimes heaps up riches to one perſon, and at other reduces to indigence individuals in eaſy circumſtances, ought
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028343_0104_0FD8ADC5C3642DE8"/>
carefully to be avoided.—Economy, ſimplicity, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate virtues, are not attached to ſuch changeableneſs.</p>
                  <p>They are found in the boſom of mediocrity only, from eaſineſs of circumſtances, founded upon that kind of toil whoſe produce is conſtant.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Indians are almoſt all cultivators or weavers, which is the reaſon why private morals have been better preſerved among theſe people than any where elſe, in ſpite of the exceſſes of deſpotiſm.</note> Such is that of agriculture in general; it embraces divers productions, which, in caſe of accident, replace each other.<note n="†" place="bottom">What recompence would be conſiderable enough for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man, who ſhould give to humanity the means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving potatoes for ſeveral years, eſpecially if the proceſs were ſimple and not expenſive? In that caſe want would be no longer feared. The embarraſſment about the legiſlation of corn would diſappear, and miſery perhaps be driven from among men.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, if it be inſiſted that wine is neceſſary to man, let it not ſtupify him; it ſhould be uſed with moderation, and its dearneſs alone may oblige men to be moderate in the uſe of it. It being greatly the intereſt of the American Republics to remove all exceſſes from individuals, in order to prevent this degeneracy, they ought to keep perpetually at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from them a production, whoſe dearneſs will prevent the abuſe of it, whoſe cultivation would render it cheap, and conſequently bring on dangerous exceſſes both to policy and morals.<note n="‡" place="bottom">It will be objected, that men employed in agriculture have need of wine to ſupport them in their labour. This is but an opinion: there are found, in countries where it is leaſt uſed, vigorous and indefatigable men. In truth, wine contains an active ſpirit which may ſupply the want of ſubſtantial aliment, and it is for this reaſon the peaſants have recourſe to wine or brandy, which is more within their reach.

                  <p>This inſtitution, eaſy to be naturalized in France, would have two branches, a depoſit in the public magazines of the productions of the earth; certificate or billets of depoſit which would form an authentic title for the diſpoſing proprietor, transferable without formalities at the current price, like all other public effects.</p>

See what the aſtoniſhing Miniſter, who is now at the head of affairs, propoſes to hinder the intervention and influence of the Engliſh govermnent in the new plan of redemption of the public effects and of their decreaſe.

that a chymiſt ought not to be a chymiſt only, but a politician alſo.</p>

The genealogy of almoſt all crimes is—no property or want of employ—cauſe of wretchedneſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—wretchedneſs the cauſe of drunkenneſs—drunkenneſs the cauſe of quarrels, of idleneſs, of miſery, of thefts. Thefts cauſe impriſonment and capital puniſhments.</p>
                        <p>The firſt link only to which a defect of property is attached, remains to be remarked. It is not neceſſary to name it. But it ariſes from this genealogy, that in the actual order of things; the people being drawn into vices and crimes, are leſs culpable than they are imagined; conſequently they ought not to be ſo ſeverely puniſhed, and that government ſhould ſuppreſs too ſevere pains. This truth cannot be too often repeated, and it ought to be joined to every circumſtance when opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, ſeeing that the liſt of bloody executions is every where augmented, and that narrow minds, which ſee the atrocity only of the crime, without perceiving its cauſe, inceſſantly demand blood for expiation. There would be but few ſcaffolds if none but real criminals mounted them.</p>

                  <p>The exportation of brandies is prejudicial to the conſumption of our wines, for it is the baſis of all made wines in countries where wine is not produced. It is put into a great quantity of water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which are added bay-berries, every where to be found. Wine brandies are indiſpenſable in this fabrication; no other can ſupply their place, becauſe they only can give to artificial wines the winy taſte which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to make them drinkable.</p>
                  <p>What immenſe gain to ſtrangers in this proceſs— and what loſs to France! A barrel of brandy which pays a trifling duty on exportation, whoſe tranſport coſts but little, on account of its contracted bulk, may be added to five or ſix barrels of water, which coſt nothing, and by the aid of ſugared ingredients, which give colours, may enter into competition with ſix barrels of wine, that pay conſiderable duties on exportation, and whoſe exportation and tranſport are very expenſive.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, in diſtilling and exporting brandies, we work for the intereſt of our rivals: we give them an eaſy means of doing without our wines. What

                  <p>And yet this operation, ſo prejudicial to France, has been favoured by government. It encourages diſtillers; that is, it raiſes up enemies againſt the meliorating vineyards and wines, and eſpecially againſt the art of preſerving the latter.

                  <p>The firſt ſpecies contains linen properly ſo called; that is to ſay, linen which ſerves to make ſhirts, ſheets, table linen, and all the linen made uſe of for every purpoſe of cleanlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe linens are made with hemp, flax, or cotton; this laſt article is employed when the two former ones are ſcarce: it is ſometimes mixed with flax.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028343_0119_0FD8ADEB68F40628"/>The manner of making theſe linens is very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they are made in all parts of Europe.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>If there be a country where the manufacture of linens is encouraged, it is in Ireland, particularly ſince its reſurrection into the political world. Parliament has eſtabliſhed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee which is particularly employed about this manufacture, and which grants very conſiderable ſuccours to manufacturers. There is one who has obtained more than thirty thouſand pounds ſterling from government, and whoſe manufacture employs two thouſand men and women, and ſix hundred children.</p>
                        <p>This committee names inſpectors to examine the ſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and afterwards to make reports, or give a general deſcription of their ſituation, of the number of workmen they employ, of their produce, reſources, wants, &amp;c.<note n="‖" place="bottom">When theſe inſpectors are honeſt, and men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their reports are evidences of ſucceſs. Then example has a ſingular influence upon induſtry.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Still more has been done in Ireland, to encourage the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of linen; great edifices have been built, and deſtined to receive them, as well as thoſe who come to offer them for ſale. The moſt conſiderable market being at Dublin, three or four times a year, linen merchants from the North, who have bleach-yards, come to Dublin with their aſſortments. They find in theſe edifices, places for their linens and for themſelves to lodge in, all at no expence.—They meet Engliſh buyers or others, who go there to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ther together all their purchaſes.—Like depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories are eſtabliſhed in the North; they are eſſentially neceſſary to thoſe manufactures, the articles of which are gathered in the country.—Where they exiſt, expences are leſs, and work is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paid for.</p>
                     </note> Thoſe countries where religious or political deſpotiſm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourages induſtry; where the numerous inſtitutions of charity, invented to divert the attention of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair from miſery, nouriſh idleneſs; theſe countries are the only ones wherein this manufacture does not merit the attention of the political obſerver.</p>
                  <p>Every where elſe, the country people employ, more or leſs, the leiſure which their kind of life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them to ſpin and weave linen. Moſt of the farmers and proprietors who enjoy a little eaſe, or who are not afraid of letting it appear, ſow hemp or flax, and draw from their ſoil and the work of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028343_0120_0FD8ADECA339DE38"/>
their hands the linen which covers their bodies and ſupplies their family.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh have added other cauſes to thoſe which produce low-priced workmanſhip: their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing induſtry, their obſerving genius, their ever calculating mind, have invented for the ſpinning, &amp;c. of cotton, and for weaving, ſeveral machines which ſtill ſurpaſs the cheapneſs to be expected from the leiſure of the inhabitants of the country.</p>
                  <p>As theſe machines are inſenſibly introduced into countries, it may be expected that the low price of linen-drapery will be every where eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the multiplication of theſe machines, nations which groan under a bad govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or are grown ruſty in old and wretched habits, will always depend, for that article of neceſſity, upon thoſe which have eſtabliſhed bounds to their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but none for their induſtry, which muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly increaſe.</p>
                  <p>It reſults from theſe facts, that the United States will always have, in proportion to the increaſe of their population and culture, leſs recourſe to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for that principal kind of linen-drapery whoſe manufacture is ſo well aſſociated with the labours of the field.<note n="*" place="bottom">The American women are renowned for their induſtry in the conduct of their houſen; they ſpin a great deal of wool or flax; they would loſe their reputation and be deſpiſed, if their whole family were not almoſt entirely clothed with the cloth and linen made in the houſe—if the whole interior of their ruſtic habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not bear evident marks of their cleanlineſs and induſtry.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Very fine linens muſt be excepted: they are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for luxury, and the individuals employed in manufacturing them are condemned to vegetate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably in cities, rolling perpetually in the ſame circle of mechanical labours.<note n="†" place="bottom">Manufactures are much boaſted of, becauſe children are employed therein from their moſt tender age; that is to ſay, that men congratulate themſelves upon making early martyrs of theſe innocent creatures; for is it not a torment to theſe poor little beings, whom nature commands us to permit to take the air and their ſports, until they are of riper years, and their ſtrength is become conſiderable—Is it not a torment to them to be a whole day, and almoſt every day of their lives, employed at the ſame work, in an obſcure and infected priſon? Muſt not the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vexation which they ſuffer, obſtruct the opening of their phyſical and intellectual faculties, and ſtupify them? Muſt not there reſult from this a degenerate race, inclined to automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſm and ſlavery? For moſt manufactures require no other than mechanical labours, which a machine would perform as well as a man. It is therefore impoſſible that a man condemned to this kind of employ ſhould not become a machine; and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and ſervitude are joined to each other.—Theſe truths can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too often repeated, not to diſguſt the Europeans with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The United States, where laborious individuals may with ſo much facility become proprietors, are far from that degradation; and if they are wiſe, they will have, for a long time, the happineſs not to ſee ſpun or woven among them, any of thoſe delicate kinds of thread and fine linens, which, ſought after and bought up by the opulent, are the real produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of European miſery.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſpecies of linens contains what is more properly called linen-drapery; that is to ſay, cloth made of thread of different colours, whether flax, or cotton; or theſe two ſubſtances mixed with others.</p>
                  <p>The greater part of this drapery requires too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated a proceſs, too varied an apparatus, too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a labour, to be manufactured otherways than in thoſe particular eſtabliſhments, ſituated from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the neighbourhood of cities, and which have no affinity with a rural life.</p>
                  <p>The art of making well the tiſſue, of mixing the colours, of contraſting them, of imaginary agreeable

deſigns, of preparing the linen when it is finiſhed, &amp;c. this art, extenſive, varied and delicate, requires the greateſt attention. The moſt important thing is to do a great deal in it at a little expence, and it is the point to which the Engliſh are arrived, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that kind generally known under the name of printed callico.</p>
                  <p>This will be for a long time a conſiderable article of commerce, between Europe and the United States, which conſumes a great deal of it; and it is an article wherein French induſtry, left to its natural force, and not being reſtrained by any obſtacle, need not fear competition.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Sheffield maintains in his work, that France has not even linen enough for her own conſumption. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial dictionary, printed at Lyons in 1763, aſſures on the contrary, that France ſends a great deal abroad. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of the dictionary ſpoke truth, he might be anſwered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the author of Les Etudes de la Nature—
<q>Of what uſe is it to a ſtate to clothe foreign nations, when one's own people are quite naked?</q>
—Theſe two writers may be made to agree, by ſaying that France, reſtored to her energy, would eaſily furniſh linens to foreigners and her own citizens, and that various interior cauſes have hithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>to prevented her from doing it.</note> In this, as in moſt other articles, the nature of things is entirely in favour of France, and ſucceſs depends wholly on the will of her government.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1785 the government of France in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, by an arret, foreign manufacturers of theſe linens to come and ſettle in France.</p>
                  <p>But this invitation is not made in terms ſufficiently clear, or flattering, to induce ſtrangers to come and ſettle amongſt us; eſpecially not ſuch as have a little energy and elevation in their characters, and it is of theſe alone that we are in need.</p>
                  <p>Among different favours granted them, there is one which entitles them to the <hi>enjoyment of their ſtate or profeſſion, and of their uſages; in that which ſhall not be contrary to the laws of the kindom, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="89" facs="unknown:028343_0123_0FD8ADF42863B4D8"/>But what ſignifies all the vague expreſſions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, of ſtate and profeſſion, liberty and uſages? What ſtate is here ſpoken of? Is it of the political, civil, religious, or domeſtic ſtate? Engliſhmen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Americans, have a political ſtate, a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical liberty, that is, a right to take part in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of public affairs: is this ſtate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? Is the liberty of having a temple for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for marriage according to that communion, underſtood by the liberty of uſages? Why are not theſe uſages ſpecified?</p>
                  <p>And above all, what ſignifies theſe words, <hi>in that which ſhall not be contrary to the laws of the kingdom.</hi> If they convey a clear meaning, do they not completely deſtroy the preceding favours granted? or, at leaſt, do not they leave a great uncertainty upon that which is or is not granted?</p>
                  <p>Why is not a language clear and without evaſion made uſe of, eſpecially in treating with ſtrangers? Inſtead of an equivocal jargon, dangerous in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe it produces miſtruſt, and may give an opening for deceit, why not ſay to them in clear terms, "If you come within our ſtates, accompanied by your wives and children,—if you bring your manufactures, if you eſtabliſh yourſelves among us, you ſhall enjoy all the rights of our ſubjects? Theſe rights are, to poſſeſs property in the fulleſt ſecurity, and not to be deprived of it but by the laws, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, &amp;c. If you fix your abode among us, your children will, without obſtacle, be your heirs: you ſhall alſo preſerve your religious opinions. When there ſhall be a certain number of you, you ſhall have a temple wherein to worſhip, according to your own manner, the Everlaſting Father; and you ſhall have miniſters, and hold aſſemblies; ſhall intermarry according to your rules, &amp;c. If France be not agreeable to you, nothing, abſolutely nothing, ſhall hinder you from leaving it, and carrying with you
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028343_0124_0FD8ADF662F84158"/>
your riches." It ſhall be told that all this was meant to be ſaid by the arret: it was neceſſary then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it clearly, and why were theſe obſcure words added,—<hi>in that which ſhall not be contrary to the laws of the kingdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How ſhould a German, an Italian, an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſhould be tempted to eſtabliſh themſelves in France, be acquainted with your ancient laws and ordinances? Will they turn over your innumerable folios? Certainly they will not, they will ſtay at home; you will therefore have failed in your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. On the other hand, do not they know that a century ago, and ever ſince that time, thouſands of ordinances were, and have been made againſt the Calviniſts, and that theſe ordinances are not yet repealed? Ought not they to be afraid that theſe would be brought forth againſt them if they gave the leaſt offence? They will remain at home, and once more you have miſſed your aim.</p>
                  <p>It is the more neceſſary for monarchies not to diſguiſe under a captious form the advantages by which they ſeek to entice ſtrangers; as free ſtates; ſuch as Ireland and Independent America, do not ſubject emigrants to any capitulation or conſtraint: they offer them all the rights of citizens the moment they ſet their feet on free ground: and what rights! In Ireland that of voting at elections; in the United States, that of being elected themſelves; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the moſt ſeducing right, becauſe it is the moſt proper one to maintain the dignity of a man who has dignity; the moſt proper to give it to him who has it not.</p>
                  <p>When a nation perceives the neceſſity of enticing ſtrangers to ſettle in it, nothing ought to be ſpared, eſpecially in ſtates far advanced in civilization.</p>
                  <p>It is a means of regenerating morals, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to regenerate them, and eſpecially to encourage
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028343_0125_0FD8ADF7DF6F2E20"/>
induſtry; for in order to exiſt in a ſtrange land, and to gain in it conſideration and confidence, emigrants are forced to have good morals, probity, and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Their example cannot but have a ſalutary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the nation which receives them into its boſom.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, having opinions, habitudes, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, different from thoſe of that nation, they may help it to break its bad cuſtoms, to give it a greater extent in its views, more coſmopolitiſm, or of that character proper for approaching nations to each other, and for diminiſhing national antipathies.</p>
                  <p>When the advantages which a country acquires by ſtrangers who fix themſelves in it are conſidered, it is aſtoniſhing to ſee governments think ſo little about them, and frequently not to reſpect their rights: They ought, on the contrary, to protect a ſtranger ſo much the more as he ſeems leſs ſupported by the laws than a citizen; that he is unacquainted with them; that he may eaſily be the victim of artifice and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canery; that it frequently happens that he does not underſtand the language; finally, that being alone, he has neither family, friends, nor patrons.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation, the ſtranger ought to be envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned by the ſafeguard of a particular adminiſtration, which ſhould watch over his ſafety; but it is the reverſe of this in many ſtates.<note n="*" place="bottom">If a ſtranger be ſuſpected, few examinations are made; he is arreſted—liberty is left to a citizen; or at leaſt he is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mildly; the ſtranger is impriſoned: the ſubaltern, inſolent by reaſon of the indifference of his ſuperiors, treats him with ſeverity: for what is there to fear from him? Is the word with them all,—ſet at liberty—will that ſtranger go and make the temple of chicane ring with his complaints? He fears, leſt it may be a new foreſt,—he flies, curſing that inhoſpitable country.</note>

                  <p>Thus, whilſt we ſee in thoſe ſtates who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their intereſts better, Frenchmen direct the

The duty appears moderate, yet the manufacturers are ſenſibly injured by it; moreover it reſtrains them, in ſubjecting them to the caprices of revenue clerks; and this does not prevent fraud; therefore, to prevent the manufacturer from being robbed, his money is taken from him, and the robbery ſtill taken place; he would prefer being l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſtill more certain that the conſumption of ſilks does not, at preſent, form there a conſiderable article; that it will augment but very ſlowly, and in a manner almoſt inſenſible. The Americans ought undoubtedly to be congratulated upon it. Their manners will be good and ſimple as long as they do not contract a want of theſe articles; but if they do not want them for themſelves, they will have occaſion for them to form branches of their ſmuggling commerce with the Spaniards. Nature invites them to carry on this commerce in an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous manner, both by ſea and land.<note n="†" place="bottom">This commerce will be better eſtabliſhed by land—The riſks there will be leſs—The great rivers which water thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe countries will ſavour it.

Hats, purely of beaver, do not wear well, and are inconvenient on account of their weight. The fineſt, handſomeſt, and beſt hats, contain but little of the fur of that animal, which we eſteem at too high a price, when we think of the loſs of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada. Wool, the furs of the hares and rabbits; the hair of goats, which, in fact, is wool, and camels hair, are more neceſſary for making of hats than the fur of beavers.</p>
                  <p>The few hats made of beaver in the United States will be ſufficient for their conſumption.—The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans muſt, however, be inceſſantly told this great truth, that manufactures are not proper for them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in thoſe articles which are immediately aſſociated with agriculture, and which facilitate its operations. That of hats is not of this kind.</p>
                  <p>Europe will therefore furniſh hats to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. And of what great importance is this object, when the rapid increaſe of their population is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered? It may be affirmed, that every nation ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſending them out merchandize, will ſend them hats; but thoſe of France will have the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

                  <p>French hats are always the beſt fulled and dyed, and the moſt agreeable. When government ſhall have reſolved to do for wools that which it has done for mulberry trees, the manufacture of hats will be ſo much the more advantageous, as we ſhall be leſs

Why is there in this leather-work of all kinds that neatneſs, that ſeducing appearance, which we have not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached? It muſt be repeated, that in England men honour the profeſſion of a tanner, and pride themſelves upon it, whilſt it is the contrary in France. An Engliſh tanner, ſhoemaker, or ſaddler, does not quit his trade when he is rich; but makes his riches ſerve, in proportion as they augment, to give luſtre to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The leather which comes from the tanneries whoſe owner is in eaſy circumſtances, is always well prepared, becauſe he can advance ſums of money, and give to hides the time neceſſary for their progreſs through his tan-yard. A poor tanner is always preſſed by his wanting to take the leather out of the tan-pit, where it is neceſſary it ſhould remain a long time to acquire a good quality. In general, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with this penury, unknown to the Engliſh, that there ſhould be time to manufacture or fabricate good merchandize. Thoſe who employ the leather, acquire no reputation in their profeſſions but in proportion to great proviſions made before hand, which puts it in their power to furniſh nothing but leather improved by being kept. It will be aſked, how the wholeſale dealers manage when they begin buſineſs? They find credit, if in their apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,

which precede their eſtabliſhments, they have acquired a good reputation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>We may readily perceive, that this hope of being ſome day well eſtabliſhed with great ſuccours, is worth all the books of morality. The engravings of Hogarth, which repreſent the fate of the idle apprentice, paint, to the life, Engliſh manners. The intention of the workman is not to become SECRETAIRE DU ROI.<note n="‖" place="bottom">A petty title of bought diſtinction, which, in the language of ridiculous pride, is conſtrued into nobility.</note> He marries the daughter of the good maſter who has brought him up, and ſucceeds him in the ſame buſineſs which he has contributed to extend.</p>
                        <p>It is not that the French tanner, who barters his profeſſion againſt a brevet of Secretaire du Roi, or commiſſary of war, ought to be blamed. He reaſons well. He ſees that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is attached to talents and induſtry, and he delays not to buy himſelf a title. It is therefore wrong to joke merchants and artizans, who, for money, get themſelves enregiſtered in a privileged claſs. It is an evil to the ſtate, but it is not the fault of thoſe who purchaſe. The fault is due to the kind of diſgrace from which government has not yet delivered the ignoble.</p>
                        <p>It ought to be obſerved here, how fatal the ſpeculation which eſtabliſhed this order of things has been to the nation. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure money, offices were created; which, by ennobling, induces the ignoble to purchaſe them; they are diſguſted with their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by being diſhonoured, and for a few millions of livres, which this pitiful operation ſlowly procures, commerce is ruined by having its capital diminiſhed: that commerce, which, by being ſupported, would continually produce millions to the ſtate.</p>

                  <p>Such is the art of the Engliſh to ſupport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their commerce in every thing, and every where. If we could put it in practice, all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of leather would ſoon equal the perfection of theirs, ſince we do not otherwiſe want materials.

The conſiderable duties impoſed ſucceſſively upon leather (ſuppreſſed afterwards in part through prudence) and eſſentially the ſevere inſpection that the COMMIS (in this caſe a kind of exciſeman) may make every hour of the day and night at the tanners. Nothing diſguſts a man, who has ſome energy, more with his profeſſion, than this diſgraceful ſervitude, than the fear, than the conſtraint which ariſes from the idea of being diſturbed at every moment, by his fire-ſide, by contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſatellites who live on the miſchief only which they do, and whom the certainty of impunity, intereſt and habitude, renders unmerciful, inſolent, and frequently perjured.</p>
                        <p>Conſiderable proceſſes have been ſeen to ariſe from theſe viſits, and very rich tanners to quit a profeſſion which promiſed them nothing but torment, anguiſh, loſs and law ſuits.

Intereſted men, who think to conſole us for real evils, which we ſuffer, by thoſe which they ſuppoſe among our neighbours, ſay and repeat, that the ſame vexation of COMMIS and of cuſtoms produces in England the ſame effects. This may ſometimes happen; but there is a law to puniſh them, without a hope of pardon, when they overleap the boundaries preſcribed to them. And theſe boundaries are much more contracted than ours, which the following fact will convince us.</p>
                        <p>Two officers of the exciſe, having taken it into their heads to follow a man carrying a hamper of wine to the houſe of a particular perſon, entered with him in contempt of the law; the maſter of the houſe called ſome conſtables and charged them with the officers: they were taken before Alderman Hamett, who read the Act of Parliament to the culprits, and ſent them to priſon, for having violated the rights of citizens.</p>

America ought to prefer Engliſh glaſs to ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ourſelves prefer it to that of our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory, common bottles excepted, which we make better, and which are of a finer glaſs than that of the Engliſh. But although this opinion may hurt the intereſt of thoſe who have ſuch eſtabliſhments, it is neceſſary to ſay, that France, far from encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them, ought to wiſh for their deſtruction. This kind of manufacture deſtroys combuſtibles, of which the rapid progreſs is alarming, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſlowneſs with which they are produced.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh, ſeated upon their coal mines, are little uneaſy about the voracity of furnaces wherein glaſs is melted; but although it be ſaid that we have the ſame advantage, it is ſtill permitted to doubt of it. And moreover it is not ſufficient to have immenſe coal mines under foot, it is neceſſary to be able to work them at a little expence. Glaſs manufactories, placed within the reach of mines, ſhould not be too far diſtant from the ſea, for the tranſports becoming expenſive, would give to the Engliſh an advantage over us, who, from every part of their iſland, can eaſily get to the ſea. Finally, our own conſumption of glaſs-ware, much greater than that of the Engliſh, may already be too conſiderable, if it be compared with the means to which the ever growing ſcarcity of combuſtibles reduces us.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcarcity of wood, which begins to be manifeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo much the more alarming, as combuſtibles which have been attempted to be ſubſtituted for it have not ſucceeded, and that luxury and population naturally inclined to increaſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with commerce, the conſumption of combuſtibles will be doubled.</note>

They have immenſe foreſts to clear, conſequently it is highly proper that they ſhould eſtabliſh glaſs manufactories, and increaſe them as much as poſſible. The labour employed to deſtroy the woods for the clearing of lands, at the ſame time that it diſpoſes the land to culture, will ſerve for the production of a very extenſive object of manufacture, therefore the utility of this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is double to the Americans.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is what is done in New-Jerſey for the forges.

                  <p>The conſumption of theſe two articles is immenſe in the United States; the ſingle article of nails amounts to conſiderable ſums. This will not appear extraordinary, when it is remembered, that all the houſes, all the incloſures of the Ameicans, are of wood, that they build a great number of ſhips, which require frequent reparations.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame with reſpect to ſaws, ſhovels, hoes, and in general all the inſtruments neceſſary to agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and navigation.</p>
                  <p>The Americans are ſingularly curious in the choice of the firſt neceſſity. They have therein the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral taſte of the Engliſh; they will have that only which is good. On comparing thoſe which they make themſelves with the tools made in France, it muſt be acknowledged that we are far from that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at which they are arrived in them: this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is owing to the eaſe of the labourer, and to the conſideration attached to agriculture. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is a neceſſary conſequence of reſtraint and diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>The Americans have attempted to make iron and ſteel. Many manufactories have been ſet up at New-York, in New-Jerſey, and in Pennſylvania: it is true that theſe manufactures are few in number, but they will neceſſarily increaſe for the reaſons which I ſhall hereafter give.</p>
                  <p>England heretofore exported a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of iron and ſteel:<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>To favour the exportation of theſe articles, the parliament had forbidden all the eſtabliſhment of mills and other machines in the United States for making of ſteel. See 25 Geo. II ch. 29. ſect. 10.</p>
                        <p>It may be judged by this circumſtance to what a point the mother country, or rather the monopolizers, can carry avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs; ſince the Americans were forbidden to enjoy thoſe advantages which nature had thrown before them.

She did no more with regard to America than ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and others, and this circuit augmented the expences of the coloniſt, without procuring him any benefit. This will exiſt no longer, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans are about to trade directly with the Swedes and Ruſſians.</p>
                  <p>Lord Sheffield calculates, that one year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther England imported 50,000 tons of foreign iron, of which from 15 to 20,000 was afterwards exported to the colonies either in its natural ſtate or worked up.</p>
                  <p>The profit to the mother country was, according to his Lordſhip, 12,000,000 lives, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>During the war, and ſince the peace, ſome exports of this kind have been made from France to the United States; but they did not ſucceed. Accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the principles of monopolizers, who have hitherto directed our foreign commerce, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our colonies with brittle utenſils, and otherwiſe very imperfect, our merchants were willing to treat the independent Americans like their ſlaves in their iſlands;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The Chamber of Commerce of Marſeilles, in an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very well drawn up, addreſſed in 1784 to the merchants, had recommended them to act contrarily—"Recollect," ſaid it,

We muſt not be ſurpriſed to find in the merchants of Marſeilles intelligence ON COMMERCE SO RARE ANY WHERE ELSE. Leſs ſhackled, commerce muſt offer more ſolid ideas.</p>
                        <p>The ſame energy is found in an excellent Memorial on the Franchiſes of this city, lately publiſhed againſt the general farm, and of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak.</p>

They ſaid, that we did not even know how to make nails; and, in ſtrict truth, they were right in their aſſertion. They preferred the iron and ſteel of England, although the duties on exportation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their dearneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is probable enough that the Engliſh legiſlature will ſuppreſs them according to the advice of Lord Sheffield; and this, joined to the benefit of the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy procured by the diſcovery of Lord Dundonald, and of Meſſrs. Watts and Boulton, for heating fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces at half the common expence, will undoubtedly produce a reduction in the price of iron.</p>
                  <p>This diminution is one of the cauſes which muſt neceſſarily hinder us from attempting a rivality in this particular with the Engliſh; but there is another, which is ſtill more deciſive.</p>

                  <p>Moreover, forges are a part of the equipage neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to country labour; for, if it were neceſſary to ſeek at a diſtance the utenſils of agriculture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of clearing of lands would ſoon be ſtopped— the productions would not pay the expences.

                  <p>Let it be remarked, that theſe manufactures being joined to a life of agriculture, and carried on in the midſt of it for its uſes, can have none of the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influences which ought to be feared in thoſe complicated manufactures which are obliged to be concentrated in the incloſures of cities, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive

                  <p>Therefore, to reſume this article—far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the exportation of iron manufactured in France, we ought, for our own intereſt, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the importation of foreign iron, becauſe manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of this kind take away combuſtibles from things more preſſingly wanted, and from leſs deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive manufactures, where workmanſhip produces a greater profit.</p>
                  <p>This, however, is not the caſe with every article of curioſity of iron, ſteel, or copper work, wherein the workmanſhip exceeds the other expences. They belong to that weak organization which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ought not to envy. But it muſt not be diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that a competition with the Engliſh will, on this head, be difficult to maintain: their great ability and addreſs in the diſtribution of work and different proceſſes, the invention of which has not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by any error<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>It is true that at preſent artiſts are permitted to have mills, &amp;c. by conforming themſelves to certain formalities,—always formalities?

Has falſe money overturned public order, impoveriſhed the nation, or diminiſhed her revenues?</p>
                        <p>With what difficulty has the invention of the coining-mill made its way into France? It is due to an induſtrious French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the fifteenth century, named Briois. Perſecuted for this diſcovery, he was obliged to take refuge in England; the Engliſh received him favourably, and put his invention into execution. Another Frenchman of the name of Warin, of the laſt century, wiſhed to procure the advantages of it to his countrymen; he experienced a like abſurd perſecution; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſupport of the Chancellor Sequier, he would have failed in his attempt.—I do not allow myſelf to ſpeak of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to which M. Droz pretends to have brought the coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mill at preſent; but by the vexations he ſuffers, it may be judged that he has in fact ſimplified that machine, that he has rendered fewer hands neceſſary, and the coinage of money more perfect and expeditious; two advantages very precious in this art, as the expences of it cannot be too much reduced, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actitude and perfection of the ſtamp of money are the ſureſt means of diſconcerting coiners. What fatal genius is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which purſues induſtry in France? That of companies, of corporations, of privileges.

                  <p>By a letter of the 9th of January, 1784, to the Marquis de la Fayette, I informed him, that inſtead of two free ports, promiſed by the treaty to the United States, the king had determined to grant them four, which has been effected; and I promiſed him to conſider the cuſtoms and duties on importation and exportation which ſhackle commerce; obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, that theſe objects required conſiderable application; they have not yet been completed. By another letter I informed the Marquis, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had ſuppreſſed the duties on the exportation of brandy, a meaſure which he hoped would be uſeful to American commerce; I aſſured him alſo, that the duties of the king and admiralty, payable by an
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028343_0155_0FD8AE3D21C20378"/>
American veſſel on its arrival in a port of France, ſhould be diminiſhed; and afterwards that ſuch of them as remained, ſhould be reduced to a ſingle duty, to be regulated according to the number of maſts or draught of water, and not according to the two uncertain eſtimation of gauging. This reduction requires an exact knowledge of all the duties received in the ports, and as they are of various ſpecies, the ſtate which I ordered to be draw a up of them has not yet been given in.</p>
                  <p>You know, Sir, the king has charged a particular committee, to examine our commercial connexions with the United States, and that the Marquis de la Fayette has laid before it a project analogous to the ideas contained in your letter to the Count de Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gennes: but you muſt perceive, how imprudent it would be to hazard, by a change of ſyſtem, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of a branch of revenue, which amounts to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eight millions of livres, without falling upon any object of the firſt neceſſity. After an ample diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every thing which might at preſent favour the importation of tobacco from America to France, it has been decreed, not that the agreement made with Mr. Morris ſhould be departed from, but that, after the expiration of it, no other of the ſame import ſhould be made; and that in the mean time the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers General ſhould be obliged to purchaſe annually about fifteen thouſand hogſheads of American tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, coming directly from the United States in French or American ſhips, at the ſame prices as ſtipulated in the contract made with Mr. Morris.</p>
                  <p>You will recollect, Sir, that whilſt the demands which had been made for wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sangrain, permitting him to receive as much of that article as ſhould amount to eight hundred thouſand livres tournois, and that I had granted paſſports to exempt this firſt quantity
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028343_0156_0FD8AE40A7D259E8"/>
from all duties whatſoever. M. Sangrain made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards an agreement with the merchants of Boſton for whale oil, to the amount of four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand livres a year, for ſix years, for which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has promiſed the ſame favours as enjoyed by the Hanſe towns.</p>
                  <p>This manner having lately been examined under a more general point of view, the adminiſtration, to which the committee has made its report comform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the requeſt of the Marquis de la Fayette, and to your opinion, relative to the entire abolition of all duties on oils, has diſcovered that it cannot conſent to it for the preſent, on account of engagements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into with other powers. All that could be done was to inſure, for ten years, whale oil, ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceti, and every thing comprehended under theſe denominations, coming from the United States in French or American ſhips, the ſame favours and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of duties as are enjoyed by the Hanſe towns.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty hopes commercial connexions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and France will become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive enough to engage him to continue the effect of this proviſionary deciſion; and as it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the committee, that a conſiderable duty was paid upon the making of the moſt favoured whale oils, and even upon national ones, his Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to aboliſh this duty with reſpect to the former, and upon ſpermaceti coming immediately from the United States in French and American ſhips; ſo that ſpermaceti and theſe oils will have to pay, for ten years to come, no more than ſeven livres ten ſols, and the ten ſols per pound, for all manner of duty; the laſt augmentation of ten ſols per pound to ceaſe in 1790.</p>
                  <p>It has been determined to gain particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon the conſumption in France of rice from Carolina, and that encouragement ſhould be given to the exportation of that article.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:028343_0157_0FD8AE424EB580C0"/>Upon the repreſentations which have been made, touching the conſiderable duties paid on the entry of pot aſh and pearl aſh, as well as relative to thoſe of beaver ſkins and fur, and raw hides, his Majeſty has ſuppreſſed all the duties on pot aſh—on the fur and ſkins of beavers—and on hides, coming raw from the United States, on board American or French veſſels. He will alſo conſider of proper encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be given to every article of the ſkin and fur trade.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty has equally conſented to free from all duties, maſts and yards of every ſpecies, red cedar, green oak, in ſhort, all timber proper for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of veſſels, coming from the United States in French or American ſhips.</p>
                  <p>The committee having alſo repreſented, that there was a duty of five per cent. upon the purchaſe of veſſels built abroad, and that this duty was prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the ſale of American veſſels, his Majeſty has taken this into his conſideration, and exempted the purchaſe of all ſhips, which ſhall be proved to have been conſtructed in the United States, from every duty of the kind.</p>
                  <p>Trees, ſmall ſhrubs, and ſeeds of trees alſo, pay high duties, which his Majeſty has agreed to aboliſh upon ſuch as ſhall be ſent from the United States to France, on board French or American ſhips.</p>
                  <p>It having been repreſented, that the ſtate of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia had ordered arms for its militia to be made in France, it has been determined, that the prohibitions which have hitherto hindered the exportation of arms and gunpowder, as well as the duties required in caſes of particular permiſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

ſhall be ſubject to a very moderate duty only, ſolely for the purpoſe of calculating the exportations.</p>
                  <p>Finally, his Majeſty has received in the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable manner the demand made to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to ſuppreſs the conſiderable duties hitherto paid on books and paper of every kind. His Majeſty ſuppreſſes all duties on articles of this kind, deſtined to the United States, and put into French or Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican veſſels.</p>
                  <p>It is with pleaſure, Sir, I announce to you theſe diſpoſitions of his Majeſty, which are a new proof to you of his deſire to unite cloſely the commerce of the two nations, and of the favourable attention he will always give to propoſitions which ſhall be made to him in the name of the United States of America.</p>

                  <head>SECTION I. Tobacco.</head>
                  <p>Of all the articles which France may procure from the United States, tobacco is the moſt important one to the inhabitants of the two countries. If it cannot be claſſed with our moſt urgent neceſſities, it follows them ſo cloſe, that excepting caſes wherein the uſe of it excites diſguſt, the deprivation of it ordinarily diſcovers the laſt degree of miſery.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not be ſurpriſed at its general uſe.— The man greedy of ſenſations has found one lively enough in tobacco: it is perhaps the only one which he can enjoy at pleaſure without injuring his health, diminiſhing his ſtrength, or ſuſpending his work or meditations. Tobacco awakens the mind agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and obſervers who have remarked the innocent pleaſure, the ſpecies of inſtantaneous comfort, which a little tobacco procures to a poor man, borne down by the weight of affliction, have always wiſhed that ſo ſimple an enjoyment ſhould be improved and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs and leſs expenſive; and they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect without horror on the crime of that fiſcal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, which, hardened by monopoly to increaſe its profits, adulterates ſnuff ſo much, as to make it pernicious to health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="unknown:028343_0160_0FD8AE4B6F5BF278"/>The conſumption of tobacco muſt therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more and more conſiderable, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of this leaf, already very important, cannot be decreaſed but by the diminution of its cultivation; which the policy of America will never permit.</p>
                  <p>The cultivation of tobacco is by no means proper for the European States, which have acquired popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nough to apply another kind of cultivation to all their good lands.</p>
                  <p>It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Alſaciens cultivate a little tobacco, and they boaſt of it; but they would make a greater profit if they cultivated their lands for proviſions. This experience is deciſive for France, where none of thoſe rich lands exiſt which are ſo well known in America. It is therefore the intereſt of France to get tobacco from abroad, but it muſt be paid for by her manufactures: ſhe may enjoy this advantage more fully with free America than with any other country. I will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t repeat the reaſons of it; I will obſerve only, that the free Americans, having an immenſe extent of lands which cannot be cleared but in the courſe of ſeveral centuries, muſt have, for a long time to come, tobacco to ſend to Europe, ſince this produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pays with uſury the expences of clearing.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the cultivation of tobacco in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica muſt be farther and farther from the ſea, and that the expences of carriage may become conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>But different conſiderations place this epocha at a diſtance; firſt, in cultivating tobacco in none but abſolute new lands, the cultivation is much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, and the produce conſiderably more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; conſequently it will coſt much leſs in a new ſoil than when the ſoil requires more labour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure. Secondly, America, interſected in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by rivers and lakes, has infinite reſources for rendering water carriage every where eaſy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently never expenſive. It is eaſy to multiply canals, and conſequently communications: no part
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028343_0161_0FD8AE4C9E7787B0"/>
of the world is ſo much favoured in this reſpect as America. Thirdly, The banks of the Ohio and the Miſſiſſippi offer immenſe lands to be cleared: the Ohio falls into the Miſſiſſippi, which falls in its turn into the ſea: theſe two rivers are almoſt every where navigable, and the lands near them produce already excellent tobacco, and will continue to do ſo for a long time.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is impoſſible to view, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hout indignation, that narrow policy of Spain, which would ſhut out the Americans from all communication with the ſea by the Miſſiſſippi. How is it, that ſhe cannot perceive, that her mercantile intereſt invites her, on the contrary, to favour this navigation, by erecting ſtore houſes upon the banks of this river near to its mouth? Is ſhe ignorant of the advantages of depoſitories? And with reſpect to her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical intereſt, is there a greater one for her in theſe countries, than to make herſelf immediately neceſſary to American eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, within the reach of the Ohio? Muſt ſhe wait till they adopt other means? What will be gained by creating diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content among a free people? If it be wiſhed that theſe people ſhould not become powerful, they muſt be deſtroyed; and if this barbarity belongs not to the eighteenth century, it is neceſſary to make friends of them. Expedients in politics are childiſh and vain.</note> Fourthly, If the price of tobacco ſhould be increaſed, France would not feel the difference, if the free Americans, preferring the culture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to want European manufactures, and gave the preference to thoſe of France. According to this ſyſtem, the exchange of merchandize, manufactured in France for the productions of the ſoil of America, may be ſtill made with advantage, if even theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions were ſold in France below the firſt coſt in America. We have long ſeen the French commerce of the Levant produce great profits, although the merchandize brought in return was ſold at a leſs price in France than it coſt at the place where it was produced. This circumſtance ſtill exiſts.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the ſpeculation, moſt to the intereſt of France, is to take as much tobacco as ſhe can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028343_0162_0FD8AE50049A5070"/>
from the Americans, and pay for it with her manufactures.<note n="*" place="bottom">The tobacco leaf, of which the farmers general had the entire monopoly, or excluſive ſale, produced to the king a clear nett revenue, annually, of between twenty-eight and twenty-nine millions of livres.</note>

If accidents happen, they are ſoon repaired; all their operations are more prompt and ſure; having a better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe ſeas, they are expoſed to leſs riſks than Europeans: finally, their proximity to the fiſheries aſſures them proviſions more freſh,<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the advantage of the Americans, that they furniſh proviſions to the ſedentary fiſheries of the Engliſh.

To wiſh to eſtabliſh and encourage a commerce with a foreign nation, and not to leave it to the care of furniſhing that which it collects with the greateſt facility, is a manifeſt contradiction. The enlightened policy of commerce is not to invade all the branches of it, but to do nothing but that which can be done better and cheaper than any other. Therefore, ſince the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have fiſh on their coaſts, ſince they are in the neighbourhood of Newfoundland, leave to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry that branch which nature has given to them in preference; let us not diſpute it with them: firſt, becauſe it would be in vain to do it, and in the next place, becauſe France may reap, without fiſhing, more advantageouſly the fruit of the American fiſheries.</p>

                  <p>There is no doubt but ſailors are formed in the fiſheries, but it is not in throwing nets or hooks, in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or preparing fiſh, that this is done; it is by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and long exerciſe on board veſſels in laborious manoeuvres, in living, ſo to ſpeak, among rocks, and in ſeas, which the vicinity or nearneſs of oppoſite coaſts makes continually dangerous: now this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of vigilance, agility, and intelligence, is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſailor in coaſting and fiſhing on the coaſts of his own country. Let coaſting be frequent, and let not this fiſhery be diſcouraged in France, and it will not be neceſſary, in order to form ſailors, to ſend them ſo far to take fiſh, which they cannot bring to Europe without great expence: by which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is conſequently limited, and which deprives us of the ineſtimable advantage of receiving in abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,

Theſe abuſes are chiefly as follows: The fiſhing veſſel muſt go to a certain port; the equipage muſt paſs in review before the Officers of the Cuſtoms; the ſhip muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete her cargo, or remain three months at ſea to do it:—ſo that if in the firſt week ſhe procured nine-tenths of it, ſhe would be obliged to keep the ſea for the other tenth. The ſhip can take no inſtruments but thoſe proper for the fiſhery, to which the premium is applied; the cargo cannot be diſcharged but in a certain port; there are general formalities to be obſerved with reſpect to the ſalt which ſhe carries out and brings home; the owners are expoſed to vexations from Cuſtom-houſe Officers, to law ſuits which they are obliged to carry on in courts of juſtice, far from their reſidence.—Judge if a poor fiſherman can expoſe himſelf to theſe inconveniencies; this is what has cauſed fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to decline, eſpecially thoſe of Scotland.—It is what has given ſo much aſcendancy to the Dutch, who have no premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums. It is that which has rendered premiums uſeleſs. Other Governments adopt this method of giving premiums: the ſame difficulties are attached to them, and yet people are aſtoniſhed that things go not on better.</note> by privileges,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028343_0166_0FD8AE5C48BD0F80"/>
and by prohibitions or overcharges of duties, which are equivalent to prohibitions on foreign induſtry.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt not be forgotten, that articles of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence are here in queſtion, that thoſe forced means make them dearer, that their conſumption is then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and their effect reſtrained; that in forcing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this manner, is doing it at the expence of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, for by this barbarous regimen, men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed inſtead of being produced, whilſt permiſſion to bring into ſea-ports the fiſh of thoſe who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better to do than to take it, would infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe population.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to whom are theſe premiums and all other favours, with which it is wiſhed to combat the nature of things, diſtributed? Does the individual of whom it is intended to make a ſailor enjoy any advantage from them? Let not men be deceived in this; they are the prey of the navigator, who goes out of his cloſet but to walk about, and who directs his ſteps ſometimes toward the ſea ſide. He begins by taking his own ſhare, and be perſuaded that the wages which he offers to thoſe whom he employs to conduct his perilous enterprize are parſimoniouſly calculated; therefore the end is not attained.</p>
                  <p>If there be an abſolute want of ſailors who have paſſed their noviciate about the banks of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and in the North ſeas, there is a more ſimple and ſure means, leſs expenſive, and what is more important, one which is exempt from deſtructive conſequences, to form them. Chooſe from honeſt families young, robuſt and intelligent men; inſure to them a perſonal recompenſe, if, after a certain number of voyages on board fiſhing veſſels, they bring certificates of good behaviour, and of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acquired by practice. Oblige them to go on board veſſels belonging to nations or cities, to which theſe difficult fiſheries are a neceſſary reſource. It is there they will acquire real knowledge. Theſe,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028343_0167_0FD8AE5F613845C0"/>
added afterwards to ſailors exerciſed in the coaſting and in the fiſheries on their own coaſts, will form for the navy experienced ſailors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whale oil</hi> belongs to the fiſheries: it is another great article of commerce with the United States. All oil of this denomination is not produced by whales only; great quantities of it is drawn from ſeals, and other ſpecies of fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of this oil is much reſtrained in France:<note n="*" place="bottom">By ſtatements which deſerve ſome faith it appears, that in 1784, the importation into France of whale oil, and that of other fiſh taken by the French, was 1,610,619 lb. Foreign oil, 2,748,099 lb. Portugal furniſhed almoſt half of the laſt.</note> that of the white of the whale, and of which ſuch fine candles are made, is little known there. The uſe of oil will become more general.</p>
                  <p>Lord Sheffield is of opinion, that ſound policy makes its neceſſary that the Engliſh ſhould prohibit, or at leaſt diſcourage by duties, American oil. It was with this idea that the government of England impoſed a duty of four hundred and fifty livres tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois per ton on oils imported by the independent Americans, to favour the oils of Canada and Nova-Scotia.</p>
                  <p>This rigour ſhould make this production, which has been hitherto proſcribed, received in France. The introduction of it is ſo much the more neceſſary, as the French whale fiſhery is ruined. Bayon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly celebrated for this fiſhery, has abandoned it; Dunkirk, which continues to fit out veſſels, furniſhes but little of this oil, at a very high price.</p>
                  <p>Whether the French go to the North, or towards Braſil, they will labour under a diſadvantage:— Without aſylum in caſe of misfortune, their naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is always longer and more expenſive than that of other nations which carry on a whale fiſhery. It is therefore more to the advantage of France to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028343_0168_0FD8AE60E1B27ED0"/>
American oil, and to pay for it with her wines and manufactures.</p>
                  <p>The French government ſoon perceived the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of receiving the oils of America. Had not this been done, an emigration of American fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into Canada and Nova-Scotia would have been the conſequence. This was near happening, ſome time after the peace, in the iſland of Nantucket. In deſpair on ſeeing the ports of England ſhut, and not knowing where to ſell their oils, which alone ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all their wants, the inhabitants had reſolved to emigrate to Nova-Scotia, when, on the moment of departure, they received a letter from the Marquis de la Fayette, whom they juſtly looked upon as their patron and father. He perſuaded them to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent until the French government ſhould ſuppreſs or reduce the duties on oils, which have been reduced for a limited time; but during this time the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Americans are to enjoy, with reſpect to their oils, all the advantages given to the moſt favoured nation;<note n="*" place="bottom">Such are the duties on whale oil, &amp;c. paid in France, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tarifs of 1664, and 1667; whale bone, cut and prepared by the French, thirty ſols per cwt. fins, three livres per cwt. a barrel of oil of five hundred pounds weight, three livres. Whale bone from foreign fiſheries pays, in the firſt inſtance, nineteen livres, in the ſecond, thirty livres, and twelve livres in the third. The Hanſe Towns pay nine livres in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſeven livres ten ſols in the third.—It is the laſt duty which the American oils now pay.</note> and this favour, joined to all their other advantages, cannot fail to give them a great ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this branch of commerce, as beneficial to France as to them.</p>
                  <p>The white of the whale muſt be added, and the candles made with this ſubſtance: they are known by the name of ſpermaceti candles, and ſerve inſtead of very fine bougies or wax candles. The American Colonies exported of them, according to Lord Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, to the amount of five hundred thouſand livres

                  <head>SECTION III. Corn, Flour, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>Foreign corn and flour enter France on paying a duty too inconſiderable to make any ſenſible increaſe in their price. The principles laid down in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding article, with reſpect to articles of ſubſiſtence, muſt be adopted for the commodities of corn and flour.</p>
                  <p>The corn merchant, the moſt uſeful of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants (whatever the vulgar, who, from a want of information, confounds a dealer in corn with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizer, may think of him,) fears arbitrary excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſudden prohibitions, and unexpected ſtrokes of authority. This ſtate of uncertainty prevents the ſolid eſtabliſhment of the true ſyſtem of liberty, whence reſult innumerable inconveniencies, which no other ſyſtem would bring on provided it were fixed, and that it afforded a certain baſis of calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But how could a legiſlation for corn be formed which ſhould not be one of liberty, and which ſhould nevertheleſs afford a like baſis? This is impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeking, firſt of all, the particular rules for every caſe, when theſe are of a nature not to be foreſeen, is ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a chimera.</p>
                  <p>Not to fall into contradiction it is neceſſary to chooſe between arbitrary power and liberty—But that which is arbitrary preſents nothing but a perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which is naturally diſcouraging. No property is ſafe under this ſyſtem; when it exiſts, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and the cultivator are obliged to hazard their property in a lottery, of which the chicaneries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be calculated; for it is neceſſary to foreſee the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028343_0170_0FD8AE664693FD90"/>
falſe informations, errors, and manoeuvres, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt different from their own, and even from that of the public, the attempts of power, &amp;c. and if all theſe conſiderations ought to enter into the elements of their calculations, how can they found hopes on ſuch a variable baſis?</p>
                  <p>Liberty conſiſts, on the contrary, in the choice which every one may make of that which is moſt agreeable to him, according to the circumſtances of the moment. This is a general rule; it is applicable to every caſe, and the hope of gain is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the deciſive certainty that an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual will be maſter of all his induſtry, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining his ſpeculations according to circumſtances, which human power cannot govern.</p>
                  <p>From this demonſtrated truth, that in every ſtate of circumſtances, the firſt thing needful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of grain is a fixed rule, reſults the neceſſity of embracing the ſyſtem of liberty, and of protecting it in its fulleſt extent, without oppoſing any reſtrictive condition.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh ſometimes prohibit importation or exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—But it muſt be obſerved, that the Engliſh previouſly fix the price of corn, which determines prohibitions. This is therefore a fixed law, and which, conſequently deranges not ſpeculators like an arbitrary law.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Governments ſhould be determined by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alone of this fixed rule, if the ſyſtem of liberty was not even demonſtrated to be the beſt in every reſpect. But this ſyſtem is moreover the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſervative againſt the alternatives of ruinous abundance and ſcarcity ſtill more ruinous, which are both calamities, wherever impoſts are conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Lord Sheffield obſerves, that Europe, not being conſtantly under the neceſſity of recurring to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican corn, the United States cannot put corn and flour into the claſs of productions, which found an

eſſential and durable commerce.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Theſe are called the STAPLE, whence the expreſſion 'ſtaple commodities' was naturally formed.</p>
                        <p>We have not, like the Engliſh, the happy liberty of making words: their language becomes more rich, their elocution rapid, and we loſe ourſelves in long circumlocutions, to deſcribe a thing of which we want the name; an inconvenience more pernicious to inſtruction than is believed. This remark is not at preſent ill timed: it is to thoſe who conduct affairs, who live among them, whoſe vocation it is to treat thereon, to create words which explain them clearly and properly.</p>
                     </note> Lord Sheffield is miſtaken. It is a truth, which every man of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is acquainted with, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hat not a year comes forward without ſhewing that ſome one or more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Europe are in want of corn. This want of grain therefore being occaſionally extended to all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, France ought to be anxious to become the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of it, ſince England was ſo formerly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be advantageous to conſtruct in the free ports opened to the United States commodious depoſitories to receive and preſerve American corn. By this means corn would be always ready to be tranſported to the place where the beſt price was to be had for it. Theſe free ports being depoſitories where articles neceſſary to the United States would be collected, the commerce of corn would thereby acquire a continuation, advantageous to the two nations:—advantageous to America, becauſe the certainty of a place of depoſit, ſafe and little expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, would cauſe grain to be ſent more frequently; advantageous to France, becauſe, beſides the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual poſſeſſion of an important commodity, and which would guarantee it from every manoeuvre of interior monopoly, theſe depoſitories would furniſh
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028343_0172_0FD8AE6C465542F8"/>
the means of a coaſting trade, almoſt continual, from the north of France to the fartheſt part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean.</p>
                  <p>France does not grow all the corn ſhe conſumes;<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a fact, though contrary to the common opinion. Another fact, which proves the neceſſity of admitting corn at a low rate, ſuch as the corn of America, is, that three-fourthe of the inhabitants of the province of Beauce, which produces ſuch fine corn, eat black bread and no other, and of which they have not even enough. What muſt this ſcarcity be in other provinces where no corn is grown?</note> ſhe is obliged to get it from the north, from Sicily, and the coaſts of Africa: that of the United States ought to be more proper for her, for two reaſons: Firſt, it muſt be cheaper, being the produce of a cultivating people. Secondly, the people have more various and general wants of freſh proviſions than the ſouthern countries of Europe. The American may receive wines, fine oils, and fruits of France, in exchange for his corn. The Neopolitan, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Finally, there is another conſideration favourable to the importation of American corn: it may eaſily arrive at Honfleur;<note n="†" place="bottom">I quote Honfleur, becauſe this port, from various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, uſeleſs to mention here, is deſtined by nature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the depoſitory of a great commerce, and that eſpecially of the United States with France. The project of making it a free port has been under conſideration; and it is to the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of France that this project ſhould be carried into execution.</note> there it may be ſtored up, and undergo all the proceſſes neceſſary to its preſervation; proceſſes which are become very ſimple and little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Theſe conſiſt in nothing but placing magazines in the open air, opened to dry winds, and conſtructed in ſuch a manner as to be entirely removed. This operation, performed once a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in proper weather, needs only to be repeated a certain number of times; after which the corn may be left in a heap, without fear of its heating. Experiments of this kind have been carefully made. The method of preſerving corn uſed at Geneva may be quoted: The government has eſtabliſhed one of its greateſt revenues in the ſale of corn to the people, and its intereſt has, conſequently, led it to improve the art of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this commodity. Beſides, in depoſitories deſtined wholly to the corn dealers, the ſame corn never remains long enough to render its preſervation difficult. There is ſome reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the ſalt air of the ſea is favourable for it.</note> Theſe eſtabliſhments would keep up a
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028343_0173_0FD8AE6DC77005B0"/>
conſiderable quantity of foreign corn within the reach of the capital, a greater advantage than may be imagined.</p>
                  <p>There are ſtill other motives which ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the French to encourage the importation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican corn. They have need of it for the vaſt magazines which the land and ſea forces, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſcarcity, oblige them to keep ſtored.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould hinder government from forming magazines of American corn in the French ſugar iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, which tempeſts, conflagrations, and other unforeſeen accidents, expoſe ſo frequently to famine, becauſe contracted victualling is carried on by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizers, who ſend but little in order to ſell dear?</p>

                  <p>France, like other European ſtates which have a royal navy and fleets of merchant ſhips to keep in repair, imports timber from Livonia and Ruſſia. This general magazine begins to be exhauſted; the quality of its maſts is not ſo good as formerly.

There is but one objection to this, and it ariſes from prejudice. It is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in France, that the quality of American timber is very much inferior to that of the Baltic. Some people go ſo far as to maintain that it is improper for the conſtruction of veſſels. I have reaſon to believe that this judgment is not only haſty, but dictated either by ignorance, or the partiality of perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Baltic timber.</p>
                  <p>It is not in the laws of nature, that immenſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whoſe aſpects are as varied as thoſe of Europe can be, and in whoſe ſoil there are the ſame diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould produce no timber but of a quality infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of the timber of Europe.</p>
                  <p>Better directed inquiries, and a more attentive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, will ſoon deſtroy this prejudice againſt the quality of American timber; a prejudice ſo much the more diſagreeable, as it would deprive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between France and the United States of an article important to the two nations.</p>
                  <p>If France will inform herſelf ſeriouſly of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let her conſult even the enemies of America; let her conſult Lord Sheffield, ſo moderate in his eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums, when it is neceſſary to give them to the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Americans. His Lordſhip ſays expreſſly,
<q>that the negociators of the treaty of peace, who have ceded the territory of Penobſcot, to the eaſt of Caſco-bay, belonging to Great-Britain, deſerve the ſevereſt cenſure; as this country produces, without contradiction, the beſt timber. The coaſt,</q>
adds his Lordſhip,

                  <p>It has been obſerved that the bulk of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which might be exchanged by the commerce between France and the United States, was, at an equal value, much more conſiderable on the ſide of America than that of France. There reſults from this, that in theſe exchanges, a great number of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican veſſels muſt be ſubject to return to America in ballaſt. This ſtate of things would certainly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the commerce between the two nations, if ſome compenſation could not be eſtabliſhed which ſhould remove the inequality.</p>
                  <p>This compenſation may be made in a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous manner to both. The independent Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans conſtruct veſſels for ſale: if it be agreeable to a nation to purchaſe of another the articles which this manufactures at a leſs expence, and with more means, it follows, that the French ought to buy American veſſels; and, in fact, this commerce begins to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Lord Sheffield reprobates this commerce with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his own country.—"Its exiſtence," ſays his Lordſhip,
<q>depends on its navy; this depends as much on Engliſh ſhip-builders as on Engliſh ſailors; therefore, of all trades, that of ſhip-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the moſt important to be preſerved in Great-Britain.</q>
The advances, according to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are of little conſequence, and theſe veſſels not being deſtined to be ſold to foreigners, what they coſt ought to be conſidered ſo much the leſs, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is incurred in the country.</p>
                  <p>Lord Sheffield preſumes alſo, that ſhip-building will be encouraged in New-Scotland, Canada, the Iſland of St. John, &amp;c. Finally, his Lordſhip declares,
<q>that the encouragement of ſhip-building in the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028343_0183_0FD8AE8ADF9B3F60"/>
United States is ruinous to Great-Britain; that it is the ſame to thoſe who may purchaſe American built veſſels; becauſe, notwithſtanding their cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, theſe veſſels are little durable, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their materials.</q>
This obſervation relates particularly to veſſels built for ſale, which, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſays,
<q>are very inferior to thoſe which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, that it is of conſquence to a nation which attaches a great importance to its navy, to have ſhip-builders. The repairs, &amp;c. of which veſſels are conſtantly in want, would be badly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, if there were not, in the claſs of workmen to whom this induſtry belongs, men capable of conſtructing a veſſel, and habituated to this conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What is ſtill more, as ſoon as a nation has a navy, it is greatly to its intereſt to poſſeſs every means of improving it; and the poſſeſſion of theſe means is ſo much more ſecure when there are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments in the country which, in this caſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port emulation, by the conſtant exerciſe of the art.</p>
                  <p>But it does not follow, that to preſerve ſuch an advantage, a nation ought to have no other veſſels than thoſe which are home built: it is here neceſſary to diſtinguiſh ſhips belonging to the royal navy from merchant ſhips. The firſt are alone ſufficient to employ a requiſite number of able builders, and to ſupply every thing which the conſtruction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of veſſels require. But merchant ſhips, of which a conſiderable number is wanted, may be procured from abroad, if thoſe of an equal quality can be had at a price conſiderably leſs.</p>
                  <p>Will it be ſaid, that a nation becomes ſo much the more powerful at ſea, as the conſtruction of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels is encouraged in her ports? that under this point of view it is neceſſary to be cautious not to furniſh the independent Americans with the means of forming a
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028343_0186_0FD8AE8C8CD5B0B8"/>
navy, which would render them formidable? that it is at leaſt unneceſſary to haſten theſe means?</p>
                  <p>If this conſideration were true, it would in ſome meaſure impoſe on France a law to encourage the United States to form their navy; for, however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable her own may be, ſhe has too many natural obſtacles to remove for her navy to be the effect of any thing but painful efforts, and conſequently that it ſhould be an eſtabliſhment very difficult to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,—very expenſive, and ſubject to long intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And ſince it is neceſſary to ſpeak conſtantly of a threatening rivality,—of an armed rivality,— France has the greateſt intereſt, to balance more ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the force of her rivals, by calling to her aid the naval force of a friendly people,—of a people to whom nature has been prodigal in the means ſhe has given them of having a conſiderable one.</p>
                  <p>But the policy which refuſed to purchaſe Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſels, for fear the Americans ſhould become formidable at ſea, would be badly founded. A ſure manner of retarding the eſtabliſhment of a navy, by a nation which poſſeſſes the means and materials; the power and activity which ſuch a great eſtabliſhment requires, is to employ it continually in the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of veſſels for ſale, and to habituate it to this kind of commerce. If this nation, and ſuch is the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, has nothing to fear inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorly from any other power, it will certainly deſpiſe all ſuch military preparations, whoſe profit and utility will not be ſo immediately perceived, as the frequent gains of peaceful commerce. Therefore, let the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Americans be perſuaded to build veſſels for ſale: let them not be provoked to build ſhips for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and offenſive operations, and they will neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the great means with which nature has furniſhed them, of having a reſpectable navy: they will even neglect them, when greater riches, and a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028343_0187_0FD8AE905B051958"/>
population, ſhall facilitate to them the uſe of their natural means.</p>
                  <p>Far from ſuffering by this new arrangement of things, France would gain thereby. This idea will undoubtedly appear extraordinary, becauſe, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning workmanſhip to American ſhip-builders, France is deprived of it: but how eaſily may ſhe compenſate this apparent loſs! In fact, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be had without labour, it is then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as real riches: therefore, it ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with a prudent economy, eſpecially in the ſyſtem of national rivalities. The workmen who will not build veſſels, will make cloth, with which veſſels may be paid for. The expence of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing theſe cloths will be paid at home, as that for the conſtruction of veſſels would have been; by which means theſe will be had at a cheaper rate. This labour and expence will therefore produce greater advantages, and place the nation in a more deſirable relation with its rivals.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Lord Sheffield, whoſe narrow policy is here refuted, propoſes that ſhip-building ſhould be encouraged in Canada, New-Scotland, &amp;c. But do phyſical circumſtances favour theſe countries as much as the United States? Can England reap real advantages from this encouragement? It is a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which ſeveral writers have combated Lord Sheffield, and on which I cannot decide.</p>
                  <p>But if England had this reſource, France would be without it. Veſſels built in America will always coſt her leſs than her own, or thoſe conſtructed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: ſhe ought therefore to favour the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>A celebrated miniſter, whom France has reaſon to regret, thought as follows: his deſign was to get a part of the veſſels of the French navy conſtructed in Sweden; he thereby expected to make great ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028343_0188_0FD8AE91A3061468"/>
they will be greater and more real, in getting the veſſels conſtructed in the United States.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh themſelves will not be able to reſiſt the force of things; they will ſooner or latter return to the uſe of American veſſels; for theſe coſt but a third<note n="*" place="bottom">In New-England the conſtructors of veſſel make their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains at the rate of three pounds ſterling per ton, carpenter's work included.

                  <p>The bad quality attributed to American veſſels is a fable, ariſing from the following circumſtances: in the contention for independence, the Americans built veſſels in haſte, to arm them as cruiſers: they were forced to make uſe of wood which was green, and unprepared; other things were either wanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the veſſels were imperfect; but this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was but accidental. A cruiſe is a lottery, wherein no notice is taken of the goodneſs and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the veſſel. It is ſufficient that it be a good ſailer, this is the eſſential quality.</p>
                  <p>Peace has re-eſtabliſhed the conſtruction of veſſels in the manner it ought to be; and there are American veſſels built before the war, and ſome thirty years ago, which for goodneſs and duration are not inferior to any Engliſh veſſel.</p>
                  <p>More progreſs has been made in America than any where elſe in the art of ſhip-building; this is eaſily explained:—it muſt not be forgotten, when the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Americans are ſpoken of, that they are not recovering from a ſtate of barbarity.

cauſe a very conſiderable one in the intenſity of induſtry.</p>
                  <p>Boſton has produced a man aſtoniſhing in the art of ſhip-building. Long and cloſely employed in the ſearch of means to unite ſwiftneſs of ſailing in veſſels to their ſolidity, Mr. Peck has had the greateſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. It was his hand which produced the Beliſarius, the Hazard, and the Rattleſnake, which were ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly diſtinguiſhed during the late war by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eir ſwiftneſs of ſailing. Veſſels conſtructed by this able builder have qualities which others have not; they carry a fourth more, and ſail faſter. Theſe facts are authenticated by a number of experiments.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh themſelves acknowledge the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of American ſhip-building:
<q>The fineſt veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</q>

                  <p>The French, if connoiſſeurs be believed, are very inferior to the Americans in the minutiae of ſhip-building. This ſuperiority of America ought not to ſurpriſe us: it will ſtill increaſe. The indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Americans who inhabit the coaſts, live by the ſea, and pride themſelves in navigation.

<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028343_0190_0FD8AE955FF49E48"/>
be, far from perceiving the importance of attaching merit to the improvement of ſhip-building; it muſt therefore languiſh, or yield to that of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Hence it reſults, that the French, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving every thing which can maintain amongſt them an able claſs of ſhip-builders, muſt buy veſſels of the Americans; becauſe every convenience is united to that of facilitating their reciprocal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and exportations, of which the bulks are ſo different in one nation from thoſe of the other.</p>
                  <p>This circumſtance is attended with the advantage of procuring the French merchant an American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at a leſs price than if he had ordered it to be built, or if he bought it in America, becauſe it will always be more to the intereſt of the American to ſell his veſſel, than to take it back in ballaſt.</p>
                  <p>Such is the fitneſs of American veſſels for the French marin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for veſſels will be eſtabliſhed;—the Engliſh reject it. France will, in a ſhort time, encourage it.</p>

                  <p>The liſt which I have gone through of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with which the independent Americans may furniſh Europe in exchange for her merchandize is not very long; but theſe articles are conſiderable, and important enough in themſelves to merit the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of European merchants: they are ſufficient to deſtroy the prejudices of thoſe who, under the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028343_0191_0FD8AE99DEFE20B8"/>
falſe pretext of the inability of the Americans to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh articles of exchange, diſdain a reciprocal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the United States. Theſe articles are not, however, the only ones which France may receive from them. Independently of pot-aſh, ſo precious to manufactures, and of which the ſcarcity becomes daily more ſenſible, iron, vegetable-wax, wool, flax, hemp, &amp;c. may increaſe the number. The Engliſh received of pot-aſh to the amount of four hundred thouſand livres per annum, during the years 1768, 1769, and 1770: pot-aſh being the produce of the wood burnt by the Americans, and as the burning of wood muſt increaſe with the number of people, the quantities of pot-aſh muſt have increaſed with population.</p>
                  <p>I ought to hope that the work, once known in the United States, will excite the independent Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans to co-operate with me, in what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to myſelf, which is to ſpread inſtruction on every thing which relates to their country. They will make known to Europe, in a more extenſive and complete manner, every thing which can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that reciprocal commerce in favour of which I write: they will aſſemble in a work correſpondent to this, all that I have been able to expoſe but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly: they will rectify my errors. I invite them to apply to this intereſting ſubject: I pray them to give it for a baſis, more philoſophical, and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throphical principles, than thoſe which have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to directed the jealous induſtry of each ſociety. For each, led on by a blind ambition, has wiſhed to embrace every thing, to do every thing at home, and furniſh every thing to others; each has taken for principle to receive nothing from others, except it be gold; each has accuſtomed itſelf to look upon every production, manufactured or unmanufactured, which it ſent abroad as a profit, and all thoſe which it received as ſo many loſſes. Such is the falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028343_0192_0FD8AE9DEA987EC8"/>
according to which all the European nations have directed their exterior commerce.</p>
                  <p>What would be the conſequence of a like ſyſtem, if it continued to prevail? All nations would be ſtrangers to each other, and exterior commerce ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely annihilated; becauſe it tends to take from this commerce that which ſupports it. For the gold which is wiſhed for in payment for exportations is refuſed to thoſe who would obtain it: all nations look upon the neceſſity of giving it alike; that it is diſadvantageous—and ſtrive to avoid it. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on one ſide, none will take return in kind, and on the other, nobody will diſpoſſeſs himſelf of his gold, what will become of exchanges? what will become of commerce?</p>
                  <p>Nature, which intended to make men ſo many brothers, and nations ſo many families;—nature, which, to unite all men by the ſame tie, has given them wants, which place them in a ſtate of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence one on the other;—this wiſe nature has, by the diſtribution of her gifts, anticipated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned this excluſive ſyſtem. She has ſaid to the inhabitants of Nantucket, The rock which thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit is rude and ſtormy; renounce, therefore, the deſire of drawing from it the delicious wines and fruits which more calm and temperate climates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Look at the ſea which ſurrounds thee,—that is thy property and thy treaſure: I have made it inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible; and if thou knoweſt how to make uſe of it; if thou wilt confine thyſelf thereto, all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other continent are thine: a ſingle ſtroke of a harpoon, dexterouſly thrown, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a thouſand times more wine in thy cellar, than if by a painful cultivation thou continueſt obſtinate, in acting contrary to my intentions.</p>
                  <p>Nature holds the ſame language to the other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth: ſhe tells the French to uſe all their efforts in the fruitful ſoil which ſhe has given
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028343_0193_0FD8AE9FE0711D60"/>
them, and to ceaſe traverſing foreign ſeas to obtain, at an immenſe expence and much riſk, the fiſh and all which the inhabitants of Nantucket procure with greater facility and more ſucceſs and economy.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould not all nations underſtand a language <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſimple, ſo wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo proper to produce univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal harmony? But how are they to be made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it? By what means are they to be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to adopt it? What means are proper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage nations which might have a direct commerce between them, to ſign a treaty of commerce, which ſhould leave each at liberty to furniſh that which it could export better and cheaper than others; and thus eſtabliſh exchanges on the immutable laws of nature?</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as nations ſhall be enlightened enough to perceive the advantage of ſuch a treaty, from that moment it will ceaſe to be neceſſary, and every other treaty will be ſtill leſs ſo. It will then be ſeen, that they all center in the ſingle word <hi>liberty.</hi> It will be diſcovered that liberty can put every thing in its place; that liberty alone, without negociation or parchment, can every where give birth to an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous induſtry. Finally, that every where, and at all times, ſhe has ſported with thoſe commercial conventions, of which politicians have ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly boaſted; of thoſe conventions wherein the contracting parties are inceſſantly on the defenſive with reſpect to each other—inceſſantly diſpoſed to deceive, and frequently multiply the ſeeds of war in a work of peace.</p>
                  <p>Under ſuch a ſyſtem of liberty, there would be no longer occaſion for craftineſs in national policy with reſpect to commerce:—of what uſe would it be? No more ſtrife; for it would have no object: no more jealouſy or rivality; no more fear of making others proſper and become rich; becauſe the riches of each ſtate would be advantageous to the whole.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028343_0194_0FD8AEA15EF66058"/>
In a word, according to this ſyſtem, each nation would wiſh the other more means, in order to have more to give and more to receive. Commerce would become what it ought to be, the exchange of induſtry againſt induſtry; of enjoyments againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and not againſt deprivations: finally, a ſtate of riches, without poverty on any ſide.</p>
                  <p>What people have more right and title than the Americans, to be the firſt in adopting ſo philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical a ſyſtem, and which is ſo conformable to the laws of nature—at leaſt to do nothing which ſhall retard it among them? Let their Congreſs,—that reſpectable aſſembly, which may become the light of nations, and from whoſe deliberations univerſal happineſs may reſult,—remain faithful to the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this nature; let it interrogate her conſtantly, and give every nation the ſame ſalutary habitude.</p>
                  <p>If Europe refuſes to admit the productions of the United States, let Congreſs, rejecting the poor policy of repriſals, open, by a great and republican reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their ports to all European productions. What evil can reſult from this to the independent Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans? If European prohibitions rendered their means of exchange uſeleſs, European merchandize muſt of courſe be without a market in America; or, falling to a mean price in the United States, it would become profitable to the Americans in paying for it even with gold.</p>
                  <p>The law may be given to an idle and degraded na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but never to one which is active and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This always puniſhes, in ſome manner or other, the tyrannical proceedings of other nations. The force of things is alone ſufficient to revenge it.</p>
                  <p>It is a misfortune to the United States, in not having been able to eſtabliſh at firſt the noble ſyſtem of which I have ſpoken, and to be obliged to have recourſe to the miſerable means of other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,—that of impoſing duties on foreign merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028343_0195_0FD8AEA4558840B8"/>
to pay their debts. Every impoſition but a quit-rent upon land is a ſource of errors. The <hi>pretended protecting duties</hi> impoſed in Europe are one conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe errors, and of which the effect leads government aſtray, ſo far as to perſuade them, that they poſſeſs a creative force equal to that of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity himſelf. And what are theſe enterpriſes by which men would force nature? Miſerable hot-houſes,—wherein every thing is haſtened to finiſh the ſooner; wherein induſtry vainly exhauſts itſelf to ſupport an unnatural exiſtence; and wherein a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous whole is frequently ſacrificed to a corrupted part.</p>
                  <p>Let the Americans carefully avoid theſe erroneous enterpriſes: to inſure themſelves therefrom, let them conſider the ſtate of Europe. The Europeans have no longer any judgment in matters of impoſt: ſimple ideas are loſt, and become impoſſible to be realized by the metaphyſician, which it is neceſſary to employ to combat ignorance, prejudices and habitudes: all ideas of juſtice and propriety are confounded. A truth cannot be advanced without meeting, at every moment, falſe notions to combat. The man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is fatigued, diſguſted, and frequently at a loſs what to anſwer to objections proceeding from habits of error. He perceives with concern, that the laws of happineſs cannot be written, but upon tables from which there is nothing to be effaced: and ſuch, I flatter myſelf, is the ſituation of the United States. They are yet virgin ſtates—they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the inſtitutions which end in chaos, wherein the love of public good loſes all its force.</p>
                  <p>Monteſquieu obſerves, that the enterpriſes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are always neceſſarily mixed with public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but that in monarchies, public affairs are for the moſt part ſuſpicious in the eyes of the merchants. But proſperity and national glory depend on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as much in monarchies as in other conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028343_0196_0FD8AEA6B19C87F0"/>
It is therefore the intereſt of monarchies to give to merchants that hope of proſperity which they have in republics, and which inclines them with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to every kind of commercial enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>Provincial adminiſtrations are the ſureſt means of producing this happy effect. If they were already eſtabliſhed, the French would comprehend, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurb it is to imagine that the United States will not diſcharge their public debt; how impoſſible it is that Republicans ſhould make uſe of the diſhonourable reſource of bankruptcy and deception; and that their public ſpirit, their morals, and intereſt, require them to diſcharge this debt, contracted for the moſt legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and honourable cauſe that ever exiſted; and which is otherways but an atom when compared with their immenſe reſources. French merchants would then give themſelves leſs concern about the manner in which their merchandize was to be paid for in America. For in the improbable caſe of a want of American productions, or of precious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, they have, as a laſt reſource, the paper of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and the States; which paper it is an advantage to acquire, by the price at which it is obtained, by the intereſt it bears, the certainty of its being paid, and by the conſequent tranſmiſſion which may be made of it in commerce to the Dutch merchant, to whom the paper of the whole world becomes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the moment it merits confidence.</p>
                  <p>I have mentioned precious metals. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans are in the neighbourhood of the countries which produce them. Theſe countries are the abodes of indolence, which diſpenſes no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> with neceſſaries. Skins, &amp;c. of animals, and ſome metals, are every thing that can be given there in exchange for articles of ſubſiſtence, which the inhabitants have not the courage to make their lands produce, and for the neceſſaries, for which they find it more convenient to pay with gold than with their induſtry. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028343_0197_0FD8AEA849BBB300"/>
Americans will become factors, advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly placed between European manufactures, and the inhabitants of regions condemned by nature to the ſterile productions of metals. All the powers of Spain cannot prevent this, nor ought even to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. This new conſideration promiſing to the French payment, ſo fooliſhly deſired in gold, ought to encourage them to prepare for a commercial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the United States.</p>

Theſe explanations are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to deſtroy the unfavourable impreſſions which muſt be made by the unfaithful recitals of gazette writers, who, from ſervile prejudices or mean inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, affect to ſpread doubts of the happy conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the revolution. If we believe theſe people, the independent Americans are plunged into inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable embarraſſments, forced to become bankrupts, given up to the moſt violent anarchy, expoſed to the tomahawk of the implacable Indians, &amp;c. How is it poſſible to reſolve to carry on a commerce with people whoſe ſituation is ſo deplorable? Ought not their ruin to be feared rather than their fortune hoped for, in the connexions which it is wiſhed to form with them?</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to refute theſe falſehoods. It is ſo much the more ſo, as ignorance eaſily leads people, little acquainted with republican conſtitutions, into
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028343_0198_0FD8AD20A0313600"/>
error; and that, led aſtray by the prejudices of their educations, a great number of Frenchmen look upon this form of government as a ſtate perpetually in a ferment, wherein life and property are continually expoſed to the greateſt dangers.</p>
               <p>Theſe prejudices lead to the belief of the moſt puerile and abſurd fables. The leaſt attention is not paid to circumſtances. Would the United States have a Congreſs of magiſtrates if it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> true that the people were at war with them? For how could Congreſs and the magiſtrates defend themſelves? They have no other defence but the reſpect which each individual has for the law, this is their only force. It is the obligation that the conſtitution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes on them, in common with the meaneſt citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, of being obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the law, as the laſt means which conſtitute their only ſafety, and which maintains, in all caſes and every where, the authority which the people have confided in them. They cannot employ a phyſical force farther than the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are willing to lend them, becauſe they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an army nor ſoldiers in pay.</p>
               <p>A diverſity of opinion exiſts wherever there are men. It belongs not to one conſtitutions more than to another; but the eſſence of a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to leave to each individual the liberty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his ſentiments on every ſubject.</p>
               <p>In the United States, legiſlation is more and more formed in proportion as things relative to each other are verified, extended, and multiplied. Is it aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing that debates ſhould ariſe on account of the different laws which are propoſed, diſcuſſed, and adopted? Theſe debates become public, animate converſation, and make it highly intereſting. But is this anarchy?</p>
               <p>The word <hi>anarchy</hi> is one of thoſe words which has been moſt abuſed and miſapplied. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary to explain it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:028343_0199_0FD8AD224222E000"/>Where anarchy reigns, there is neither chief, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, laws, nor ſafety. Each individual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the defender of his own perſon, the ſocial contract is broken, and there is no longer any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or tranſactions, becauſe there can be no more contracts. Authority, changing at every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant its rules, principles, and aim, becomes cruel or contemptible; it deſtroys, or is deſtroyed. Such a ſtare exiſts not long; or if it does exiſt, it ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides ſociety into armed herds, enemies to each other, and which ſubſiſt but in proportion as they fear and counterbalance each other's power.</p>
               <p>Is any thing like this ſeen in the United States? Are there diſputes even about the principles of the conſtitution, the fundamental laws, or the propoſed end? Has not every thing relative to this been long ſince agreed upon? The preſent debates relate wholly to ſome rules of adminiſtration: it is upon the beſt manner of ſerving the public cauſe, and of ſupporting it, that minds are ſtill in a ſalutary agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this agitation hinders not more the regular courſe of public affairs and tranſactions, than the debates in the Engliſh Parliament hinder the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch from naming to offices and conferring rank— than they ſtop the courſe of juſtice, or are impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the affairs of every claſs of citizens.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>anarchy</hi> is proper to ſtates which, like Egypt, have twenty-four ſovereigns, and neither laws nor government. It is applicable to the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated conſtitutions of Aſia, where the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is divided into ſeveral departments, independent of each other, traverſing one another in their views and pretenſions, the operations of one part interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe of the other, all having the power of making particular laws, or of ſuſpending the effect of thoſe which exiſt. There a real anarchy reigns, becauſe it is not known where the government is, nor in whom the legiſlative power is veſted. This
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028343_0200_0FD8AD23CB858620"/>
incertitude brings on diſorder, renders property un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and endangers perſonal ſafety.</p>
               <p>None of theſe evils exiſt in the United States. America is not yet gnawed by the vermin which devour Europe, by indeſtructible mendicity: thieves render not her foreſts dangerous; her public roads are not ſtained with blood ſhed by aſſaſſins. How ſhould there be aſſaſſins and robbers? There are no beggars, no indigent perſons, no ſubjects forced to ſteal the ſubſiſtence of others to procure one to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Every man finds there lands to produce him articles of ſubſiſtence: it is not loaded with taxes, but renders to each, with uſury, a recompenſe for his labour. A man who can live eaſy and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, never conſents to diſhonour himſelf by uſeleſs crimes, which deliver him to the torments of remorſe, diſhonour, and the vengeance of ſociety.</p>
               <p>The ravages of the ſeven years war were undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly terrible; but as ſoon as the faulchion could be converted into a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ough-ſhare, the land became fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and miſery diſappeared. The American ſoldiers were citizens; and they were alſo proprietors before they became ſoldiers; they remained citizens in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and returned to their profeſſions on quitting it: they did not fight for money, nor by profeſſion, but for their liberty, their wives, child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their own account, when peace obliges their maſters to diſband them. There has been ſeen in America (what the annals of the world preſent not in any ſtate, except that of Rome) a General, adored by his ſoldiers, diveſt himſelf of his power as ſoon as his ſervices became no longer neceſſary, and retire into the boſom of peace and obſcurity: a numerous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which was not paid, was ſeen generouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to diſband without payment; the ſoldiers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,

                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>The following advertiſement is taken from the American papers, in which there are a thouſand others of a like nature.</p>
               <p>Two brothers, Captains who diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves during the war, returned at the peace to their trade of hat-making;—they inſerted in the gazette an advertiſement as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The brothers <hi>Bickers</hi> inform the public, that they are returned to their old profeſſion of hatters, which they had abandoned to defend the liberty of their country. They hope that their fellow-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens will be pleaſed, in conſideration of their courage and ſervices, to favour them in their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fer them to others.</q>
What Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean Captain would put his name to a like advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>This is what reſults from liberty: but what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable in moſt European ſtates, a military ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reigns there, and its prejudices are predominant. War is the road to glory, ambition, and fortune; and to preſerve t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This uſeleſs burden, this pernicious ſpirit, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the United States;—public ſpirit, much more favourable to good order, takes its place, and peace and ſafety reign without marechauſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Public ſpirit ſupplies the place of all theſe means, whilſt they will never ſupply the want of public ſpirit; nor, like it, produce the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſociety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:028343_0202_0FD8AD275FD62198"/>In vain will prejudiced men exclaim, that this is declamation—I offer them facts. It is neceſſary to read the American gazettes—not thoſe altered by the Engliſh gazette-writers, but thoſe which are printed in America: theſe only can give a juſt idea of the ſituation of the United States.</p>
               <p>The American ſhould rather deſpiſe Europe, in remarking to us the continual ſlaughter we make of thieves and aſſaſſins; in comparing the immenſe number of dungeons, priſons, hoſpitals, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments of every kind, inſtituted to cure or palliate the incurable ulcers of the old inſtitutions: in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this diſguſting liſt with the very few murders and thefts committed in the United States, with the hoſpitals, truly <hi>domeſtic</hi> and humane, which are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed there, with the happineſs of each American family and their ſimple manners; and in proving to us, by their example, that a wiſe liberty regulates the ſocial man, and renders uſeleſs thoſe ruinous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines with which he is cruſhed, leſt he ſhould do any harm.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the men, the laws, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Europeans have calumniated. Theſe men who are deſtined to regenerate the dignity of the human ſpecies!—Theſe laws which ſcourge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but crimes,—which puniſh them every where, and are never ſilent in the face of power!—This go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is the firſt that ever preſented the image of a numerous family, well united, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy; wherein power is juſt, becauſe it circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates through every hand, and reſts in none; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obedience, becauſe it is voluntary, anticipates command; wherein adminiſtration is ſimple and eaſy; becauſe it leaves induſtry to itſelf; wherein the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate has little to do, becauſe the citizen is free, and that a citizen always reſpects the law and his fellow creatures! Theſe are the prodigies which we calumniate: we, Europeans, enſlaved by antiquated
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028343_0203_0FD8AD304AEB97E0"/>
conſtitutions, and by the habitudes given to us by prejudices, of which we know not either the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or the frivolouſneſs! We ſpeak well, but act badly; why, therefore, do we calumniate men, who not only ſpeak but act well? If it be not permitted us to have their virtues, nor to enjoy their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let us not decry them; let us reſpect that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority to which we cannot attain.</p>
               <p>It will, perhaps, be objected, that the government of England has deferred the concluſion of a treaty of commerce with the United States, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that their conſtitutions were not yet ſufficiently eſtabliſhed. But can it be imagined that the Engliſh, who trade in Turky, with the Algerines, and at Grand Cairo, were ſerious when they decried and rejected commercial connexions with the United States, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence that their legiſlation was not yet well enough eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted that the difference of poſition between the French and Engliſh merchants, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their governments, has a great influence upon their reciprocal proſperity; and for this reaſon, it ſhould be inceſſantly repeated to the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that if it wiſhes to inſure proſperity to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, it ought to adopt the means, which are, <hi>liberty of acting,—the right of proteſting againſt the attempts made on that liberty,—and the certainty of juſtice,— without reſpect to perſons:</hi>—theſe are the baſis of the genius, induſtry, and greatneſs of a ſtate; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, a great commerce cannot exiſt: this baſis may be eaſily conciliated with the French conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:028343_0209_0FD8AD3B29D23510"/>In cities, where all trades, occupations, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are full, many delay until they can ſee how to bear the charges of a family; which charges are greater in cities, as luxury is more common; many live ſingle during life, and continue ſervants to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, journeymen to trades, &amp;c. hence cities do not by natural generation ſupply themſelves with inhabitants; the deaths are more than the births.</p>
               <p>In countries full ſettled the caſe muſt be nearly the ſame; all lands being occupied and improved to the height, thoſe who cannot get land muſt labour for thoſe who have it; when labourers are plenty, their wages will be low; by low wages a family is ſupported with difficulty; this difficulty deters many from marriage, who therefore long continue ſervants and ſingle. Only as cities take ſupplies of people from the country, and thereby make a little more room in the country, marriage is a little more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged there, and the births exceed the deaths.</p>
               <p>Great part of Europe is full ſettled with huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, manufacturers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now much increaſe in people. Land being plenty in America, and ſo cheap as that a labouring man, who underſtands huſbandry, can in a ſhort time ſave money enough to purchaſe a piece of new land ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a plantation, whereon he may ſubſiſt a family, ſuch are not afraid to marry; for even if they look far enough forward to conſider how their children, when grown, are to be provided for, they ſee that more land is to be had at rates equally eaſy, all circumſtances conſidered.</p>
               <p>Hence marriages in America are more general, and more generally early, than in Europe. And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one marriage per annum among one hundred perſons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in Europe they have but four births to a marriage (many of their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages being late) we may here reckon eight; of which,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028343_0210_0FD8AD3C98580A58"/>
if one half grow up, and our marriages are made, <hi>reckoning one with another, at twenty years of age, our people muſt at leaſt he doubled every twenty years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this increaſe, ſo vaſt is the territory of North America, that it will require many ages to ſettle it fully; and until it is fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, labour will never be cheap here, where no man continues long a labourer for others, but gets a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his own; no man continues long a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman to a trade, but goes among theſe new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers, and ſets up for himſelf, &amp;c. Hence labour is no cheaper now in Pennſylvania than it was thirty years ago, though ſo many thouſand labouring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been imported from Germany and Ireland.</p>
               <p>In proportion to the increaſe of the colonies, a vaſt demand is growing for Britiſh manufactures; a glorious market wholly in the power of Britain, in which foreigners cannot interfere, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in a ſhort time even beyond her power of ſupplying, though her whole trade ſhould be to her colonies.</p>

               <p>It is a miſtake in thoſe who imagine that the new ſtate of Kentucky compriſes the Weſtern Territory of North-America. That new ſtate includes but a ſmall part of this great domain. The ſtate of Kentucky is deſcribed to be bounded on the ſouth by North-Carolina, on the north by Sandy creek, on the weſt by Cumberland river, making about two hundred and fifty miles in length, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in breadth; whereas the whole Weſtern Territory is infinitely more extenſive. The limits are unknown; but that part of it which was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Captain Hutchins, geographer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, he has given us a ſhort account of. From his

account, becauſe it is known to be authentic, we have extracted the following.</p>
               <p>The part he ſurveyed lies between the 33d and 45th degrees of latitude, and the 78th and 94th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of longitude, containing an extent of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which, for healthfulneſs, fertility of ſoil, and variety of productions, is not perhaps ſurpaſſed by any on the habitable globe.</p>
               <p>"The lands comprehended between the river Ohio, at Fort-Pitt, and the Laurel mountain, and thence continuing the ſame breadth from Fort-Pitt to the Great Kanhawa river, may, according to my own obſervations, and thoſe of the late Mr. Giſt, of Virginia, be generally, and juſtly deſcribed as follows.</p>
               <p>"The vallies adjoining to the branches or ſprings of the middle f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of good farming grounds on the hills, near the largeſt branch of that river. The lands within a ſmall diſtance of the Laurel mountain (through which the Youg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iogeny runs) are in many places broken and ſtony, but rich and well timbered; and in ſome places, and particularly on Laurel creek, they are rocky and mountainous.</p>
               <p>"From the Laurel mountain to Monongahela, the firſt ſeven miles are good, level farming grounds, with fine meadows; the timber, white oak, cheſnut, hickory, &amp;c. The ſame kind of land continues ſoutherly (twelve miles) to the upper branches or forks of this river, and about fifteen miles northerly to the place where the Youghiogeny falls into the Monongahela. The lands, for about eighteen miles in the ſame courſe of the laſt-mentioned river, on each ſide of it, though hilly, are rich and well tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. The trees are walnut, locuſt, cheſnut, pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ſugar or ſweet maple. The low lands, near the river, are about a mile, and in ſeveral places
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028343_0212_0FD8AD4339F138B0"/>
two miles wide. For a conſiderable way down the river, on the eaſtern ſide of it, the intervals are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rich, and about a mile wide. The upland for about twelve miles eaſtwardly, are uncommonly fertile, and well timbered; the low lands, on the weſtern ſide, are narrow; but the uplands, on the eaſtern ſide of the river, both up and down, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and covered with ſugar trees, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Such parts of the country which lie on ſome of the branches of the Monongahela, and acroſs the heads of ſeveral rivers that run into the Ohio, though in general hilly, are exceedingly fruitful and well watered. The timber is walnut, cheſnut, aſh, oak, ſugar trees, &amp;c. and the interval or meadow lands are from two hundred and fifty yards to a quarter of a mile wide.</p>
               <p>"The lands lying nearly in a north-weſterly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Great Kanhawa river to the Ohio, and thence north-eaſterly, and alſo upon Le Tort's creek, Little Kanhawa river, Buffaloe, Fiſhing, Weeling, and the two upper, and two lower, and ſeveral other very conſiderable creeks, (or what, in Europe, would be called large rivers) and thence eaſt, and ſouth-eaſt to the river Monongahela, are, in point of quality, as follows.</p>
               <p>"The borders or meadow lands are a mile, and in ſome places near two miles wide; and the uplands are in common of a moſt fertile ſoil, capable of abundantly producing wheat, hemp, flax, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"The lands which lie upon the Ohio, at the mouths of, and between the above creeks, alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of rich intervals and very fine farming grounds. The whole country abounds in bears, elks, buffaloe, deer, turkies, &amp;c. An unqueſtionable proof of the extraordinary goodneſs of its ſoil! Indiana lies within the territory here deſcribed. It contains about three millions and an half of acres, and was granted to Samuel Wharton, William Trent, and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028343_0213_0FD8AD44B07D19E8"/>
George Morgan, Eſquires, and a few other perſons, in the year 1768.</p>
               <p>"Fort-Pitt ſtands at the confluence of the Alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heny and Monongahela rivers; in latitude 40° 31′ 44″, and about five degrees weſtward of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. In the year 1760, a ſmall town, called Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, was built near Fort-Pitt, and about two hundred families reſided in it; but upon the Indian war breaking out (in the month of May, 1763) they abandoned their houſes, and retired into the fort.</p>
               <p>"In the year 1765 the preſent town of Pittſburgh was laid out. It is built on the eaſtern bank of the river Monongahela, about two hundred yards from Fort-Pitt.</p>
               <p>"The junction of the Allegheny and Mononga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hela rivers forms the river Ohio, and this diſcharges itſelf into the Miſſiſſippi, (in latitude 36° 43′) about one thouſand one hundred and eighty-eight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted miles from Fort-Pitt. The Ohio, in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Miſſiſſippi, glides through a pleaſant, fruitful, and healthy country, and carries a great uniformity of breadth, from four hundred to ſix hundred yards, except at its confluence with the Miſſiſſippi, and for one hundred miles above it, where it is one thouſand yards wide. The Ohio, for the greater part of the way to the Miſſiſſippi, has many meanders, or windings, and riſing grounds upon both ſides of it.</p>
               <p>"The reaches in the Ohio are in ſome parts from two to four miles in length, and one of them, above the Muſkingum river, called the Long Reach, is ſixteen miles and an half long. The Ohio, about 100 miles above, or northerly of the Rapids, (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called the Falls) is in many places 700 yards wide; and as it approaches them, the high grounds on its borders gradually diminiſh, and the country becomes more level. Some of the banks, or heights
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028343_0214_0FD8AD4643F13760"/>
of this river, are at times overflowed by great freſhes; yet there is ſcarce a place between Fort-Pitt and the Rapids, (a diſtance of 705 computed miles) where a good road may not be made; and horſes employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in drawing up large barges (as is done on the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the river Thames in England, and the Seine in France) againſt a ſtream remarkably gentle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in high freſhes. The heights of the banks of the Ohio admit them every where to be ſettled, as they are not liable to crumble away.</p>
               <p>"To theſe remarks it may be proper to add the following obſervations of the ingenious Mr. Lewis Evans. He ſays, that 'the Ohio river, as the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſnows are thawed by the warmth or rains in the ſpring, riſes in vaſt floods, in ſome places exceeding twenty feet in height, but ſcarce any where over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing its high and upright banks. Theſe floods,' Mr. Evans adds, 'continue of ſome height for at leaſt a month or two, according to the late or early breaking up of the winter. Veſſels from 100 to 200 tons burthen, by taking the advantage of theſe floods, may go from Pittſburgh to the ſea with ſafety, as then the falls, rifts, and ſhoals, are covered to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality with the reſt of the rivers;'—and though the diſtance is upwards of 2000 miles from Fort-Pitt to the ſea, yet as there are no obſtructions to prevent veſſels from proceeding both day and night, I am perſuaded that this extraordinary inland voyage may be performed, during the ſeaſon of the floods, by rowing, in ſixteen or ſeventeen days.</p>
               <p>"The navigation of the Ohio in a dry ſeaſon, is rather troubleſome from Fort-Pitt to the Mingo town (about 75 miles) but from thence to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi there is always a ſufficient depth of water for barges, carrying from 100 to 200 tons burthen, built in the manner as thoſe are which are uſed on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Thames, between London and Oxford;—to wit, from 100 to 120 feet in the keel, ſixteen to eighteen

               <p>"The Rapids, in a dry ſeaſon, are difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with loaded boats or barges.</p>
               <p>[But inſtead of the carrying place now uſed, it is intended to ſubſtitute a canal on the contrary ſide of the river.]</p>
               <p>"Moſt of the hills on both ſides of the Ohio are filled with excellent coal, and a coal mine was in the year 1760, opened oppoſite to Fort-Pitt, on the river Monongahela, for the uſe of that garriſon. Salt ſprings, as well as iron ore, and rich lead mines, are found bordering upon the river Ohio. One of the latter is opened on a branch of the Scioto river, and there the Indian natives ſupply themſelves with a conſiderable part of the lead which they uſe in their wars and hunting.</p>
               <p>"About 584 miles below Fort-Pitt, and on the eaſtern ſide of the Ohio river, about three miles from it, at the head of a ſmall creek or run, where are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral large and miry ſalt ſprings, are found numbers of large bones, teeth, and tuſks, commonly ſuppoſed to be thoſe of elephants:—but the celebrated Doctor Hunter of London, in his ingenious and curious obſervations on theſe bones, &amp;c. has ſuppoſed them to belong to ſome carnivorous animal, larger than an ordinary elephant.</p>
               <p>"On the north-weſtern ſide of Ohio, about eleven miles below the Cherokee-river, on a high bank, are the remains of Fort-Maſſac, built by the French, and intended as a check to the ſouthern Indians. It was deſtroyed by them in the year 1763. This is a high, healthy, and delightful ſituation. A great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of game, buffaloe, bear, deer, &amp;c. as well as ducks, geeſe, ſwans, turkies, pheaſants, patridges, &amp;c. abounds in every part of this country.</p>

               <p>"The lands upon the Ohio, and its branches, are differently timbered according to their quality and ſituation. The high and dry lands are covered with red, white and black oak, hickory, walnut, red and white mulberry and aſh trees, grape-vines, &amp;c. the low and meadow lands are filled with ſycamore, poplar, red and white mulberry, cherry, beach, elm, aſpen, maple, or ſugar trees, grape-vines, &amp;c. and below, or ſouthwardly of the Rapids, are ſeveral large cedar and cypreſs ſwamps, where the cedar and cypreſs trees grow to a remarkable ſize, and where alſo is a great abundance of canes, ſuch as grow in South-Carolina. The country on both ſides of the Ohio, extending ſouth-eaſterly, and ſouth-weſterly from Fort-Pitt to the Miſſiſſippi, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Ohio river, and its branches, contains at leaſt a million of ſquare miles, and it may, with truth, be affirmed, that no part of the globe is bleſſed with a more healthful air, or climate; watered with more navigable rivers and branches communicating with the Atlantic Ocean, by the rivers Potowmack, James, Rappahannock, Miſſiſſippi, and St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or capable of producing, with leſs labour and expence, wheat, Indian corn, buck-wheat, rye, oats, barley, flax, hemp, tobacco, rice, ſilk, pot-aſh, &amp;c. than the country under conſideration. And although there are conſiderable quantities of high lands for about 250 miles (on both ſides of the river Ohio) ſouthwardly from Fort-Pitt, yet even the ſummits of moſt of the hills are covered with a deep rich ſoil, fit for the culture of flax and hemp; and it may alſo be added, that no ſoil can poſſibly yield larger crops of red and white clover, and other uſeful graſs, than this does.</p>

Theſe meadows are from 20 to 50 miles in circuit. They have many beautiful groves of trees interſperſed, as if by art, in them, and which ſerve as a ſhelter for the innumerable herds of buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe, deer, &amp;c. with which they abound.</p>
               <p>"I am obliged to a worthy friend and country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for the following juſt and judicious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They were addreſſed to the Earl of Hillſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, in the year 1770, when ſecretary of ſtate for the North-American department; and were written by Mr. Samuel Wharton of Philadelphia, who at that time reſided in London, having ſome buſineſs there with Mr. Strahan, Mr. Almon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"No part of North-America," he ſays, "will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire leſs encouragement for the production of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſtores, and raw materials for manufactories in Europe, and for ſupplying the Weſt-India iſlands with lumber, proviſions, &amp;c. than the country of the Ohio;—and for the following reaſons:—</p>
               <p>"Firſt, The lands are excellent, the climate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, the native grapes, ſilk worms, and mulberry trees, abound every where: hemp, hops, and rye, grow ſpontaneouſly in the vallies and low lands; lead and iron ore are plenty in the hills; ſalt ſprings are innumerable; and no ſoil is better adapted to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of tobacco, flax, and cotton, than that of the Ohio.</p>
               <p>"Second, The country is well watered by ſeveral navigable rivers, communicating with each other; by which, and a ſhort land carriage, the produce of the lands of the Ohio can, even now (in the year 1772) be ſent cheaper to the ſea-port town of Alexandria, on the river Potowmack in Virginia (where General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's tranſports landed his troops,) than any kind of merchandize is ſent from Northampton to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:028343_0218_0FD8AD500087C5D0"/>"Third, The river Ohio is, at all ſeaſons of the year, navigable with large boats, like the weſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try barges, rowed only by four or five men; and from the month of February to April large ſhips may be built on the Ohio, and ſent to ſea laden with hemp, iron, flax, ſilk, tobacco, cotton, pot-aſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Fourth, Flour, corn, beef, ſhip-plank, and other uſeful articles, can be ſent down the ſtream of the Ohio to Weſt-Florida, and from thence to the Weſt-India iſlands, much cheaper, and in better order, than from New-York or Philadelphia to theſe iſlands.</p>
               <p>"Fifth, Hemp, tobacco, iron, and ſuch bulky ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, may alſo be ſent down the ſtream of the Ohio to the ſea, and at leaſt 50 per cent. cheaper than theſe articles were ever carried by land carriage, of only 60 miles, in Pennſylvania: where waggonage is cheaper than in any other part of North-America.</p>
               <p>"Sixth, The expence of tranſporting European manufactories from the ſea to the Ohio, will not be ſo much as is now paid, and muſt ever be paid, to a great part of the counties of Pennſylvania, Virginia, and Maryland. Whenever the farmers or merchants of Ohio ſhall properly underſtand the buſineſs of tranſportation, they will build ſchooners, ſloops, &amp;c. on the Ohio, ſuitable for the Weſt-India, or Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean markets; or, by having black-walnut, cherry-tree, oak, &amp;c. properly ſawed for foreign markets, and formed into rafts, in the manner that is now done by the ſettlers near the upper parts of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware river in Pennſylvania, and thereon ſtow their hemp, iron, tobacco, &amp;c. and proceed with them to New-Orleans.</p>
               <p>"It may not, perhaps, be amiſs, to obſerve, that large quantities of flour are made in the diſtant (weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern) counties of Pennſylvania, and ſent by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive land carriage to the city of Philadelphia, and from thence ſhipped to South-Carolina and to Eaſt and Weſt Florida, there being little or no wheat

The river Ohio ſeems kindly deſigned by nature as the channel through which the two Floridas may be ſupplied with flour, not only for their own conſumption, but alſo for the carrying on an extenſive commerce with Jamaica and the Spaniſh ſettlements in the Bay of Mexico. Millſtones in abundance are to be obtained in the hills near the Ohio, and the country is every where well watered with large and conſtant ſprings and ſtreams, for griſt and other mills.</p>
               <p>"The paſſage from Philadelphia to Penſacola is ſeldom made in leſs than a month, and ſixty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſterling per ton freight (conſiſting of ſixteen bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels) is uſually paid for flour, &amp;c. thither. Boats carrying 800 or 1000 barrels of flour, may go in about the ſame time from the Ohio (even from Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh) as from Philadelphia to Penſacola; and for half the above freight the Ohio merchants would be able to deliver flour, &amp;c. there in much better order than from Philadelphia, and without incurring the damage and delay of the ſea, and charges of inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, &amp;c. as from thence to Penſacola.</p>
               <p>"This is not mere ſpeculation; for it is a fact, that about the year 1746, there was a great ſcarcity of proviſions at New-Orleans, and the French ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, at the Illinois, ſmall as they then were, ſent thither in one winter, upwards of eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand weight of flour."</p>
               <p>"I ſhall now proceed to give a brief account of the ſeveral rivers and creeks which fall into the river Ohio.</p>
               <p>"Canawagy, when raiſed by freſhes, is paſſable with ſmall batteaux, to a little lake at its head;—from thence there is a portage of twenty miles to lake Erie, at the mouth of Jadághque.

               <p>"French Creek affords the neareſt paſſage to lake Erie. It is navigable with ſmall boats to Le Beuf, by a very crooked channel; the portage thence to Preſquile, from an adjoining peninſula, is 15 miles. This is the uſual route from Quebec to Ohio.</p>
               <p>"Licking and Lacomic Creeks do not afford any navigation; but there is plenty of coals and ſtones for building in the hills which adjoin them.</p>

               <p>"Monongahela is a large river, and at its junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Allegheny river, ſtands Fort-Pitt. It is deep, and gentle, and navigable with batteaux and barges, beyond Red-Stone creek, and ſtill farther with lighter craft. At ſixteen miles from its mouth is Youghiogeny; this river is navigable with batteaux or barges, to the foot of Laurel-hill.</p>
               <p>"Beaver Creek has water ſufficient for flat bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom boats. At Kiſhkuſkes, (about 16 miles up) are two branches of this creek, which ſpread oppoſite ways; one interlocks with French Creek and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râge,—the other with Muſkingum and Cayahoga; on this branch, about thirty-five miles above the

               <p>"Muſkingum is a fine gentle river, confined by high banks, which prevent its floods from overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſurrounding land. It is 250 yards wide at its confluence with the Ohio, and navigable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any obſtructions, by large batteaux or barges, to the Three Legs, and by ſmall ones to a little lake at its head.</p>
               <p>"From thence to Cayahoga (the creek that leads to lake Erie) the Muſkingum is muddy, and not very ſwift, but no where obſtructed with falls or rifts. Here are fine uplands, extenſive meadows, oak and mulberry trees fit for ſhip-building, and walnut, cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, and poplar trees, ſuitable for domeſtic ſervices. —Cayahoga furniſhes the beſt portage between Ohio and lake Erie; at its mouth it is wide and deep enough to receive large ſloops from the lake. It will hereafter be a place of great importance.</p>
               <p>"Muſkingum, in all its wide-extended branches, is ſurrounded by moſt excellent land, and abounds in ſprings, and conveniencies particularly adapted to ſettlements remote from ſea navigations;—ſuch as ſalt ſprings, coal, clay, and free ſtone. In 1784 a coal mine oppoſite to Lamenſhicola mouth took fire, and continued burning about twelve months, but great quantities of coal ſtill remain in it. Near the ſame place are excellent whetſtones, and about eight miles higher up the river, is plenty of white and blue clay for glaſs works and pottery.</p>
               <p>"Hockhocking is navigable with large flat bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom boats between ſeventy and eighty miles; it has fine meadows with high banks, which ſeldom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, and rich uplands on its borders.

Theſe falls were formerly thought impaſſable; but late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries have proved, that a waggon road may be made through the mountain, which occaſions the falls, and that by a portage of a few miles only, a communication may be had between the waters of Great Kanhawa and Ohio, and thoſe of James river in Virginia.</p>
               <p>"Tottery lies upon the ſouth-eaſtern ſide of the Ohio, and is navigable with batteaux to the Ouaſioto mountains. It is a long river, has few branches, and interlocks with Red Creek, or Clinche's River (a branch of the Cuttawa;) and has below the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, eſpecially for 15 miles from its mouth, very good land. Here is a perceptible difference of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate between the upper and this part of Ohio. Here the large reed, or Carolina cane, grows in plenty, even upon the upland, and the winter is ſo moderate as not to deſtroy it. The ſame moderation of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate continues down Ohio, eſpecially on the ſouth-eaſt ſide, to the rapids, and thence on both ſides of that river to the Miſſiſſippi.</p>
               <p>"Great Salt Lick Creek is remarkable for fine land, plenty of buffaloes, ſalt ſprings, white clay, and lime-ſtone. Small boats may go to the croſſing of the war-path without any impediment. The ſalt ſprings render the waters unfit for drinking, but the plenty of freſh ſprings in their vicinity makes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient amends for this inconvenience.</p>

               <p>"Scioto is a large gentle river, bordered with rich flats, or meadows. It overflows in the ſpring, and then ſpreads about half a mile, though when confined within its banks, it is ſcarce a furlong wide.</p>

The ſtream of Scioto is gentle and paſſable, with large batteaux or barges, for a conſiderable way, and with ſmaller boats near 200 miles, to a portage of only four miles to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſky.</p>
               <p>"Sanduſky is a conſiderable river abounding in level land; its ſtream gentle all the way to the mouth, where it is large enough to receive ſloops.

               <p>"Buffaloe river falls into the Ohio on the eaſtern ſide of it, at the diſtance of 925 computed miles from Fort-Pitt. It is a very conſiderable branch of the Ohio; is 200 yards wide, navigable upwards of 150 miles for batteaux or barges, of 30 feet long, five feet broad, and three feet deep, carrying about ſeven tons, and can be navigated much farther with large ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes. The ſtream is moderate. The lands on both ſides of the river are of a moſt luxuriant quality, for the production of hemp, flax, wheat, tobacco, &amp;c. They are covered with a great variety of lofty and uſeful timber; as oak, hickory, mulberry, elm, &amp;c. Several perſons who have aſcended this river ſay, that ſalt ſprings, coal, lime, and free-ſtone, &amp;c. are to be found in a variety of places.</p>

From thence, on account of a rocky bottom, and ſhoal water, large canoes are chiefly employed, except when the river is ſwelled with rains, at which time it may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended with boats, ſuch as I have juſt deſcribed, (197 miles further) to the Miami carrying place, which is nine miles from the Miami village, and

this is ſituated on a river of the ſame name, that runs into the ſouth-ſouth-weſt part of Lake Erie.— The ſtream of the Wabaſh is generally gentle to Fort-Ouiatanon, and no where obſtructed with falls, but is by ſeveral rapids, both above and below that fort, ſome of which are pretty conſiderable. There is alſo a part of the river, for about three miles, and 30 miles from the carrying place, where the channel is ſo narrow, that it is neceſſary to make uſe of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting poles inſtead of oars. The land on this river is remarkably fertile, and ſeveral parts of it are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural meadows, of great extent, covered with fine long graſs. The timber is large and high, and in ſuch variety, that almoſt all the different kinds grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Ohio and its branches (but with a greater proportion of black and white mulberry-trees) may be found here.—A ſilver mine has been diſcovered about 28 miles above Ouiatanon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Wabaſh abounds with ſalt ſprings, and any quantity of ſalt may be made from them, in the manner now done at the Saline in the Illinois country:—the hills are reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the beſt coal, and there is plenty of lime and free ſtone, blue, yellow and white clay, for glaſs works and pottery. Two French ſettlements are eſtabliſhed on the Wabaſh, called Poſt Vincient and Ouiatanon; the firſt is 150 miles, and the other 262 miles from its mouth. The former is on the eaſtern ſide of the river, and conſiſts of 60 ſettlers and their families. They raiſe Indian corn, wheat, and tobacco of an extraordinary good quality, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, it is ſaid, to that produced in Virginia. They have a fine breed of horſes (brought originally by the Indians from the Spaniſh ſettlements on the weſtern ſide of the river Miſſiſſippi), and large ſtocks of ſwine and black cattle. The ſettlers deal with the natives for furs and deer ſkins, to the amount of

about 5000l. annually. Hemp of a good texture grows ſpontaneouſly in the low lands of the Wabaſh, as do grapes in the greateſt abundance, having a black, thin ſkin, and of which the inhabitants in the autumn make a ſufficient quantity (for their own conſumption) of well-taſted red-wine. Hops, large and good are found in many places, and the lands are particularly adapted to the culture of rice. All European fruits;—apples, peaches, pears, cherries, currants, gooſberries, melons, &amp;c. thrive well, both here and in the country bordering on the river Ohio.</p>
               <p>"Ouiatanon is a ſmall ſtockaded fort on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſide of the Wabaſh, in which about a dozen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies reſide. The neighbouring Indians are the Kickapoos, Muſquitons, Pyankiſhaws, and a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the Ouiatanons. The whole of theſe tribes conſiſt, it is ſuppoſed, of about one thouſand war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. The fertility of ſoil, and diverſity of timber in this country, are the ſame as in the vicinity of Poſt Vincient. The annual amount of ſkins and furs obtained at Ouiatanon is aboat 8000l. By the river Wabaſh, the inhabitants of Detroit move to the ſouthern parts of Ohio and the Illinois country. Their rout is by the Miami river to a carrying place, which, as before ſtated, is nine miles to the Wabaſh, when this river is raiſed with freſhes; but at other ſeaſons, the diſtance is from 18 to 30 miles, including the portage. The whole of the latter is through a level country. Carts are uſually employed in tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boats and merchandize from the Miami to the Wabaſh river.</p>
               <p>"The Shawanoe river empties itſelf on the eaſtern ſide of Ohio, about 95 miles ſouthwardly of the Wabaſh river. It is 250 yards wide at its mouth, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"The Cherokee river diſcharges itſelf into the Ohio on the ſame ſide that the Shawanoe river does, that is, 13 miles below or ſoutherly of it, and 11 miles above, or northerly of the place where Fort-Maſſac formerly ſtood, and 57 miles from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Ohio with the river Miſſiſſippi. The Cherokee river has been navigated 900 miles from its mouth. At the diſtance of 220 miles from thence, it widens from 400 yards, (its general width) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three miles, and continues this breadth for near thirty miles farther. The whole of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is called the Muſcle Shoals. Here the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is obſtructed with a number of iſlands, formed by trees and drifted wood, brought hither, at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſons of the year, in freſhes and floods. In paſſing theſe iſlands, the middle of the wideſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate water is to be navigated, as there it is deepeſt. From the mouth of the Cherokee river to Muſcle Shoals the current is moderate, and both the high and low lands are rich, and abundantly covered with oaks, walnut, ſugar-trees, hickory, &amp;c. About 200 miles above theſe ſhoals is, what is called, the Whirl, or Suck, occaſioned, I imagine, by the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which there confines the river (ſuppoſed to be the Laurel mountain.) The Whirl, or Suck, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues rapid for about three miles. Its width about fifty yards. Aſcending the Cherokee river, and at about 100 miles from the Suck, and upon the ſouth-eaſtern ſide of that river, is Highwaſce river. Vaſt tracts of level and rich land border on this river; but at a ſmall diſtance from it, the country is much bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſome parts of it produce only pine trees.

wide, and about fifty miles up it ſeveral families are ſettled. From Clinche's to Teneſee river is one hundred miles. It comes in on the eaſtern ſide, and is 250 yards wide. About ten miles up this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is a Cherokee town, called Chota, and further up this branch are ſeveral other Indian towns, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by Indians, called, the Overhill Cherokees. The navigation of this branch is much interrupted by rocks, as is alſo the river called French Broad, which comes into the Cherokee river fifty miles above the Teneſee, and on the ſame ſide. One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty miles above French Broad is Long-Iſland, (three miles in length) and from thence to the ſource of the Cherokee river is ſixty miles, and the whole diſtance is ſo rocky as to be ſcarcely navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable with a canoe.</p>
               <p>"By the Cherokee river, the emigrants from the frontier counties of Virginia and North-Carolina, paſs to the ſettlements in Weſt-Florida, upon the river Miſſiſſippi. They embark at Long-Iſland.</p>
               <p>"I will now proceed to give a deſcription of that part called the Illinois country, lying between the Miſſiſſippi weſterly, the Illinois river northerly, the Wabaſh eaſterly, and the Ohio ſoutherly.</p>
               <p>"The land at the confluence, or fork of the rivers Miſſiſſippi and Ohio, is above twenty feet higher than the common ſurface of theſe rivers; yet ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable are the ſpring floods, that it is generally overflowed for about a week, as are the lands for ſeveral miles back in the country.—The ſoil at the fork is compoſed of mud, earth, and ſand, accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the Ohio and Miſſiſſippi rivers. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fertile, and in its natural ſtate yields hemp, pea-vines, graſs, &amp;c. and a great variety of trees, and in particular the aſpen tree, of an unuſual height and thickneſs.</p>
               <p>"For 25 miles up the Miſſiſſippi (from the Ohio) the country is rich, level, and well timbered; and
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028343_0229_0FD8AD67DD198620"/>
then ſeveral gentle riſing grounds appear, which gradually diminiſh at the diſtance of between four and five miles eaſtward from the river. From thence to the Kaſkaſkias river is 65 miles. The country is a mixture of hills and vallies; ſome of the former are rocky and ſteep; but they, as well as the vallies, are ſhaded with fine oaks, hickory, walnut, aſh, and mulberry trees, &amp;c. Some of the high grounds af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford moſt pleaſant ſituations for ſettlements. Their elevated and airy poſitions, together with the great luxuriance of the ſoil, every where yielding plenty of graſs, and uſeful plants, promiſe health, and ample returns to induſtrious ſettlers.</p>
               <p>"Many quarries of lime, free-ſtone, and marble, have been diſcovered in this part of the country.</p>
               <p>"Several creeks and rivers fall into the Miſſiſſippi, in the above diſtance (of 65 miles), but no remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ones, except the rivers à'Vaſe and Kaſkaſkias: the former is navigable for batteaux about 60, and the latter for about 130 miles. Both theſe rivers run through a rich country, abounding in extenſive, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural meadows, and numberleſs herds of buffaloe, deer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"The high grounds, juſt mentioned, continue along the eaſtern ſide of the Kaſkaſkias river, at a ſmall diſtance from it, for the ſpace of five miles and a half, to the Kaſkaſkias village; then they incline more towards that river, and run nearly parallel with the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi, at the diſtance of about three miles in ſome parts, and four miles in other parts from it. Theſe are principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of lime and free-ſtone, and from 100 to 130 feet high, divided in ſeveral places by deep cavities, through which many ſmall rivulets paſs before they fall into the Miſſiſſippi. The ſides of theſe hills, fronting this river, are in many places perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and appear like ſolid pieces of ſtone maſonry, of various colours, figures, and ſizes.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:028343_0230_0FD8AD6AF68EC048"/>"The low land between the hills and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi begins on the north ſide of the Kaſkaſkias river, and continues for three miles above the river Miſouri, where a high ridge terminates it, and forms the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi. This interval land is level, has few trees, and is of a very rich ſoil, yielding ſhrubs and moſt fragrant flowers, which, added to the number and extent of meadows and ponds diſperſed through this charming valley, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it exceedingly beautiful and agreeable.</p>
               <p>"In this vale ſtand the following villages, viz. Kaſkaſkias, which, as already mentioned, is five miles and a half up a river of the ſame name, running northerly and ſoutherly. This village contains 80 houſes, many of them well built—ſeveral of ſtone, with gardens and large lots adjoining. It conſiſts of about 500 white inhabitants, and between four and five hundred negroes. The former have large ſtocks of black cattle, ſwine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Three miles northerly of Kaſkaſkias, is a village of Illinois Indians (of the Kaſkaſkias tribe) contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 210 perſons and 60 warriors. They were formerly brave and warlike, but are degenerated into a drunken and debauched tribe, and ſo indolent, as ſcarcely to procure a ſufficiency of ſkins and furs to barter for clothing.</p>
               <p>"Nine miles further northward than the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned village, is another, called La Prairie du Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or the Rock Meadows. It conſiſts of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred white inhabitants, and eighty negroes.</p>
               <p>"Three miles northerly of this place, on the banks of the Miſſiſſippi, ſtood Fort-Chartres. It was abandoned in the year 1772, as it was rendered untenable by the conſtant waſhings of the River Miſſiſſippi in high floods.—The village of Fort-Chartres, a little ſouthward of the fort, contained ſo few inhabitants as not to deſerve my notice.</p>

is a village ſettled by 170 warriors of the Piorias and Mitchigamias (two other tribes of the Illinois Indians). They are as idle and debauched as the tribe of Kaſkaſkias which I have juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>"Four miles higher than the preceding village, is St. Philip's. It was formerly inhabited by about a dozen families, but at preſent is poſſeſſed only by two or three. The others have retired to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſide of the Miſſiſſippi.</p>
               <p>"Forty-five miles further northwards than St. Philip's (and one mile up a ſmall river on the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſide of it) ſtands the village of Cahokia. It has 50 houſes, many of them well built, and 300 inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, poſſeſſing 80 negroes, and large ſtocks of black cattle, ſwine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Four miles above Cahokia, on the weſtern or Spaniſh ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, ſtands the village of St. Louis, on a high piece of ground. It is the moſt healthy and pleaſurable ſituation of any known in this part of the country. Here the Spaniſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant and the principal Indian traders reſide; who, by conciliating the affections of the natives, have drawn all the Indian trade of the Miſouri, part of that of the Miſſiſſippi (northwards) and of the tribes of Indians reſiding near the Ouiſconſing and Illinois rivers, to this village. In St. Louis are 120 houſes, moſtly built of ſtone. They are large and commodious. This village has 800 inhabitants, chiefly French;—ſome of them have had a liberal education, are polite, and hoſpitable. They have about 150 negroes, and large ſtocks of black cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Twelve miles below, or ſoutherly of Fort-Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, on the weſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi, and nearly oppoſite to the village of Kaſkaſkias, is the village of St. Genevieve, or Miſſire. It contains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 100 houſes, and 460 inhabitants, beſides
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028343_0232_0FD8AD6F1BEA35B0"/>
negroes. This and St. Louis are all the villages that are upon the weſtern or Spaniſh ſide of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi.</p>
               <p>"Four miles below St. Genevieve, (on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern bank of the Miſſiſſippi,) at the mouth of a creek, is a hamlet, called the Saline. Here all the ſalt is made which is uſed in the Illinois country, from a ſalt ſpring that is at this place.</p>
               <p>"In the ſeveral villages on the Miſſiſſippi, which I have juſt deſcribed, there were, ſo long ago as the year 1771, twelve hundred and ſeventy-three ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible men.</p>
               <p>"The ridge which forms the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi, above the Miſouri river, continues north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly to the Illinois river, and then directs its courſe along the eaſtern ſide of that river for about 220 miles, when it declines in gentle ſlopes, and ends in extenſive rich ſavannahs. On the top of this ridge, at the mouth of the Illinois river, is an agreeable and commanding ſituation for a fort, and though the ridge is high and ſteep (about 130 feet high), and rather difficult to aſcend, yet when aſcended, it affords a moſt delightful proſpect.—The Miſſiſſippi is diſtinctly ſeen from its ſummit for more than twenty miles, as are the beautiful meanderings of the Illinois river for many leagues;—next a level, fruitful meadow preſents itſelf, of at leaſt one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in circuit on the weſtern ſide of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi, watered by ſeveral lakes, and ſhaded by ſmall groves or copſes of trees, ſcattered in different parts of it, and then the eye with rapture ſurveys, as well the high lands bordering upon the river Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouri, as thoſe at a greater diſtance up the Miſſiſſippi. In fine, this charming ridge is covered with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent graſs, large oak, walnut-trees, &amp;c. and at the diſtance of about nine miles from the Miſſiſſippi, up the Illinois river, are ſeen many large ſavannahs, or meadows, abounding in buffaloe, deer, &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:028343_0233_0FD8AD702AC0DEB8"/>"In aſcending the Miſſiſſippi, Cape au Gres par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attracted my attention. It is about eight leagues above the Illinois river, on the eaſtern ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, and continues above five leagues on that river. There is a gradual deſcent back to delighted meadows, and to beautiful and fertile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, watered by ſeveral rivulets, which fall into the Illinois river, between thirty and forty miles from its entrance into the Miſſiſſippi, and into the latter at Cape au Gres. The diſtance from the Miſſiſſippi to the River Illinois acroſs the country, is leſſened or increaſed, according to the windings of the former river;—the ſmalleſt diſtance is at Cape au Gres, and there it is between four and five miles. The lands in this intermediate ſpace between the above two rivers are rich, almoſt beyond parallel, covered with large oaks, walnut, &amp;c. and not a ſtone is to be ſeen except upon the ſides of the river. It is even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the French inhabitants, that if ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements were only begun at Cape au Gres, thoſe upon the Spaniſh ſide of the Miſſiſſippi would be abandoned, as the former would excite a conſtant ſucceſſion of ſettlers, and intercept all the trade of the upper Miſſiſſippi.</p>
               <p>"The Illinois river furniſhes a communication with Lake Michigan, by the Chicago river, and by two portages between the latter and the Illinois river; the longeſt of which does not exceed four miles.</p>
               <p>"The Illinois country is in general of a ſuperior ſoil to any other part of North America that I have ſeen. It produces fine oak, hickory, cedar, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees, &amp;c. ſome dying roots and medicinal plants;—hops and excellent wild grapes, and in the year 1769, one hundred and ten hogſheads of well-taſted and ſtrong wine were made by the French ſettlers from theſe grapes,—a large quantity of ſugar is alſo annually made from the juice of the maple-tree; and as the mulberry-trees are long and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,

I preſume the making of ſilk will employ the attention and induſtry of the ſettlers, when the country is more fully inhabited than it is at preſent, and eſpecially as the winters are much more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and favourable for the breed of ſilk worms, than they are in many of the ſea-coaſt provinces.— Indigo may likewiſe be ſucceſsfully cultivated (but not more than two cuttings in a year); wheat, peas, and Indian corn thrive well, as does every ſort of grain and pulſe, that is produced in any of the old colonies. Great quantities of tobacco are alſo yearly raiſed by the inhabitants of the Illinois, both for their own conſumption, and that of the Indians; but little has hitherto been exported to Europe. Hemp grows ſpontaneouſly, and is of a good tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; its common height is 10 feet, and its thickneſs three inches (the latter reckoned within about a foot of the root), and with little labour any quantity may be cultivated. Flax ſeed has hitherto been only raiſed in ſmall quantities. There has however been enough produced to ſhew that it may be ſown to the greateſt advantage. Apples, pears, peaches, and all other European fruits, ſucceed admirably. Iron, copper, and lead mines, as alſo ſalt ſprings, have been diſcovered in different parts of this territory. The two latter are worked on the Spaniſh ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, with conſiderable advantage to their owners. There is plenty of fiſh in the rivers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly cat, carp, and perch, of an uncommon ſize.—Savannahs, or natural meadows, are both nu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>merous and extenſive; yielding excellent graſs, and feeding great herds of buffaloe, deer, &amp;c.—Ducks, teal, geeſe, ſwans, cranes, pelicans, turkeys, phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, partridges, &amp;c. ſuch as are ſeen in the ſea-coaſt colonies, are in the greateſt variety and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.—In ſhort, every thing that a reaſonable mind can deſire is to be found, or may, with little pains, be produced here.</p>

Its ſituation is delightful, and in the centre of a pleaſant, fruitful country.</p>
               <p>"The ſtrait St. Clair (commonly called the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit river) is at its entrance more than three miles wide, but in aſcending it, its width perceptibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028343_0237_0FD8AD7862BDC4B0"/>
ſo that oppoſite to the fort (which is 18 miles from Lake Erie) it does not exceed half a mile in width. From thence to Lake St. Clair it widens to more than a mile. The channel of the ſtrait is gentle and wide, and deep enough for ſhipping of great burden, although it is incommoded by ſeveral iſlands, one of which is more than ſeven miles in length. Theſe iſlands are of a fertile ſoil, and from their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afford a very agreeable appearance. For eight miles below, and the ſame diſtance above Fort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, on both ſides of the river, the country is divided into regular and well-cultivated plantations, and from the contiguity of the farmers' houſes to each other, they appear as two long extended villages. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who are moſtly French, are about 2000 in number, 500 of whom are as good markſmen, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They raiſe large ſtocks of black cattle, and great quantities of corn, which they grind by wind-mills and manufacture into excellent flour. The chief trade of Detroit conſiſts in a barter of coarſe European goods with the natives for furs, deer ſkins, tallow, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"The rout from Lake St. Clair to Lake Huron is up a ſtrait or river, about 400 yards wide. This river derives itſelf from Lake Huron, and at the diſtance of 33 miles loſes itſelf in Lake St. Clair. It is in general rapid, but particularly ſo near its ſource: its channel, and alſo that of Lake St. Clair, are ſufficiently deep for ſhipping of a very conſiderable burthen. This ſtrait has ſeveral mouths, and the lands lying between them are fine meadows. The country on both ſides of it, for 15 miles, has a very level appearance, but from thence to Lake Huron it is in many places broken, and covered with white pines, oaks, maple, birch, and beech."</p>

               <head>Thoughts on the Duration of the American Commonwealth.</head>
               <p>THERE is a greater probability that the duration of the American commonwealth will be longer than any empire that has hitherto exiſted. For it is a truth, univerſally admitted, that all the advantages which ever attended any of the monarchies in the old world, all center in the new, together with many others which they never enjoy. The four great empires, and the dominions of Charlemaign and the Turks, all roſe by conqueſts—none by the arts of peace. On the contrary, the territory of the United States has been planted and reared by a union of liberty, good conduct, and all the comforts of domeſtic virtue.</p>
               <p>All the greater monarchies were formed by the conqueſt of kingdoms, different in arts, manners, language, temper, or religion, from the conquerors; ſo that the union, though in ſome caſes very ſtrong, was never the real and intimate connection of the ſame people; and this circumſtance principally acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated their ruin, and was abſolutely the cauſe of it in ſome. This will be very different in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. They will, in their greateſt extent and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, be one and the ſame people—the ſame in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, religion, laws, manners, tempers and purſuits; for the ſmall variation in ſome diſtricts, owing to the ſettlement of Germans, is an exception ſo very ſlight, that in a few ages it will be unknown.</p>
               <p>The Aſſyrian and Roman empires were of very ſlow growth, and therefore laſted the longeſt; but ſtill their increaſe was by conqueſt, and the union of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant parts. The Perſian and Macedonian monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies were ſoon founded and preſently overturned; the former not laſting ſo long as the Aſſyrian, nor a ſixth of the duration of the Roman; and as to the Macedonian, it laſted but ſix years. This advant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of a ſlow growth is ſtrong in favour of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; the wonderful increaſe of their numbers is the natural effect of plenty of land, a good climate, and a mild and beneficent government, in which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and tyranny are wholly unknown. Some centuries are already paſt ſince their firſt ſettlement, and many more will paſs before their power appears in its full ſplendour; but the quickneſs of a growth that is entirely natural will carry with it no marks of decay, being entirely different from monarchies found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by force of arms. The Roman empire periſhed by the hands of northern barbarians, whom the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world diſdained to conquer: it will not be ſo with the Americans; they ſpread gradually over the whole continent, inſomuch that two hundred years hence there probably will be nobody but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the whole northern continent: from whence therefore ſhould their Goths and Vandals come? Nor can they ever have any thing to fear from the ſouth; firſt, becauſe that country will never be populous, owing to the poſſeſſion of mines: ſecondly, there are ſeveral nations and languages planted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in it: thirdly, the moſt conſiderable part of it lies in the torrid zone; a region that never yet ſent forth nations of conquerors.</p>
               <p>In extent the habitable parts of North-America exceed that of any of the four empires, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can feed and maintain a people much more numerous than the Aſſyrians or the Romans. The ſituation of the region is ſo advantageous that it leaves nothing to be wiſhed for; it can have no neighbours from whom there is a poſſibility of attack or moleſtation; it will poſſeſs all the ſolid advantages of the Chineſe empire, without the fatal neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Tartars.</p>
               <p>It will have further the ſingular felicity of all the advantages of an iſland, that is, a freedom from the attacks of others, and too many difficulties, with
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028343_0240_0FD8AD80A5B7FD98"/>
too great a diſtance, to engage in enterpriſes that heretofore proved the ruin of other monarchies.</p>
               <p>The ſoil, the climate, production, and face of the continent, are formed by nature for a great, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and permanent government: fill it with people who will of themſelves, of courſe, poſſeſs all ſorts of manufactures, and you will find it yielding every neceſſary and convenience of life. Such a vaſt tract of country, poſſeſſing ſuch ſingular advantages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming inhabited by one people, ſpeaking the ſame language, profeſſing the ſame religion, and having the ſame manners; attaining a population equal to that of the greateſt empire; ſprung from an active and induſtrious nation, who have transfuſed into them their own induſtry and ſpirit, and ſeen them worthy of their original; inhabiting a ſoil not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly fertile, nor a clime generally conducive to effeminacy; accuſtomed to commerce: ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt found a commonwealth as indiſſoluble as humanity will allow. Suffice it for England, that ſhe will have been the origin of a commonwealth, greater and more durable than any former monarchy; that her language and her manners will flouriſh among a people who will one day become a ſplendid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle in the vaſt eye of the univerſe. This flattering idea of immortality no other nation can hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>And here let me make an obſervation that ſhould animate the authors in the Engliſh language with an ardour that cannot be infuſed into thoſe of any other nation; it is the pleaſing idea of living among ſo great a people, through almoſt a perpetuity of ſame, and under almoſt an impoſſibility of becoming, like the Greek and Latin tongues, dead; known only by the learned.—Increaſing time will bring increaſing readers, until their names become repeated with pleaſure by above an hundred millions of people!</p>

               <p>They do not diſcourage our rice, pot and pearl aſh, ſalted proviſions, or whale oil: but theſe articles being in ſmall demand at their markets, are carried thither but in a ſmall degree. Their demand for rice, however, is increaſing. Neither tobacco nor indigo are received there.

               <p>A duty of five ſous the kental, or nearly four and a half cents, is paid on our tar, pitch, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine.

               <p>Salted beef is received freely for re-exportation, but if for home conſumption, it pays five livres the kental.

               <p>During their former government, our tobacco was under a monopoly, but paid no duties; and our ſhips were freely ſold in their ports, and converted into national bottoms. The firſt National Aſſembly took from our ſhips this privilege: they emancipated tobacco from its monopoly, but ſubjected it to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eighteen livres fifteen ſous the kental, carried in their own veſſels, and twenty-five livres carried in ours, a difference more than equal to the freight of the article.</p>

               <p>Great-Britain receives our pot and pearl aſhes free, while thoſe of other nations pay a duty of two ſhillings and three pence the kental. There is an equal diſtinction in favour of our bar iron, of which article, however, we do not produce enough for our own uſe. Woods are free from us, whilſt they pay

ſome ſmall duty from other countries. Our tar and pitch pay 11d. ſterling the barrel; from other alien countries they pay about a penny and a third more.</p>
               <p>Our tobacco, for their own conſumption, pays 1s. 3d. ſterling the pound, cuſtom and exciſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides heavy expences of collection. And rice, in the ſame caſe, pays 7s. 4d. ſterling the hundred weight; which rendering it too dear as an article of common food, it is conſequently uſed in very ſmall quantity.</p>
               <p>Our ſalted fiſh, and other ſalted proviſions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept bacon, are prohibited. Bacon and whale oil are under prohibitory duties; ſo are our grains, meals, and bread, as to internal conſumption, unleſs in times of ſuch ſcarcity as may raiſe the price of wheat to 50s. ſterling the quarter, and other grains and meals in proportion.</p>
               <p>Our ſhips, though purchaſed and navigated by their own ſubjects, are not permitted to be uſed, even in their trade with us.</p>
               <p>While the veſſels of other nations are ſecured by ſtanding laws, which cannot be altered but by the concurrent will of the three branches of the Britiſh legiſlature, in carrying thither any produce or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of the country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried in any veſſels, ours, with the ſame prohibition of what is foreign, are further prohibited by a ſtanding law (12 Car. II.28. § 3) from carrying thither all and any of our own domeſtic productions and manufactures. A ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent act, indeed, authoriſed their executive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms, at its ſole diſcretion; and the permiſſion has been given from year to year by proclamation, but ſubject every moment to be withdrawn on that ſingle will, in which event our veſſels having any thing on board, ſtand interdicted from the entry of all Britiſh ports.

by our merchants on a late occaſion, when an official notification that this law would be ſtrictly enforced, gave them juſt apprehenſions for the fate of their veſſels and cargoes diſpatched or diſtined to the ports of Great-Britain. The miniſter of that court, indeed, frankly expreſſed his perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the words of the order went farther than was intended, and ſo he afterwards officially inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; but the embarraſſments of the moment were real and great, and the poſſibility of their renewal lays our commerce to that country under the ſame ſpecies of diſcouragement as to other countries where it is regulated by a ſingle legiſlator; and the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the ſecurity of fixed laws, while that ſecurity is given to the navigation of others.</p>
               <p>Our veſſels pay their ports 1s. 9d. ſterling per ton, light and trinity dues, more than is paid by Britiſh ſhips, except in the port of London, where they pay the ſame as Britiſh.</p>
               <p>The greater part of what they receive from us is re-exported to other countries, under the uſeleſs charges of an intermediate depoſit and double voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. From tables publiſhed in England, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as is ſaid, from the books of their cuſtom-houſes, it appears that of the indigo imported there in the years 1773—4—5, one third was re-exported; and from a document of authority, we learn that of the rice and tobacco imported there before the war, four-fifths were re-exported. We are aſſured, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the quantities ſent thither for re-exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince the war, are conſiderably diminiſhed, yet leſs ſo than reaſon and national intereſt would dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The whole of our grain is re-exported when wheat is below 50s. the quarter, and other grains in proportion.</p>

and pork, meals and bread of all ſorts, and lay a prohibitory duty on ſpirits diſtilled from grain.</p>
               <p>All other of our productions are received on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried duties, which may be reckoned on a medium at about three per cent.</p>
               <p>They conſume but a ſmall proportion of what they receive; the reſidue is partly forwarded for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the inland parts of Europe, and partly re-ſhipped to other maritime countries. On the latter proportion they intercept between us and the conſumer ſo much of the value as is abſorbed by the charges attending an intermediate depoſit.</p>
               <p>Foreign goods, except ſome Eaſt-India articles, are received in veſſels of any nation.</p>
               <p>Our ſhips may be ſold and naturalized there with exceptions of one or two privileges, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſen their value.</p>
               <p>Denmark lays conſiderable duties on our tobacco and rice carried in their own veſſels, and half as much more if carried in ours; but the exact amount of theſe duties is not perfectly known here. They lay ſuch as amount to prohibitions on our indigo and corn.</p>
               <p>Sweden receives favourably our grains and meals, ſalted proviſions, indigo, and whale oil.</p>
               <p>They ſubject our rice to duties of ſixteen mills the pound weight carried in their own veſſels, and of forty per cent. additional on that, or 22,4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They conſume more of our tobaccoes, which they take circuitouſly through Great-Britain, levying heavy duties on them alſo; their duties of entry, town duties, and exciſe, being 4 dols. 34 cents. the hundred weight, if carried in their own veſſels, and of 40 per cent. on that addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, if carried in our own or any other veſſels.</p>
               <p>They prohibit altogether our bread, fiſh, pot and

pearl aſhes, flax-ſeed, tar, pitch and turpentine, wood (except oak timber and maſts), and all foreign manufactures.</p>
               <p>Under ſo many reſtrictions and prohibitions, our navigation with them is reduced almoſt to nothing.</p>
               <p>With our neighbours, an order of things much harder preſents itſelf.</p>
               <p>Spain and Portugal refuſe to thoſe parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica which they govern, all direct intercourſe with any people but themſelves. The commodities in mutual demand between them and their neighbours muſt be carried to be exchanged in ſome port of the dominant country, and the tranſportation between that and the ſubject ſtate muſt be in a domeſtic bottom.</p>
               <p>France, by a ſtanding law, permits her Weſt-India poſſeſſions to receive directly our vegetables, live proviſions, horſes, wood, tar, pitch and turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, rice and maize, and prohibits our other bread ſtuff; but a ſuſpenſion of this prohibition having been left to the colonial legiſlatures in times of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, it was formerly ſuſpended occaſionally, but latterly without interruption.</p>
               <p>Our freſh and ſalted proviſions (except pork) are received in their iſlands under a duty of three colonial livres the kental, and our veſſels are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and to bring away rum and molaſſes.</p>
               <p>Great-Britain admits in her iſlands our vegetables, live proviſions, horſes, wood, tar, pitch and turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, rice and bread ſtuff, by a proclamation of her executive, limited always to the term of a year. She prohibits our ſalted proviſions: ſhe does not permit our veſſels to carry thither our own produce. Her veſſels alone may take it from us, and bring in exchange, rum, molaſſes, ſugar, coffee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cocoa nuts, ginger, and pimento. There are, indeed, ſome freedoms in the iſland of Dominica, but under ſuch

circumſtances as to be little uſed by us. In the Britiſh continental colonies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are prohibited, and our veſſels forbidden to enter their ports; their governors how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in times of diſtreſs, have power to permit a temporary importation of certain articles in their own bottoms, but not in ours.</p>
               <p>Our citizens cannot reſide as merchants or factors within any of the Britiſh plantations, this being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly prohibited by the ſame ſtatute of 12 Car. II. C. 18. commonly called the Navigation Act.</p>
               <p>In the Daniſh American poſſeſſions, a duty of five per cent. is levied on our corn, corn-meal, rice, tobacco, wood, ſalted fiſh, indigo, horſes, mules, and live ſtock; and of ten per cent. on our flour, ſalted pork and beef, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</p>
               <p>In the American iſlands of the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and Sweden, our veſſels and produce are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſubject to duties, not ſo heavy as to have been complained of; but they are heavier in the Dutch poſſeſſions on the continent.</p>

                  <p>Such being the reſtrictions on the commerce and navigation of the United States, the queſtion is, in what way they may beſt be removed, modified, or counteracted?</p>
                  <p>As to the commerce, two methods occur. 1. By friendly arrangements with the ſeveral nations with whom theſe reſtrictions exiſt: or, 2d. By the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate act of our own legiſlatures for countervailing their effects.</p>
                  <p>There can be no doubt, but that of theſe two, friendly arrangement is the moſt eligible. Inſtead of embarraſſing commerce under piles of regulating laws, duties, and prohibitions, could it be relieved from all its ſhackles in all parts of the world—could every country be employed in producing that which nature has beſt fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual ſurpluſſes for mutual wants, the greateſt maſs poſſible would then be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of thoſe things which contribute to human life and human happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the numbers of mankind would be increaſed, and their condition bettered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="unknown:028343_0251_0FD8ADA0E0876480"/>Would even a ſingle nation begin with the United States this ſyſtem of free commerce, it would be adviſable to begin it with that nation; ſince it is by one only that it can be extended to all. Where the circumſtances of either party render it expedient to levy a revenue, by way of impoſt, on commerce, its freedom might be modified, in that particular, by mutual and equivalent meaſures, preſerving it entire in all others.</p>
                  <p>Some nations, not yet ripe for free commerce, in all its extent, might ſtill be willing to mollify its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and regulations for us in proportion to the advantages which an intercourſe with us might offer. Particularly they may concur with us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocating the duties to be levied on each ſide, or in compenſating any exceſs of duty, by equivalent advantages of another nature. Our commerce is certainly of a character to entitle it to favour in moſt countries. The commodities we offer are either neceſſaries of life, or materials for manufacture, or convenient ſubjects of revenue; and we take in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, either manufactures, when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the laſt finiſh of art and induſtry, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such cuſtomers may reaſonably expect welcome, and friendly treatment at every market; cuſtomers too, whoſe demands, increaſing with their wealth and population, muſt very ſhortly give full employment to the whole induſtry of any nation whatever, in any line of ſupply they may get into the habit of calling for from it.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould any nation, contrary to our wiſhes, ſuppoſe it may better find its advantages by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſyſtem of prohibitions, duties, and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it behoves us to protect our citizens, their commerce, and navigation, by counter-prohibitions, duties, and regulations alſo. Free commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and vexations; nor are they likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a relaxation of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="unknown:028343_0252_0FD8ADA260E72FF0"/>Our navigation involves ſtill higher conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As a branch of induſtry, it is valuable; but as a reſource, eſſential.</p>
                  <p>Its value, as a branch of induſtry, is enhanced by the dependence of ſo many other branches on it. In times of general peace it multiplies competitors for employment in tranſportation, and ſo keeps that at its proper level; and in times of war, that is to ſay, when thoſe nations who may be our principal car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, ſhall be at war with each other, if we have not within ourſelves the means of tranſportation, our produce muſt be exported in belligerent veſſels at the increaſed expence of warfreight and inſurance, and the articles which will not bear that, muſt periſh on our hands.</p>
                  <p>But it is a reſource for defence that our navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The poſition and circumſtances of the United States leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to deſire beyond their preſent rights. But on their ſea-board, they are open to injury, and they have there, too, a commerce which muſt be protected. This can only be done by poſſeſſing a reſpectable body of citizen-ſeamen, and of artiſts and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in readineſs for ſhip-building.</p>
                  <p>Were the ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the induſtry of all, ſo that every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and veſſel ſhould be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the United States would certainly not ſet the example of appropriating to themſelves, excluſively, any portion of the common ſtock of occupation. They would rely on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe and activity of their citizens for a due parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the benefits of the ſeafaring buſineſs, and for keeping the marine claſs of citizens equal to their object. But if particular nations graſp at undue ſhares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more eſpecially if they ſeize on the means of the United States to convert them into aliment for their own ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ſupport of thoſe to whom they belong, defenſive and protecting meaſures become neceſſary on the part of the nation whoſe marine reſources are thus invaded, or it will be diſarmed of its defence; its productions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has poſſeſſed itſelf excluſively of the means of carrying them, and its politics may be influenced by thoſe who command its commerce. The carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of our own commodities, if once eſtabliſhed in another channel, cannot be reſumed in the moment we may deſire. If we loſe the ſeamen and artiſts whom it now occupies, we loſe the preſent means of marine defence, and time will be requiſite to raiſe up others, when diſgrace or loſſes ſhall bring home to our feelings the error of having abandoned them. The materials for maintaining our due ſhare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation are ours in abundance; and as to the mode of uſing them, we have only to adopt the principles of thoſe who thus put us on the defenſive, or others equivalent and better fitted to our circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The following principles being founded in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity, appear perfectly juſt, and to offer no cauſe of complaint to any nation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Where a nation impoſes high duties on our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be proper for us to do the ſame by theirs, firſt burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or excluding thoſe productions which they bring here in competition with our own of the ſame kind; ſelecting next ſuch manufactures as we take from them in greateſt quantity, and which at the ſame time we could the ſooneſt furniſh to ourſelves, or obtain from other countries; impoſing on them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties lighter at firſt, but heavier and heavier afterwards, as other channels of ſupply open. Such duties hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effect of indirect encouragement to domeſtic manufactures of the ſame kind, may induce the manufacturer to come himſelf into thoſe ſtates; where cheaper ſubſiſtence, equal laws, and a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028343_0254_0FD8ADA7C51C5980"/>
higheſt profits from his ſkill and induſtry. And here it would be in the power of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to co-operate eſſentially, by opening the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of encouragement which are under their controul, extending them liberally to artiſts in thoſe particular branches of manufacture, for which their ſoil, climate, population, and other circumſtances have matured them, and foſtering the precious efforts and progreſs of houſehold manufacture, by ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage ſuited to the nature of its objects, guided by the local informations they poſſeſs, and guarded againſt abuſe by their preſence and attentions. The oppreſſions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occaſion of relieving it from a dependence on the councils and conduct of others, and of promoting arts, manufactures, and popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at home.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. Where a nation refuſes permiſſion to our merchants and factors to reſide within certain parts of their dominions, we may, if it ſhould be thought expedient, refuſe reſidence to theirs in any and every part of ours, or modify their tranſactions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where a nation refuſes to receive in our veſſels any productions but our own, we may refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in theirs, any but their own productions. The firſt and ſecond clauſes of the bill reported by the committee are well formed to effect this object.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Where a nation refuſes to conſider any veſſel as ours which has not been built within our territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we ſhould refuſe to conſider as theirs any veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel not built within their territories.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. Where a nation refuſes to our veſſels the carriage even of our own productions to certain countries under their domination, we might refuſe to theirs, of every deſcription, the carriage of the ſame productions to the ſame countries. But as juſtice and good neighbourhood would dictate, that thoſe who have no part in impoſing the reſtriction on us, ſhould not be the victims of meaſures adopted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028343_0255_0FD8ADA91F445D30"/>
its effect, it may be proper to confine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of veſſels owned or navigated by any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſame dominant power, other than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the country to which the ſaid produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be carried.—And to prevent all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the ſaid inhabitants, and to our own, by too ſudden a check on the means of tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may continue to admit the veſſels marked for future excluſion, on an advanced tonnage, and for ſuch length of time only, as may be ſuppoſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to provide againſt that inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>The eſtabliſhment of ſome of theſe principles by Great-Britain alone has already loſt us, in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that country and its poſſeſſions, between eight and nine hundred veſſels of near 40,000 tons burthen, according to ſtatements from official mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, in which they have confidence. This involves a proportional loſs of ſeamen, ſhipwrights, and ſhip-building, and is too ſerious a loſs to admit forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome effectual remedy.</p>
                  <p>It is true we muſt expect ſome inconvenience in practice, from the eſtabliſhment of diſcriminating duties. But in this, as in ſo many other caſes, we are left to chooſe between two evils. Theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences are nothing when weighed againſt the loſs of wealth and loſs of force, which will follow our perſeverance in the plan of indiſcrimination.— When once it ſhall be perceived that we are either in the ſyſtem or the habit of giving equal advantages to thoſe who extinguiſh our commerce and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by duties and prohibitions, as to thoſe who treat both with liberality and juſtice, liberality and juſtice will be converted by all into duties and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions. It is not to the moderation and juſtice of others we are to truſt for fair and equal acceſs to market with our productions, or for our due ſhare in the tranſportation of them; but to our means of independence, and the firm will to uſe them. Nor do the inconveniencies of diſcrimination merit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028343_0256_0FD8ADAD386754C0"/>
Not one of the nations before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perhaps not a commercial nation on earth, is without them. In our caſe one diſtinction alone will ſuffice, that is to ſay, between nations who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our productions and navigation, and thoſe who do not favour them. One ſet of moderate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſay the preſent duties, for the firſt, and a fixed advance on theſe as to ſome articles, and prohibitions as to others, for the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Still it muſt be repeated, that friendly arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are preferable with all who will come into them; and that we ſhould carry into ſuch arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all the liberality and ſpirit of accommodation, which the nature of the caſe will admit.</p>
                  <p>France has, of her own accord, propoſed nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations for improving, by a new treaty, on fair and equal principles, the commercial relations of the two countries. But her internal diſturbances have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto prevented the proſecution of them to effect, though we have had repeated aſſurances of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Propoſals of friendly arrangement have been made on our part by the preſent government to that of Great-Britain, as the meſſage ſtates; but, being already on as good a footing in law, and a better in fact, than the moſt favoured nation, they have not as yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered any diſpoſition to have it meddled with.</p>
                  <p>We have no reaſon to conclude that friendly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements would be declined by the other nations with whom we have ſuch commercial intercourſe as may render them important. In the mean while, it would reſt with the wiſdom of Congreſs to determine whether, as to thoſe, nations, they will not ſurceaſe exparte regulations, on the reaſonable preſumption that they will concur in doing whatever juſtice and moderation dictate ſhould be done.</p>

Spain has, by an ordinance of June laſt, eſtabliſhed New Orleans, Penſacola, and St. Auguſtine, into free ports, for the veſſels of friendly nations having treaties of commerce with her, provided they touch for a permit at Corcubion in Gallicia, or at Alicant; and our rice is by the ſame ordinance excluded from that country.</p>
