            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>WHEREFORE YE MUST NEEDS BE SUBJECT, NOT ONLY FOR WRATH, BUT FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle PAUL appears to have been an adept in philoſophy, ethics and politics. In his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with human nature he was equalled by few. Knowing the will of his divine Teacher, and having imbibed his ſpirit, with irreſiſtible arguments, enforced by a captivating addreſs, and all the power of rhetoric, he inculcated the intereſting doctrines and ſacred maxims of chriſtianity. Well verſed in the principles of civil government, and knowing the importance of the influence of chriſtianity upon the minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men to the happineſs of civil ſociety, as well as to their preparation for another and more glorious ſtate, with the authority of an Apoſtle inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt and commiſſioned from the King of Kings, he ſolemnly exhorts, "let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers: For there is no power but of GOD: The powers that be, are ordained of GOD." The meaning undoubtedly is, that civil government, through the inſtrumentality of men, was inſtituted by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, for the benefit of mankind, On this principle, civil magiſtrates are appointed, not for their own honor, emolument or aggrandizement, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and private and public peace and happineſs, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030454_0005_0FE6E25FF1681628"/>
vice, and encouraging virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. To ſuch a government, well adminiſtered, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity requires peaceable and quiet ſubjection; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces it with this ſolemn denunciation againſt thoſe, who reſiſt ſuch a government; they reſiſt the ordinance of GOD, and ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.—Such ſubjection is required not from a principle of fear only, but for conſcience fake. The Apoſtle means a conſcience enlightened by the principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſanctified by the ſpirit of grace. We muſt therefore be ſubject, not for wrath only, but from a ſtill higher motive, a ſenſe of obligation to Deity and the indiſſoluble bonds of conſcience.</p>
            <p>THE words of the text may therefore properly ſtand as the head of the following diſcourſe; in which a few thoughts may be ſuggeſted upon the neceſſity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of virtue and religion to the ſupport and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of civil government.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle does not preſcribe any particular form of government: This is left to the wiſdom and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men; with which chriſtianity never intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. It is evident from the Apoſtle however; that government ought to be founded upon the juſt rights of mankind, and to be adminiſtered for the beſt intereſts of ſociety. They greatly miſtake the Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who ſuppoſe him to favor the horrid doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance. Such language is fit only for a deſpot to an untaught, barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. If this were the Apoſtle's meaning, no oppoſition ought to be made to the greateſt tyranny on earth. No revolution might then take place; but men, like brutes, muſt ſubmit to ſtill more brutiſh men; patiently wear the galling yoke, and drag out the burden of life in miſerable ſervitude without reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle teaches no ſuch doctrine. Chriſtianity in by no means adapted to encourage oppreſſion and tyranny. No form of government yet conſtructed,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030454_0006_0FE6E263B4185D60"/>
ever was ſo congenial to chriſtianity, as a well regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Republic. No religion, ever yet known, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the genius of a free government, as chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER critically attends to human nature, the deſign of civil government, and the influence of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles on the minds and conduct of men, will eaſily perceive how eſſential morality and religion are to the peace and happineſs of civil ſociety. There are in mankind a variety of deſires and paſſions, whence all their actions proceed. In the preſent ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity, unhappily for us, theſe deſires and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are frequently at variance with each other.—This circumſtance, in ſpite of philoſophy and natural religion, will create a claſhing of intereſt, that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe different opinions and oppoſing actions, whence diſtreſſing evils may enſue. To prevent ſuch miſchiefs, the invention of civil government undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly took its riſe. If the deſires and paſſions of men were duly regulated, civil government and penal laws would be unneceſſary. Men would then never err, except through miſapprehenſion, which information and the benevolent affections would always rectify.—But human nature is poſſeſſed of the paſſions of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ambition, envy and jealouſy, which unreſtrained would produce diſcord, ſtrife, and every evil work.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government is a kind of machine, which the neceſſities of mankind have compelled them to erect for the reſtraint of ſuch deſires and paſſions as, if let alone, would be ruinous to the public peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſociety. Theſe machines ought to be ſo conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructed and managed, as in their operations to effect that public peace and happineſs, which may be ſenſibly felt, and realized by the people. But theſe machines require ſomething more, than the power and influence of penal laws, to preſerve them in order, and promote their great and important uſes. The great art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030454_0007_0FE6E263C11BC488"/>
government well conſiſts in laying the deſires, the paſſions and luſts of men under proper reſtraint.—But how can this be done? The experience of ages decides that penal laws alone are inadequate to the purpoſe. Though in many inſtances they may be effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, yet in general they do not reform the deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minds of the lawleſs, nor correct the vicious habits of the licentious. Fear of puniſhment may prevent many crimes; but, as it does not deſtroy the deſires and paſſions which originate them, whenever this fear, through the hope or proſpect of impunity, ſubſides, the ſame paſſions will again urge on to licentiouſneſs and criminalty. Human reaſon and philoſophy are not of themſelves ſufficient to ſecure the permanent peace and happineſs of ſociety from the depradations of licentious deſires and paſſions. Further aid beyond any thing civil government abſtractedly conſidered em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, is neceſſary to ſupport it, and to ſecure the liberties and happineſs of the people. Religion prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this aid. The very deſign of chriſtianity is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form mankind, to meliorate their tempers, to bring them to diſcharge their duty to GOD, and one another, and through the merits of the Redeemer to fit them for happineſs in the world to come. The ſpirit of the religion of JESUS, thoroughly imbibed, would check all dangerous aſpiring ambition, and thoſe reſtleſs jealouſies, which ſo often diſturb the peace of mankind. Chriſtianity embraces the true principles of free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, as founded, not in uſurpation, tyranny, or oppreſſion, but in the true freedom and happineſs of mankind. Divine revelation deſcribes the character of good rulers, as men of wiſdom and underſtanding; and requires that they be able men, ſuch as fear GOD, and hate covetouſneſs. Thus ſaid David, the ſpirit of the Lord ſpake by me, the GOD of Iſrael ſaid, HE, that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of GOD. Such rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. They are Miniſters of GOD for the good of the people. The ſacred Oracles teach us, that,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030454_0008_0FE6E26C5E483A50"/>
though they live, as GOD upon earth, they muſt die like men, and be accountable to him, by whom King's reign and Princes decree juſtice; who taketh not bribes, and is no reſpecter of perſons.</p>
            <p>IF a government uſurp an authority, and claim the exerciſe of a power, with which they never were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted; or if one branch of government ſhould leap its own preſcribed limits, and invade the prerogative of another; or if the people ſhould claim the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that authority, which they have delegated to their rulers; in all ſuch caſes the order and harmony of government will be neceſſarily interrupted, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic felicity ſuffer, and the liberties of the people be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. Hence ſuch conteſts may ariſe between peace and faction, government and anarchy, as will ſhake, if not deſtroy, the very foundation of public happineſs. To prevent theſe fatal evils, chriſtianity requires that nothing be done through ſtrife and vain glory. But that each in lowlineſs of mind eſteem others better, than himſelf. That every one ſtudy to be quiet, and to do his own buſineſs; not going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, nor defrauding others in any matter. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity teaches to render to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute; cuſtom to whom cuſtom; fear, to whom fear; honor, to whom honor. We are not to ſpeak evil of dignities; nor uſe our liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſts, but as the ſervants of GOD. We are to lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty; and in all things, whatſover we would that men ſhould do unto us, even ſo to do unto them. All this is to be done from love to GOD and our neighbor; and from a religious regard to duty.</p>
            <p>No ſubſtitute was ever yet found equal to virtue and religion for the ſupport of order and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They, who reject theſe, may boaſt of their conſtitutions, their laws and adminiſtration; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wiſeſt conſtitutions, moſt rigid laws, nor ſtrong nerved officers, dreary priſons, nor ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030454_0009_0FE6E26C65C05E20"/>
without the aid of virtue and religion can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the permanent felicity of civil ſociety. The boaſted powers of philoſophy, of natural reaſon, and national honor are all too feeble or capricious to be depended on to effect that manly, that regular, and uniform mode of conduct, which is the natural offspring of virtue and religion. Natural religion is of high importance, and its inducements to righteouſneſs and truth peace and good order are numerous and weighty; but they fall far ſhort of the motives of chriſtianity and give leſs ſecurity to the liberty and happineſs of civil ſociety. The influence of the former terminates with this life; but the latter embraces motives drawn from the conſideration of a future ſtate; that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men as moral agents will be rewarded or puniſhed in the world to come. Theſe are motives the ſtrongeſt and moſt influential, that can apply to the conſciences of men. Without theſe the public, in many caſes, can have no ſecurity. The conſcientious man, in full belief of the exiſtence of GOD, and the truth of chriſtianity, as an honeſt man and ſincere chriſtian, acts as under the eye of the allſeeing and heart ſearching Deity, who will bring every ſecret thing into judgment, puniſh the guilty, and beautify the meek with ſalvation.</p>
            <p>BUT what has the infidel to do with conſcience, whoſe mind is contaminated with unbelief? Whoſe principles are deſtructive both of religion and morality; and whoſe conſcience is feared as with an hot iron by deeply rooted vicious habits? What dependence can ſociety place on ſuch characters? A foe to GOD is not a friend of man. Reſtraining laws, neceſſary as they are for the prevention of crimes, can never reach the evil of abandoned principles and vicious habits, ſo as to effect a remedy. Such characters may ſometimes act for the public good; but this is only, when ſuch a line of conduct coincides with ſome favorite paſſion—They always change with the current of their paſſions and intereſts. Such men are unſtable in all their ways.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030454_0010_0FE6E26ECCE0EBB8"/>IN connexion with the power of conſcience, we may inſtance the importance of the influence of religion, in the uſe of lawful oaths. An oath is a ſolemn appeal to GOD, for the truth of what is affirmed or promiſed: It implies an imprecation of the juſt and righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD, if what the perſon declares, be not true; or if, in what he promiſes, he ſhould not be faithful. An oath is therefore a ſolemn religious act, implying the imprecation of the wrath of GOD upon a perſon, if he be guilty of perjury. Dreadful is the puniſhment threatened in ſuch caſes. A curſe ſhall enter into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſely by the name of the LORD!</p>
            <p>THE utility and neceſſity of oaths in caſes of evidence and in laying a perſon under ſolemn obligation to fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in the diſcharge of the duties of his office, have been known and acknowledged among moſt nations. An oath of confirmation, ſays the Apoſtle, is an end of ſtrife. As a kind of ſanction to the lawfulneſs and utility of oaths in important caſes, the Deity himſelf, graciouſly condeſcended to confirm his promiſe to Abraham by an oath. Oaths of evidence and of office are of ſo much importance, that civil government would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe without them. It would be difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to invent a ſubſtitute, that would anſwer the purpoſe. "Becauſe, as one obſerves, the obligation of an oath reacheth to the moſt ſecret and hidden practices of men, and takes hold of them in many caſes, where the penalty of human laws can have no awe or force upon them." But what is the oath of an infidel, or of a man void of religion? What ſecurity can the public have from the oath of a perſon, who does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there will be a future ſtate of rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments? What obligations of conſcience can ſuch a perſon feel? His taking the form of an oath while he is regardleſs of that being, by whom he ſwears, is no better, than ſolemn mockery. The public, it may be repeated, have no ſecurity from ſuch oaths. The util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030454_0011_0FE6E26ED5BC9EF8"/>
and neceſſity of oaths therefore, to the public ſafety and happineſs evince the neceſſity of religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and virtuous habits. In the days of Polybius ſuch, we are told, was the corruption of the principles and morals of the people of Athens, that, "no Greek could be truſted on the ſecurity of his oath." But in the republic of Rome, antecedently to their abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing licentiouſneſs, ſuch was the impreſſion of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles and virtuous habits on young minds, "that no Roman was ever known to violate his oath."</p>
            <p>THE paſſions of men, unawed by religion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are dangerous, and ruinous to the freedom and happineſs of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>WHEN looſe principles, ungovernable paſſions, and vicious habits take place of morality and religion; ambition and avarice, revenge and thirſt for dominion in the diſappointed, or envy againſt thoſe, who riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them in wealth and honor, united with diſhoneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and intrigue, ſow the ſeeds of diſcord among the people, excite jealouſies, raiſe factions, and diſturb the public tranquility; and, if unreſtrained, would throw government, yea even the world itſelf into confuſion.</p>
            <p>THE evil effects of irreligion and immorality may be exemplified from the univerſal hiſtory of mankind. A few inſtances may be ſufficient to confirm the ſubject.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER attends to the hiſtory of that ancient na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Jews, will find theſe obſervations verified. When Balaam found that every other expedient to bring deſtruction upon Iſrael failed, he laid a diabolical ſcheme to corrupt and debauch the morals of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by this mean effected their ruin. To the ſame cauſe, the corruption of principles and morals, may be traced the final deſtruction of the Jewiſh policy, church, and ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE ancient republic of Sparta through the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary policy and rigid laws of Lycurgus, aided by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030454_0012_0FE6E278990384C8"/>
principles and habits impreſſed upon the young mind by a ſingular mode of education, exiſted for almoſt ſeven hundred years. While it remained cemented by the force of principles and manners, it bore down all oppoſition, and bid defiance to the world. But it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fell a ſacrifice to diſſolute manners and lawleſs fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To ſimilar cauſes may be aſſcribed the ruin of the famous, though ſhort lived republic of Athens. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon lived to ſee the fabric of freedom, which he had erected, fall to deſtruction. He gave them laws, which he acknowledged were not the beſt that might have been given, but the beſt they could bear. On his departure from Athens political ſtorms aroſe; aided by an unprincipled licentious populace, demagogues took the lead, deluded the people, feized the ſtrong hold, and eſtabliſhed a ſyſtem of tyranny. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Athens was never recovered. That once famed republic, overrun with ignorance and barbariſm, now groans under Turkiſh tyranny, and Mahometan impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>THE feuds and factions, which eventually proved the overthrow of the freedom, and the republic of Rome, may be traced up to the ſame deſtructive foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of bad principles and diſſolute morals of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. "They adopted the luxury, the immoralities, and irreligion of other nations." Theſe in coincidence with their own paſſions effected their complete ruin. Thus that renowned republic, which nothing elſe could conquer, was conquered by its own vices. "A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners and numerous crimes, ſays a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed writer, made greater havoc in the city, than the mightieſt armies could have done; and in that manner avenged the conquered globe."</p>
            <p>As human nature in all ages of the world is the ſame, like cauſes, under ſimilar circumſtances, in whatever period or part of the globe, will produce like effects. Happy will it be for America, if we avoid the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030454_0013_0FE6E278A0893558"/>
rocks, againſt which ſo many others have been daſhed in pieces.</p>
            <p>MANY important inferences and reflections, appoſite to the preſent occaſion ſuggeſt themſelves from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>IF the influence of virtue and religion are ſo eſſential in preſerving the freedom and ſecuring the permanent felicity of civil ſociety; the cultivation of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and virtuous morals among the people may be conſidered, as an object highly meriting the regard of our Legiſlative, Judicial, and Executive branches of government. What encouragement then ſhould be given by our civil Rulers, by all influential men, and every claſs of citizens, to morality, religion and piety; and to all chriſtian inſtitutions, as calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch happy effects.</p>
            <p>IF civil government thus needs the aid of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and virtuous habits, to render its operations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and permanent, it muſt be a hazardous experiment for any nation under Heaven to reject that aid, on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that conſtitutions and human laws are ſufficient without it, to ſecure peace and good order, and the rights and privileges of the people. Men may form conſtitutions, enact laws, diſplay their philoſophy, and exert all their eloquence in conjunction with coercion, but all will be inſufficient for the permanent ſecurity of freedom and good government, without the aid of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>REASONING from human nature and paſt events, we might venture to predict, if any nation ſhould have the temerity to caſt off morality and religion, as unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the happineſs of civil ſociety, it would in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent pay dearly for the experiment; and find, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too late, that their own folly was their ruin.</p>
            <p>FROM the foregoing obſervations we may infer the high importance of a virtuous education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:030454_0014_0FE6E27A0EE5D3D8"/>IN countries, where religion is only the tool of ſtates and of tyrants, the more ignorant the people are, the more eaſily they may be impoſed upon and enſlaved. It is the intereſt of ſuch governments therefore, to keep the great maſs of the people in ignorance. But, as mankind were not made for ſlavery, an enlightened virtuous people will never ſuffer themſelves to be long enſlaved. If, through ſupineſs and inattention, tyranny, ſhould ſlip on the galling yoke, and faſten upon them the chain of ſlavery, they would ſoon feel their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and with a manly virtuous reſentment raiſe the all conquering arm of liberty, and break the yoke, as a withe of ſtraw, and ſnap the chain, as a ſpiders web.</p>
            <p>A virtuous education is eſſential to the permanent felicity of all free governments. "The infant mind, ſays a writer of note, left to its own untutored dictates, inevitably wanders into ſuch follies and vices, as tend to the deſtruction of itſelf and others." "The early and continued culture of the heart can alone produce ſuch upright manners and principles, as are neceſſary to check and ſubdue the paſſions of the ſoul; and liberty can only ariſe from a general ſubordination of theſe to the public welfare."</p>
            <p>EDUCATION in general forms the characters of men. Principles inſtilled into the mind, and habits formed in early life, lay a foundation, for the happineſs or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world. They verify the ſacred maxim, train up a child in the way, he ſhould go; and, when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
            <p>IMPRSSEED with theſe ideas, our pious anceſtors made the earlieſt exertion for the diffuſion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the promotion of morality and religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. Their deſign has been happily aided by many chriſtian Patriots, whoſe numerous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable donations for the promotion of knowledge and religion, while they have ſo greatly ſerved to advance private and public happineſs, have at the ſame time
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030454_0015_0FE64C7D8B301ED8"/>
laid up for the pious and charitable donors a rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in heaven!</p>
            <p>WE are happy in living under a government, where the great object of promoting learning and religion has arreſted the attention of our wiſe and patriotic Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, who from time to time have enacted ſuch laws, as, if carried into execution, would prove the grand palladium of our republic. Our Legiſlatros have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that "a general diſſemination of knowledge and virtue is neceſſary to the proſperity of every ſtate, and to the very exiſtence of a Commonwealth."</p>
            <p>To promote the great deſign of a virtuous education, a preſent exiſting law of this Commonwealth, makes it the "duty of the Preſident, Profeſſors, and Tutors of the Univerſity in Cambridge, Preceptors of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all other Inſtructors of youth, to take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care, and to exert their beſt endeavours, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on the minds of children and youth committed to their care an inſtruction, the principles of piety, juſtice, and a ſacred regard to truth, love to their country, humanity and univerſal benevolence, ſobriety, induſtry, and frugality, chaſtity, moderation, and temperance, and thoſe other virtues, which are the ornament of human ſociety, and the baſis, upon which the republican conſtitution is ſtructured; and it ſhall be the duty of ſuch Inſtructors, to endeavor to lead thoſe under their care (as their ages and capacities will admit) into a particular underſtanding of the tendency of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned virtues, to preſerve, and perfect a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican conſtitution, and to ſecure the bleſſings of liberty as well, as to promote their future happineſs; and the tendency of the oppoſite vices to ſlavery."</p>
            <p>MAY this monument of the wiſdom and patriotiſm of the Legiſlature, who framed it, be as laſting, as the world.</p>
            <p>THIS leads us to reflect upon the importance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting the inſtruction of youth to thoſe only, who are
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030454_0016_0FE6E27D17D52A70"/>
of religion and good morals; who will teach by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample as well, as precept.</p>
            <p>HAPPY will it be for theſe riſing States, if our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative and Executive branches of government be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the idea, that without cloſe attention to the virtuous education of youth, republicaniſm, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and public happineſs can never be preſerved.</p>
            <p>FROM a regard to the happineſs of the people, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and public, preſent and future, our civil fathers, we may hope, will give every encouragement to literary and religious inſtitutions. Parſimony in the ſupport of education and religion is a kind of ſacrilege, in which we cheat ourſelves and the riſing generation, injure the public, and rob GOD of his due.</p>
            <p>IF morality and religion be thus eſſential to public happineſs and the ſupport of free governments, it muſt then be of high importance, that our rulers be virtuous and good men.</p>
            <p>I BELIEVE it may be conſidered, as an unfailing max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that no man can in heart be a true republican, who is not a perſon of piety and good morals. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, immoral true republican is a ſoleciſm in language. Conſequently no man, who is unfriendly to religion in profeſſion or practice, ought to be intruſted with any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns in government. If it be pleaded, that bad men in many inſtances have done great good to the public; it may be replied, this happens only, when the ſelfiſh principles and paſſions chance to coincide with the public good. Such cannot be confided in. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial caution ought to be uſed againſt all thoſe, who treat chriſtianity with contempt. Whatever ſuch men may pretend, I appeal to the ſerious part of the community, whether an enemy to the croſs of CHRIST can be a friend to mankind? The liberties of the people can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſafe in the hands of unprincipled men. While the following maxim remains an eternal truth, "That can never be politically right, which is morally wrong;"
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030454_0017_0FE6E27D1F561458"/>
an unprincipled man can never be a good politician, and ought never to be confided in by the people.</p>
            <p>THE example of wiſe and religious rulers, if juſtly eſteemed, will have great influence upon the people.—For, in a general way, we may ſay with the wiſe ſon of Sirach, "As is the judge of the people himſelf, ſo are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, ſuch are they, that dwell therein." From the imitative nature of man, the power of example lays an indiſpenſible obligation upon rulers, and upon all influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential men, to exhibit an example of virtue and piety in all their words and actions.</p>
            <p>HAPPY muſt it be for that people, whoſe rulers feel the weight of this obligation. Bad examples are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contagious. The higher men are called in life, the greater in general is the influence of their example. If legiſlators diſregard the laws, they have framed, they practically declare ſuch laws are of no conſequence.—One of the moſt effectual methods, to induce men to obey the laws, is for thoſe, who preſcribe them, to ſet the example. Highly favored is that people, whoſe legiſlators may each, with an honeſt heart ſay, as a great and wiſe ruler in Iſrael ſaid to the people, "look on me, as I do, ſo do ye."</p>
            <p>IN every view it muſt be the higheſt wiſdom in all elections to have an eye to the religious character of men as well, as to the other qualifications. What can have greater influence upon the minds and conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences of Rulers, to excite them to fidelity in diſcharge of the duties of their office, than an habitual ſenſe of the all ſeeing eye of Deity, joined to a firm perſuaſion, that the moſt exalted, who live, as GODS on earth, muſt die like men, and appear at the awful tribunal of GOD, who is no reſpecter of perſons, and be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rewarded according to their works.</p>
            <p>IF the influence of religion be ſo eſſential to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs; then the encouraging of virtue and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030454_0018_0FE6E280A62F5C30"/>
piety, and diſcountenancing of all profanity, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, profanation of the Lord's day; all public ſhows, and plays, and every thing, which tends to diſſipate the minds, and corrupt the morals of youth, or the people at large, claim the attention of our wiſe and virtuous Rulers, the guardians of our laws and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. On ſome of theſe vices, particularly on profanity, intemperance, and profanation of the holy Sabbath, with their baneful influence upon ſociety, I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate, were it not that I ſhould intrude too much upon your patience. One vice however I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to mention. I mean ſlander or detraction. This, whether it proceed from the tongue, the pen, or the preſs, is an evil of the meaneſt, blackeſt die, and of the moſt miſchievous tendency. Its envenomed ſhafts often aim a deadly blow at the faireſt and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant characters, to wound and deſtroy that good name, which is better, than great riches; yea, that is next to life itſelf. When long tried virtue, diſtinguiſhed merit, and ſignal ſervices are repaid with ingratitude and abuſe, can it be expected, that men of integrity will be willing to continue in the ſervice of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? If men of this character be driven from office, and others ſucceed them, who prefer private emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the public welfare, we ſhall, when too late, rue the folly and wickedneſs of the conduct, which produced the change. Slander is an evil of ſuch mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, that no bounds can be ſet to its miſchievous conſequence. Well might the wiſe preacher call the defamer a madman, who caſteth fire-brands, arrows, and death. With infinite reaſon did the inſpired A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle repreſent the defaming tongue, as a fire, a world of iniquity, that ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and as ſet on fire of hell.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing however, to be feared from an open, manly, honeſt, and decent inveſtigation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic men and meaſures. The right of free diſcuſſion and private judgement is the glory of every free Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. But, when this degenerates into falſehood, ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030454_0019_0FE6E280AFA54018"/>
and perſonal abuſe; no indignation nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt can be too great to be expreſſed againſt it.—Happy, thrice happy will it be for America, when the principles of chriſtianity, and the energy of good morals ſhall influence every heart, dictate every tougue, and guide in every action. Then will harmony of opinion, peace, and truth pervade every part of the United States. Then will wrath and bitterneſs ceaſe, faction hide its monſtrous head, iniquity be done away, and, the kingdom of the Redeemer flouriſh.</p>
            <p>We muſt paſt over many other inferences and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which naturally ſuggeſt themſelves from this fruitful ſubject.</p>
            <p>THIS day recalls to our grateful remembrance, what we have heard with our ears, and our Fathers have told us concerning the great things our all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious GOD hath done for this land. Our pious anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, on account of the diſſoluteneſs of manners and licentiouſneſs of the youth, among whom they reſided, "and fearing their poſterity through theſe temptations and vicious examples would degenerate, and religion die among them; for the ſake of purity of worſhip, and liberty of conſcience, and from a hope of laying a foundation for the propagation of the kingdom of CHRIST." left all that was dear in their native country, and planted themſelves in this then barbarous land.—From ſmall beginnings, by a ſeries of almoſt miraculous events, the United States have ariſen into an extenſive, flouriſhing nation.</p>
            <p>AND now, with reſpect to our conſtitutions, laws, and adminiſtration, civil and religious privileges, and with reſpect to our commercial and agricultural intereſts, may it not be affirmed, without an hyperbole, that we are the happieſt nation, that has exiſted, ſince the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtars ſang together, and the ſons of GOD ſhouted for joy at the creation of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:030454_0020_0FE6E28AE50A4108"/>WHAT gratitude is due to Heaven on this occaſion, for our State and Federal governments, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious privileges and bleſſings, we enjoy under them? With what grateful ſenſations ſhould we remember that wiſe and valiant band of ſtateſmen, warriors, and other patriots, whoſe great exertions have been employed in pulling down the ſtrong holds of tyranny and oppreſſion, and in rearing up the pillars of liberty, peace, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs? To do full juſtice to whoſe characters, would beggar the power of language. May their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories remain indelibly engraver on the heart of every American! But who, O who can render adequate thanks to GOD for WASHINGTON—whoſe wiſdom, and integrity, firmneſs and magnanimity, have excited the aſtoniſhment of the nations of the earth, and added a new wonder to the political world!</p>
            <p>WHAT is wanting, to render our national happineſs as complete, as the preſent ſtate of things will permit, but a juſt eſtimate of the numerous public bleſſings, whereby we are diſtinguiſhed from other nations, due gratitude to Heaven, and an expreſſion of this gratitude by a correſpondent behaviour. We ought however, to remember that a ſtate of proſperity is a ſtate of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It excites envy abroad, and lulls to ſecurity at home. It preſents us a mark for the wiles of thoſe, who are well verſed in intrigue; while our youth and inexperience render us unſuſpicious of their ſtratagems, and poorly qualify us to detect and defeat them. While we are juſt and faithful in the fulfilment of our engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all, as free and independent States, may we be proof againſt foreign arts, and foreign influence from every quarter.</p>
            <p>ON this auſpicious anniverſary, while many nations are ſitting in darkneſs, others are involved in the horrors of war, ſtruggling for the bleſſings we enjoy, and are groaning to be delivered from calamity, to behold our civil fathers, the heads of our tribes, here peaceably aſſembled to tranſact the great affairs of ſtate, what
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030454_0021_0FE6E28AECD51CA0"/>
heart does not ſwell with gratitude to Heaven? What tongue is not ready to break forth into a ſong of praiſe.</p>
            <p>HIS Excellency the Governor, his Honor the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor, the honorable the Council, and the honorable the Members of Legiſlature, will pleaſe accept my warmeſt and moſt reſpectful congratulations on this important, joyful occaſion. May Almighty GOD take your Excellency and Honors into his moſt holy protection! Influenced by the beſt of principles, the peaceable religion of the Prince of Peace, may wiſdom and unanimity attend your connſels and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; that the people may rejoice and ſay, bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath ſet ſuch wiſe and good men to rule over us. Wherefore let us be ſubject, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>MAY the various branches of the State and Federal governments, under the influence of the religion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, each in its proper ſphere, like the various orbs above, keep their proper places and balances, the one never encroaching upon, or interfering with the other, move on in harmonious rounds till time ſhall be no more!</p>
            <p>IF ſuch be the importance of morality and religion to the ſupport of the freedom and happineſs of ſociety; my much reſpected fathers and brethren in the miniſtry will never be wanting in their exertions to promote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles, and the chriſtian virtues among the people. I am happy in believing the great body of the Clergy, with a very few exceptions, are firm friends to our State and Federal governments, to our conſtituted authorities, to virtue and religion, peace and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among the people. And, if their united exertions and patient ſufferings in effecting the American revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are marks of patriotiſm, may they not juſtly lay claim to the title of chriſtian patriots? When the divine Saviour commands us to render to Ceſar the things that are Ceſar's, and to God the things that are God's—When the inſpired Paul ſolemnly charges Titus to put
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030454_0022_0FE6E28F13E4B660"/>
his hearers in mind to obey magiſtrates, and to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to every good work—When the inſpired Peter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly exhorts his hearers to ſubmit themſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake—When we hear the inſpired Jude denouncing his anathemas againſt thoſe, who diſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities; with ſuch divine commands, and enforcing examples before us, on any great emergency, ſhould the Clergy ſhow indifference, and not exert their influence to ſave their country; might not our divine Lord and Maſter ſay, as in another caſe, I tell you, if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out.—In every ſerious danger, on every important criſis, for Zion's ſake they will not hold their peace, and for Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem's ſake, they will not reſt, until the righteouſneſs thereof go forth, as brightneſs, and the ſalvation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as a lamp that burneth. They will plead that God will ſpare his people, that none among the nations of the earth may ſay of America, where is now their God?</p>
            <p>IN a word, may the conſideration of the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of virtue and religion to our public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happineſs, both preſent and future, engage every claſs of citizens to cultivate the chriſtian temper, and to promote ſobriety, peace, and good order in every ſphere of action; that our peace may be as a river, and our righteouſneſs, as the waves of the ſea! May the holy Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth; and that kingdom, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, univerſally prevail! That inſtead of wars and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Kings may become nurſing Fathers, and Queens nurſing Mothers to the people of God. Then will that ancient prophecy be fulfilled, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign forever aud ever.</p>
