            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label>Anſ:</label> This with many other things have been ſo often anſwered that we think it meerly needleſs to ſay much more of it; and as to the word Duſt, it was no ways ſpoken in contempt of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; but it was written againſt ſome few of old who ran so far into an extteam as to <hi>Deify as it were the very letter of the Scriptures,</hi> which, to be ſure, may be termed Duſt; and that there were ſuch Prieſts ſee <hi>G: F's Great Myſtery page 261;</hi> how one Roger Atkins affirmed <hi>That the Letter of the Scripture is God.</hi> And Richard Stoaks affirmed that the <hi>Scripture is God.</hi> And Jeremiah Jves affirmed, it was an error to ſay, the Letter of the Scripture <hi>is carnal.</hi> ibid: page 111.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' our friends in thoſe days have ſeemed to ſome to run ſomething into an extream by uſing ſuch expreſſions as they did
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001230_0014_0FB17D51AA9D4958"/>in oppoſition to ſuch extreams of thoſe ſort of prieſts, whoſe ſaid crooked expreſſions did need ſtraightning: we hope they are not to be condemned for uſing endeavours as they did for that end. As for the word Death,<note place="margin">Vind: Veritatis, page, 192.</note> as D: Philips ſaith, what difference is there between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aying, the Letter killeth, and the Letter is death; for the <hi>Apoſtle in Cor: 2.3 6. ſaith, The Letter killeth;</hi> and is not the ſenſe the ſame, tho' differently worded; and ſurely as the Apoſtle uſed not any ſlighting expreſſion of the Scripture; no more, we are well ſatisfied, did G: F: &amp;c. As for the words, Serpents meat, ſee alſo what the ſaid D: P: ſhews us in the ſame page, how the adverſary abuſively joyned thoſe following words together; which are not ſo in G: F's book viz. Your word is carnal. The Letter and the Light is carnal. The Letter, and ſo duſt is the Serpents meat &amp;c. Now to this D: P: aptly anſwers and ſayes, whereas, in that page there are twelve lines between, The Light is carnal the letter, and ſo duſt is the Serpents meat: in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſpace G: F: treats of Infants Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper: from theſe two Subjects coming between two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe words <hi>Beaſtly ware,</hi> we are, as to that, alſo much abuſed, G: W: ſaith. <q>I have examined the ſaid book out of which the ſaid expreſſions have been pretended to be taken, I find no ſuch groſs expreſſions, as calling the Scripture, beaſtly ware, but divers ſevere reflections upon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, perſecuting prieſts in thoſe days; writ by ſome priſoners at York-Caſtle, 1653:<note place="margin">A brief Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, pa: 9.</note> and what is there called beaſtly ware, is not the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons Merchants <hi>ſell for a large price (i: e.)</hi> A rabble of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the word <hi>Jdol,</hi> ſeeing there is no book quoted, we only ſay thus, that to ſet up any creature ſo as to call it God, is to idolize that creature; but in thoſe days, as above, ſome Prieſts did ſo ſet up the Letter, which is a creature, ſo as to call it God. What then did they leſs than idolize the creature?</p>
            <p>But now, to ſhew that our friends have from the beginning had a high and reverend eſteem of the Holy Scriptures, ſee firſt what G: F: ſaith of them in anſwer to thoſe very prieſts that ſaid the Letter was God &amp;c.

               <hi>our bodies</hi> are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſts and our Saviour as plainly tells us, that the Father is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped at Jeruſalem; nor at the Mountain &amp;c. but as God is a Spirit, ſo they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in <hi>Spirit and in Truth;</hi> and that it's ſuch the Father ſeeks to worſhip him. And as we find things thus under the Goſpel (viz) the Temple of God to be the bodies of the Saints and that the time of reformation is come in which ended the meats, drinks, divers waſhings and carnal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the waſhing is now to be with pure water, and the Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is to be that of the heart, from an evil Conſcience; and that the Baptiſm and drinking is to be by and into one Spirit, and the ſinging is to be in the Spirit: and in ſhort that the Father is to be worſhip'd in Spirit. So that upon the whole we cannot therefore find it any ways unſcriptural to conclude that none of thoſe things are now outwardly to be practiſ'd as Ordinances of the Goſpel Commanded by our bleſſed Saviour or his holy Apoſtles; but rather that it is ſomething <hi>beſides the very nature of the new Covenant as diſtinguiſhed from the old,</hi>

               <p>Obſerve reader, here is all that's mentioned of the attire of the Whore, is there any thing here ſaid as D: L: aſſerts, viz: <hi>that the Scripture is the attire of the Whore, the falſe Church which brings none to know God or Chriſt?</hi> No, we ſee it was the ground of their Worſhip, Laws, &amp;c: that ſprung up in the Apoſtacy, ſince the Whore ſate as a Queen, that had not the Spirit to give them the underſtanding of the Scripture, and all the invented Practices, Forms and Images of the divers Opinions, which they all wrongfully pretend the Scripture was the foundation of, when it was only their own twiſting and turning them &amp;c: Was that he called the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of the Whore;</hi> but as to the Scriptures, we ſee he expreſly calls them <hi>the Writings of the holy men of God, words of Truth ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth &amp;c:</hi> but as the reader may ſee, he doth not call the Scripture <hi>the Attire of the Whore, the falſe Church which brings none to know God or Chriſt,</hi> as this D: L: ſo very abuſively, expreſsly renders him to ſay; therefore for this alſo <hi>he ought to make ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, ſee his <hi>May</hi> month 1704<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cites a paſſage of a blaſphemous Letter, which he ſaith, was writ by <hi>John Audland to G: F:</hi> beginning thus <hi>Dear and precious One, in whom is my life bound up, and my ſtrength in thee ſtands, by thy breathings I am nouriſhed, by thee is my ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.

               </p>
               <p>Now as confidently as D: L: affirms this was from <hi>John Audland</hi> in a Letter to G: F: without any pretence of proof that it was ſo. So we have many reaſons to believe the contrary, ſome of which are aptly laid down by our friend <hi>Joſeph Wyeth</hi> in page 483 of the <hi>Switch for the Snake,</hi> which reaſons take as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſome pieces of it, [meaning the aforeſaid Letter] but have contradicted one another as to the matter of it, by which contradiction in terms it is fully ſhewn that they could not all be right, as they pretended they were. Again ſaith he, "this pretended Letter from <hi>John Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to G: F: was not ſo well contrived, but the forgers who have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore given it with a date, have made it bear date from <hi>Briſtoll</hi> Anno 1665. this was a very unlucky overſight, which as it cannot now be mended, ſo it abſolutely overthrows the pretence of it's being his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>John Audland</hi> was buried in <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> the 24 of the firſt month 1663, being the laſt day of that year, ſo that it appears he was dead about two years before the date of the pretended Letter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now obſerve, ſince D: L: hath expreſly called it <hi>John Audland's</hi> Letter to G: F: upon our diſowning and denying it to be ſo upon ſuch good grounds as above, he ought to prove it as well as charge, and until he ſo do, how can we eſteem him leſs than a falſe accuſer of us herein alſo; and fo as that for which he <hi>ought to make ſatisfaction.</hi>
