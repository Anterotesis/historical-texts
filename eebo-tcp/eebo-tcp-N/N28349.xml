            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe three unfortunate young men were attended, from the time they received their ſentence, to the day of their execution, by clergymen of different perſuaſions, and they employed themſelves almoſt unremittedly in acts of devotion; and appeared truly penitent, and anxious to obtain favour from an offended God, through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037781_0005_100F4C95EC566720"/>
               <hi>Peter La Croix, ſhortly before his execution, gave the following account of his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>"I was born in Flanders; my parents gave me a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and my mother, particularly, never failed to give the beſt admonitions; but, unfortunately, I did not comply with them; on the contrary, I followed my own wicked inclinations. I was only a boy when I went to ſea, and I engaged at laſt in the Low-Dutch, or Holland ſervice; but, not liking this, I went over to England. I ſoon returned from thence to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and; in order not to be brought to puniſhment as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, I changed my name, and called myſelf <hi>Peter Peterson.</hi> My reſtleſs ſpirit ſoon drove me away from Holland again; and I wandered from one place to another.</p>
               <p>"During the whole time, after I had left my parents, I led a very ungodly life. I had not, nor did I care, for any good book; and, particularly, I never read in that book, which is now my only conſolation,—<hi>the Bible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"God and Eternity were only my ſport. I was a true blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer; and I now recollect, with horror, that I actually lifted up my fiſt againſt the Almighty; and, in the tumult of my paſſion challenged his vengeance.</p>
               <p>"I could ſay a great deal about the dreadful murder on board of the Eliza, but I think it unneceſſary: This one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I cannot, however, conceal, that <hi>I never actually kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one myself of those who were murdered:</hi> But this does not excuſe me, becauſe I could have ſaved their lives: Yet, though it was in my power, as I did not prevent the murder, but, on the contrary, ſided with thoſe who perpetrated it, I have certainly deſerved death, and ſhortly ſhall juſtly ſuffer what my actions merit."</p>
            </q>
            <p>To the above, we have to add, that the name of La Croix was no more his real name than that of Peterſon; and he certainly had his reaſons why he changed his name the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time—reaſons which were obviouſly not founded on his good behaviour.</p>
            <p>He diſcloſed his real name to one of the miniſters, who viſited him: but begged that it might be kept a ſecret, as he did not wiſh to expoſe his relations to that diſgrace which the publicity of his unhappy end undoubtedly would.</p>
            <p>According to his account, he is of a reſpectable family; and his mother, brethren, and ſiſters were yet alive, as far as he knew.</p>
            <p>The author of this ſhort account did not ſee the priſoner until ſentence had been paſſed on him; and, therefore, can
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037781_0006_100F4C984F9E0048"/>only relate what ſituation he found him in, during that ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
            <p>The unhappy man was, in thoſe days, as much as appeared, quiet, and perfectly reſigned. His chief occupation was the ſtudy of the Scriptures; and, in theſe, the Old. Teſtament as well as the New, he was ſurpriſingly verſed. He made many ſenſible and ſtriking remarks upon ſome texts, which might otherwiſe be accounted difficult; and it appeared, plainly, that he underſtood what he read. It was a great advantage to him, that, in his early days, he had been well acquainted with the Bible; for, although he afterwards reviled the ſame, and even ſcoffed at it, yet, at the hour of death, it was his only refuge; and this, without a doubt, becauſe the bleſſed recollection of what it had been to him in his youth, encouraged him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. He confeſſed that he never had cared for the Scriptures ſince his infancy, until he was confined in the cell of the Philadelphia Priſon. In this diſtreſs, he knew of no other remedy to allay his apprehenſions. He read, and the more he read, the more he wiſhed to read; and he muſt really have been very induſtrious, in this his employment, or elſe it would have been impoſſible, that, in ſo ſhort a time, he ſhould have become ſo well acquainted with this book, as he really was.</p>
            <p>When viſited, he complained of nothing more than of the hardneſs of his heart. This he looked upon as the ſevereſt judgment of God, which the Lord had inflicted upon him for his enormous iniquities. He acknowledged how great the difference was between the faith of the head and of the heart: He complained that the latter remained ſo ſtrange to him. He prayed frequently; yet, according to his own declaration, altho' the words proceeded from his mouth, his heart and ſentiments had no ſhare therein. He believed in Jeſus as his Saviour; but this belief made no impreſſion upon his heart. He ſhewed great concern, leſt the Lord ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, and that he would hardly accept of a ſinner like him. His approaching end, did not, according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, occaſion in him any fear. He confeſſed that he had perfectly deſerved this puniſhment; but, that the judgment of God, and of eternity, were dreadful to him: That the recollection of his ſins, and the damnation which he had deſerved, were the gnawing worm of his heart.</p>
            <p>In this ſorry and dreadful ſituation of mind, he was found conſtantly, until about three days before his execution: when beamed a ſmall glimpſe of grace upon his darkened ſoul. A very applicable German Hymn was read to him, which drew the firſt tears from his eyes, and his heart was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably releaved by it. From that moment, he began to be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037781_0007_100F4C9A2F1F4B20"/>more eaſy. He now peruſed the Scriptures with more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: Reading Luke 11, 1, 12, he exclaimed: <hi>"Now this must be true, what Jesus has said, for be never spoke an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; and so the Almighty God will, for all, hear my prayers."</hi> And here-his-eyes were bathed in tears.</p>
            <p>The above-mentioned Hymn gave great conſolation to him; he read it himſelf, and he cauſed it to be read to him repeatedly.</p>

               </gap> morning of his life, when he was viſited, and aſked how it was now with him? his anſwer was, <hi>"Oh, it is better,—much better with me. I had a very good night; I have prayed the whole night. The Lord Jesus ordered me to watch and pray! No sleep came into my Eyes, and I feel now much easier."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly important it was to him, that which he had read that morning in Harvey's Meditations on the Night, where he introduces a Latin Motto on a Sun-dial. The tranſlation of which is, <hi>"On this moment depends an eternity." Each moment;</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is now, for certain, to me, an eternity; and, for that reason, I like to do nothing better than praying:</hi>

            <p>During this converſation, a woman came in, who ſaid that ſhe was his mother. He looked at her without the leaſt emotion; and only ſaid, <hi>"no,—no,—that is not my mother. I know that my mother could not be in Philadelphia."</hi> It is ſaid that the woman, herſelf, afterwards, acknowledged her error.</p>
            <p>As one of thoſe, who viſited him took his leave, (burſting into tears) he ſaid, <hi>"Ah! I hope and I believe we shall see one another again in bliss with the Lord. Farewell—farewell, and thanks for your kindness."</hi>

            <p>He had given to the ſame perſon, the evening before, a Letter, with a requeſt to forward the ſame to his brother, and to deſire him to inform his mother of his fate; at leaſt, of his death. Here follows the tranſlation of the letter, which was written in the Low-Dutch language.</p>

                  <p>THIS is the laſt letter which you will receive from me; and I hope that the great and Almighty God, will let you come to a better end than that which I am come to: Becauſe I forſook the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037781_0008_100F4C9BF1F79870"/>God, my latter end is truly unfortunate. I hope you will take this to heart, and, with your whole ſoul, cleave to God, who can deliver us from evil. Dear brother, I write this in chains and fetters, about twenty hours before my death, in hopes that you will take the ſame to heart, and truſt in him, whom I had forſaken,—but on whom I now place my only hopes, and confide in his unmerited mercy. I hope that you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me with brotherly love. I herewith conclude, recommending you, as likewiſe my poor ſoul, into the hands of the God of my fathers, and wiſh you an eternal <hi>good night.</hi> And, as I hope to obtain the grace of God, I recommend you into the hands of my Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt; and I now go to <hi>eternal reſt</hi>—Amen.—Greet all friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances in the name of the Lord my God, and your God—Amen.</p>

            <p>Reader! The crimes of theſe young men were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that can be committed in civil ſociety—and highly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by many attrocious circumſtances. Although they have not furniſhed the world with a particular account of their paſt lives, it is almoſt certain, that, though young men, they had purſued a diſſolute and abandoned courſe,—regardleſs of God, before whom they are now to be judged—and who, in his all-wiſe Providence, ſtopped them in their vicious career.</p>
            <p>Murder is a crime of ſo deep a dye, that it ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eſcapes a temporal puniſhment;—though God, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy, may grant repentance, and, thereby, the unhappy perpetrator may not be finally ſhut out from eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037781_0009_100F4C9EEBD61F48"/>
How much reaſon had theſe perſons to rejoice, that they were brought to a city, where the conſolation of the goſpel were held out to them, by pious divines;—that they were not ſnatched into eternity, from their wicked courſes, in a moment, without time or opportunity to reflect on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, of their miſpent life, and the diſregard they had paid to the commandments of God, or the laws of man.</p>
            <p>It is ſincerely hoped, that their untimely fate may be a warning to all young men, to forſake the paths of vice, and to remember their Creator in the days of their youth—to gain a living by honeſt induſtry, rather than by violence upon the perſons or property of others, in whatever ſtations they are alloted to,—whether by Land or Sea.</p>
            <p>They were taken from the cells about 11 o'clock, dreſſed, in white, in one cart, accompanied by two clergymen, to Market-ſtreet wharf, where they were put on beard a boat, and conveyed to the place of execution, on the Iſland, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Dock-ſtreet, and guarded by the marſhall, ſheriff and other peace-officers. They continued in prayer until near twelve o'clock; when the executioner performed his laſt office to them, and they were launched into eternity, in the view of an immenſe concourſe of ſpectators, who crouded the wharfs and the ſhipping. They made no other ſpeech, than begging the world to forgive them, as they forgave every perſon in it.</p>
            <p>Captain Wheland was preſent, with whom they ſhook hands, as they did with each other, previous to the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their exiſtence.</p>
