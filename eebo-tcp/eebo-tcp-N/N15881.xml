            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHILE I obey with sincere pleasure the commands of the respectable assembly whom I have now the honor to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, I feel the most trying emotions of anxiety and apprehension in attempting to perform so difficult and serious a duty, as that prescribed to me at our last meeting. The importance and novelty of the subject, the injurious consequences of mistaken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions on it and your presence necessarily excite feelings such as these. They are lessened however, by the hope of some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020305_0004_0FAE9A66535AF8A8"/>
to that part of my fellow citizens, who depend for comfort on our native manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and by an ardent wish to promote e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very measure, that will give to our new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born states the strength of manhood. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by these considerations and relying on the kind indulgence, which is ever shewn to well meant endeavours, however unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, I shall venture to proceed.</p>
            <p>PROVIDENCE has bestowed upon the United States of America means of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as great and numerous, as are enjoyed by any country in the world. A soil fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diversifiedâ€”a healthful climateâ€”mighty rivers and adjacent seas abounding with fish are the great advantages for which we are indebted to a beneficent creator. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture, manufactures and commerce, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally arising from these sources, afford to our industrious citizens certain subsistence and innumerable opportunities of acquiring wealth. To arrange our affairs in salutary
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020305_0005_0FAE9A66F8322B60"/>
and well digested systems, by which the fruits of industry, in every line, may be most easily attained, and the possession of property and the blessings of liberty may be completely securedâ€”these are the important objects, that should engross our present attention. The interests of commerce and the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a just and effective government are already committed to the care of THE AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUST BODY now sitting in our capital.â€”The importance of agriculture has long since recommended it to the patronage of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous associations, and the attention of all the legislaturesâ€”but manufactures, at least in Pennsylvania, have had but a few uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected friends, till sound policy and public spirit gave a late, but auspicious birth, to this Society.</p>
            <p>THE situation of America before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution was very unfavourable to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this institution. The prohibition of most foreign raw materialsâ€”considerable
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020305_0006_0FAE9A67B1E2C080"/>
bounties in England for carrying away the unwrought productions of this country to that, as well as on exporting British goods from their marketsâ€”the preference for those goods, which habit carried much beyond what their excellence would justify, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other circumstances created artificial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, that appeared almost insuperable. Several branches however were carried on to good advantage. But as long as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in our colonial situation, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress was very slow, and indeed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of attention to manufactures was not so urgent, as it has become since our assuming an independent station. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of those, whom the decline of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation has deprived of their usual occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionsâ€”the consumption of the encreasing produce of our lands and fisheries, and the certainty of supplies in the time of war are weighty reasons for establishing new manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories now, which existed but in a small degree, or not at all, before the revolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020305_0007_0FAE9A6982797BE0"/>
WHILE we readily admit, that in taking measures to promote the objects of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, nothing should be attempted, which may injure our agricultural interests, they being undoubtedly the most important, we must observe in justice to ourselves, that very many of our citizens, who are expert at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and the useful arts, are entirely unacquainted with rural affairs, or unequal to the expences of a new settlement; and many we may believe, will come among us invited to our shores from foreign countries, by the blessings of liberty, civil and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We may venture to assert too, that more profit to the individual and riches to the nation will be derived from some manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, which promote agriculture, than from any species of cultivation whatever. The truth of this remark however, will be better determined, when the subject shall be further considered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020305_0008_0FAE9A6A5DA19A10"/>
LET us endeavor first to disencumber ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of the objections, that appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, the principal of which are, the high rate of labor, which involves the price of provisionsâ€”the want of a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hands on any terms,â€”the scarcity and dearness of raw materialsâ€”want of skill in the business itself and its unfavorable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on the health of the people.</p>
            <p>FACTORIES, which can be carried on by watermills, windmills, fire, horses and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines ingeniously contrived, are not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with any heavy expence of boarding, lodging, cloathing and paying workmen, and they multiply the force of hands to a great extent without taking our people from agriculture. By wind and water machines we can make pig and bar iron, nail rods, tire, sheet-iron, sheet-copper and sheet-brass, anchors, meal of all kinds, gunpowder, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, printing and hanging paper, snuff, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed oil, boards, plank and scantling; and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020305_0009_0FAE9A6B5BAE45F0"/>
they assist us in finishing scythes, sickles and woolen cloths. Strange as it may appear they also card, spin and weave by water in the European factories. Bleaching and tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must not be omitted, while we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the usefulness of water.</p>
            <p>BY FIRE we conduct our breweries, distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, salt and potash works, sugar houses, potteries, casting and steel furnaces, works for animal and vegetable oils and refining drugs. Steam mills have not yet been adopted in America, but we shall probably see them after a short time in New-England and other places, where there are few mill seats and in this and other great towns of the United States. The city of Philadelphia, by adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of them, might make a saving of above five <hi>per cent.</hi> on all the grain brought hither by water, which is afterwards manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured into meal, and they might be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied to many other valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:020305_0010_0FAE9A6C5244AA90"/>
HORSES give us, in some instances, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the difficulties we are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obviate. They grind the tanners bark and potters clay; they work the brewers and distillers pumps, and might be applied, by an inventive mind, as the moving prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of many kinds of mills.</p>
            <p>MACHINES ingeniously constructed, will give us immense assistance.â€”The cotton and silk manufacturers in Europe are possessed of some, that are invaluable to them. One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance I have had precisely ascertained, which employs a few hundreds of women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and performs the work of 12000 card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, spinners and winders. They have been so curiously improved of late years, as to weave the most complicated manufactures. In short, combinations of machines with fire and water have already performed much more than was formerly expected from them by the most visionary enthusiast on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Perhaps I may be too sanguine, but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020305_0011_0FAE9A6D1BF18C98"/>
they appear to me fraught with immense ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to us, and full of danger to the manufacturing nations of Europe; for should they continue to use and improve them, as they have heretofore done, their people must be driven to us for want of employment, and if, on the other hand, they should return to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual labor, we shall underwork them by these invaluable engines. We may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borrow some of their inventions and others of the same nature we may strike out our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for on the subject of mechanism A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica may justly pride herself. Every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of machinery may be expected from a country, A NATIVE SON of which, reaching this inestimable object at its highest point, has epitomized the motions of the spheres, that roll throughout the universe <note n="*" place="bottom">David Rittenhouse, <abbr>Esq.</abbr> of Pennsylvania.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE lovers of mankind, supported by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced physicians, and the opinions of enlightened politicians, have objected to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020305_0012_0FAE9A6DB4473590"/>
as unfavorable to the health of the people. Giving to this humane and important consideration its full weight, it furnishes an equal argument against several other occupations, by which we obtain our comforts and promote our agriculture. The painting business for instanceâ€”reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marshesâ€”clearing swampsâ€”the culture of rice and indigo and some other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are even more fatal to those, who are engaged in them. But this objection is urged principally against carding, spinning and weaving, which were formerly manual and sedentary occupations. Our plan, as we have already shewn, is not to pursue those modes, unless in cases particularly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced, for we are sensible, that our people must not be diverted from their farms. <hi>Horses, and the potent elements of fire and water, aided by the faculties of the human mind ( except in a few healthful instances ) are to be our daily labourers.</hi> After giving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate relief to the industrious poor, these
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020305_0013_0FAE9A6E8ED13E50"/>
unhurtful means will be pursued and will procure us private wealth and national pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
            <p>EMIGRATION from Europe will also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and assist us. The blessings of civil and religious liberty in America, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of most foreign governments, the want of employment at home and the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of profit here, curiosity, domestic unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, civil wars and various other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances will bring many manufacturers to this asylum for mankind. Ours will be their industry, and what is of still more consequence ours will be their skill. Interest and necessity, with such instructors, will teach us quickly. In the last century the manufactures of France were next to none; they are now worth millions to her yearly. Those of England have been more improved within the last twelve years, than in the preceding fifty. At the peace of 1762, the useful arts and manufactures
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020305_0014_0FAE9A6F4D3C5DE0"/>
were scarcely known in America. How great has been their progress since, unaided, undirected and discouraged. Countenanced by your patronage and promoted by your assistance, what may they not be 'ere such another space of time shall elapse.</p>
            <p>WONDERFUL as it must appear, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers of beer, that best of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, have lately been obliged to import malt from England. Here must be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable neglect, or a strange blindness to our most obvious interests. The cultivation of barley should certainly be more attended to, and if I mistake not exceedingly, the present abundant crop of wheat will so fill our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, that the farmer, who shall reap barley the ensuing year, will find it the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable of all grains. We cannot, however, have any permanent difficulty on this article.</p>
            <p>OF flax and hemp little need be said, but that we can encrease them as we please, which we shall do according to the demand.</p>

WOOL must become much more abundant as our country populates. Mutton is the best meat for cities, manufactories, semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of learning, and poor houses, and should be given by rule as in England. The set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of our new lands, remote from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carriage, must introduce much more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turage and grazing, than has been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore necessary, as sheep, horses and horned cattle will carry themselves to market through roads impassable by waggons. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions of our trade will also tend to encrease the number of sheep, horses and horned cattle, used to form a great part of the New-England cargoes for the English West-India islands. These animals are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to those places now in very small numbers, as our vessels are excluded from their ports.â€”The farms, capital and men, which were formerly employed in raising them, will want a market for their usual quantity, and the nature of that country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

unfit for grain, sheep must occupy a great proportion of their lands.</p>
            <p>COTTON thrives as well in the southern states, as in any part of the world. The West-India islands and those states raised it formerly, when the price was not half what it has been for years past in Europe. It is also worth double the money in America, which it sold for before the revolution, all the European nations having prohibited the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of it from their respective colonies to any foreign country. It is much to be desired, that the southern planters would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the cultivation of an article from which the best informed manufacturers calculate the greatest profits, and on which some esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished factories depend.</p>
            <p>SILK has long been a profitable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Georgia and other parts of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, and may be encreased, I presume, as fast as the demand will rise. This is the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020305_0017_0FAE9A7426CE76A8"/>
strongest of all raw materials and the great empire of China, though abounding with cotton, finds it the cheapest cloathing for her people.</p>
            <p>IRON we have in great abundance, and a sufficiency of lead and copper, were labor low enough to extract them from the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth.</p>
            <p>MADDER has scarcely been attempted, but this and many other dye stuffs may be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to advantage, or found in America.</p>
            <p>UNDER all the disadvantages which have attended manufactures and the useful arts, it must afford the most comfortable reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every patriotic mind to observe their progress in the United States and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Pennsylvania. For a long time after our forefathers sought an establishment in this place, then a dreary wilderness, every thing necessary for their simple wants was the work of European hands. How great
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020305_0018_0FAE9A75AD974F78"/>
â€”how happy is the change. The list of articles we now make ourselves, if particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly enumerated would fatigue the ear, and waste your valuable time. Permit me however to mention them under their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads: meal of all kinds, ships and boats, malt and distilled liquors, potash, gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cordage, loaf-sugar, pasteboard, cards and paper of every kind, books in various languages, snuff, tobacco, starch, cannon, musquets, anchors, nails, and very many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles of iron, bricks, tiles, potters ware, mill-stones, and other stone work, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet work, trunks and Windsor chairs, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and harness of all kinds, corn-fans, ploughs and many other implements of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, sadlery and whips, shoes and boots, leather of various kinds, hosiery, hats and gloves, wearing apparel, coarse linens, and woolens, and some cotton goods, linseed and fish-oil, wares of gold, silver, tin, pewter, lead, brass and copper, clocks and watches,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020305_0019_0FAE9A7649A2C048"/>
wool and cotton cards, printing types, glass and stone ware, candles, soap and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther valuable articles with which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory cannot furnish us at once.</p>
            <p>IF the nations of Europe possess some great advantages over us in manufacturing for the rest of the world, it is however clear, that there are some capital circumstances in our favor, when they meet us in our own mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. The expences of importing raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, which in some instances they labor under, while we do notâ€”the same charges in bringing their commodities hitherâ€”the duties we must lay on their goods for the purposes of revenueâ€”the additional duties, though small, which we may venture to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose without risquing the corruption of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals or the loss of the revenue by smugglingâ€”the prompt payment our workmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveâ€”the long credits they give on their goodsâ€”the sale of our articles by the piece to the consumer, while they sell theirs by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020305_0020_0FAE9A76B4524D68"/>
the invoice to an intermediate purchaserâ€”the durable nature of some American manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, especially of linensâ€”the injuries theirs often sustain from their mode of bleach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingâ€”these things taken together will give us an advantage of twenty-five to fifty <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cent.</hi> on many articles, and must work the total exclusion of several others.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the difference in the qualities of American and European linens, arising from the mode of bleaching, there is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable saving of expence from the same cause. So much and so powerful a sunshine saves a great loss of time and expence of bleaching-drugs and preparations, and this will be sensibly felt in our factories of linen and cotton.</p>
            <p>WE must carefully examine the conduct of other countries in order to possess our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their methods of encouraging ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories and pursue such of them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020305_0021_0FAE9A777595AE90"/>
to our own situation, so far as it may be in our powerâ€”Exempting raw materials, dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuffs, and certain implements for manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing from duty on importation is a very proper measure. Premiums for useful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and improvements, whether Foreign or American, for the best experiments in any unknown matter, and for the largest quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of any valuable raw material must have an excellent effect. They would assist the efforts of industry, and hold out the noble incentive of honorable distinction to merit and genius. The state might with great convenience enable an enlightened Society, established for the purpose, to offer liberal rewards in land for a number of objects of this nature. Our funds of that kind are considerable and almost dormant. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled tract of a thousand acres, as it may be paid for at this time, yields very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the state. By offering these premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums for useful inventions to any citizen of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020305_0022_0FAE9A7836E2D3B8"/>
the Union, or to any foreigner, who would become a citizen, we might often acquire in the man a compensation for the land, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the merit which gave it to him. If he should be induced to settle among us with a family and property, it would be of more consequence to the state than all the purchase money.</p>
            <p>IT might answer an useful purpose, if a committee of this society should have it in charge to visit every ship arriving with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers from any foreign country, in order to enquire what persons they may have on board capable of constructing useful machines, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to carry on manufactures, or coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us with a view to that kind of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It would be a great relief and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to those friendless people in a land of strangers, and would fix many among us whom little difficulties might incline to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:020305_0023_0FAE9A79020A3780"/>
EXTREME poverty and idleness in the citizens of a free government will ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vicious habits and disobedience to the laws, and must render the people fit instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the dangerous purposes of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men. In this light the employment of our poor in manufactures, who cannot find other honest means of a subsistence, is of the utmost consequence. A man oppress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by extreme want is prepared for all evil, and the idler is ever prone to wickedness, while the habits of industry, filling the mind with honest thoughts, and requiring the time for better purposes, do not leave leisure for meditating or executing mischief.</p>
            <p>AN extravagant and wasteful use of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign manufactures, has been too just a charge against the people of America, since the close of the war. They have been so cheap, so plenty and so easily obtained on credit, that the consumption of them has been absolutely wanton. To such an excess
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020305_0024_0FAE9A79BB39BA58"/>
has it been carried, that the importation of the finer kinds of coat, vest and sleeve but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, buckles, broaches, breastpins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trinkets into this port only, is supposed to have amounted in a single year to ten thousand pounds sterling, which cost the wearers above 60,000 dollars. This lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evil has suggested to many enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minds a wish for sumptuary regulations, and even for an unchanging national dress suitable to the climate, and the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the country. A more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use of such manufactures as we can make ourselves, would wean us from the folly we have just now spoken of and would produce, in a safe way, some of the best effects of sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary laws. Our dresses, furniture and carriages would be fashionable, because they were Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican and proper in our situation, not because they were foreign, shewy or expensive. Our farmers, to their great honor and advantage, have been long in the excellent oeconomical
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020305_0025_0FAE9A7AB1D9D358"/>
practice of domestic manufactures for their own use, at least in many parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is chiefly in the towns that this madness for foreign finery rages and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroysâ€”There unfortunately the disorder is epidemical. It behoves us to consider our untimely passion for European luxuries as a malignant and alarming symptom, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convulsions and dissolution to the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical body. Let us hasten then to apply the most effectual remedies, ere the disease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inveterate, lest unhappily we should find it incurable.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude this address, gentlemen, without taking notice of <hi>the very favorable and prodigious effects upon the landed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> which may result from manufactures. The breweries of Philadelphia in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent infant state require forty thousand bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of barley annually, and when the stock on hand of English beer shall be consumed, will call for a much larger quantity. Could
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020305_0026_0FAE9A7B342987E8"/>
the use of malt liquors be more generally introduced, it would be, for many reasons, a most fortunate circumstance. Without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting on the pernicious effects of distilled liquors, it is sufficient for our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to observe, that a thousand hogsheads of rum and brandy, mixt with water for common use, will make as much strong drink as will require 120,000 bushels of grain to make an equivalent quantity of beer, besides the horses, fuel, hops, and other articles of the country, which a brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery employs. The fruits of the earth and the productions of nature in America are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so required by various other manufacturers, whom you will remember without enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But it is not in their occupations only, that these valuable citizens call for our native commodities. They and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who work in foreign articles, with their wives, children and servants necessarily consume in food and raiment a prodigious
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020305_0027_0FAE9A7E994E31F8"/>
quantity of our produce, and the buildings for the accommodation of their families and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness are principally drawn from our lands. Their effects upon agriculture are of more consequence than has ever been supposed by those, who have not made the necessary esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. So great are the benefits to the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed interest, which are derived from them, that we may venture to assert without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of mistake, that the value of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican productions annually applied to their various uses, as just now stated, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the manufacturers of flour, lumber and bar-iron, is double the aggregate amount of all our exports in the most plentiful year with which Providence has ever blessed this fruitful country.â€”How valuable is this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for our encreasing produceâ€”How clearly does it evince the importance of our present plan. But we may venture to proceed a step furtherâ€”Without manufactures the progress of agriculture must be arrested on the frontiers
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020305_0028_0FAE9A7FCDAD01D0"/>
of Pennsylvania. Though we have a country practicable for roads, our western counties are yet unable to support them, and too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote perhaps to use land carriage of the most easy kind. Providence has given them, in certain prospect, a passage by water; but the natural impediments, though very inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and the more cruel obstructions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from political circumstances, are yet to be removed. The inhabitants of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile tracts adjacent to the waters of the Ohio, Potowmack and Susquehannah, besides the cultivation of grain must extend their views immediately to pasturage and grazing and even to manufactures. Foreign trade will never take off the fruits of their labor in their native state. They must manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture first for their own consumption, and when the advantages of their mighty wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall be no longer suspended, they must become the great factory of American raw materials for the United States. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sources
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020305_0029_0FAE9A808764FD78"/>
in wood and water are very great, their treasures in coal are almost peculiar, As they cannot sell their grain but for home consumption and must propagate sheep and cattle for the reasons above stated, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will in a short time be the cheapest upon earth. Let us observe the reduction of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and raw materials, which even the present year will produce among them, and thence judge, with the necessary considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the time to come.</p>
            <p>How numerous and important then, do the benefits appear, which may be expected from this salutary design! It will consume our native productions now encreasing to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundanceâ€”it will improve our agriculture and teach us to explore the fossil and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kingdoms, into which few researches have heretofore been madeâ€”it will accelerate the improvement of our internal navigation and bring into action the dormant powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the elementsâ€”it will lead us once
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020305_0030_0FAE9A81383D00D0"/>
more into the paths of virtue by restoring frugality and industry, those potent antidotes to the vices of mankind and will give us real independence by rescuing us from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of foreign fashions, and the destructive torrent of luxury.</p>
            <p>SHOULD these blessed consequences ensue, those severe restrictions of the European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have already impelled us to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the distant regions of the eastern hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, defeating the schemes of short-sighted politicians will prove, through the wisdom and goodness of Providence, the means of our POLITICAL SALVATION.</p>
