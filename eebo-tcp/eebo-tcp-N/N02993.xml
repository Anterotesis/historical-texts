            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>What ſhall one then anſwer the Meſſengers of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? That the Lord hath founded Zion and the Poor of his People ſhall truſt in it.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is no ſmall Part of the Duty of Zion's Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to obſerve, and lead their People with them into a religious Improvement of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Providences. And ſince theſe Days are very remarkable,—wherein the Heads of our Country are gone forth in ſolemn Form to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and entertain the <hi>Meſſengers of the Nation</hi> in a Treaty with them on the very important Articles of Peace, and of their receiving the glorious Goſpel of Salvation; I have turned my Thoughts on this Subject as a proper Means of leading up our moved Affections to the pious Exerciſes that are proper on this great Occaſion: Here every one, who conſidering the already diſtreſſed State of the Land, and the many Evils that would attend a bloody War with the deceitful Heathen on our Borders ſhall eagerly ask the important Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall one then anſwer the Meſſengers of the Nation?</hi> Is furniſhed with an anſwer of Divine certainty, <hi>That the Lord hath founded Zion: and the Poor of his People ſhall truſt in it.</hi> The
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003587_0003_0FF87804053F9CD8"/>
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent and continued by God to the backſliding <hi>Jews</hi> a very great while, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 1. and the Subject of his large and excellent Propheſy, beſides that of it which relates to the Coming of Chriſt and Spreading of his Goſpel, is chiefly a Repreſenting to the Jews the great and dreadful Calamities which God would bring upon them for their Sins, and that by the <hi>Aſſyrians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> &amp;c. And alſo his Reſtoring them to Favour after a longtime; And puniſhing their Enemys in a moſt fearful manner. God had nouriſhed up and increaſed the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> to be his own peculiar People, but they at length baſely forſook the God of their Fathers, therefore he ſtired up againſt them the Heathen that were round about them, and made them the Rod of his Anger, to puniſh that hypocritical Nation; But they, as is common in ſuch Caſes, went beyond their Commiſſion as Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and laviſh'd their own Rage and barbarous Cruelties upon the miſerable People that were put into their Hands to be chaſtiſed, (which temper it is likely made <hi>David</hi> avoid falling into the Hands of Men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 14.) Therefore God would not leave them unpuniſhed, but by this Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told their deſtruction too. And among theſe Heathen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys of the Lord's People, they who made no ſmall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure were the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> on the North, whoſe borders were vaſtly extended, and their Metropolis was <hi>Babylon;</hi> And the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> on the South-weſt, and the Deſolation of theſe two is foretold in the 13 &amp; 14 Chapters: And from the 28 verſe of this chapter to that which I have named for my Text, is particularly exhibited the utter Downfall of the <hi>Philiſtians,</hi> who were ſuch near and bad Neighbours and often ſuch very cruel Enemies to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And it is very likely that they with the other neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might at that time look upon the Poverty of the <hi>Jews</hi> with Diſdain and enquire of them occaſionally and tauntingly too, how they would eſcape being an eaſy Prey to their Enemies if there ſhould be a War with them? And at the Concluſion of theſe Predictions, comes in my Text, which is an heroic Strain of the Prophet's Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement and Praiſe to the Sovereign Author of <hi>Juda'</hi>s Salvations, and a very pious Direction, ſhewing how the Lord's defended People ſhould improve ſuch Favours.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003587_0004_0FF87805880E5120"/>
               <hi>What ſhall one then anſwer the Meſſengers of the Nation.</hi> Or, <hi>And</hi> what ſhall, or, <hi>What ſhall therefore be anſwer'd by any one,</hi> to the Meſſengers of the Nation? The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of any People or Nation that ſhould be ſent to the Jews on any Occaſion whatſoever: And of ſuch Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers there is great and frequent Occaſion in the Affairs of every Nation or People, to treat with one another on the important Buſineſs of Peace and War; to ſettle the limits of Trade and Commerce: Or to congratulate or condole with one another in particular Circumſtances, and the like. And ſome would have it underſtood of any Strangers that ſhould occaſionally repair to the Jews. And the Anſwer is, <hi>That God hath founded</hi> or eſtabliſhed and ſecured <hi>Zion: and the poor of his People ſhall truſt in it. Zion</hi> was the City of <hi>David,</hi> the Metropolis of the Jews: And that Name is often uſed to ſignify the Church or People of God; ſuch as are called by his Name, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Worſhip and Ordinances, and do depend upon his Protection. And in this latter ſenſe, at leaſt in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the former, I ſuppoſe the Word to be uſed here: And ſo I ſhall further diſcourſe of my Text under theſe two general Heads,</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That God hath ſo eſtabliſhed his Church in the World, as that his People in their greateſt Poverty and Diſtreſs, may ſafely truſt therein for Protection from their Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That it is the Duty of the Lord's People care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to let others, and eſpecially the Heathen round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them know what their Dependence is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That God hath ſo eſtabliſhed his Church in the World, as that his People in their greateſt Poverty and Diſtreſs, may ſafely truſt therein for Protection from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi> And here I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What is intended by Men's truſting in Zion, or the Church of God for Safety and Protection from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> 2. <hi>The Truth of the Doctrine</hi>—And 3. <hi>The Reaſon of the Doctrine as it relates to Men's Practice:</hi> Or <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Connection that there is between Religion and temporal Safety</hi> To ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is intended by Men's truſting in Zion or the Church of God for Safety and Protection from their Enemies.</hi>

               <hi>It ſuppoſes their conſtant and induſtrious care in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Methods of Defence, hoping in and waiting for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of Goſpel Promiſes in a way of careful and ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Rules of it.</hi> Such as expect the ſpecial Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Providence to the obtaining for or ſecuring to them any Favour, muſt carefully imploy all their own Powers in a regular way of obtaining that end for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe they expect that Favour in an unreaſonable way; for how can Men look that God ſhould do any thing for them while they are either too lazy or too wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do what they can for themſelves? And this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will appear in the moſt convincing Light, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſuch Indolence, Wilfulneſs and Negligence, to be as they really are, a very great degree of diſobedience to and contempt of God, who has given them their Powers to be always uſed in a rational Way. The impotent Man muſt ſtrive to ſtretch forth his hand at Chriſt's bidding, or elſe he could have had no hope of a Cure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 13. And <hi>Gideon</hi> with his little Army muſt go forth in Warlike Form againſt Midian, altho' God had determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe Enemies miraculouſly, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 15, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And having applied their own Care and Labour, they muſt humbly look to God for the fulfilment of his Promiſes to them: And this naturally ſuppoſes their pious Care to evidence, That they are indeed his People, for why elſe do they come to him? It muſt be allowed by all, That they who expect the Favours of God's Church, muſt be within its Walls, and this cannot be without obeying its Rules and Ordinances. And that Church or People who as a Body do yield a careful and ſincere Obedience to the Rules of the Goſpel, do thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves to be the Subjects and Servants of God, and may lay juſt claim to his Patronage and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33 20, 22. And where this Obedience is wanting, they are the Enemies of God and may expect to be treated accordingly, what ever diſtinguiſhing names of Virtue or Religion they may take to themſelves. While the Jews continued a pure Church, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had large experience of the Divine Honours and Protections ſo beſtowed on them, as that they knew it to be becauſe they were the Lord's People, and this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003587_0006_0FF878091A678D50"/>
mightily confirmed their Confidence &amp; Joy in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. But at length they vainly run over to a carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the external part of their Church Privileges, while they ſadly neglected the Spirit and Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. And God reproaches them for it, and profeſſes his deſign to caſt them off, altho' they were called by his Name, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>begin</hi> to <hi>ver.</hi> 15. The Sum of all this is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn in the Terms of that Covenant ſtipulation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Obey my Voice and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People, and walk ye in all the Ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you</hi> Thus O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is the only Evidence of our Subjection to God; and this Subjection is our only Title to Safety. <hi>Jotham'</hi>s Parable in <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 15. inſtructs us here.</p>
            <p>And then I come to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Truth of the Doctrine.</hi> And to render it plain and eaſy, I Premiſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſpecting the Circumſtances of the People to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: <hi>That their greateſt Diſtreſs and Poverty, is no bar or difficulty in the way of their Protection, unleſs they have forfeited this by their diſobedience.</hi> So the Lord's People in the greateſt Diſtreſs and Poverty, are to truſt in him, with whom it is equal to ſave by many or by few, by ſtrong or weak means. It was a time of ſore Affliction and Poverty in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which well might, and it is likely did make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders wonder, and enquire how they ſhould be ſecured from becoming an eaſy prey to their neighbouring Enemies, unto which the Anſwer in my Text refers, <hi>That the Lord hath founded Zion and the poor of his people ſhall truſt in it.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reſpecting the extent of the temporal Protection of the Lord's People, exhibited in my Text and Doctrine: <hi>That altho' this is confirmed to them in the way of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> As 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 7, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23, &amp; elſewhere; <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Truſt being the terms on their part, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Safety the terms on God's part; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is juſtly to be looked upon as the determined and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way in which God will deal with his People, and they may ſafely depend upon it always: yet why may he not in his abſolute Sovereignty ſometimes go out of this ordinary way, if he pleaſes? But then it ſhall always be for their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary good:</hi> As in the caſe of <hi>Job.</hi> Thus it is a Scripture
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003587_0007_0FF8780AF6398FB0"/>
Rule, that all Men ſhall dye: yet God ſometimes goes out of this ordinary way, by virtue of his own Royal Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But then it is always better for them that are ſo treated, then if they were dealt with in the ordinary way: As in the Inſtances of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah.</hi> And with conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe things premiſed. I now proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Truth of the Doctrine: That God hath ſo eſtabliſhed his Church in the World, as that his people in their greateſt Poverty and Diſtreſs, may ſafely truſt therein for Protection from their Enemies.</hi> And this appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Promiſes that God has made to his people, that it ſhall be ſo.</hi> As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 13, 14, &amp; 18. And God repeats His Promiſes of this kind to them in the Form of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23. And it is juſtly reckoned among the grievous Aggravations of <hi>Manaſſeh'</hi>s ſins, that he ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forfeited and deſpiſed thoſe temporal Favours that were ſo plainly made over to him in caſe of his Obedience, 2 Chron. 33. 7, 8 <hi>And here I obſerve; That tho' theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made directly to the Jews, yet being made to them as the Lord's People, they are to be applyed to all thoſe, to the end of the World, who can lay a juſt claim to the Character of the Lord's People.</hi> Thus when the great charge &amp; buſineſs of conducting <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was laid upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Almighty to ſupport and encourage him under that burden, made this Promiſe to him, Deut. 31. 8. <hi>And the Lord he it is that goeth before, he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forſake thee: Fear not</hi>—Which is applyed to all Chriſtians as an argument againſt Covete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and to promote our truſt and dependance on Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the way of our Duty, Heb. 13. 5. 6.—<hi>For he hath ſaid,</hi> (he ſaid it to <hi>Joſhua,</hi>) <hi>I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee, ſo that we,</hi> we Chriſtians, unto the end of the World <hi>may boldly ſay; The Lord is my helper: And I will not fear what Man ſhall do unto me.</hi> And the Truth of the Doctrine appears.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From Scripture Hiſtory, wherein we ſee promiſed delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from their Enemies, conſtantly fulfilled for the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while they exerciſed their dependance on him for it, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by their obedience.</hi> I might here mention a vaſt ſeries of great Salvations beſtowed on <hi>Iſrael</hi> on this ſcore, becauſe they were the Lord's People; and conſider with what aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Terror and divine Majeſty God himſelf was wont to come down to fight their Battles for them. This is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſcribed in a ſtile and language moſt auguſt and divinely Magnificent, as in <hi>Pſal 18.</hi> alſo in the Song of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32. and of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak, Judg.</hi> 5. And the Prayer of <hi>Habakkuk, Chap.</hi> 3. which I might read to you, with many other ſuch like Hiſtorical Paſſages in ſacred Scripture: But I muſt leave them to your Peruſal.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>And I further remark to you, how carefully God Almighty informs us in his Word, of the reaſon why the Lord's People were from time to time delivered over to their Enemies,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Experience that we have had of God's Protecting his own People in this Land while they were obedient to him.</hi> And here I ſhall offer many things which are very remarkable, and a pious Remembrance and Conſideration of them will ſtrongly urge our Reformation, by a moſt careful Obedience to and ſtrong Dependance on God, who was peculiarly <hi>our Father's God,</hi> and who <hi>will be with us while we are with him.</hi> And in recollecting them I will view the Land in its <hi>Proſperous,</hi> and in its <hi>Calamitous</hi> State, reſpecting its Enemies.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And here it is always to be conſidered, That the principal Buſineſs &amp; Aim of theſe very pious &amp; worthy Men who firſt ſettled New-England <note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> was, that they might freely enjoy the pure Diſpenſation of Goſpel Ordinances themſelves; And promote them alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen.</hi> This! This was their noble Deſign

when they firſt planted this Wilderneſs and brought the Goſpel hither, when the Land was full of miſerable and cruel Wretches, whoſe God was the Devil, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Morals and Happineſs too, were agreable with what might be expected in the Servants of ſuch a Prince.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>And God remarkably directed their Courſe;</hi> for who can name any thing but even the miraculous Favours of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that protected their Settlements when they came, full indeed of Faith and Good Works, but with their very ſmall Numbers and very feeble Strength, into this vaſt and cold Wilderneſs, full of the fierce Subjects of Satan, who gnaſhed their Teeth and gaped upon them like voracious Dragons, and would have ſwallowed them up alive as the Grave, and whole as thoſe that go down into the Pit: But the Lord blowed upon their frequent Attempts, and confounded their Counſels when he remembred his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for his Obedient People, who followed him into this deſert Land: And he was not a Wilderneſs to them, or Land of Darkneſs, but gave them great Occaſion to ſay as Hab. 3. 12. <hi>Thou didſt march through the Land in Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, thou didſt threſh the Heathen in Anger.</hi> And ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible was the hand of God in this Matter as to put that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Mouth, Pſal. 18. 29. <hi>For by thee I have run through a Troop.</hi> And Deut. 32. 30 <hi>How ſhould one chaſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight.</hi>—Here we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate the frequent and fierce Sallies which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then with their cruel Multitudes made on them, but to their own ſhame and damage, in the very early ſettling of the Country: And particularly the firſt War which they formally made upon them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pequot War</hi> Anno 1637.</note> which though it was by the moſt powerful, warlike, fierce and cruel of all the Tribes in the Land, who had of long time been a Terror to their neighbouring heathen Nations, and were then reſolved to blot out the New Engliſh Name in the Earth: Then the Sword of the Lord did ſo viſibly purſue them, as to finiſh that War in a very few Months, and that with little Damage to the Engliſh, without the loſs (I think) of one Life: But ſuch fatal Deſtruction of the aggreſſing Enemy, as hath ſcarce left the Name and Memory of them in the whole Earth. Hab. 3. 13. <hi>Thou wenteſt forth for the Salvation of thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>And further,</hi> But bare Juſtice to thoſe our Anceſtors obliges me to remark when I mention them in this Caſe: And I would now do it alſo to ſtir up our Reformation and devout Care to keep very cloſe to the Worſhip and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God: <hi>That there never was one conſiderable Breach made upon this Land by its Enemies</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">I mean ſince the Settlement began at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Anno 1620. and have no Reference to the ſeveral Settlements of any part of <hi>New England</hi> before that: As about <hi>Sagadehoc</hi>-River, which was Settled by Sir <hi>John Popham</hi> in 1606, and broken up in about two Years: And was again Settled by the French, who were driven off by the Inhabitants of <hi>Virginia</hi> in 1613. And again it was Settled by the Engliſh in 1615, and ſoon broken up: And Settled by them again in 1619, but very ſoon left.

               <hi>until the firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were gone off, and the ſtanding Inhabitants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had very openly forſaken that Intereſt which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign of their Fathers in coming hither:</hi> Which I will next conſider.</p>
            <p>And alaſs! as it is natural to the Children of Men to deſpiſe that which they eaſily poſſeſs; ſo here, the pure Ordinances of the Goſpel, moſt, freely enjoyed, appeared, in the next Generation, to grow cheap in their Eyes, which they plainly diſcovered by a parcimonious Treatment of it, as to its Support<note n="‖" place="bottom">Magn.

For their Practice did then proclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud <hi>that it was not a thing of neceſſary Importance with them whether the Goſpel was carefully promoted or not.</hi> And I ſuppoſe that the ſaving of ſo conſiderable a Charge was the guilded Bait that allured the blinded People into that fatal Snare that Satan had ſo craftily, and alaſs how ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lay'd for them! And no doubt but the Dragons of the Infernal Pit prided themſelves in this Advantage they had gotten againſt <hi>New-England,</hi> knowing how God would deal with a favourite People in ſuch a Caſe; As <hi>Iſa</hi> 57 17. <hi>For the Iniquity of his Covetouſneſs was I wroth and ſmote him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſecondly,</hi> Here begins the very calamitous ſtate of <hi>New England,</hi> with reſpect to her Enemies, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe next to conſider.</p>
            <p>¶ And I believe that no ſerious thinker, who conſiders that whole caſe, can do other than judge that that plain &amp; great Apoſtacy muſt needs be very grievouſly provoking to God, that had marvellouſly nouriſhed up and defended his People here, to advance the known ends of their Settling the Country, which that Generation had then ſo far deſerted: And He alarmed them with two notable Earthquakes<note n="‖" place="bottom">On <hi>Jan.</hi> 26 and 28. 1662, 3.</note> which ſhould have ſtired up the Inhabitants to conſideration and amendment, but if that were the deſign of them, they failed of their end, and left the ungrateful Land ſadly open to God's Judgments, which covered &amp; impoveriſhed it in a few Years: Deut. 32. 20, 21.—<hi>And He ſaid, I will hide my face from them, I will ſee what their end ſhall be: For they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no

faith They have moved me to jealouſy—they have provoked me to anger—And I will move them to jealouſy with thoſe which are not a People, I will provoke them to anger with a fooliſh nation.</hi> For the Heathen Nations round about them being made the Rod of God's Anger, did gather themſelves to Battle, and broke in upon the People with barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and open War<note n="†" place="bottom">On <hi>June</hi> 24. 1675.</note> which reached in the ſpace of twenty days about 240 Miles, <hi>i. e.</hi>

               </note> from the moſt ſoutherly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this Province, to the moſt northerly and eaſterly Limits of all the Engliſh Settlements. <hi>And that was a moſt heavy War:</hi> It continued with, often but ſhort, and always very precarious Ceſſations for a great many Years And in it the rage of the Heathen proceeded with great ſucceſs: They gloried in their Victories when they had burnt up all the Towns in a fair and beautiful Country on the Sea-ſhore about <hi>an hundred Miles,</hi> diſmantled and deſtroyed all their ſtrong Forts and Garriſons, left their pleaſant Fields to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Wilderneſs, and were the proud Owners of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Inhabitants, and of their Wealth: Yea, they infeſted the very Bowels of our Country, and drew nigh and threatned the Metropolis itſelf; and with what amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; horror was the Land then filled? Labourers were cut off in the Meadows and Fields, ſtrong Men fell down wounded in the Streets; and Men of War ambuſhed, and ſlain in their going forth, as by the Leopards of the deſart that lurk privily for their Prey; ſo that our Highways were untroden, and the Dwellings in the borders of the Towns forſaken, as in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the days of <hi>Shamgar</hi> &amp; <hi>Jael, Jud.</hi> 5. And every one juſtly <hi>feared the Alder in the path, and the noiſe of the Archers in the places of drawing water.</hi> And how loud &amp; bitter were the inceſſant Cries, with which bereived Multitudes lamented their Friends, either Slain, or carried away Captive, and many of them, eſpecially Female Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren retained to be either Paganized by their barbarous Owners, or Sold to be cloyſtered up in Nurſerys of Impiety, where ſome of them yet remain; a heavy burden to their diſtreſſed Parents and Friends? How many Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieved of their Parents, and gray headed mourning for the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003587_0013_0FF833A52D430D28"/>
Sons of their Old Age; Widows crying out for the Husband and Guide of their Youth; and <hi>Rachels</hi> weeping for their Children? And among the reſidue of the People, how many halted with their Wounds? And there are ſome now alive, that were caſt down wounded by them, and left among the Slain in a moſt forlorn ſtate, who yet <hi>eſcaped with the skin of their Teeth,</hi> while their moſſy Heads do always mind them of their Hairy Scalp pluck'd off, and carryed away in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, to witneſs for the Numbers they had ſlain. Well might the Inhabitants then ſhake and tremble, thro' Fear and dreadful Expectation, when they were thus beſet with a fierce People that were armed againſt them on every ſide, and fluſhed with Victories: And a People dark and cruel like the Infernal Regions; of a ſtammering ſpeech alſo, that they could not underſtand, and their Numbers covered the Mountains And where they prevailed on Towns or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, their Behaviour was often moſt inhuman: They regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the face of old Men; and tender &amp; delicate Women they carryed into a moſt difficult, long and perilous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the flower of our Youth, they trod as in a Wine Preſs; nor had they any pity on the fruit of the Womb, they daſhed the little Children in pieces; and Tears of Blood are an Emblem low enough to lament the unheard of Cruelties often deviſed for the Tormenting of them that fell into the hands of thoſe worſe than Lybian Tygers, when they had leaſure for it, the rehearſing of whoſe Actions, would make us believe, that among the very Devils or open Perſecutors of Chriſt and his Members, who are their near kindred, one of a large Capacity muſt be picked to vie with them. Lam. 3. 42, to 47. and Chap. 4. 18, 19 <hi>We have Tranſgreſſed and have rebelled, thou haſt not pardoned, thou haſt covered with Anger and perſecuted us: Thou haſt ſlain, thou haſt not pitied. All our Enemies have opened their mouths againſt us. Fear and a ſnare is come upon us, deſolation and deſtruction They hunt our ſteps that we cannot go in our ſtreets.—Our Perſecutors are ſwifter than the Eagles of the Heaven: They purſued us upon the Mountains, they laid wait for us in the Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon ſuch great Calamities it is natural and pious too to ask with Modeſty, what the provoking Cauſe of them is; for God doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the

Children of Men, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33, 34. And although as to his Judgments, <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs are often round about him, and his Paths are in the great Waters;</hi> Yet he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome way diſcover to Men a ſufficient Reaſon of the very calamitous things that befal them. So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Cauſe of drowning the old World, is carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 11, 12. and of the deſtruction of Sodom and her Siſters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 13. and the like in other Places. And it is wonderful to ſee that even prophane and common as well as ſacred Hiſtorians, do uſually if not always, make the ſame Remarks; which muſt ariſe from ſome notable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to all thoughtful and inquiring Obſervers in ſuch Caſes. This is confirmed by the great Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> who ſays <q>We ſhall find it noted by Hiſtorians, that before any great public Calamity, or utter Exciſſion of a Nation, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were become univerſally vicious, &amp;c.</q> See his <hi>Phyſico-Theol.</hi> P. 271.</p>
            <p>And it is very certain, that tho' every Town in the Land ſhared very deeply in thoſe Calamities, yet <hi>the Manner in which they were then diſpenſed to this Province, was very peculiar and very ſtrange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The moſt if not all of thoſe Towns in it, were ſingled out, which were Settled without the Goſpel, and (unleſs I miſtake the Hiſtory of the Country which I have diligently ſearched) every one of them was broken up and utterly deſtroyed<note n="‡" place="bottom">If any object here, the Towns in a neighbouring Province, which have ſometimes been all of the moſt of them without the ſettled Ordinances of the Goſpel: It may be anſwered, That all thoſe erroneous Towns may be thought to have had the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them at that Day in a way which they ſuppoſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: And the erroneous in Religion are not to be reckoned in the Caſe before us, with ſuch as in a Land of Light do caſt off the Form of Godlineſs. Moreover the Sin of this Province was againſt its own profeſſed Deſign as well as Principles: And that Province was not ſettled for the ſame Reaſon that this was which is of much wait here. Upon all which accounts we might not expect ſo much Plainneſs and Severity in the Treatment of them as of us. <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2.</note>, although ſome of them were ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many Inhabitants and Souldiers, and with very

ſtrong Forts and Garriſons, ſuch as were found in but very few other Places in all <hi>New-England.</hi> We may ſay of ſome of them for their great Strength, as the Prophet in Lam. 4 12. <hi>The Kings of the Earth and all the Inhabitants of the World would not have believed that the Adverſary and the Enemy ſhould have entered into the Gates.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi> It is conſtantly affirmed by all the Accounts that ever I could meet with, which ſpeak diſtinctly of theſe particular Settlements, <hi>That not one of all the many ſmall and feeble Towns where the Ordinances of the Goſpel were ſettled, was deſtroyed by them;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The only Objection I ever met with againſt this Obſervation, is the Caſe of <hi>Groton,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants thought it beſt to draw off, and ſtay till the War was over, which they did with their Goods, except one Garriſon which was kept there and never taken. And that no ſuch Town was ever quite broken up by the Enemy, is conſtantly affirmed, and hath been often publiſhed by grave obſerving Men, who lived in the midſt of thoſe Wars, &amp; wrote of them, profeſſedly remarking and admiring at this difference; As the Reverend Mr. BRECK in his <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and Mr PINHALLOW in the Introduction to his Hiſtory of the Wars of <hi>N.

This was very ſurprizing to beholders then and ſhould ſtill be marvellous in our Eyes.</p>
            <p>AND NOW; What more legible Tokens to diſcover the Deſigns of Providence in thoſe fierce and dreadful Judgments could we have deviſed unleſs we waited for the Fingers of a Man's Hand that wrote upon the Plaiſter of <hi>Belſhazzar's</hi> Wall; or propoſed to ſee them written in the plaineſt Lines of our own Language, and with Sun-Beams in the Air?</p>

it a pious Care to collect and ſet them in order for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of others; I am ſure it will ſtir up the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every conſiderate and the Care of every pious Mind. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>begin.</hi> And I am now to ſhew,</p>

               <hi>And</hi> as it is eaſy for every one to ſee how the Service of the Devil, naturally tends to make Men like him, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unjuſt, cruel, contentious, and very miſerable; for he would fain make all his followers like himſelf, both in Sin and Torment if he could; Hence ſome of them we ſee grow very near like him in many of his bad Qualities. From ſuch as are then in his Service alſo, come all the Lies, Injuſtice, Treachery and Quarrels which are often nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to fierce and cruel Words, Bloodſhed and War. <hi>Jan.</hi> 4 <hi>begin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So on the other hand,</hi> The Service of God marvelouſly tends to deſtroy this Image and work of the Devil, and to beautify Men with the likeneſs of the moſt glorious and excellent Being: It makes them knowing, wiſe, juſt, kind, holy and happy; for Holineſs and Happineſs will certainly go together. It is a ſure Truth &amp; plain to human Reaſon if contemplated, that Virtue &amp; Vice have their natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Happineſs and Miſery by the eternal and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſon of things, &amp; it is impoſſible it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And it would be a pleaſant task, were there time now, to ſhew in particulars, how and wherein the Rules of the Goſpel do all of them naturally tend by promoting every virtue to advance the temporal Peace and Happineſs of every one that obſerves them, and that in a plain and eaſy method: For beſides the more ſpiritual Duties of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Godlineſs, which the World can't ſo well ſee into, they learn Men to live ſoberly and righteouſly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. which if complied with, would take away all occaſion of injury, contention &amp; figthing. Let any one view the moſt difficult caſes that are ever mentioned as the cauſe of War,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003587_0017_0FF833AE943A6010"/>
and ſee if a compliance in both parties with that Juſtice, neighbourly Kindneſs and Charity, which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, would not ſpeedily cure all, &amp; confirm their Peace and Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>And if an unrighteous People ſhould ſeek occaſion of War againſt their Neighbours when they had none juſtly, yet if the injured party would be ſo politic, as well as happy, as to treat them in every Article according to the temper of the Goſpel, they would thereby bring ſuch a viſible and acknowledged guilt upon their aggreſſing Adverſaries as would certainly render them ſelf condemned, tho' they were the darkeſt Heathen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. And condemned in the Eyes of the reſt of the World; and how natural and great an effect this would have in disheartning them and incouraging and ſecuring the other party, let any one judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And add to this,</hi> The regular claim that Innocence, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion enable Men to lay to the ſpecial Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Providence which over-rules all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And finally,</hi> The Covenant which God hath made with his People, exhibited in the plain and explicit Promiſes of the Goſpel, that their Obedience to, and truſt in him, ſhall intitle them to his Favour and Protection, do ſufficiently evidence the reaſon of my firſt Doctrine, while they not only determine theſe to be the People of the Lord; But alſo, if they behave as herein before deſcribed, that their Enemies are the Enemies of the Lord too; and then it is eaſy to ſee their End. And ſo I paſs to conſider,</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That it is the Duty of the Lord's People, very carefully to let others, and eſpecially the Heathen round about them know what their Dependance is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This diſcovers their Humility and Deſire of giving to God the Glory and Praiſe of his Goodneſs unto them in their Preſervation.</hi> Both theſe are very neceſſary Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of near Relation to each other, for it is only the humble Man that can find in his Heart to <hi>give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name.</hi> And the contrary to this is a Sin very provoking to God and very pleaſing to proud Man; He would fain think much of himſelf; &amp; even good Men are ſadly apt to be guilty this Way. This was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſin of that great &amp; good King <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 39 <hi>beg.</hi> He ſhould have told thoſe Meſſengers of the King of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003587_0018_0FF82C1A8D183410"/>
how God had brought his People Iſrael into a ſtrange Land, and driven out the Heathen to make Room for them, that they might be his peculiar People; and that if they did continue cloſe in their obedience to him, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways defend them from their Enemies; and that this was their Strength, Refuge and Defence in Dangers. Such a ſhew might have ſtirred up thoſe Embaſſadors to enquire after Iſrael's God, and come by degrees into Terms of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, for the ſake of his Protection; at leaſt it would have created great Thoughts of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Mind of the King of Babylon and of his Servants: But inſtead of this, the King ſhewed them that which might make himſelf and his People appear Honourable, Magnificent and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their own Strength and Grandeur; ſuch as his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Wealth, Armour, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And God was angry at it and ſent the Prophet to reprove him for it, &amp; to aſſure him that all thoſe things which he had gloried in ſhould be ſo far from defending him, as that they ſhould be carried away into Babylon, <hi>verſe</hi> 5, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This would have a natural tendency to bring others eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Heathen, unto the ſame methods of Piety, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God.</hi> To ſee a flouriſhing People very careful and diligent in the obſervance of all Religious Duties, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſſing that they did this in Obedience to that God who had exceedingly favoured them even in the eye of the World, and would certainly appear for their ſafety and defence at all times, unleſs they forſook him; would put others upon obſerving them; and if they found ſuch grave and ſerious Profeſſion and ſteady Practice of pious Obedience conſtantly perſiſted in, accompanied alſo with ſignal outward Favours beyond others, it muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to ſeek terms of Communion with this God too. And this would eſpecially prevail on the Heathen who are wont to ſerve Gods that are deceitful, falſe and cruel to them, leading them into perplexities and ſtraits, and often deſtroying their own moſt obedient Servants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This method would powerfully tend to make good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the moſt dark</hi> &amp; <hi>barbarous Heathen.</hi> If they could once be learned to obey the Goſpel, it would be ſafe living by them. And they who will ſpend their time, ſtrength and labour, to effect this great Work, will gloriouſly in<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Bear in mind always, that the very Foundation of the Country, ſtands upon our carefully obſerving and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the pure Ordinances of the Goſpel. For this being ſo great a part of the avowed deſign of the firſt Settlers, and by them pleaded with God as a reaſon of his Protecting them. And ſo wonderfully anſwered in the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours more eminently beſtowed on them, than on any other People did virtually eſtabliſh it into a Covenant, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23. We are therefore more obliged to obſerve, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and promote the Goſpel, than any People living; which I beſeech you always to remember, <hi>For it is not a vain thing for you: becauſe it is your Life; and through this thing ye ſhall prolong your days in the land</hi>—Deut. 32. 47. And can we think that the jealous God will bear long with us, if we forſake this truſt? Would Men bear to be ſo created?
