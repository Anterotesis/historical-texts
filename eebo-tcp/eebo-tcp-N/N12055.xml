            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>WELL, gentlemen, a pretty state for British gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and British troops—the terror of the world become mere scare-crows to themselves.—We came to <hi>America,</hi> flush'd with high expectations of conquest, and curbing these sons of riot.—We tour'd away in the senate as if our success was certain; as if we had only to curb a few licentious villains, or hang them as spectacles for their brethren —But how are we deceiv'd?—Instead of this agreeable employ, we are shamefully confin'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of <hi>three miles, wrangling</hi> and <hi>starving</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourselves.</p>

                     <p>Curs'd alternative, either to be murder'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or starv'd within.—These <hi>yankey dogs</hi> treat us like a parcel of poltroons; they divert themselves by firing at us, as at a flock of partridges.—A man can scarcely put his nose over the intrenchments without losing it;—ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loses his eyes, only looking thro' the ambuseirs.— They have a set of fellows call'd <hi>rifflers</hi>; they would shoot the very <hi>devil</hi> if he was to come within a league of them.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, it will not do to set groaning here; let us determine upon some plan quickly to be done, otherwise I shall bid you farewell, and you may
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015213_0004_0F99909731D9A860"/>
follow after as well as you are able.—You find every night brings them nearer and nearer; they raise a hill and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it in 6 hours —I expect soon to see a fortification grow out of the <hi>channel,</hi> and our <hi>ships of war</hi> to be blown up by some damn'd machine.—Such devils are capable of any thing; the power of miracles is put into their hands, and they improve the patent to admiration.—You must do something to dispossess them of those fortifications, otherwise we shall not only be starv'd, but absolutely murder'd.</p>

<q>how

                     <p>We shall all be oblig'd to follow his example; I never thought to make an improvement of a parable, but our case is now so truly deplorable that necessity prompts me to it.—<hi>Hard crusts</hi> and <hi>rusty bones</hi> have never till <hi>now</hi> become my diet; they do not suit my <hi>digestion.</hi>— My <hi>teeth</hi> are worn to stumps, and my <hi>lips</hi> are swell'd like a blubber-mouth negro's, by thumping <hi>hard bones</hi> against them; my <hi>jaw bone</hi> has been set a dozen times, dislocated by chewing <hi>hard pork,</hi> as tough as an old swine's ass.</p>

            <l>Which put my risibles in such commotion.</l>
            <l>By yankees frighted too! oh dire to say!</l>
