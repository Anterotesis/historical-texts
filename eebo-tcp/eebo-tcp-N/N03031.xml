            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This mighty LORD, the <hi>bleſſed and only Potentate,</hi> here ſpeaks of <hi>Himſelf:</hi> Himſelf the <hi>Speaker</hi> and Himſelf the <hi>Subject.</hi> He cannot ſpeak of a <hi>Greater,</hi> and He only is fit to ſpeak of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> who only comprehends Himſelf. <hi>For the things of God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no Man</hi> (nor Angel) <hi>out the</hi> SPIRIT OF GOD: As He pleaſes to reveal concerning Himſelf unto his Creatures. Job xxxvii. 19. <hi>Teach us what we ſhall ſay, for we cannot order our Speech by reaſon of Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Words <hi>worthy of Himſelf,</hi> truly <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> are here ſpoken: <hi>I am a</hi> GREAT KING <hi>ſaith the</hi> LORD OF HOSTS.</p>
            <p>He is a KING: that is the <hi>leaſt</hi> that can be ſaid of Him, tho' <hi>Kings</hi> are the greateſt and higheſt Things we have on Earth: And becauſe we have none <hi>greater</hi> here below, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are <hi>Kings</hi> the ſhadows to us of the DIVINE MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>But the LORD is a GREAT KING. How <hi>Great</hi> can't be ſaid. The <hi>Potentates</hi> of this World are <hi>little</hi> parcels of Duſt, and Worms before HIM. It is a <hi>ſmall</hi> thing to ſay of the <hi>great</hi> GOD, <hi>He is higher than the Kings of the Earth.</hi> He is the great King of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>King of Glory.</hi> His <hi>Heſts</hi> ſpeak beſt how great his <hi>Dominion</hi> is: Pſalm. xxiv. 10. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts, He is the King of Glory.</hi> Jerem. xlvii. 18. <hi>As I live, ſaith the</hi> KING, <hi>whoſe Name is the</hi> LORD OF HOSTS.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To whom,</hi> and upon what <hi>Occaſion,</hi> ſpake the Great GOD theſe Words of Himſelf? It was to his <hi>worſhiping People,</hi> and to his <hi>Pricſts,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Religion among them. It was to <hi>ſtrike</hi> them with an awful Apprehenſion of his own Majeſty and Greatneſs. It was to <hi>reprove</hi> them for and <hi>convince</hi> them of, their profane and contemptuous Carriage toward Him, in their pretended Worſhip. It was to <hi>arraign,</hi> terrify and humble a wicked, hypocritical, formal, profeſſing People; to admoniſh them of his Power, Juſtice and Wrath, and that he was coming near unto them in Judgment. <hi>Curſed be the Deceiver that hath in his Flock a Male, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. GOD <hi>is a</hi> KING. He <hi>condeſcends</hi> to take this <hi>Stile</hi> to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is <hi>neceſſary</hi> and eſſential to Him to be <hi>King</hi> of the World: King <hi>over</hi> all his Works and <hi>unto</hi> all, for his <hi>own Glory</hi> and <hi>their Good</hi> His is <hi>the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory,</hi> by a natural unalienable Right, Propriety and abſolute Authority.

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003645_0005_10023BABDA2CF550"/>PRESERVER of all things muſt exerciſe Government and Rule over all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a King GOD gives <hi>Laws</hi> to his Creatures. Iſai. xxxiii. 22. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is our Lawgiver, the</hi> LORD <hi>is our King.</hi> He has written his Law <hi>in</hi> Man, and he has publiſh'd it <hi>to</hi> him. He has paſs'd it with <hi>Royal</hi> Majeſty, <hi>"I am the</hi> LORD. He came down from Heaven in great Glory, and proclaim'd it with Sound of <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and a Diſcharge of the <hi>Artillery</hi> of Heaven. He gives Laws to <hi>Angels</hi> that are higher than we, and they do his Will, hearkning to the Voice of his Word. He has given his Law to the mighty Frame of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> even to all the vaſt <hi>Globes</hi> in all their various <hi>Circles;</hi> and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this day in their excellent Order and wonderful Motion, according to his Ordinance, for all are his Servants. In our lower Regions, <hi>Fire, Hail and Snow, Vapour and ſtormy Wind fulfil his Word.</hi> This is a <hi>Kingly Part</hi> to give Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unto all, and to be obeyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>more</hi> than a King, He <hi>ſuſtains and upholds</hi> all things in Being. He is the <hi>Breath of our Noſtrils:</hi> Our <hi>Life</hi> and the length of our Days. In Him we live and move and have our Being. He preſerveth Man and Beaſt. In his Hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all Mankind. How much more is this than the Protection, Defence or Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that Princes and Governments on Earth can afford their Subjects. Should God remove his ſuſtaining Hand, all Fleſh would periſh together, and all Worlds would fall into Ruine and Confuſion. The <hi>Orbs</hi> of the Univerſe would <hi>doſh</hi> one againſt another, and run into their original <hi>Chaos,</hi> and Darkneſs would cover the Deſolation for ever and ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD <hi>hears up</hi> the Pillars of the Earth, or it and its Inhabitants would <hi>diſſolve</hi> together, Pſalm. lxxv. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. More than Princely or Kingly is <hi>his Royal Bounty</hi> and Munificence. He keeps the Table and Feaſt of a King. He feeds all his Creatures. <hi>He giveth Food to all Fleſh.</hi> All Eyes wait on Him, and he giveth them their Meat in due Seaſon. He fills 'em with Good, he ſatisfies the Deſire of every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing. The Earth is full of his Riches. <hi>All things come of Him,</hi> and it is <hi>of his own</hi> that we make our Returns to Him. This is more than <hi>Royal:</hi> it is a Glory truly <hi>Divine:</hi> 1 Chron. xxix. 11. <hi>Thine O Lord is the Greatneſs, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majeſty! for all that is in the Heaven and on the Earth is thine; thine is the Kingdom, O</hi> LORD, <hi>and Thou art exalted Head above all.</hi> Earthly <hi>Kings</hi> are ſupported in their Magnificence by their Subjects, but the <hi>Divine</hi> MAJESTY ſupplies all his Dominions with all they have,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003645_0006_10023BAD6AD754B8"/>and gives them all things richly to enjoy. ver. 16. O LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, <hi>all this ſtore cometh of thy Hand, and it is all thine own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 As a King GOD <hi>judges, rewards and puniſhes.</hi> He doeth Judgment and Juſtice. Theſe are the <hi>Habitation of his Throne.</hi> He reigns and rules in Righteouſneſs. He is the <hi>juſt</hi> LORD in the midſt of us. He governs by Law; juſt and right is He. He <hi>loveth Righteouſneſs, and executeth Judgment in the Earth:</hi> He <hi>is excellent in Judgment, and in plenty of Juſtice: Holy in all his Ways and Works.</hi> There is no Iniquity with the LORD our GOD, nor Reſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As a King he <hi>rewards the Good.</hi> His Countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Upright. Verily there is a Reward for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Theſe He delights to honour; He dignifies and enobles them. He rewards like a King with a munificent Hand. Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heart of Man to conceive the things which GOD has prepared for them that love him. The LORD will render to every Man his Righteouſneſs and Faithfulneſs; He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his Work, and a full Reward ſhall be given him. He bleſſes indeed, with all ſpiritual Bleſſings, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Places. The LORD will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. He has Crowns and Kingdoms to give; the <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. As a King He <hi>puniſhes the Wicked,</hi> the Enemies of his Crown and Dignity. He will not hold them guiltleſs. He will render Vengeance to his Enemies, and deſtroy them that hate Him. He is able to ſave and to deſtroy. The wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed.

            <p n="2">2. God is the <hi>Great</hi> King, for He is the <hi>Supream Being, the</hi> MOST HIGH.

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003645_0011_10023B6174DB1CD8"/>doing them Homage. So the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> when he had extended his <hi>Empire,</hi> and triumphed in many <hi>Victories</hi> over the <hi>Nations</hi> and their <hi>Gods,</hi> which were no Gods, then he aſſum'd the Stile of the <hi>Great King.</hi> 2 Kings xviii 19. But who gave Him his Greatneſs, and took it away again? the ſame GOD OF HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN, who afterward gave a Kingdom, Power, Strength and Glory to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and made Him a King of Kings: Dan. ii. 37.

All the Kings of the Earth ſhould fear His Glory, and kiſs THE SON, HIS CHRIST, who is Higher than the Kings of the Earth; and there is given Him the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that all People, Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve Him.</p>

This was the <hi>Perſian</hi> Pride and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur: Eſther i. 1. <hi>This is Ahaſuerus which reigned from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia even to Ethiopia, over an hundred and ſeven and twenty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi> How Great was this Man in his own Eyes, and in the eyes of the World! but GOD is infinitely greater in the Sight of Angels and Saints: 2 Kings. xix. 15. <hi>Hezekiah prayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the</hi> LORD, <hi>and ſaid, O</hi> LORD GOD <hi>of Iſrael, Thou, even Thou alone, art</hi> GOD <hi>of all the Kingdoms of the Earth.</hi> Geneſis xiv. 22. <hi>I have lifted up my Hand unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>the moſt High</hi> GOD, <hi>the Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth.</hi> 1 Chron. xxix. 11. <hi>For all that is in the Heaven and on the Earth is thine! thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom O</hi> LORD, <hi>and Thou art exalted</hi> GOD <hi>above all.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. GOD is the <hi>Great King,</hi> for He is <hi>Independent and Abſolute.</hi> Kings, on Earth depend on GOD, from whom they derive their Being and their Power. Yea they depend on <hi>Others</hi> for their Exerciſe of Power and Rule. <hi>The King is ſerved of the Field.</hi> He depends on the Husbandman for his ſumptuous Table.</p>
            <p>Kings are alſo <hi>limited</hi> by GOD both as to the Extent and Exerciſe of their Power. They may not act as they liſt, or do what they will. GOD is the only <hi>abſolute</hi> Lord and Sovereign. Job. xxxiv. 13. <hi>Who hath given Him a Charge over the whole Earth? who hath diſpoſed the whole World? who hath enjoyned Him his Way? or to whom giveth He any Account of his Matters?</hi> Kings reign by <hi>Contract</hi> and Covenant with their People! but God's Right is in Himſelf, eternal and unalienable, and his Power is irreſiſtible. Daniel iv 35. <hi>He doeth according to his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003645_0012_10023BB722D42340"/>Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth! and none can ſtay his Hand, or ſay unto Him "What doeſt thou?</hi> Abſolute Power is the true and real Greatneſs of Dominion, but can belong to ONE <hi>only,</hi> which is GOD. No Creature may pretend to it, or can be fit for it. It would be impious Inſolence and Arrogance in the beſt and firſt of <hi>Angels</hi> to aſpire after it. The <hi>Pride</hi> which was the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Devil</hi> was, it may be, ſomething akin to this. It is yet leſs Sufferable in Duſt and Aſhes to ſay, <hi>I will be like the moſt</hi> HIGH. It is not for Kings to ſay abſolutely, <hi>I will.</hi> The Reaſon is becauſe they are imperfect in Knowledge and Virtue, and may err and ſin.</p>
            <p>What a woful World would an <hi>Abſolute Sinner</hi> make? Such a one as <hi>Pharaoh," I will purſue, I will ſatisfy my Luſt,</hi> &amp;c. Or like the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> the Rod of God's Anger and Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Indignation, in whoſe Heart it was to deſtroy and cut off Nations not a few; and He ſaid <hi>"Are not my Princes altogether Kings? ſhall I not do as I have done?</hi> Iſai. x. 8, 10. This is for the <hi>Ax</hi> to boaſt it ſelf againſt Him that heweth therewith, or for the <hi>Saw</hi> to magnify it ſelf againſt him that ſaketh it. There neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>ought</hi> to be but one only Abſolute Being, Iſai. xlvi. 10. <hi>I am</hi> GOD, <hi>and there is none like me, I ſay, my Counſel ſhall ſtand and I will do all my Pleaſure; I have ſpoken it and I will bring it to paſs; I have purpoſed and alſo will do it.</hi> None may ſpeak after this manner but only the GREAT KING, the One abſolute <hi>Sovereign</hi> of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. GOD is the <hi>Great</hi> King, for He is the moſt <hi>perfect Being.</hi> And therefore is He indeed the <hi>Abſolute</hi> LORD and <hi>Supream,</hi> becauſe He is <hi>Perfect.</hi> For abſolute Power ſhould not be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any Hand but His who is perfect. And it is the only Security, Felicity and Safety, of the Univerſe to have it lodged in his Hand; for He can't err or do wrong.</p>
            <p>It is a wiſe and celebrated Saying of an <hi>Ancient,</hi> "That if we could find <hi>One Man</hi> far excelling all others in Wiſdom and Goodneſs, He ought to have the Government". To be ſure true Greatneſs lies in the Perfection of the Soul. From thence only may we look for a perfect Adminiſtration. Vice and Folly ſet in high Dignity are but the more miſcheivous and the more expoſed. God made <hi>Meſes</hi> Great for Wiſdom, Piety, Goodneſs and Juſtice, and ſet him at the Head of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael Samuel</hi>'s Name ſhines for ever, while <hi>Saul</hi>'s imprudent and irreligious Conduct ſunk him below the meaneſt <hi>Iſraclite.</hi> But our Eyes behold the KING in his Grandeur and Beauty, while we meditate the perfect Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, the infinite Wiſdom of GOD.</p>

1. GOD is <hi>Great</hi> in <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and therefore is the <hi>Great King.</hi> This princely Qualification makes Kings truly great. <hi>Solomon</hi> asked this of GOD, and He gave him <hi>a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Heart,</hi> to do judgment and Juſtice. It made him <hi>Great</hi> in the Eyes of the Nations round about Him, and his Name great to the End of the World. The greateſt Princes reverenc'd Him, and came from far to hear his Wiſdom. But a Greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> is before us, <hi>the Only wiſe</hi> GOD. Wiſdom and Strength are His. He gives to good and great Kings their <hi>Largeneſs of Heart.</hi> It was a high Compliment to ſuch a Prince, <hi>'There is nothing hidden from my Lord the King, and he is wiſe as an Angel of</hi> GOD. But the wiſe and great GOD charges his very <hi>Angels</hi> with Folly. His Underſtanding is <hi>infinite,</hi> and therefore is He the <hi>Univerſal</hi> King. Known to Him are all his Works, all his Dominions, from the Beginning of the World. He looketh to the Ends of the Earth, and ſeeth under the whole Heaven. His Eyes are in every Place beholding the Evil and the Good. He puts Wiſdom in Mans inward Parts, and giveth Underſtanding to the Heart. He gives Knowledge to them that know Underſtanding.

Behold</hi> this admirable Work of GOD ſays the <hi>Prophet;</hi> admire this rare and great Thing in the Earth, this great Bleſſing to the World.</p>
            <p>Such is the GREAT GOD to his Creatures, and ſuch His <hi>Government</hi> over them. <hi>He loveth Righteouſneſs and executeth Judgment in the Earth. Juſt and true are thy Ways, O King of Saints! There is none Holy as the</hi> LORD, <hi>for there is none beſide</hi> HIM.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD is the Great King, for He is perfect in <hi>Goodneſs and Mercy.</hi> This is his GLORY. Thus he ſhewed his <hi>Face</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thus He proclaim'd his <hi>Name:</hi> Exod. xxxiv. 6. <hi>The</hi> LORD, <hi>the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>merciful and gracious and abundant in Goodneſs.</hi> How great is a <hi>good King!</hi> Great in the eyes of God and Men! So an <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> would fill a Throne! ſo <hi>They</hi> ſhine upon their Thrones above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercy and Truth</hi> adorn and <hi>preſerve Kings,</hi> uphold and blazen their Thrones. Theſe render 'em <hi>God like.</hi> And all that is great and excellent in the Kingdom of Nature is but a meet Compariſon, whereby to illuſtrate their high Excellency. 2 Sam. xxiii. 4. <hi>And he ſhall be like the Light of the Morning, and as the clear ſhining after Rain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD exerciſes Loving-kindneſs and Mercy in the Earth. His Goodneſs endureth continually. Every good and perfect Gift comes down from Him, the Father of Lights. <hi>There is none Good beſide Him.</hi> How great is the Goodneſs which he has laid up for them that fear him, which he has wrought for them that truſt in him! His <hi>Pardon</hi> is out to all the <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> againſt his Government, Crown and Dignity. He forgiveth Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin: He keepeth Mercy for Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. None are excepted, but all invited to repent. He waits to be gracious, and is a Long-ſuffering GOD. Dan. ix 9. <hi>To the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>belong Mercies and Forgiveneſſes, tho' we have rebelled againſt Him.</hi> Micah. vii. 18. <hi>Who is a</hi> GOD <hi>like unto Thee, that pardoneſt Iniquity, and paſſeſt by Tranſgreſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteſt in Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have contemplated the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the LORD OUR GOD in his being the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> It is Wiſdom Juſtice and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003645_0015_10023BC05BCA1708"/>Goodneſs that make Perſons <hi>great,</hi> be They on higher Seats or lower Forms. But ſet the moſt perfect <hi>Man</hi> upon a Throne, and how would he Shine? Even the <hi>devant</hi> would be ready to fall down and <hi>worſhip</hi> this lively <hi>living Image of the</hi> DEITY. Or rather, They could not help admiring the GREAT GOD in him. 2 Samuel vii. 3. <hi>And Nathan ſaid to the King, Go, do all that is in thy Heart, for</hi> GOD <hi>is with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be but ONE moſt perfect, and how much <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> muſt HE be than all other, that are finite and imperfect! Matth. v. ult. <hi>Our Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi> His therefore is <hi>the</hi> GREATNESS, <hi>and the Glory and the Majeſty.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will break off my Contemplation of the GREAT KING: For what can be added to that which is PERFECT? the Greatneſs of his Kingdom can't be juſtly celebrated in any Words below thoſe of <hi>David,</hi> in his <hi>royal Pſalm of Praiſe,</hi> cxlv.</p>
            <p>I might add many more Words to what has been ſaid of the <hi>Greatneſs of</hi> GOD's Dominion, and might well begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and caſt the <hi>Argument</hi> into a various <hi>Method;</hi> GOD is great in the Kingdom of <hi>Nature and Providence,</hi> great in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and greater yet in the Kingdom of his <hi>Glory:</hi> ſo Great that all things are <hi>little</hi> and as <hi>nothing</hi> before Him. But I muſt come to the USE.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is GOD a KING, and a GREAT KING? He is therefore <hi>greatly to be feared and had in Reverence in the Aſſembly of his Worſhippers.</hi> Pſalm. lxxxix. 7.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Argument</hi> in our <hi>Context,</hi> which <hi>arraigns</hi> the Worſhippers of GOD for their <hi>Irreverence</hi> towards Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Earthly Kings</hi> expect to be always treated with utmoſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and Reſpect; to be approached, ſpoken to and heard with great Reverence. Offer leſs to thy <hi>Governour</hi> will he be pleaſed with thee or accept thy Perſon? And ſhall the GREAT KING demand or accept leſs from us. Levit. x. 3. <hi>I will be ſanctified by them that draw nigh me.</hi> Pſalm xcv. 3, 6. <hi>For the</hi> LORD <hi>is a great</hi> GOD, <hi>and a great</hi> KING <hi>above all God O come, let us worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> Hebrews xii. 24. <hi>Let us find Grace, whereby we may ſerve</hi> GOD <hi>acceptably with Reverence and godly Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In all our <hi>Prayers and Supplications.</hi> If we had a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſent to our Earthly Prince, and might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Royal Preſence to offer it; with what an awful Care ſhould we do it? More eſpecially if it were to cry to Him for our Life, or the Lives of our People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when <hi>Eſther</hi> had her
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003645_0016_10023B6AAC583FC8"/>Requeſt to make. With like and greater Apprehenſions of the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of GOD, ſhould we pray to HIM in ſecret or in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. We ſhould think with our Selves, "Whom am I go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak unto? and for what? — Is it to to the <hi>moſt High</hi> GOD, the King of Glory? for my Soul, and it's everlaſting Intereſts? Wherewithal ſhall I come before the LORD? and bow my ſelf before the moſt High GOD? O let not the LORD be angry that Duſt and Aſhes take upon them to ſpeak unto Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This great King is <hi>fearful in Praiſes.</hi> The LORD is Great <hi>and greatly to be praiſed,</hi> He is to be <hi>ſeared above all Gods.</hi> Neither Angels, nor Saints can praiſe Him <hi>according to his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Greatneſs.</hi> Kings are commanded to ſerve Him with Fear and to rejoyce with Trembling The glorified Spirits that know his Greatneſs <hi>cover their Faces and fall down before the Throne,</hi> while they give him the Glory of His Holineſs and Grace. Sec Iſai. 1.1, — 5. Rev. iv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, — 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of this Great King muſt be read, preached and heard with great Reverence. Where the Word of a <hi>King</hi> is there is <hi>Power.</hi> When Kings ſpeak, how are they liſtned to! <hi>The Voice of the</hi> LORD <hi>is full of Majeſty. I will hear what</hi> GOD <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>will ſay. Liſten ye Iſles from far.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He once ſpake by <hi>Angels,</hi> and the People quaked beneath the ſhaking Mountain. He came down that his Fear might fall on them, and He promited 'em from that Day to ſpeak by the Mouth of Men. But what a great Thing is it to ſpeak from the <hi>Great</hi> GOD, or to be ſpoken to in his Name? Preaching and Hearing are therefore awful Parts of Divine Worſhip. It ſhould be to us as GOD Himſelf, the Great King, ſpeaking from the excellent Glory. 1 Theſſ. ii. 13. <hi>Not as the Word of Men, but as it is indeed the Word of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Poſitive Laws and Inſtitutions of the Great</hi> KING ſhould be carefully and reverently obſerved. Theſe are the <hi>Statutes</hi> of our GOD, reſpecting his publick Worſhip. In his Majeſty, Wiſdom, Holineſs and Grace He has enjoyned them. They are few and of great Significance and Importance, for the Glory of God and the Benefit of Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Honour of the <hi>Great</hi> KING of Heaven, and in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Him, we muſt religiouſly keep his <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> There is a Portion of <hi>Time</hi> which He has ſeperated to Himſelf, from the Creation of Man upon the Earth. There is no proper Reverence of Him as our <hi>Creator</hi> Redeemer and Sanctifier without the reverend Obſervation hereof. Levi. xxvi. 2. <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary, I am the</hi> LORD
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003645_0017_10023BC214750B98"/>Exod. xxxi. 13. <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep, for it is a Sign between Me and You thro'out your Generations that I am the</hi> LORD <hi>that doth Sanctify you.</hi> It is a weekly Act of Homage to GOD as the Great King and Governour of the World. Kings are required thus to honour the KING of all the Earth. Ezek. xlvi. 2, 4 <hi>The Burnt-offering which the Prince ſhall offer upon the Sabbath-day ſhall be ſix Lambs without Blemiſh.</hi> He muſt bring a princely Offering, and give a royal Example to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The firſt Sabbath-breaker in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> died as a <hi>Traitor</hi> againſt the LORD his King. It was <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt the MAJESTY <hi>on High.</hi> He has no <hi>Birth-day</hi> for us to keep in Honour to his Name! but there is the Birth-day of this <hi>World</hi> of ours, and of <hi>Man</hi> upon it, and there is a Day wherein He raiſed up the SON OF MAN, <hi>the Prince of Life</hi> from the dead; and in ſolemn Remembrance of Theſe He commands us to ſpend one Day in ſeven in Prayers and Praiſes to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Being, the GOD of our Salvation. Thus it is that the <hi>Kingdom of our</hi> GOD, <hi>and the Power of His</hi> CHRIST is perpetuated and made glorious on Earth. Thus it is that we obey and anſwer to that Divine Call to us, Pſalm xxiv. ult. <hi>Lft up your Heads, O ye Gates, and he ye lift up ye Everlaſting Doors, that the</hi> KING OF GLORY <hi>may come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In Reverence to GOD as the Great King of his Church, we awfully obſerve the holy Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> He may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn us what He will. Of old He gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Sign of Circumciſion, and that day he circumciſed Himſelf, his Son, and all the Men of his Houſe. His Covenant was in their Fleſh for an everlaſting Covenant. When the Will of GOD was once declared, it had been high Preſumption, a Contempt of His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> to have diſobeyed, tho' it was a humbling and painful Inſtitution. Exciſion from God and from his People was the Penalty incurred. It was of ſpecial ſpiritual Significancy to 'em; Deut. x. 16. <hi>Circumciſe the Foreskin of your Hearts.</hi> xxx. 6. <hi>And the</hi> LORD <hi>will circumciſe the Heart of your Seed to love Him, that thou mayeſt live.</hi> In like manner, the ſacred <hi>Sacramental Waſhing with Water</hi> is ſignificant of a Soul ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience. They are the Circumciſion who worſhip GOD in the Spirit. Baptiſm is now the <hi>Livery of the Great King,</hi> which his Servants wear to ſignify their Relation to Him, and Dedication to his Service. Matth. xxviii. ult. <hi>Go teach all Nations baptizing them.</hi> The KING of the Church was Himſelf baptized, and the Heavens opened on the illuſtrious Occaſion, and the SPIRIT deſcended as a Dove upon Him. The Miſſion of <hi>John</hi> was witneſſed to from Heaven by the FATHER and the SPIRIT, and by the SON on Earth, <hi>He, the Elias of the New-Teſtament</hi> came baptizing with Water. It is a Solemnity much to be reverenc'd in the Chriſtian Church to the End of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003645_0018_10023BC3B15C2F48"/>World. CHRIST'S Yoke herein is light, a Law of eaſy and pleaſant Obſervation; and he muſt be very unreaſonable who like <hi>Naaman</hi> the Leper thinks much of the Injunction were it to waſh <hi>ſeven times.</hi> 2 Kings v. 13.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we recognize our <hi>Seed</hi> as Subjects of CHRIST'S Kingdom. Did our Earthly King ſummon us to <hi>inrol</hi> our Names, and thoſe of our Children, that He might know Us and Them as Candidates for the Honours and Preferments of His Court, we ſhould crowd it may be to enter our Names. Or ſhould He ſend us a <hi>Garter</hi> to wear in Token of his Favour and Grace to us, we ſhould be proud to put it on. With like Gratitude ſhould Chriſtians think of their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and bring their Offspring to the Waters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Reverence and Obedience to the GREAT KING of the Church, we ſhould be very careful in our Obſervation of the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> It is the Memorial of our CRUCIFIED KING, for ſo ran the Inſcription over his Croſs, "JESUS <hi>of Nazareth King of the Jews</hi> Him hath GOD ſet KING upon his holy Hill. He is LORD to the Glory of the FATHER. And as he went to his Croſs he left us this Law, "<hi>This do ye in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame GOD and KING that requir'd of old the Ordinance of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> has appointed now this of the <hi>Supper;</hi> to give Him the Glory of his <hi>Redeeming Love,</hi> and to receive from Him a publick Token and Pledge of it. Shall we refuſe? And ſay as in our <hi>Context," The Table of the Lord is contemptible!</hi> GOD fo bid. Is the Table of a great <hi>King</hi> ſo accounted among Men? Do or dare Men refuſe to wait there, when required to do ſo? Or do they not think it a great <hi>Honour</hi> and Pleaſure to be call'd up to it? And with what <hi>Reverence</hi> do they behave, who ſtand about their Princes Table? How do they dreſs and prepare on ſuch Occaſion? Yet in Religion Men too often are the Reverſe of all this. The Caſe and Crime is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the KING that made <hi>a Marriage Supper</hi> for his SON, Matth. xxii. Init. But thoſe that were <hi>bidden</hi> made their paltry and criminal <hi>Excuſes,</hi> till the <hi>King was wroth</hi> and proteſted they ſhould never taſte of his Feaſt. We read again of His coming in to ſee his <hi>Gueſts,</hi> and how He chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd him that came without a <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> and caſt him out into utter Darkneſs. It teaches us the equal Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of thoſe that <hi>neglect</hi> and thoſe that <hi>profane</hi> the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Supper.</hi> Many wont come at all at the Call of their KING, and too many come careleſly and without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Fear. The Inſtitutions of our GOD may be proſtituted by Humane Laws, and many an unfit polluted Soul find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003645_0019_10023BC5F83242D0"/>under an evil kind of Conſtraint to approach them for carnal and filthy Ends: For the ſake of their daily Bread they may ſometimes unwillingly eat of the Bread of their GOD and drink of his Cup. And as long as partaking of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is made a <hi>Teſt</hi> of Loyalty to our <hi>Earthly King,</hi> and a <hi>Qualification</hi> for Offices in Fleets and Armies, it will in this wicked World be neceſſarily profan'd to the Diſhonour of the KING OF GLORY. HE has made it an <hi>Oath of our Allegiance to Himſelf,</hi> and we muſt take and make it with godly Fear; <hi>Swearing</hi> to Him in Truth, in Righteouſneſs and in Judgment. Has our GREAT KING ſaid to us, "<hi>Do this in Remembrance of Me!</hi> And ſhall we not do it? And He has ſaid, Do it not <hi>unworthily!</hi> leſt ye <hi>eat and drink Judgment to your Selves.</hi> We ſhould be equally deterred from the Neglect, and from the careleſs Performance of the Duty.</p>
            <p>But this for the <hi>firſt Uſe,</hi> which anſwers to the mighty <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the Words as they ly in our <hi>Context:</hi> Is GOD a Great KING? then with what <hi>Reverence and godly Fear</hi> is HE to be <hi>worſhipped</hi> in one Ordinance of his Houſe and in another? I ſhall be <hi>ſhorter</hi> in the remaining <hi>Inferences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is GOD a Great King? <hi>how great is the Evil of the leaſt Sin!</hi> We muſt ever eſtimate the Evil of Sin from the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the DIVINE MAJESTY. <hi>David's</hi> Heart ſmote him for cutting off <hi>Sauls</hi> Skirt, ſo ſhould our Hearts ſmite us for the leaſt Appearance of Sinning againſt the LORD our King. In every wilful Act of ſin we are guilty of ſtretching forth our Hand againſt the KING of Heaven, and ſtriking at his Crown and Government. Shall not <hi>Shimei</hi> die (ſaid faithful <hi>Abiſhai</hi>) that has <hi>rail'd</hi> at and <hi>curs'd</hi> my Lord the King? We in Effect do <hi>this</hi> to the KING <hi>of Glory,</hi> and <hi>caſt Stones</hi> at Him, in every ſin we commit againſt the LORD OUR GOD. Shall a <hi>dead Dog</hi> do this and live! Sinners are <hi>no better</hi> before that BLESSED BEING whom their Sins bark at and blaſpheme. A light Repentance can never ſuffice for the leaſt ſin againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty. 1 Sam. ii. 25. <hi>If a Man ſin againſt the</hi> LORD <hi>who can entreat for Him?</hi> What Atonement can be made for an infinite Offence? We read of ſome, who being doubly damn'd, <hi>do curſe their</hi> GOD <hi>and</hi> KING, <hi>and look upward.</hi> Iſai. viii. ult.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If GOD be a great King, He can <hi>greatly Pardon.</hi> And it is therefore a great Thing for Him to pardon the leaſt Sin. He cannot lightly pardon the Tranſgreſſion of his royal and perfect Law. The glorious Honour of his Kingdom forbids it. He cannot de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Himſelf. But ſaving the Rights of his own Wiſdom, Juſtice and Holineſs, what cannot the Great King do?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003645_0020_10023BC867658E58"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> well prayed, Numb. xiv. 17. <hi>Let the</hi> POWER <hi>of my</hi> LORD <hi>be great according as Thou haſt ſaid, the</hi> LORD <hi>is Long-ſuffering and of great Mercy, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhai</hi> wondered at <hi>David</hi>'s forgiving <hi>Shimei.</hi> But what was <hi>David</hi>'s Throne if compar'd with GOD'S. <hi>To the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, <hi>belong Forgiveneſſes.</hi> This is the <hi>Glory</hi> wherein he paſſes before us Sinners.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What a great thing is it, for the GREAT KING of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to give <hi>his</hi> OWN SON to ſave us! His <hi>Only-begotten and Eternal</hi> SON! <hi>the Brightneſs of his</hi> Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon! by <hi>Whom He made the World, and by Him all things conſiſt.</hi> What manner of Love and Grace is this to Rebel duſt and aſhes! Had all the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, and all the <hi>Kings</hi> upon Earth, been offer'd up in one Sacrifice, theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lives had been as nothing in Compariſon of that ſingle Life of the SON OF GOD in our Nature. A LIFE worth all theſe ten thouſand times over.</p>
            <p>It was accepted as a great thing by the GREAT GOD, when <hi>Abraham</hi> offer'd up his beloved <hi>Iſaac</hi> to Him, at his Word, for a Burnt-Offering. But may we name it here? by no means. It was a more ſurpriſing thing and horrible, when the <hi>King of Moah</hi> driven to Deſpair by the victorious Arms of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> took his <hi>Eldeſt Son</hi> that ſhould have reigned after him, and <hi>ſlew</hi> him on the Wall of the City. A ſalvage and brutiſh. Act! from Rage at his powerful Enemies, and worthy of their Deteſtation. But the Love of GOD in giving his <hi>Dear Son,</hi> to ſave his Enemies, is worthy of the Adorations of <hi>Angels</hi> and Men, while <hi>Devils</hi> gnaſh their Teeth and melt away.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> is due from us to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the GREAT KING, and what <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to Him in all his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences!</hi> GOD is abſolutely to be obeyed and ſubmitted to in all things. He is ſo in Heaven and it ſhould be ſo on Earth. "<hi>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> It was a wiſe and righteous Order, given by the Greateſt Man on Earth, Ezra vii. 23, 26. <hi>Whatſoever is commanded by the</hi> GOD <hi>of Heaven, let diligently be done; for why ſhould there be Wrath againſt us?</hi> GOD's <hi>Judgments</hi> muſt be reſigned to with a perfect Acquieſcence. As <hi>Shimei</hi> anſwered to <hi>Solomon, "The ſaying is good: As my Lord the King hath ſaid, ſo will thy ſevant do.</hi> We are happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a perfect Government. <hi>As for</hi> GOD, <hi>his Work is perfect.</hi> This is enough to keep us always eaſie, thankful, joyful. <hi>Shall he that hateth Right govern, or is there Wickedneſs in the</hi> MOST HIGH? <hi>What Right have I (ſaid injured Mephibeſheth) to cry
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003645_0021_10023BCA01339E00"/>to the King?</hi> Our Times and Lives are in GOD's Hand. It is the LORD! let Him do what ſeemeth him good.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Is GOD a Great King? <hi>to him let us ſwear and to Him perform our Vows.</hi> Becauſe He is the <hi>Greateſt</hi> we ſwear by his Name, and He ſwears by Himſelf. Jerem. iv. 2. <hi>Thou ſhall ſwear, "the</hi> LORD <hi>liveth! in Truth and Righteouſneſs: and the Nations ſhall bleſs themſelves in Him, and in Him they ſhall glory.</hi> We muſt ſwear Allegiance and Fidelity to GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He is our <hi>King.</hi> So we have done in our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and ſo we do <hi>as often as we eat of his Bread and drink of his Cup.</hi> The <hi>Sacraments</hi> of Religion are <hi>Oaths</hi> of Loyalty and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to CHRIST. And in all our ſolemn Prayers and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</hi> and occaſional Vows, we bind our Souls, as by <hi>Oath,</hi> to GOD. "<hi>O my Soul, thou haſt ſaid unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>Thou art my</hi> LORD. This is the Demand of the GREAT KING, and his Glory requires it: Iſai. xlv. 23 <hi>I have ſworn by</hi> MY SELF, <hi>that unto Me every Knee ſhall bow, every Tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Is GOD a Great King? there is certainly <hi>a Tribute</hi> due to Him out of all that we are and have: from our Minds and Hearts, from our Lips and Hands, out of our Eſtates, and according to our Endowments and reſpective Stations. GOD is the King of <hi>Souls,</hi> and it is the Homage of the <hi>Heart</hi> that He requires and values. He gives us alſo our <hi>Wealth</hi> and claims an <hi>Offering</hi> out of that.
