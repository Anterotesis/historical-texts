            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE enſuing addreſs to a miniſter and his church in Berwick, was not wrote with any deſign of publication; and when that was firſt requeſted, I intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it for ſeveral reaſons; one of which was, that I would be far from expoſing private concerns to public view, farther than is neceſſary. But upon a renewed requeſt from my friends in Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and viewing how greatly thoſe called the Baptiſt principles are miſtaken and miſrepreſented by miniſters and churches in that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they are but little known, I thought proper to yield to the requeſt: Neither in reality are theſe private concerns, for they were publicly acted among them, and there is reaſon to think that both authors and neighbouring miniſters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in the affair. Though what had the greateſt weight in my mind was, the conſideration that many who are filling the nation with the cry of LIBERTY, and againſt <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> are at the ſame time them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves violating that deareſt of all rights, LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE; for if that man is <hi>inexcuſable</hi> who judgeth another, and yet doth the <hi>ſame things,</hi> and if we are <q>ſure that the judgment of God is according to truth, againſt them which commit ſuch things,</q> is it not a needful kindneſs, inſtead of an injury, to endeavour to ſhew to ſuch, be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011556_0003_0F87215858D77F40"/>
they ever ſo much our ſuperiors, wherein they are expoſing themſelves to that judgment? And as I am ſenſible that multitudes have the ſame notions concerning liberty of conſcience, as this miniſter and church have, I ſhall tranſcribe their ſentiments upon it, and make a few remarks thereon.</p>
            <p>They expreſs themſelves thus: <q>As to what you ſay of <hi>tying the conſcience in ſpiritual things,</hi> we can hardly think what you refer to. It is what we intirely diſallow and proteſt againſt, and are not ſenſible of doing it; but it you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of having done it, we are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that objection.—Liberty of conſcience we claim ourſelves and allow others, as a darling point; and therefore muſt not be <hi>forced</hi> to any thing contrary to <hi>our</hi> conſciences, nor be thought to tye the conſciences of others by <hi>not conſenting</hi> to what we cannot think to be for the honor of God, and intereſt of religion.</q> It is readily granted, that the uſe either of force or fraud is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true liberty; but does it not look odd for a miniſter and his church to talk of being <hi>forced,</hi> only by a requeſt from one of their members, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in as mild and reſpectful terms as language can furniſh? However, by this we may gueſs what complaints we ſhould hear, if they had as much occaſion from us as we have from them. The plain fact is this. A brother of that church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from their communion, and (as an atteſted copy of their records ſhews) gave two reaſons for his ſo doing: One was, their admitting perſons of <hi>various characters</hi> to own the covenant, and bring their children to baptiſm: The other was, <q>That he ſaw a ſpirit of oppoſition againſt the ſpirit of God in the church.</q> And they don't deny the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011556_0004_0F8721592DBACD68"/>
truth of his reaſons, but judged them not to be "ſufficient," and therefore declare him to "lie under the public offence of this church," &amp;c. And they afterward tell his wife that this cenſure "was not for one opinion more than another, but for the neglect of—attending upon the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per." And when he and his wife were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by a farther ſearching of the ſcriptures, not only that the half-way covenant was wrong, but alſo that believers only were the proper ſubjects of baptiſm, ſhe wrote a letter, wherein ſhe in a very reſpectful manner requeſted a diſmiſſion to the Baptiſt church in that town: In anſwer to which they wrote a letter to her as long as a ſermon, in which they poſitively <hi>deny</hi> her requeſt.</p>
            <p>And what now is their liberty of conſcience come to? Why truly their <hi>members</hi> are <hi>forced</hi> either to believe as the church believes, or be dealt with as public offenders! They tell this ſiſter, that <q>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but very weighty and grievous things lying upon the conſcience, which they cannot remedy, can juſtify a perſon to ſeperate,</q> &amp;c. Which implies, that in ſuch a caſe they may ſeperate; yet whoſe conſcience is to judge when the caſe is ſo? If it is only the church that is to judge, then where is their allowance of liberty to others as a darling point! It will doubtleſs be ſaid, that they give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their denial of that requeſt. Well what are they? One of them is, they ſay that Baptiſt church was "ſet up in an irregular manner." And was there ever a church which allowed that thoſe who ſeperated from their irregularities, were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in ſo doing? But to let others judge of this caſe, I underſtand it to be plainly thus. Sundry of theſe brethren in Berwick, withdrew from this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011556_0005_0F87215A90D38A78"/>
and other churches for like reaſons, and were dealt with in like manner as theſe mentioned above; and they were baptized by the paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Haverhill, and he with two deacons from that church were preſent when this church was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted on June 28. 1708. who have maintained divine worſhip among themſelves ever ſince, and are owned as a regular church of Chriſt by ſiſter churches of the ſame faith and order. Regular, is a word which is turned to any purpoſe which men pleaſe, and it is well known that it is often applied to thoſe who were lately guilty of the moſt bloody diſorders and irregularities ever ſeen in our Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis. And it expreſly appears by what is before refer'd to, that all that this miniſter and church in Berwick have againſt theſe two members, ariſes from their refuſing to join with them; and by what I can learn, the caſe is much the ſame with the reſt of the Baptiſt church, whom they call irregular.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſnares on every hand, which we ſhould watch againſt, therefore let none miſtake me, and think that I am againſt miniſters and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches labouring faithfully with their members, if they think them out of the way in any reſpect; but the manner of their doing of it in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, appears contrary to the goſpel rule of <hi>ſpeaking the truth in love,</hi> in the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They try to ſtrain a few of this ſiſter's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to make her ſay what ſhe did not ſay, in order to get an advantage againſt her. Indeed they ſay they regard not ſo much her inconſiſtency in writing, as in her ſentiments and practice; but her ſentiments and practice are plainly theſe, that there are ſome in that church which ſhe eſteems as
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011556_0006_0F87215A9975CAB0"/>
               <hi>beloved in Chriſt,</hi> and wiſhes well to them all, while the church as a body appears to her ſo corrupt both in doctrine and practice, that ſhe cannot with a clear conſcience join with them: And where is any inconſiſtency in that?</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they ſet out to ſhew the Baptiſts errors, they bring in many truths which we hold as much as they do, and hereby unwary minds are catcht with a prejudice againſt us as a very bad people, that don't hold ſuch good truths. So have I ſeen a net baited with as good wheat as that which is laid up in the garner. Some of the truths I refer to are theſe; that whatever agrees not with the law and teſtimony, is to be rejected; that fathers, or our neareſt relations, are not to be followed, but rather teſtified againſt when they forſake the truth and their duty; that baptiſm is a ſign of initiation or introduction into the viſible church of Chriſt, and as ſuch ought not to be repeated. Theſe and other truths which they bring in, we hold as fully as they, and for them to repreſent the contrary, is unfair dealing with us, and tends to deceive others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Having attempted to ſtrip us of ſuch good cloathing, they would cloath us with ſuch bearſkins as theſe, viz. That in order for a perſon to join with us, he muſt renounce <q>all that he has done to lay himſelf under obligations, all his profeſſions, and all that God has done for him heretofore;</q> and a great deal of ſuch ſtuff, which is as contrary to truth as darkneſs is to light. For they ſay, <q>That muſt be of men, which is not taken from the word of God, as enjoined there;</q> therefore when we are convinced that infant-ſprinkling is ſuch, we renounce it, and practice believers baptiſm, which is plainly enjoined there, without the leaſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011556_0007_0F87215B52D9E1C8"/>
thought of renouncing any thing which God has done for us, or that we have heretofore done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that was agreeable to his will.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Having thus laboured to turn her mind, they near the cloſe ſay, "If you <hi>will</hi> forſake the church, you muſt anſwer for it." In which, their putting a mark of diſtinction as they do upon the word <hi>will,</hi> plainly implies a judging her to be governed by will inſtead of conſcience, if ſhe does not yield to their arguments.</p>
            <p>Now if, to ſtrain an expreſſion, and make a man an <hi>offender for a word;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 29.20, 21.</note> if attempts to ſtrip ſuch as appear againſt the evils of the times, of truths which they hold, and to load them with falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, and then to charge them, or ſuch as join with them, with wilfulneſs in their way, were things peculiar to Berwick, I ſhould not have expoſed them thus to the world: But this is ſo much the picture of modern liberty and charity, that a hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up to view may poſſibly be of ſervice to others. And though many may think this picture ſufficiently odious already, yet the finiſhing ſtroke is ſtill behind; which is for the ſecular arm to finiſh what the church has began. The church has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Baptiſt to be irregular, therefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power ſtill <hi>force</hi> them to ſupport the worſhip which they conſcientiouſly diſſent from; for this end the public teacher of the Baptiſt church in Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and one of the ſociety, were ſeized and carried priſoners to York laſt winter, and they informed me that when they attempted to have the caſe tried at April court, it was ſhifted off by a pretence that the chief Judge might not ſit becauſe he lived in Berwick, though the Baptiſts deſired he might ſit:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011556_0008_0F87215FF6A0F470"/>
And as there was not enough to make a court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, the other party could hereby prevent the caſe from coming to the Superior Court until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year. This is done by men who pretend to allow liberty of conſcience to others as a darling point! And things of like nature are done in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the land; of which at preſent take but two inſtances more. One is in the diſtrict of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague, in the county of Hampſhire, where is a Baptiſt church of many years ſtanding; yet their neighbours force away, their eſtates from time to time, to ſupport a worſhip which they cannot join with: And I was informed by a credible Gentleman who was preſent, that when one of that church ſought for relief at laſt Auguſt court, the chief Judge (who was honor'd with that commiſſion in conſequence of his being one of the 17 <hi>reſcinders</hi>) was inſtrumental of turning the caſe againſt him, by ſuch a cant as this, viz. That the plaintiff was one of the ſigners of their certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and there was not the number which the law required without him. According to which, it is only for any people to diſtrain firſt upon one of the committee, and then they may fall upon the reſt of the ſociety as they pleaſe, as they have done at Montague ſince in a barbarous manner.</p>
            <p>The other inſtance is at Aſhfield, in the ſame county, where a Baptiſt church was conſtituted and a miniſter regularly ordained in the year 1761, when they were the major part of the town; and they have maintained divine worſhip among themſelves ever ſince; yet a number of a different perſuaſion coming into the town afterward, and a few who were there before, with the help of non-reſident proprietors, brought in a miniſter of their own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and have taxed the Baptiſt miniſter and his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011556_0009_0F87216159AC53A0"/>
ſociety towards his ſettlement, ſalary, and building their meeting-houſe, for which they have forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them at ſeveral times to the value of <hi>ten Pounds</hi> lawful money on each right; and tho' the Baptiſt petitioned for relief to the General Court in May 1768, and obtained a vote that they ſhould notify the town and proprietors of Aſhfield, to ſhew cauſe, if any they had, why their petition ſhould not be granted, at the next Seſſion of the court, and that the further collection of taxes from the petitioners ſhould be ſuſpended in the mean time; yet no ſooner were they gone home, but their opponents the next week <note n="*" place="bottom">Chiefly, as I am informed, by means of the ſame Judge that turned the caſe againſt them at Montague.</note> obtained an Act to enable them to lay their miniſterial taxes upon all the lands in ſaid town, let them be in whoſe hands they would: In conſequence of which, they poſted and ſold laſt April at public vendue, for a very ſmall part of their value, mowing land, winter grain, orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding, one dwelling-houſe of a poor man's, and their burying place, in the whole about 400 acres; by which means, as they ſay in their petition to our General Court, <q>We are not only deprived of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience, which our moſt gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign has granted us in common with other his loyal ſubjects (which we have a right to in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and reaſon) but we are alſo in great meaſure diſinherited, and in a fair way to be turned naked into the wide world; we humbly beg leave to ſay, Theſe things are hard; very hard! for if we may not ſettle and ſupport a miniſter agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our own conſciences, where is liberty of conſcience? And if we may be allowed that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which is moſt reaſonable, by what law, or with what equity, are we <hi>forced</hi> to pay for the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011556_0010_0F87216307245E80"/>
ſettlement of another with whom we cannot in conſcience join!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe people (as they ſay in ſaid petition, <q>A conſiderable part of us ſettled on our lands in this town before the laſt war, and endured a great deal of hardſhip in the war, in building a fort upon our own coſt, and defending ourſelves for ſome years, without any help from the province,)</q> have been at a great deal of pains and expence in applications to our General Court from time to time, and this very year have been at the expence of no leſs than five journeys down above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles for that purpoſe, were at their Seſſion in the ſpring before, and in the time of their lands being torn from them, which they had cleared with the peril of their lives, becauſe of the ſword of the wilderneſs; yet have got no relief, nor any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of it, but the contrary. And ſome, to juſtify their conduct, plead that thoſe lands were granted upon condition of ſettling and ſupporting that religion; and there are miniſters who, inſtead of purſuing <hi>peace, prepare war</hi> againſt thoſe who will not <hi>put into their mouth;</hi> and, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> obſerves, <q>That magiſtrates ſhould thus ſuffer theſe incendiaries and diſturbers of the public peace, might juſtly be wondered at; if it did not appear that they have been invited by them unto a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the ſpoil, and have therefore thought fit to make uſe of their covetouſneſs and pride, as a means whereby to encreaſe their own power. For who does not ſee that <hi>theſe good men</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more miniſters of the government, than miniſters of the goſpel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that great reaſoner juſtly obſerves, that <q>The buſineſs of laws is not to provide for the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011556_0011_0F87216394EB9740"/>
truth of opinions, but for the ſafety and ſecurity of the common-wealthy and of every particular man's goods and perſon. And ſo it ought to be; for truth certainly would do well enough if ſhe were once left to ſhift for herſelf. She ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has received, and I fear never will receive, much aſſiſtance from the power of great men; to whom ſhe is but rarely known, and more rarely welcome. She is not taught by laws, nor has ſhe any need of force to procure her entrance into the minds of men. Errors indeed prevail by the aſſiſtance of foreign and borrowed ſuccours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſays he, <q>To give laws, receive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and compel with the ſword, belong to none but the civil magiſtrate; and upon this ground I affirm, that the magiſtrate's power extends not to the eſtabliſhing of any articles of faith, or forms of worſhip, by force of laws. For laws are of no force at all without penalties." "The care of ſouls cannot belong to the civil magiſtrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his power conſiſts only in outward force: But true and ſaving religion conſiſts in the inward perſuaſion of the mind; without which nothing can be acceptable to God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and many other convincing obſervations Mr. Locke has made, in his letter concerning tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but I have a greater authority than his to produce againſt theſe oppreſſive meaſures; even that of Zion's King, who compares the ſetting up of his kingdom in the world to the ſowing of good ſeed in a field; after which an enemy ſows tares; which when the ſervants diſcovered, they were for gathering up the tares, but he ſaid, <hi>Nay; leſt, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them: let both grow together until the harveſt.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011556_0012_0F8721645B6EACB0"/>
Which parable he has explained ſo plainly, that we may well be aſtoniſhed at the conduct of ſome who pretend to be his ſervants, and yet dare to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him; ſo much that the field which he ſays is <hi>the world,</hi> they ſay, is the <hi>church:</hi> according to which, if any <hi>appear by their fruits</hi> to be children of the <hi>wicked one,</hi> they muſt ſtill let them alone in the church, inſtead of <hi>putting away</hi> from among themſelves ſuch wicked perſons, as he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, 1 Cor. 5.13. While they ſtir up the civil magiſtrate to <hi>root up</hi> or puniſh ſuch of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in <hi>the world,</hi> as will not ſupport their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes. Here then, though we ſuppoſe we might lay as juſt a claim to the character of loyal ſubjects, and good chriſtians, as our neighbours; yet let them ſuppoſe the beſt for themſelves, and the worſt for us that they poſſibly can; let them call themſelves children of the kingdom, and us children of the wicked one, and at the ſame time forcibly deprive us of any of our worldly goods and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, becauſe we don't conform to their religion; how can they anſwer it before the king of Kings, and lord of Lords! How dreadfully do they run upon the ſword which proceedeth out of his mouth, that ſays, "Let both grow together until the harveſt!"</p>
            <p>I am very far from charging this upon any whole body of people, and fully believe that there are many of the common denomination in this country who truly regard the rights of conſcience, and abhor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and in many places our people enjoy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and live in peaceable good neighbourhood with others; yet the violations of the rights of mankind are ſo great in other places, that it is high time that ſomething was more effectually done againſt them, than has ever yet been done in our land; for thoſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011556_0013_0F8721651ADA7748"/>
which have been called laws in our favour, have never been enforced with penalties which has emboldned many to break them; and indeed Mr. Locke ſays, "laws are of no force at all without penalties."</p>
            <p>Some would accuſe us of being enemies to our country, becauſe we move in theſe things now; though if regard to our country had not prevailed above our private intereſts, poſſibly the court of Great-Britain would have heard our complaints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time: However, let our accuſors turn the tables, let them hear their oppreſſors exclaiming from year to year againſt being taxed without their own conſent, and againſt the ſcheme of impoſing epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy upon them; while the ſame perſons impoſe crually upon their neighbours, and force large ſums from them to uphold a worſhip which they conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly diſſent from, and then ſee if they will ſit ſtill until their oppreſſors have got fully eſtabliſhed in their power, before they ſeek deliverance from their yoke; for this is truly our caſe. And as the honorable Edward Goddard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly one of his Majeſty's council for this province, and whoſe motto adorns our title page) ſays,
<q>
                  <l>LORD majority would claim the purſe,</l>
                  <l>For his incumbants: than which nothing worſe,</l>
                  <l>LORDLY dioceſan, himſelf, can claim:</l>
                  <l>So theſe two Lords do differ but in name.</l>
                  <l>One pleading Engliſh laws, for his ſupport;</l>
                  <l>The other feigning acts of our own court.</l>
                  <l>Alledging law, in a perverted ſenſe,</l>
                  <l>To render CHARTER grant, a mere pretence;</l>
                  <l>And as if law and charter both intend,</l>
                  <l>To cruſh one church, another to befriend:</l>
                  <l>They'd make them mean, the ſame that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid,</l>
                  <l>Go ſerve the Lord, but let your flocks be ſtay'd.</l>
                  <l>But if one church be tax'd, to ſerve another,</l>
                  <l>No matter whether done by this or t' other.</l>

            </head>
            <p>AT a church-meeting Auguſt 11. 1767. It was deſired that Mr. Abraham Lord give his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of abſenting from the communion of this church. And 1ſt. He ſaid, That he could not approve of the church's admitting many perſons to have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for their children who are of various characters, as he ſaid they did; and that he did not know of any diſtinction between owning the covenant and coming into communion, and believed there was but one covenant. 2dly. That he ſaw a ſpirit of oppoſition againſt the ſpirit of God in the church, in keeping our ſome preachers, and depriving the members of hearing, and improving their gifts. Which being conſidered by the church, the queſtion was put, Whether the church look on theſe reaſons as ſufficient to juſtify his abſenting from our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Voted in the negative. The conſideration of the matter referred to the next church-meeting.</p>
            <p>Sept. the 8th, the church met according to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, and 1ſt. entred upon the conſideration of the caſe of Mr. Abraham Lord; and voted, That Mr. Abraham Lord be declared to lie under the public offence of this church, and be with-held and ſuſpended from the holy fellowſhip of the Lord's ſupper, and from all ſpecial ordinances and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the church, until his offence be removed by penitent confeſſion.</p>

I cannot ſit eaſy here in your debaring one of the members of this church from the holy fellowſhip of the Lord's ſupper, and from all ſpecial ordinances and privileges of this church. You have intirely ſhut me out who am of the ſame way of thinking; for tying the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſpiritual things is worſe than parting with earthly enjoyments. As to the doctrines and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Baptiſt church, as far as I can conceive, it is agreable to the word of God, and neceſſary for my ſalvation; and to be plain, I cannot benefit here as I would deſire.

            <head>(Their Anſwer.)</head>
            <head type="sub">To Mrs. Elizabeth Lord, member of the church of Chriſt in the north pariſh in Berwick.</head>
            <p>BEloved ſiſter in Chriſt, your letter to us of April laſt has been laid before us, and we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered thereon: And though an anſwer thereto has been delayed for a conſiderable time, yet we would not have you think that it is through a neglect of you; but it was thought proper that ſome previous ſteps ſhould be taken before a poſitive anſwer was given; as we would leave no ſuitable chriſtian means untried to remove what we eſteem your falſe opinions, which are grounds of your requeſt of a diſmiſſion. And indeed the ſubject of your letter is ſuch, and your mind is (as we conceive) ſo much turned aſide from the truth, that after labouring with you to reclaim you by a committee of the church, it may be conſidered as a prudential act, and an act of kindneſs and tenderneſs to you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay an anſwer, that you might have opportunity to think better of the ſubject, and to return to your duty before you had wholly gone off and forſaken the communion of the church of Chriſt, with which you ſolemnly covenanted: praying that God would lead you into the truth, and deliver you from error; we hope that you do by this time at leaſt begin to think better.</p>
            <p>As to the principal ſubject of your letter, which is your requeſting a diſmiſſion from this church, to the Baptiſt church in this town, we having met twice and deliberated thereon, judged it inconſiſtent with our covenant-engagements and chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; accordingly voted, That we cannot ſee our way clear to comply with your requeſt, by giving
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011556_0017_0F872169E760E6F0"/>
you a diſmiſſion from this church to the Baptiſt church in this town.—There are ſeveral reaſons which (as they appear to us) render it improper and what we ought not to comply with, to give you a diſmiſſion in the manner which you requeſt.—1ſt. We cannot but eſteem your motives thereto, in part at leaſt, to be very wrong, and that you labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very miſtaken apprehenſion of things in the reaſons which you give therefor.—You ſay, the reaſon why you inſiſt on it is, That you cannot ſit eaſy here; and that the reaſon that you cannot ſit eaſy here is, that we have debated one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this church from our communion, or to that purpoſe; whereby you ſay, we have ſhut you out, who are of the ſame way of thinking. We muſt ſuppoſe that you mean your Huſband, when you ſpeak of one of the members of this church being debared, with whom you ſay, you are of the ſame way of thinking. But if you think that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bared for any opinion at all, you have quite miſtook the thing:—It was not for one opinion more than another, but for the neglect of an important chriſtian duty, viz. attending upon the Lord's ſupper, a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect which had long been perſiſted in, while you continued to commune with the church therein:— And it was for this neglect, and not for any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions, that we dealt with him in a way of diſcipline, as we thought it to be our duty from our obligations of a brotherly watch for his good to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. As to his differing from us in his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about Baptiſm, he did indeed at the church-meeting juſt ſuggeſt that he began to think diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, or was under ſome doubt, but did not inſiſt on it at all as a reaſon for his abſenting from our communion before:—His being ſuſpended does not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011556_0018_0F87216B36E442E8"/>
therefore at all relate to you, or ſhut you out from the enjoyment of any and all the ordinances and privileges of the church; unleſs you are affected with it merely becauſe he ſtands in the relation to you of your huſband. But if that is the caſe, we muſt tell you that we think you are very wrong therein; for in Chriſt's kingdom we are not to be influenced by any ſuch relations; but to deny and forſake them all as to acts of ſpiritual communion, if his honor and the truth and purity of his goſpel require it. To this purpoſe is that ſaying of Chriſt in Luke 14.26. "If any man come to me, and hate not his father &amp; mother, and wife and children, brethren and ſiſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple." Which <hi>hating</hi> can mean nothing ſhort of a diſregard of them in compariſon of Chriſt and his goſpel, and a hearty readineſs to oppoſe them, and bear teſtimony againſt them, wherein they forſake the truth and their duty: We conceive therefore that your motive for leaving us ariſing from hence, is very wrong. And if you are diſpoſed in any meaſure to change your opinion, or to think more favourably of the Baptiſt principles, or to leave us and go to them on account of the cenſure paſt upon your huſband, you are certainly quite wrong therein, in not being led by truth, but by partiality and prejudice in favour, which you ought not to be governed by. We do not ſay that this is the caſe with you, but adviſe you to examine yourſelf.</p>
            <p>As to what you ſay of <hi>tying the conſcience in ſpiritual things,</hi> we can hardly think what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to.— It is what we intirely diſallow and proteſt againſt, and are not ſenſible of doing it; but if you can convince us of having done it we are ready to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011556_0019_0F87216BD4E25428"/>
remove that objection: You cannot therefore have any reaſon or motive from hence to forſake us.— Liberty of conſcience we claim ourſelves and allow others, as a darling point; and therefore muſt not be <hi>forced</hi> to do any thing contrary to <hi>our</hi> conſciences, nor be thought to tye the conſciences of others by <hi>not conſenting</hi> to what we cannot think to be for the honor of God and intereſt of religion.</p>
            <p>As to your opinion concerning the doctrines and diſcipline of the Baptiſt church, both that they are agreable to the word of God, and neceſſary for your ſalvation, we are truly ſorry for your miſtake, and that you appear to be ſo uncharitable, by ſaying, what ſeems to cut off the whole Chriſtian world, except the few who are of the ſect of the Baptiſts from your charity and hope of their ſalvation: But we truſt that if you carefully and ſeriouſly attend to and conſider this opinion with its conſequences, you will not abide by it: We truſt you would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly ſay or do what would ſhut out from ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deny ſalvation to the apoſtles who baptized whole houſholds upon the faith of the head or heads of the family, or deny the ſalvation of thoſe who were baptized by them, and of all the primitive chriſtians who (according to ancient hiſtory) for three or four centuries univerſally practiſed infant-baptiſm, and none denied it. Which that it was practiſed by the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians may be alſo concluded from the univerſality of the practice ever ſince, and at this day among all the ſectaries of whatever denomination in Chriſtendom, except the ſmall ſect of the Baptiſts, comparatively with the whole ſmall indeed: For however ſome of the other ſectaries have warped off from the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in other reſpects, yet they all agree in this, who
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011556_0020_0F87217135006F88"/>
hold to any outward ordinances, viz. The baptiſm of infants as being of divine right and authority. And the univerſality of agreement in this practice among all ſectaries, how different ſoever, &amp; oppoſite to one another, except the few Baptiſts, ſtrongly argues in all reaſon that it is a practice of early date, and took its riſe with the chriſtian diſpenſation, that it was taught and practiſed by the firſt founders of it. We truſt you would not deny the ſalvation of all who have practiſed and do ſtill practiſe infant-baptiſm and ſprinkling; among whom (if we judge by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evidences and marks of true piety and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) there have been and are ſtill many, not only real chriſtians, but eminent chriſtians, and among whom there have been many eminent miniſters, whom God has evidently own'd and bleſs'd, and which way God has evidently own'd and bleſs'd by bringing home many ſouls therein. It ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God himſelf does not eſteem the doctrines and diſcipline of the Baptiſt church to be neceſſary for ſalvation, wherein they differ from us, and that he has made it appear that they were not neceſſary for the ſalvation of the primitive chriſtians, or chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of later ages, or chriſtians of theſe days. You ſeem indeed aware of this even while you deſire a diſmiſſion from us to the Baptiſt church, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that you think their doctrines and diſcipline to be neceſſary for your ſalvation; this appears in your ſtiling us, <hi>Beloved in Chriſt, deſiring our prayers for you, and hoping that we and you ſhall meet at the right hand of God, and praiſe him to all eternity:</hi> All which are expreſſive of your charity for us, and hope of our ſalvation in the way that we are in, as you ſay, <hi>Though we cannot join in ſerving God here, I hope,</hi> &amp;c.—We muſt put you in mind of your
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011556_0021_0F8721903AF8BDA0"/>
inconſiſtency, and therefore your error in this point, regarding not ſo much an inconſiſtency in writing as in your ſentiments and practice: You ſtile us, <hi>Beloved in Chriſt, deſire our prayers for you,</hi> and hope we ſhall meet together at God's right hand, and yet deſire to leave us, intimate that you cannot have communion with us, and that you think other and different doctrines and diſcipline from what we receive and practiſe are neceſſary to ſalvation, that is, to <hi>your</hi> ſalvation, which term <hi>neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> implies that you think that you cannot obtain ſalvation without embracing thoſe doctrines and that diſcipline: But how is it that they are ſo neceſſary for your ſalvation, when ſo many people have been chriſtians, and have been ſaved, and others may yet be ſaved in a different way, and you yourſelf expreſs your charity for us as <hi>chriſtians,</hi> and hope of our ſalvation, who do not embrace thoſe doctrines and that diſcipline, and continuing not to embrace them? Why are they ſo neceſſary for your ſalvation, and not at all neceſſary for the ſalvation of others? Or why, if we are chriſtians and beloved in Chriſt, and a true church of Chriſt, [<note n="*" place="bottom">This Mr. Lord and his wife declare is not true.</note> as you expreſt yourſelf in your letter, and private converſation to the church's committee compared together]—if ſo, why do you deſire to leave us, why can't you have communion with us, why can't you ſit eaſy here, how can you eſteem other and different doctrines and diſcipline neceſſary to your ſalvation, and by renouncing your baptiſm, and all your former profeſſions, do that which will deny any communion with us, and that we have any right to the name of a church of Chriſt? Can your views of things be right, can your motives be good, which induce you to do this? Can they
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011556_0022_0F87219196253C38"/>
be approved of God? How can you lay ſuch a ſtumbling-block before the children of God, the church of Chriſt, even ſo large a body of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as the whole number of thoſe who practiſe infant-baptiſm and ſprinkling? If our <hi>baptiſm</hi> is null and void in the ſight of God, then our miniſtry and ordinances are ſo too, a meet nullity, or what is much worſe, a profanation; God therefore does not own them nor concur with them in his influences, there can therefore be no hope of our ſalvation in our way of adminiſtration. Whatever excuſes you may be ſo kind as charitably to make for us on account of our want of light, and labouring under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of education, ſo as to hope that we may be accepted and ſaved; yet, alas! they won't help us: But your profeſſed principles and practice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing your infant-baptiſm [if our character and final ſtate was to be determined according to them] would not only ſhut us out of a church-ſtate, but out of heaven itſelf; we could not hope to receive a bleſſing in our way of adminiſtration, or to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God to eternal life, perſiſting therein. If it be indeed, as the plain language of your new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples expreſs, or (in other words) if your new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be true according to the goſpel, there is no hope for us perſiſting in the way that we are in:— But to ſupport our confidence, we may ſafely ſay, If our method of adminiſtration of ordinances is not valid, and God does not own them, he never own'd any in the chriſtian diſpenſation, and hath no true church upon earth, as we have the witneſs of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, who well evidenced their faith, and the blood of martyrs in various ages in our favour; yea mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of thoſe who were in our way of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who bore teſtimony to the truth of the religion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011556_0023_0F872192128C4E68"/>
which they profeſſed unto the death, triumphing over that laſt enemy in the ſure and lively hope of glory: To which we think we may add, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the holy Spirit to us in his concurring influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and bleſſing with the word and ordinances; from whence we firmly conclude that he owns them.</p>
            <p>We ſuppoſe indeed that you think yourſelf to have been a chriſtian for a number of years; if ſo we truſt you won't deny the agency of the Spirit of God in making you a chriſtian: And his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of operation is in the way of the means of his own appointment; and no doubt he acted conſiſtent with himſelf, and in his uſual way of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when you was brought home, if indeed you be a chriſtian; which was while you continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the adminiſtration of ordinances, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and practiſe: In conſequence of which opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [we ſuppoſe] you was induced to join in full communion with the church in this way, and ſo continued for a number of years without a difficulty upon your conſcience as to your baptiſm, that we were ever ſenſible of. You will perhaps ſay, that you have ſince gained farther light as to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of baptiſm, and find that you are ſtill unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: But can that be <hi>true light</hi> which induces you to renounce your baptiſm, and that adminiſtration of ordinances, as a meer nullity or profanation, which God has thus owned and bleſſed? To you, or that miniſtry, in attendance upon which God has beſtowed upon you his ſaving influences, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned you with the light of life? To ſuppoſe that the Spirit of God who owned the adminiſtration of ordinances which we practiſe, does now lead you to renounce your baptiſm, this adminiſtration of ordinances and theſe churches, is to ſuppoſe that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011556_0024_0F8721982DC05378"/>
the Spirit of God acts contradictorily to himſelf, and owns two directly contrary methods of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one of which being a total ſubverſion or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the other: Which ſuppoſition needs no farther confutation, than the bare mentioning of it. Therefore, unleſs you can deny that God did ever concur in his influences, and afford his bleſſing with our method of adminiſtration, either to you or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you are conſtrained and bound to confeſs that you are not now led by the Spirit of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing your baptiſm, and therewith our admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ordinances and churches: And if you are not led by the Spirit of God herein, which operates in and by the word and miniſtry of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you are certainly wandering out of the paths of truth, in the wilderneſs of error, in this reſpect, wherein you have loſt the true guide, in renouncing the adminiſtration which God owns. Therefore as you acknowledge and own us in your language as chriſtians, and a true church of Chriſt, and that we may be ſaved in our way, the inconſiſtency of your practice, we muſt think, is a proof of your error in thoſe ſentiments, and that practice which denies any communion with us, and virtually ſpeaks and ſays, That we are in a ſtate of Heatheniſm, that we have not ſo much as the viſible ſigns, and deſerve not the name of a church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And we have farther to add, 2dly. That we eſteem the <hi>act</hi> of your leaving us and going off to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church, and complying with what they demand of being re-baptized, to be very wrong. Baptiſm, if it is conſidered in ſcripture light, we conceive is to be eſteemed an initiating ordinance, a ſign and ſeal of initiation or introduction into the viſible church of Chriſt; and as ſuch it is not to be repeated. It
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011556_0025_0F87219A14F22EC0"/>
is abſurd, as common ſenſe and reaſon teaches, to ſuppoſe two initiations by the ſame ſign. If a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has been once initiated by baptiſm into the viſible church, he is then a member of Chriſt's viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and however he may fall away and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize by ſin or neglect of his duty, ſo as to forfeit the charity of the church, and ſo to require a public profeſſion of repentance and ſolemn renewal of his engagements to be the Lord's, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the church's charity; yet all this does not diſſolve his baptiſmal bonds, and his relation to the church as a baptized perſon, or render him unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, whether that ordinance was adminiſtred in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy or adult years. It is in the nature of it an outward ordinance, and ſo far as it is an outward ſign of initiation, it is never to be repeated when it is once performed. When Simon the ſorcerer fell after his baptiſm, and appeared to be an unbeliever, in the gall of bitterneſs and in the bond of iniquity, the apoſtle exhorts him to repent of his wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of his heart may be forgiven him; but he ſays not a word about his being baptized again. See Acts 8. Whereas his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to thoſe who were unbaptized were, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized,</hi> Acts 2.38. If you ſhould ſay, That you was baptized in <hi>infancy,</hi> when you <hi>knew nothing of it,</hi> and was not capable of <hi>believing,</hi> and that it is therefore null and void: It may be anſwered, That your want of faith did not diſannul your baptiſm as an outward ſign, any more than Simon's unbelief diſannulled his baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Your baptiſm (we may add) is no more diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by its being done in your infancy, than the circumciſion of the Jewiſh children at eight days old was rendred null and void by its being done in their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011556_0026_0F87219A8A3868C8"/>
infancy, when they were incapable of believing; whereas it was not expected that it ſhould be <hi>their act</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> in the promulgation of God's graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous covenant, or to <hi>offer themſelves</hi> to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, as they were not capable of acting, though the ſign of initiation into God's covenant was enjoined to be performed to them by others: The ſame propriety there is undoubtedly in the nature of the thing, and in God's view in believers under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel conſecrating and dedicating their infant ſeed unto God, by a ſacred ceremony and ſeal, a ſeal which God has ſeen fit to enjoin as a ſeal of initiation into his viſible church and kingdom under the chriſtian diſpenſation. As God did once expreſly command, viz. that under the old diſpenſation of the covenant of grace, that the infant ſeed of his viſible people ſhould be initiated into his viſible church by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſign; and as he has under the new diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not diſannulled their right to the covenant ſeal, but on the contrary given us ſtrong reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the continuance of the ſame right to that ſign which is now the ſeal of the covenant, the ſeal of initiation, by various paſſages of ſcripture, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in ſtiling the children <hi>holy,</hi> one or both of whoſe parents are believers, 1 Cor. 7.14. not meaning (as we ſuppoſe) an inherent holineſs, or holineſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a faederal or covenant holineſs, as being of the number of God's people, as being the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the covenant;—from theſe conſiderations, as well as other reaſons which fall in with theſe, ſome of which have been hinted at in the courſe of this letter, we think we are bound to hold the baptiſm of infants to be of divine right and authority, and think that the validity of their baptiſm, when once baptized, cannot be denied: therefore your baptiſm,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011556_0027_0F87219B177B8150"/>
we conceive, is not on this account to be repeated. We are ſenſible that there is great ſtreſs laid upon the particular mode of baptiſm by <hi>plunging,</hi> by ſome of the ſect of the Baptiſts; who ſay, That baptiſm by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> is of itſelf null and void on account of the mode, and that it is no baptiſm:—But is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no baptiſm, becauſe it is baptiſm performed by ſprinkling, or pouring water on the perſon, and not by dipping him all over therein? And do you think your baptiſm to be no baptiſm on that account? And is it for this reaſon that you ſay, that the doctrines and diſcipline of the Baptiſt church, as far as you can conceive, are neceſſary for your ſalvation? This is truly to make the particular mode of baptiſm by plunging to be eſſential, both eſſential to baptiſm and to ſalvation.—But by what authority do you make ſuch a particular mode of baptiſm one of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of religion, eſſential to baptiſm, and to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Have you your authority therefor from the ſcripture? Has Chriſt or his apoſtles ever ſaid ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or ſaid that from whence you may without any doubt infer it, and affirm it to be in the above ſenſe eſſential, ſo as to declare all thoſe who are not baptized in this way, but are baptized by ſprinkling to be unbaptized perſons, and in a ſtate of heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, a ſtate of eſtrangement from God and from the promiſes and privileges of the covenant of grace, ſo as to ſhut them out of the church and of Chriſt, and therefore out of heaven? As this principle holds. We are fully perſuaded that you don't find Chriſt or his apoſtles ſaying any ſuch thing:—But if it had been eſſential, don't you think that Chriſt in his boundleſs wiſdom and goodneſs to mankind, and his church would have clearly revealed his mind and will to us in that point, in his revelation which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011556_0028_0F87219BDBCF3F58"/>
to his church? No doubt he would,—as we have reaſon to bleſs his name that he has given us ſufficient reaſon to think that every thing neceſſary to ſalvation is clearly and plainly revealed in the written revelation which God has of his abundant mercy given us.—"To the law, therefore, and to the teſtimony; if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them." <hi>Iſa.</hi> viii. 20. We would therefore remind you that it is dangerous making things eſſential, which Chriſt has not made ſo, and making other laws, rules and terms of communion, beſides thoſe which Chriſt has made and enjoined:—This is to uſurp the throne, the prerogative and authority of Chriſt, the only king and lawgiver of his church, and is alſo an high affront to his wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>That water-baptiſm is an ordinance of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel diſpenſation, we firmly believe, as Chriſt has been pleaſed clearly to reveal it to be ſo: But as to the particular manner of adminiſtring it, whether by dipping or pouring water on a perſon, or ſprinkling, we find nothing expreſs in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and think that Chriſt has left no poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reſpecting it, leaving us at liberty to perform it either way as ſeem to us moſt convenient, and that we have full liberty to uſe either way of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without giving offence to any chriſtian, without giving occaſion to any to withdraw from our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or incurring the cenſure of any as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſons, in a ſtate of heatheniſm, having no regular miniſtry or ordinances, and having no right to the name and privileges of a church of Chriſt; which is the plain conſequence of holding that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by plunging is the only baptiſm, that baptiſm by ſprinkling is null and void, and is no chriſtian
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011556_0029_0F87219CA2961870"/>
baptiſm; as you ſignified is your opinion.—We don't ſay, that baptiſm was never adminiſtred by John Baptiſt, or by the apoſtles, by <hi>dipping,</hi> though we are perſuaded that it was not always, as where it appears, that ſome were baptized in the houſe, and where great numbers were baptized in a day; upon which occaſions dipping would be attended with great inconvenience, or even an impoſſibility: We are perſuaded therefore that dipping is not eſſential to the ordinance, but that ſprinkling of water on a perſon in baptiſm, is fully warrantable by ſcripture, that it was at leaſt ſometimes practiſed by the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and primitive chriſtians, and is upon the whole to be choſen, as being agreable to the mind of Chriſt, and that in <hi>ſome</hi> caſes at leaſt it <hi>ought</hi> to be uſed; as when the other mode would be impracticable, or be attended with great inconvenience or danger of health.</p>
            <p>But as to the practice of John Baptiſt, allowing that he baptized by dipping only, <hi>that,</hi> we conceive, is nothing to the preſent mode of baptiſm; for his baptiſm was not the chriſtian baptiſm, for the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſpenſation had not then taken place in the world, it being the baptiſm of repentance introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to it, and practiſed before Chriſt entred upon his public miniſtry, ſee Matt. 3d and 4th chapters. It was not therefore the baptiſm of the new and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſpenſation, Chriſt not having yet inſtituted it: Hence the boaſted argument comes to nothing at all, which ſome uſe to prove the neceſſity of being baptized by <hi>dipping, That it is a following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt,</hi> who they ſay, was baptized in that manner by John Baptiſt in Jordan, as it is ſaid, <hi>That he went up out of the water:</hi> For that was not the baptiſm of the chriſtian diſpenſation, and therefore it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011556_0030_0F87219D55672810"/>
is no proof or evidence that he deſigned that we ſhould follow him in that particular mode of baptiſm.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt has not enjoined the particular mode of baptiſm, but has left us at liberty to uſe either plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſprinkling, or pouring water on the perſon to be baptized, we think baptiſm by dipping is <hi>lawful</hi> according to the ſcripture, though we don't think it enjoined or commanded; and if any perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared conſcientiouſly to chooſe it, we could with a good conſcience conſent to the admiſſion of members into our church, by their being baptized in that way, in caſe they had not been baptized at all. But to eſteem it eſſential, or to admit a perſon to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by dipping, who had been baptized by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, we cannot. And indeed for a perſon that has been once baptized by ſprinkling, to renounce that baptiſm and be baptized by dipping, is at leaſt a trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the ſacred ordinance, and is but little, if any, ſhort of a profanation of it; and if you ſince you have been baptized by ſprinkling, have renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your baptiſmal covenant, and have communed with the church of Chriſt, ſhould renounce all your former engagements to receive baptiſm by dipping, we eſteem it that you would be guilty of great ſin herein, even a trifling with or a meer profanation of ſacred things. And if you are a chriſtian, yet your conduct herein muſt be reckoned among thoſe works, which are ſtiled <hi>wood, hay, ſtubble,</hi> which ſhall be burnt, by which you will ſuffer loſs. And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſteem it for the honor of God, for the intereſt of Chriſt's kingdom, or the ſafety of ſouls, that the ſect of the Baptiſts, eſpecially ſome of them, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout urging thoſe who have already been baptized by ſprinkling, to be re-baptized by dipping, thus teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011556_0031_0F87219F996CB678"/>
as that muſt be of man, which is not taken from the word of God, as enjoined there, and thus mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commandment of God, the inſtitution au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by God, of none effect by their traditions.</p>
            <p>To conclude this our reply to your letter, we ſhall only add, 3dly. That however your mind may be ſo turned aſide from the truth, as to think that you ſhall do right, to renounce your baptiſm to be re-baptized by being dipped, to forſake this church with whom you have ſolemnly covenanted to walk in chriſtian fellowſhip, and to go off from us to the Baptiſt church, yet we do not think it to be our duty to <hi>conſent</hi> thereto, by giving you a diſmiſſion from us to that church; but we think it to be our duty to <hi>deny</hi> it, to <hi>bear teſtimony againſt</hi> your ſo doing, and ſolemnly to warn you againſt it.—We eſteem it no ſmall matter for a perſon to ſeperate from a church in any manner, with which he or ſhe has ſolemnly covenanted to walk in chriſtian fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; an act which nothing but very weighty and grievous things lying upon the conſcience, which they cannot remedy, can juſtify: But to add to this the renouncing the baptiſmal tranſaction and bonds, and all that a perſon has done to lay himſelf under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, all his profeſſions and all that God has done for him heretofore, to be baptized by dipping, thereby practically declaring all the churches of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denominations to be no churches of Chriſt, this muſt be attended with peculiar and very great aggravations. Hereby the body of Chriſt is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and torn, his members wounded and grieved, many whom you yourſelf cannot deny to be chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>deſpiſed</hi> as being unbaptized, having no true churches, miniſtry or ordinances, and thereby is thrown a ſtumbling-block in the way of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011556_0032_0F8721A189375C18"/>
of Chriſt: And on whom muſt the guilt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of lie? Muſt it not lie on you?</p>
            <p>If you can <hi>ſatisfy yourſelf</hi> as to doing this, we repeat it, that <hi>we cannot conſent</hi> to it; we think it inconſiſtent with our duty to God our heavenly Father, to Chriſt our Lord and Redeemer, and to you our ſiſter in the Lord, to withdraw our brotherly watch from you, and conſent to your going off to a church with which we are not in communion as a church, it being ſet up in an irregular manner; we think we ſhould be guilty of great want of love, of brotherly tenderneſs and care ſo to do. But if you <hi>will</hi> forſake the church with which you have ſolemnly covenanted, and conſent to join with the Baptiſt church by being re-baptized, <hi>you muſt anſwer</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>We have a hope for you that you have built upon the true foundation, even Jeſus Chriſt, but caution you not to build thereon this, <hi>wood, hay, ſtubble,</hi> leſt you ſuffer loſs by your works being burnt.—We hope and pray that God will purge you from any tincture of error, and lead you into all truth, that you may continue in the faith, grounded and ſettled, and that you may be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding; and reſt your Brethren in Chriſt,</p>

            <p>BEING by divine Providence brought into this place, and being called to baptize Mr. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Lord, and his wife, I thought it my duty to inquire into their character, as well as their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and experiences; and finding that he is under a cenſure of your church for withdrawing from your communion, and that ſhe has had a long letter of warning and reproof from you, in anſwer to one that ſhe wrote to requeſt a diſmiſſion from you to the Baptiſt Church in this town, it appeared to me expedient to return you ſome anſwer thereto: In doing of which I ſhall endeavour,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. To give the true ſtate of the caſe between us. 2dly. To conſider your method of ſupporting your principles. 3dly. Your notion of liberty of conſcience.</p>
            <p n="1">Iſt. To give the true ſtate of the caſe between us; it is plainly this: We hold that baptiſm was inſtituted by Chriſt to be adminiſtred only to them who give goſpel evidence of their being true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and to be adminiſtred to ſuch by <hi>burying</hi> in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011556_0034_0F8721A3A8E13D90"/>
water, and not by pouring or ſprinkling. But you hold infants as well as believers to be ſubjects of baptiſm; and that <q>Chriſt has not enjoined the particular mode of baptiſm, but has left us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to uſe either plunging or ſprinkling, or pouring water on the perſon to be baptized.</q> This being the plain ſtate of the caſe, I will proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly. To conſider your method of ſupporting your principles. And here, 1. You beg the very queſtion in debate; for you ſay, <q>The apoſtles baptized whole houſholds <hi>upon the faith</hi> of the head or heads of the family;</q> and that, <q>All the primitive chriſtians (according to ancient hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory) for three or four centuries univerſally practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infant baptiſm, and none denied it.</q> Whereas the very point in diſpute is, Whether the apoſtles baptized any <hi>upon the faith</hi> of the head of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or not? And for you to ſay they did without proof, is a notorious begging of the queſtion. As for the Jaylor's houſe, the ſcripture is expreſs that they <hi>ſpake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe:</hi> And that he rejoiced, <hi>believing in God with all his houſe,</hi> Act. 16.32, 34. And the houſe of Lydia are called <hi>brethren,</hi> who were <hi>comforted</hi> by the apoſtles, ver. 40. And the houſhold of Stephanus, were the <hi>firſt fruits of Achaia,</hi> and <hi>addicted themſelves to the miniſtry of the ſaints,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.16. and 16.15. All which plainly be-ſpeak their acting by their own faith, and not being baptized upon others faith; and theſe are the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtances of houſhold baptiſm, that we have in the Bible. And as to the primitive chriſtians, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their univerſally practiſing infant-baptiſm, according to ancient hiſtory, it appears that we never have it named until the third century, and then St.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011556_0035_0F8721A4128CAC28"/>
               <hi>Origen,</hi> who is one of the firſt that appeared for it, ſays, <q>It is for that reaſon, becauſe by the ſacrament of baptiſm the <hi>pollution of our birth is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> that infants are baptized.</q> See Mr. <hi>Peter Clark</hi>'s defence of infant baptiſm, againſt Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> pag. 111. And hence they (as appears by Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s quotations) frequently called baptiſm <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> from a miſtaken notion that a being born of water, in John 3.5. meant baptiſm: But if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents willingly bringing their children, and miniſters willingly putting water upon them would regenerate them, that would contradict John 1.13. which aſſures us, that we are not born again of <hi>blood,</hi> nor <hi>of the will of man, but of God.</hi> And your ſaying that none denied it, is not truth; for it appears by Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> and others, that <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s appearing againſt infant-baptiſm, is the firſt expreſs account that we have of its ever being practiſed; and by the ſame account we find that the uſe of <hi>God fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> therein, is of as early date as the practice itſelf. The apoſtle John tells us, that the <hi>myſtery of iniquity</hi> did <hi>already work</hi> in his day; how far then had it prevailed when this cuſtom was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, which, according to <hi>Origen</hi>'s words, was built upon that antichriſtian doctrine, That the <hi>ſacraments confer grace!</hi>

Having thus begged the queſtion, you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to frighten Mrs. Lord from embracing the Baptiſt principles, by repreſenting that her ſo doing would virtually <q>ſhut out from ſalvation, or deny ſalvation to the apoſtles,</q> and to the primitive chriſtians, as well as to multitudes ſince. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence you endeavour to draw from her ſaying in her letter to you, that <q>As to the doctrines and diſcipline of the Baptiſt church, as far as I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011556_0036_0F8721AA8E78F0D8"/>
it is agreable to the word of God, and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for my ſalvation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But, pray Sirs, who would ever have drawn ſuch a conſequence therefrom, if they had not a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced mind? Her words plainly include all our doctrines and diſcipline, and not thoſe points only wherein we differ from other chriſtians: And do any of you expect to be ſaved without embracing and conforming to the doctrines and diſcipline that you think is agreable to the word of God? Or dare you act contrary to your conſciences for fear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning good men's errors! The apoſtle plainly ſhews, that he that <hi>doubteth</hi> whether a thing be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or not, and yet doeth it, is <hi>damned</hi> or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Rom. 14.23. how much more muſt that perſon be ſo who acts contrary to what he is convinced is right? Mrs. Lord, in her letter, plainly expreſt her belief of the ſalvation of other chriſtians, which are not of her ſentiments about baptiſm, while ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed it neceſſary for her to act according to the light which God had given her: This you try to repreſent as a great inconſiſtency, and carry things ſo far as to ſay of yourſelves, that <q>If our baptiſm is null and void in the ſight of God, then our miniſtry and ordinances are ſo too, a meer nullity, or what is much worſe, a profanation; God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does not own them nor concur with them in his influences; there can therefore be no hope of our ſalvation in our way of adminiſtration.</q>— This is a way which has been often uſed to frighten people from ſeeing with their own eyes, or from acting their own judgments; but I truſt you will allow that circumciſion was as neceſſary formerly as baptiſm is now, yet will you ſay that there was no hope of the ſalvation of all the Iſraelites, who were
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011556_0037_0F8721AC95975FD0"/>
born in the wilderneſs for 40 years, who were not circumciſed until after they came over Jordan? Joſh. 5.5. The feaſt of Tabernacles, which was one of the greateſt ordinances in the Jewiſh church, took its name from the mode which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be kept in, yet ſoon after they were ſettled in Canaan, they dropt that mode, and it was not recovered again for above a thouſand years, even from Joſhua's time until after their habitations had lain deſolate 70 years, Neh. 8.17. Solomon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the temple at that feaſt, though becauſe they had dropt the manner of keeping of it, from which it took its name, therefore it is there named only from the time of keeping it, viz. the <hi>ſeventh month,</hi> 1 Kin. 8.2. Yet how great were the tokens of God's preſence at that feaſt? Can any of you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to equal evidence of his preſence in ſprinkling for baptiſm, as Iſrael had at that feaſt? Or to any who have practiſed it, that equalled David for devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Solomon for wiſdom? Yet the poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives who returned from Babylon, were not deter'd by ſuch great characters from returning to an exact conformity to divine rule, Neh. 8.14,—17. From theſe and many other ſcriptures, it appears that God owns and grants his preſence with his ſaints, ſo far as they act in his truth, and yet will not hold them guiltleſs in retaining any error, or neglecting to act upon any truth when it is farther opened to them, even though, that error had been held, or that truth neglected by the greateſt or beſt of men.</p>
            <p>The prejudices of education and natural affection are ſo great, that all the light and power of the day of Penticoſt did not convince one of the apoſtles that they were to drop circumciſion; and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother viſion from heaven gave Peter farther light
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011556_0038_0F8721AD1591D9C0"/>
in the caſe, the reſt of the Church <hi>contended with him</hi> about it, until they were convinced alſo, Act. 11.2, 18. So I expect our fathers and brethren will do with us about our forſaking infant ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, until they are convinced of their error.</p>
            <p>All your attempts to prove that either Mrs. Lord had not the Spirit of God with her when ſhe held to infant baptiſm, or elſe cannot have the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in leaving of it, have not ſo much colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in them, as they might have had who were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of circumciſion, to ſay to Peter, That either he had not the ſpirit on the day of Penticoſt, or elſe that he could not have it in going in to men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You go on to endeavour to prove infant-baptiſm from Abraham's covenant. But here let me obſerve, that the prieſthood in that church was as expreſly limited to Aaron's natural ſeed, as ever church-privileges were to Abraham's poſterity; yea and more ſo, for one admitted of proſelytes, the other did not: And it is abundantly evident from the New-teſtament, that both Abraham and Aaron were types of Chriſt, and their ſeed types of the ſaints; and I am fully perſuaded that there is every whit as much warrant from ſcripture, to entail the miniſtry under the goſpel to miniſters natural ſeed, as there is to give ſpecial ordinances to the offspring of believers before they are converted. How vain is it then to attempt to build a New-teſtament ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon an old-teſtament ceremony? How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent alſo is the method that is taken concerning 1 Cor. 7.14? For it is held on your ſide that this text proves that the ceremonial law is aboliſhed, by which the <hi>Jews wives, and ſuch as were born of them, were put away,</hi> Ezra 10.3. And you take
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011556_0039_0F8721AE99763FE0"/>
the ſenſe of the word <hi>ſanctified</hi> from the goſpel as we do, 1 Tim. 4.3,—5. Yet you turn directly back to that aboliſhed law for your ſenſe of the word <hi>holy.</hi> We are commanded to make <hi>ſtrait</hi> paths for our feet; and if we regard it, we ought to know that the ſame law which called Iſrael <hi>a holy people unto the Lord, above all people upon the face of the earth,</hi> commanded them for that reaſon not to <hi>make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi> with other nations, Deut. 7.3, 6. What <hi>crooked</hi> work then do they make who will take that law to explain the word holy by, in this very text which proves it to be out of date! Pray conſider it; if our children are holy as Iſrael were, then marriages with others is unlawful; but if ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are lawful now, then our children are not holy in that ſenſe as they were.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the mode of baptiſm, I obſerve that you allow our mode to be good, but would have other modes to be good alſo; to which I would ſay, We have not only plain accounts of their going into and coming out of the water, but are twice ſaid to be <hi>buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by or in baptiſm, and all know that to be buried is to be covered. I know many ſay, this don't refer to literal, but to ſpiritual baptiſm; yet when the ſame perſons come to the meaning of the word baptize, they would refer us to ſpiritual baptiſm, which they ſay is by ſprinkling or pouring; but you know what is ſaid of them that turn aſide to <hi>crooked ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are ſenſible that the word <hi>ſprinkled</hi> is often uſed, but it is never applied to baptiſm in all the bible; and you obſerve that thoſe who ſpeak not according to the law and teſtimony, <q>it is becauſe there is no light in them.</q> You need then to ſee what you are doing when you call that baptiſm which the Bible never calls ſo. We don't hold to re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011556_0040_0F8721AF5510AB70"/>
any more than you do, but when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that what was formerly done under that name was not what the ſcripture calls baptiſm, we eſteem it our duty to leave it though it were done by our deareſt fathers, and to practiſe Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and your own words are full in our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication herein; for you ſay that Luke 14.26. <q>Can mean nothing ſhort of a diſregard of them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſt and his goſpel, and a hearty readineſs to oppoſe them, and bear teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, wherein they forſake the truth, and their duty.</q>—I come,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To conſider your notion of liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, where you tell Mrs. Lord, that you can hardly think what ſhe refers to, when ſhe ſpeaks of your <hi>tying the conſcience in ſpiritual things;</hi> and you ſay, <q>Liberty of conſcience we claim ourſelves, and allow others as a darling point.</q> Yet you have laid her huſband under church-cenſure, for not coming to your communion, although it appears by your records, that he gave reaſons for his not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both as to your principles and conduct, which he "could not approve of:" And when ſhe tells you ſhe is of the ſame way of thinking, you reply, that it was not for <hi>any opinion at all</hi> that he was dealt with in a way of diſcipline; and ſay, <q>His being ſuſpended does not therefore at all relate to you, or ſhut you out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in the fear of God, Sirs, what do you mean! Has the admitting perſons of <hi>various characters</hi> to bring their children to baptiſm, and into a half-way covenant, no reference to any opinion? And if a perſon ſays, he ſees <q>A ſpirit of oppoſition againſt the ſpirit of God in the church in keeping out ſome preachers, and depriving the members of hearing, &amp; improving their gifts;</q> and therefore
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011556_0041_0F8721B01F934080"/>
declares he cannot commune with them for theſe reaſons, and yet is cenſured by the church therefor; is that <q>allowing liberty of conſcience to others as a darling point!</q> Or when another declares they are burdened with the ſame things, can it conſiſt either with liberty, or with <hi>truth,</hi> for the church to declare that the others caſe don't <hi>relate</hi> to them <hi>at all,</hi> unleſs they are affected with it meerly on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of natural <hi>relation;</hi> and ſo go on with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of injurious ſuggeſtions and repreſentations, which are followed with warnings and reproofs, without ever giving the leaſt ſatisfaction as to the points their conſciences were burdened with! If this be your church-order; if this be your liberty of conſcience, I muſt ſay as Jacob did, <hi>O my ſoul, come thou not into their ſecret, unto their aſſembly mine honor be not thou united.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt add, that your repreſenting that our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing believers baptiſm, carries in it a <q>renouncing all that a perſon has done to lay himſelf under obligations, all his profeſſions, and all that God has done for him heretofore:</q> And your often accuſing us with repreſenting all others to be in a ſtate of <hi>heatheniſm,</hi> are notorious falſhoods. Who will pretend to ſay, that Iſrael's being circumciſed at Gilgal, implied a renunciation of their former obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, or of any thing that God had done for them in the wilderneſs, or any pretence that they were then in a ſtate of heatheniſm!</p>
            <p>Methinks upon a review you muſt alſo be ſhock'd at your ſaying, that the baptiſm which Chriſt and his apoſtles received from John, <q>was not the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Chriſtian diſpenſation.</q> For we have not the leaſt intimation that Chriſt or any one of his apoſtles ever had any other water baptiſm but what
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011556_0042_0F8721B0D5239F00"/>
they received by John, ſo that you had as good ſay, that neither of them ever received the Chriſtian bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm!—I am willing to make all the allowance in theſe things, for remaining darkneſs and prejudice, that is conſiſtent with that <hi>charity</hi> which <hi>rejoiceth not in iniquity</hi> but <hi>in the truth;</hi> though I hope I may never give up the truth for any: And ſince you allow that a hating of fathers and brethren, in Luk. 14.26. can mean nothing ſhort of <q>a hearty readineſs to oppoſe them, and bear teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, wherein they forſake the truth and their duty;</q> I hope you will not take it ill that I have taken the freedom to do ſo to you.</p>
            <p>I have had but little time and advantage therefor, and am willing to have my miſtakes corrected, but what is truth ought to be regarded for its own ſake, and thoſe who do not regard it muſt anſwer therefor before Him who is ready to judge the quick and the dead; to whom I would commend you all, and reſt your hearty Well-wiſher,</p>

            <head>Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>DEAR Sirs, as I had but little opportunity when in your town, to anſwer your letter, I would now add a remark or two more. The firſt is, That notwithſtanding your profeſſed regard to the divine oracles, yet you ſet up the practice of men above the example of Jeſus Chriſt; for, to ſupport infant-ſprinkling you ſay, <q>The univerſality of agreement in this practice among all ſectaries how different ſoever, and oppoſite to one another, except the few Baptiſts ſtrongly argues in all reaſon that it is a practice of early date, and took its riſe with the chriſtian diſpenſation.</q> Though by the way the change of the feaſt in the ſeventh month, from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in <hi>tabernacles</hi> to keeping it in their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, was more univerſal; for I think we don't read of a ſingle diſſenter from that practice in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; unleſs the prophet is to be conſidered as one, who told this people, That the earth was <hi>defiled</hi> under them becauſe they had tranſgreſſed the laws, <hi>changed the ordinance,</hi> Iſa. 24.5. And if you look into John 7.44,—49 you may find that you are not the firſt who have advanced the authority of great men and the multitude, againſt a deſpiſed few; nor the firſt that have ſlighted the example of Jeſus of Nazareth, as you do in ſaying, <q>As to the practice of John Baptiſt, allowing that he baptized by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping only, <hi>that,</hi> we conceive, is nothing to the preſent mode of baptiſm; for his baptiſm was not the chriſtian baptiſm, for the chriſtian diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation had not then taken place in the world:<note n="*" place="bottom">If this arguing were good, then neither would it be any thing at all to us, how or in what manner Chriſt eat the Lord's ſupper, for the Jewiſh diſpenſation was not then diſſolved. What do men run into when they turn aſide from truth!</note>—
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011556_0044_0F8721B257026950"/>
Hence the boaſted argument comes to nothing at all, which ſome uſe to prove the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized by <hi>dipping, That is a following the example of Chriſt.</hi>
               </q> Thus the example of our divine Lord (though it perfectly agrees with that of Philip and the Enuch, who went <hi>into,</hi> and came <hi>out of</hi> the water) ſeems "nothing at all" in your eyes, while the practice of the multitude ſince the anti-chriſtian apoſtacy is ſo ſacred in your view, that you ſay, <q>For a perſon that has been once baptized by ſprinkling to renounce that baptiſm and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by dipping, is at leaſt a triflng with the ſacred ordinance, and but little, if any, ſhort of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, ſecondly, you, Sirs, who unjuſtly judge Mrs. L. to hold water baptiſm as eſſential to ſalvation, notoriouſly condemn yourſelves therein; for you tell her, That whatever excuſes ſhe might be ſo kind as charitably to make for you, <q>yet alas! they won't help us; but your profeſſed principles and practice in renouncing your infant-baptiſm [if our character and final ſtate was to be determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them] would not only ſhut us out of a church-ſtate but out of heaven itſelf.</q> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain you ſay, <q>If our baptiſm is null and void in the ſight of God,—there can be no hope of our ſalvation in our way of adminiſtration.</q> If this is not a holding external forms to be eſſential to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I know not what can be ſo; yea and ſuch forms too as you are all forced to own, are built upon conſequences and not upon expreſs ſcripture: And it is a tradition which, as far as it prevails, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cuts off your children from the liberty of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering a good conſcience</hi> after they believe, by being baptized as their Lord was; yet you are the men
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011556_0045_0F8721B418117408"/>
who accuſe us of <q>making the commandment of God, the inſtitution authoriſed by God, of none effect by our traditions,</q> only becauſe we teach believers who were formerly ſprinkled, that they ought now to be <hi>buried in baptiſm.</hi>—Upon the whole, I leave it to be conſidered whether the ſtreſs of your long letter does not all turn very much upon this one point, viz That whatever miniſters and churches have held &amp; practiſed when they had God's Spirit with them, can never be forſaken under the ſame influence. Which argument, however ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it has appeared to many, carries nothing leſs in it than that old Quaker notion, That when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has the Spirit with him, he is then perfect; for if he is not ſo, then there is no inconſiſtency in Peter's being taught by the ſame Spirit to go in to the uncircumciſed at Ceſarea, who firſt taught him to preach to the circumciſed at Jeruſalem; which was only a fulfilment of our Lord's words, who told them that he had many things to ſay to them which they could not bear now; but that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth ſhould guide them into all truth; yet many diſcover ſuch ſtrange ignorance of their bibles as to take this laſt clauſe to contradict the other with, as if the Spirit that guides into <hi>all truth,</hi> muſt do it all at once, inſtead of guiding in that path which <hi>ſhineth more and more until the perfect day!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Churchmen have made much uſe of this very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for retaining all thoſe popiſh ceremonies which were not reformed by ſuch eminent Saints and Martyrs as ſuffered in Mary's days: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the nature of the argument is levelled againſt all further reformation, and verifies the obſervation of one of the moſt eminent fathers of this country, namely Mr. John Davenport, the firſt miniſter of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011556_0046_0F8721B4E63B6250"/>
New-Haven, who afterward died at Boſton. He firſt fled into Holland from perſecution, and was deſired to ſettle there, but a principal reaſon why he would not, was becauſe they (much as it is now in our country) admitted almoſt all ſorts of perſons to bring their children to baptiſm, therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to come here; for, <q>He obſerved, That when a <hi>reformation</hi> of the church has been brought about in any part of the world, it has rarely been <hi>afterwards</hi> carried on one ſtep further, than the <hi>firſt reformers</hi> did ſucceed in their <hi>firſt endeavours;</hi> he obſerved that as eaſily might the <hi>Ark</hi> have been removed from the mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> where it firſt grounded, as a people get any ground in reformation, after and beyond the <hi>firſt remove</hi> of the <hi>reformers.</hi> And this obſervation quickned him to embark in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>reformation,</hi> wherein he might have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to drive things in the firſt eſſay, as near the precept and pattern of ſcripture as they could be driven.</q> See Dr. Mather's Magnalia, B. III. pag. 53. Accordingly, when in 1662, they, inſtead of perſuing further <hi>reformation,</hi> opened that way of <hi>degeneration,</hi> the half-way-covenant, he gave both his verbal and printed teſtimony againſt it. I fully believe that many of the fathers of this country were truly built upon the Rock, but that infant-ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was among their wood, hay, ſtubble, which will be burnt up; and I leave you to conſider what a condition ſuch are in, who have only their wood, hay and ſtubble, to build upon.</p>
