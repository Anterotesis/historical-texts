         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reader ſhould be reminded that the ground of the unhappy conteſt between Great-Britain and her Colonies, is wholly changed. A redreſs of grievances was all that the American Congreſs claimed at firſt. This redreſs has been repeatedly and amply offered by Government: Government is therefore guiltleſs of whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences may attend the war.</p>
            <p>But matters of this ſort are now entirely forgotten, and out of the queſtion. Empire, foreign alliances, and the ruin of the Parent State, are the <hi>ſublime</hi> objects which the Congreſs are now <hi>piouſly</hi> labouring to accompliſh. The Congreſs, as a body, are the authors of all the calamities which overwhelm America. Their conduct, as a body, which is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in the extreme, is therefore the ſubject of the following animadverſions. The writer of theſe Letters hath no perſonal enmity againſt any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Congreſs. He was, for this reaſon, under no biaſs, and had no inclination to run into perſonal invectives; he moreover diſdained the employment, and could not deſcend to ſuch trifles, when matters of ſo much greater moment demanded his attention. His heart bleeds for the calamities of his country: He tenderly ſympathizes in the diſtreſſes of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and feels a glow of indignation at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults which are daily offered to his amiable Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign —at the injuries intended againſt the Parent State. Whoever hath ſenſations ſimilar to theſe,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:016311_0003_0F9C2B01B53798A0"/>
will readily excuſe any aſperity that may be met with here, while the public conduct of thoſe who are the authors of theſe calamities, diſtreſſes, inſults and injuries, is examined; eſpecially when that aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is confined within the limits of truth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>The American Congreſs conſiſts of more than <hi>ſeventy</hi> members. Of theſe, <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine</hi> may be men of affluent fortunes—at leaſt, what are deemed ſuch in America—worth perhaps from 10,000l. to 30,000l. ſterl. All the reſt are either men of deſperate fortunes, plunged deep in debt; or in ſuch circumſtances, that, ſeparate from the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of office, and the eſtates amaſſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, none of them could have credit for 5000l. in the ordinary courſe of buſineſs. Whether ſuch men are fit to be truſted with abſolute, uncontrolled power; or with the management of millions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney —a management wholly ſecret—a management which is ſubject to no public inſpection, nor account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any, let reaſon decide. What a temptation to corruption and tyranny! Willing however to do all the juſtice to Congreſs that truth will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I may aver, that however prompted by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, republican principles, or ſelf-intereſt, they would not have had the audacity or preſumption to puſh matter, to ſuch extremities, at <hi>this time,</hi> had they not been countenanced, abetted and ſupported by a faction in England.</p>
            <p>Ambition, avarice, and local pride are diſeaſes of the human mind, and perhaps the moſt incurable. Truth and reaſon ſeldom have ſufficient efficacy to remove them. When SOLON warned the Athenians to beware of the popular arts of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> who was his kinſman, and that his deſign was to enſlave them in
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:016311_0004_0F9C2B03142ED308"/>
the end, which actually happened; the Athenians pronounced SOLON to be <hi>maa</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See SOLON's Letter to EPIMENIDES, preſerved by DIOG. LAERT. in vita Solon.</note>. Should the author be conſidered in the ſame light by any perſons, or be reviled, it would be ſome conſolation to him that one of the moſt celebrated Legiſlators, and moſt revered characters of antiquity, met with ſimilar treatment, in a ſimilar caſe. Whether this may he his fate; or whether his countrymen may profit by the warnings here faithfully and ſincerely given to them, he knows not: He has the ſatisfaction however of an approving conſcience; and can reflect with pleaſure that he hath diſcharged the duty of a good citizen and loyal ſubject, and hath done all in his power to avert the utter ruin of his country.</p>
            <p>N. B. The following letters were firſt printed in Mr. Rivington's <hi>Royal Gazette,</hi> and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in Mr. Gaine's <hi>New-York Gazette,</hi> ſince the commencement of the preſent year. Meſſ. <hi>Laurens</hi> and <hi>Jay</hi> were ſucceſſively preſidents of Congreſs— the latter now fills that place.</p>

            <p>THE late procedure of the Congreſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and impriſoning Lieut. HELE, of the Hotham ſloop, bearing a flag of truce, being a flagrant violation of the law of nations, ſhould not paſs without reprehenſion; nor the ſophiſtry which would attempt to juſtify it, without being detected and expoſed. The ſpirit which dictated this extraordinary meaſure, is perfectly ſimilar to that which actuates the Congreſs in all their other proceedings; this is an additional rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it ſhould be held up to public view, that the men and their meaſures may be the better known. The <hi>anſwer</hi> of Congreſs to Admiral GAMBIER's letter, requiring the releaſe of Lieut. HELE and his aſſociates, having been authenticated by the ſignature of your name, I ſhall addreſs to you the followihg <hi>ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> on that anſwer, which, I preſume, you and they deem a full vindication of your conduct.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances which gave riſe to the above anſwer, are ſo recent and well known, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to recapitulate them minutely. It will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016311_0007_0F9C2B0577977200"/>
to obſerve—that the King's Commiſſioners, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter making the moſt generous offers to the Congreſs, (ſuch as no American in the hour of ſober reaſon and reflection had a right to expect, or would have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) and attempting to bring about a reconciliation with the revolted colonies, in vain, thought proper, on the 3d of Oct. 1778, to iſſue their final <hi>manifeſto and proclamation,</hi> renewing their former offers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating their intention of returning to England ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, in caſe they were rejected—that this <hi>proclamation</hi> was addreſſed in the firſt inſtance to the Congreſs— that Lieut. HELE, in the Hotham ſloop, bearing a flag of truce, was charged with the delivery of the <hi>proclamation</hi> to the Congreſs—that his ſloop was wreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bay of Delaware, while proceeding on this buſineſs—that two of his people periſhed on the wreck —and that himſelf and the remainder, who with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty reached the ſhore, were ſeized and flung into priſon, by order of the Congreſs.</p>
            <p>On receiving the firſt intelligence of this inhuman act, ſo repugnant to the practice of all nations, civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized or ſavage, Admiral GAMBIER ordered an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be made to Mr. Beatty, the rebel Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of Priſoners, demanding the immediate releaſe of Lieut. HELE and his companions. Two reſolves of the Congreſs, authoriſing this nefarious deed, were tranſmitted by Mr. Beatty; and no other ſatisfaction was obtained: Lieut. HELE and his men were ſtill detained in priſon.</p>
            <p>A gallant officer will poignantly feel any inſult offered to his Sovereign—any injury done to thoſe who ſerve under him. The Admiral wrote a very ſenſible, ſpirited letter to the Congreſs, repeating the former demand, and expoſtulating with them on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of their procedure. Among other things he urged,</p>

1ſt. That it was an undue advantage taken of the calamity of a wreck, and that wreck a flag of truce.</p>
               <p n="2">2d.
The reſolution on which the Congreſs now wiſh to juſtify themſelves, is ſubſequent in date to the fact of which they complain.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. The manifeſto in queſtion was addreſſed in the firſt inſtance to the Congreſs themſelves, and could not poſſibly be ſeditious.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To theſe arguments, equally true, juſt and forcible, the Congreſs returned an <hi>oracular reſponſe</hi>; ſetting forth—
<q>That as the manifeſtos on board that veſſel (the Hotham) were of a ſeditious nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to open an unwarrantable correſpondence; their being covered with a flag of truce is by no means an extenuation of the offence.—That as no reſpect is due by the law of nations to a flag of truce when employed in illicit practices, ſo when detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the rights of a flag are forfeited; nor does the accidental wreck of the veſſel in queſtion make any diſtinction in favour of thoſe who navigated her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The diſingenuous ſophiſtry of this part of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (and it is of a piece with the reſt) is as contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, as the meaſure it would juſtify, is baſe and abominable. Every circumſtance relative to the flag of truce is miſrepreſented; every thing is called by an appellation which implies guilt, and an air of criminality is thereby thrown upon the whole, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make out the appearance of an argument for your vindication. A manifeſto containing the moſt liberal overtures of accommodation, and addreſſed to the Congreſs, is pronounced <hi>ſeditious,</hi> and tending <hi>to open an unwarrantable correſpondence</hi>; a flag of truce engaged openly to convey thoſe manifeſtos to the Congreſs, is ſaid to be <hi>employed in illicit practices</hi>; and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016311_0009_0F9C2B06D63FBD60"/>
to be <hi>detected</hi> in thoſe practices, when wrecked on her paſſage! Can any thing be more diſingenuous, or a groſſer violation of truth?</p>
            <p>Yet were every tittle of this true, it would by no means juſtify your conduct. The law of nations would not authoriſe you to detain Lieut. HELE and his crew, ſuppoſing him to be even employed on the deſign you alledge, and to have arrived at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia: That law would juſtify no more on your part than a refuſal of the manifeſtos, the preventing their circulation, and a diſmiſſion of the flag of truce, to return from whence ſhe came; but utterly forbids your barbarity to him when wrecked on his paſſage.</p>
            <p>The law of nations is no other than the law of reaſon applied to communities, in their intercourſe with each other, whether in peace or war; and their ſenſe of it we muſt learn from their practices in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes. As peace is the legitimate object of war—as this object cannot be obtained, nor the horrors of war ſoftened otherwiſe than by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of perſons who ſhall tranſact between the belligerent powers: Mankind have always agreed in paying a reverential regard to thoſe who were employed for thoſe ſalutary purpoſes, whether cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ambaſſadors, envoys, plenipotentiaries, depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, heralds, officers with a white flag, a drum, trumpet, or any thing elſe that was expreſſive of their pacific deſign. Their perſons were held ſacred and inviolable; they were conſidered as amenable to thoſe only who ſent them; they might miſbehave whilſt in an enemy's country, but this was not thought ſufficient to authoriſe an enemy to puniſh them. The ſtate to which they were ſent might, in this caſe ſend them home, or accuſe them to their maſters, who then became their judges or accomplices. The utility ariſing from the intercourſe which was kept up
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016311_0010_0F9C2B073914CEE8"/>
by thoſe perſons, was not the only cauſe of their ſafety: A ſenſe of honour and public faith in the ſtates to which they were ſent, contributed to it much more; for theſe were conſidered as plighted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the man who came with a peaceful, ſalutary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and voluntarily threw himſelf on the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Were it neceſſary I could fill pages with quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ancient authors, and from modern writers on the law of nations, to evince what is here aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their ſuffrages are unanimous on this point; and thoſe ſuffrages are ſupported by cogent arguments and the practice of nations. Whoever chuſes it may turn to Grotius, Puffendorf, Buddeus, Barbeyrac, Burla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maqui or Monteſquieu, among foreigners, or to Selden, Hutchinſon or Rutherforth, of our own nation, and he will find their teſtimony clear, united and deciſive.</p>
            <p>It may however be proper to produce an inſtance from hiſtory which will apply to the preſent caſe; of a multitude that occur, I ſhall ſelect one from the Roman hiſtory, at a period when, I dare ſay, you, Sir, and your aſſociates moſt admire the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and conduct of that people—it was when they aboliſhed the Regal authority. Soon after Tarquin's expulſion from Rome, he ſent deputies or ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, that is, in modern language, perſons with a flag of truce, to demand his effects: The depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were admitted to an audience by the Senate, and the latter took ſeveral days to deliberate whether the demand ſhould be granted or refuſed. During this interval, Tarquin's deputies remained in the city, and meeting with ſeveral perſons who were deſirous of reſtoring the ancient government, entered into a plot with them for the purpoſe; the plan was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerted—Tarquin was to be ſecretely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the night—every thing was ready for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016311_0011_0F9C2B0A44BC6ED0"/>
when the whole was diſcovered; and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part which was taken by the king's deputies, that is, his officers bearing a flag of truce, was clearly detected and proved. What followed? Did the Romans judge that according to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<q>the rights of a flag were forfeited by thoſe men thus detected in illicit practices;</q>
and were they not accordingly impriſoned or put to death? No—quite the reverſe. <hi>De legatis,</hi> ſays Livy, in his conciſe way, <hi>paullulum addubitatum eſt; et quanquam viſi ſunt commiſſiſſe, ut hoſtium loce eſſent, jus tamen gentium valuit.</hi> i. e. "For ſome time they (the Senate and Conſuls) were in ſuſpenſe how to proceed with the ambaſſadors or deputies; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the latter deſerved to be treated as enemies, yet a regard to the law of nations prevailed."—Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the deputies were diſmiſſed without injury.</p>
            <p>Reflect on this caſe, Sir, and compare the conduct of thoſe Romans, with yours in the affair before us. <hi>There,</hi> deputies from an abjured monarch, under the pretext of demanding his effects, entered into a conſpiracy againſt the new government of Rome— even within its walls. They were detected in the conſpiracy, their guilt was clearly proved; yet ſuch was the reſpect paid by the Romans to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to the ſacred character of Ambaſſadors, that they ſent away thoſe conſpirators to their maſter, without offering them any violence. <hi>Here,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Hele,</hi> on a much more intereſting and important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, (for <hi>he</hi> came with propoſitions to reſtore peace and re-unite a great empire, <hi>they</hi> only to demand ſome old furniture) approached your city; he came openly and undiſguiſed, relying on that public faith and honour which had ever been the protection of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his character; he engaged in no conſpiracy; had no other intention than to deliver his diſpatches; he was unfortunately wrecked: And you, without
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016311_0012_0F9C2B0B4C2AE228"/>
compaſſion for his misfortune, without regard to the character he bore, ſeized him and flung him into a dungeon!</p>
            <p>Really, Sir, the procedure of the Roman Senate is ſo oppoſite to that of the American Congreſs, in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances nearly reſembling each other, that one would be tempted to adopt the ſentiments of the ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtic <hi>Gulliver,</hi> at leaſt in <hi>one</hi> inſtance. Whilſt in the <hi>Iſland of Sorcerers,</hi> where the Governor could ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the dead to appear juſt as they were when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alive, Capt. <hi>Gulliver</hi>
               <q>deſired that the Senate of Rome might appear before him in one large chamber, and a modern repreſentative in counter view, in another. The firſt, ſays <hi>Gulliver,</hi> ſeemed to be an aſſembly of heroes and demi-gods; the other a knot of pedlars, pick-pockets, highway-men and bullies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I grant indeed that there are precedents which you may plead—Inſtances where Ambaſſadors, and others in a ſimilar character, have been impriſoned, nay, even murdered. But you will be pleaſed to remember, that this always happened through the violence of faction, or the brutality of ſome individuals. Every thing of this ſort has been condemned by the united voice of mankind, as diſhonourable, impious <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Greeks, and other civiliſed nations of antiquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the vengeance of Heaven purſued thoſe who offered violence to Ambaſſadors or Heralds. Of this we have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtance in HERODOTUS, LIB. vii. Darius had ſent Heralds to ſeveral cities of Greece, demanding earth and water in token of ſubmiſſion. Some Spartans were ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with rage at this demand, that they flung the Heralds into a deep pit, bidding them carry earth and water thence; and there the Heralds periſhed. The Spartans, when they cooly reflected on the matter, were heartily ſorry for this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtep, which was the effect of rage, and univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and being afterwards afflicted with heavy calamities, they attributed them to the anger of the Gods, for murdering the Perſian Heralds. Two noble Spartans, Sperthies and Bulis, voluntarily offered to devote their lives, and thereby make ſatisfaction for the death of thoſe Heralds, and avert the anger of the Gods. Accordingly they ſet out for Perſia, as if going to certain death; and when they informed Xerxes, the ſon and ſucceſſor of Darius, of their errand, he generouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q>That he would not imitate the Spartans, who had violated the rights of mankind by the injuries done to his father's Heralds—that he would not do the ſame thing which he condemned in them; nor by the death of two men, acquit the Spartans of the guilt they had contracted.</q>
               </note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016311_0013_0F9C2B0BB94A9870"/>
to the law of nations—has been diſapproved and diſowned by the very people who were the aggreſſors; and ſome of the bloodieſt wars recorded in hiſtory were undertaken on this account. Provoked by ſuch an inſult, David, King of Iſrael, made war on the Ammonites, and took ſevere revenge. For this ſole reaſon, the Romans entered into a war ſucceſſively with the Veientes, Fidenates and Faliſci, the Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Ligurians, &amp;c. to ſay nothing of other nations. And were there no other cauſe for proſecuting the preſent war with rigour, your treatment of Lieut. <hi>Hele</hi> would ſufficiently juſtify our Sovereign in doing ſo, until thoſe were brought to reaſon who preſumed thus to inſult his officers, and trample on the law of nations.</p>
            <p>There is perhaps no part of the law of nations which hath been held more ſacred by mankind, or that hath been more ſtrictly obſerved, than that which regards the protection and liberty of Ambaſſadors, and other meſſengers of peace, by whatever name diſtinguiſhed, between hoſtile States. <hi>One</hi> inſtance—and one <hi>only</hi> —have I met with where it is ſaid to be violated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſapprobation, by any people:—It is by ſome of the ſavage nations of this continent. <hi>Charlevoix,</hi> ſpeaking of ſome Indian tribes in North-America, when at war, ſays—
<q>It becomes their Envoys or Plenipotentaries to exert their abilities and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016311_0014_0F9C2B0CF526F6D0"/>
for if the terms they offer are not accepted of, they had need to ſtand on their guard. It fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens that a blow with an hatchet is the only return given to their propoſitions. They are not out of danger if they are even ſo fortunate as to avoid the ſtroke; they may expect to be purſued, and if taken, to be burnt.</q>
The ingenious Dr. <hi>Robertſon</hi>'s obſervation on this paſſage, is—
<q>Men capable of ſuch violence ſeem to be unacquainted with the firſt principles upon which the intercourſe between nations is founded.</q>
Perhaps you will urge, that your conduct excells that of thoſe Indians, reſpecting the meſſengers of peace—that ſeizing one of them is not ſo bad as knocking him on the head with an hatchet—nor putting him in a dungeon ſo atrocious as committing him to the flames. Be it ſo; yet our feelings are greatly hurt to find that chriſtians and proteſtants are capable of acting a part which bears ſo near a reſemblance to the brutal conduct of Savages—and in an inſtance where ſo very few, even among Savages, will give it any countenance. You muſt alſo allow on your part, that the Indians have the advantage of you in one reſpect: They permit the meſſenger of peace, who offends them, to depart, and thereby give him a chance for his liberty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you inſtantly ſeize, and put him in durance.</p>
            <p>And this reminds me of another obſervation which your conduct hath often ſuggeſted. Among civilized nations, war is carried on with little or no animoſity. The ſame principles and knowledge which ſerve to refine and improve manners, in the peaceful ſcenes of ſocial life, ſerve alſo to ſoften the horrors of war, and preclude rage and reſentment from mingling with its operations. The reverſe of this is the caſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. Inſtigated with relentleſs rancour, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded inſolence, to deſtroy and exterminate is their object. I am ſorry to ſay that the wanton cruelty
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016311_0015_0F9C2B0D43746E10"/>
every where exerciſed on loyaliſts, and the inſults with which they are treated—that the illiberal ſpirit, the rage and inſolence which ſtimulate your Congreſs and their adherents, with very few exceptions, and mark their proceedings, give reaſon to compare your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with that of Savages in this inſtance alſo.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have reaſoned with you on the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this country was actually, and of right, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent—that your Congreſs were juſtly veſted with ſupreme authority as the repreſentatives of America, and had been unanimouſly choſen as ſuch by all the Americans. Even on this ſuppoſition, your treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lieut <hi>Hele</hi> would not only be unjuſtifiable, but highly criminal.</p>
            <p>But ſurely, Sir, you cannot in the fond hour of your greateſt ſelf-importance and exaltation admit the ſuppoſition to be true. You cannot but know that King GEORGE WAS, and IS the rightful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of theſe colonies—that he ſtill claims their allegiance—that a large majority of the coloniſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his government to your tyrannical uſurpation— that not a TWENTIETH part of them have voted for your Congreſs—and that the members of the Congreſs themſelves, and their adherents, are revolted ſubjects of the Britiſh crown. Theſe facts are certainly true, whether you will admit them or not; nor can the Congreſs, with all their ſubtil artifice and tyranny, conceal them, or obliterate them from the minds of the good people of America.</p>
            <p>Conſider theſe circumſtances for a moment, and how do they aggravate your crime! In how deteſtable a light muſt your conduct appear! The Gentleman whom you impriſoned, was a meſſenger of peace from your injured Sovereign. In vain did the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions throw its ſhield over him, and promiſe him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016311_0016_0F9C2B0DFB9AB678"/>
You ſpurned that law, and were deaf to his remonſtrances. He brought the moſt liberal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of accommodation—ſuch as would make this country the happieſt and freeſt upon earth: Yet equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly callous to the dictates of reaſon, duty, honour and humanity, you rejected thoſe overtures with diſdain, and doomed America to be a ſcene of war, deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wretchedneſs, rather than reſign that ideal importance which the temporary infatuation of a <hi>few</hi> had conferred on you. Nay, you added inſult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. You not only ſhut the door againſt all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accommodation, ſo far as in you lay; but by an act ever held in deteſtation among civilized nations, and deemed the moſt provoking, you have juſtified the ſevereſt retaliation that Britain can make! Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, her aim was to reclaim, not to deſtroy, or even to conquer: You have done all in your power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her to adopt different meaſures; and you have probably entailed on this country a war, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating ravages may not ceaſe but with the utter ruin of America.</p>
            <p>But I turn from the horrid ſubject with diſguſt; and as this letter is already protracted to a ſufficient length, ſhall defer my <hi>ſtrictures</hi> on the remaining part of your <hi>anſwer</hi> to ſome future opportunity.</p>

            <head>LETTER II. To HENRY LAURENS, Eſq.</head>
            <p>IN my former <hi>ſtrictures</hi> I pointed out how fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grantly you had violated the law of nations by the detention and impriſonment of Lieutenant HELE of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016311_0017_0F9C2B0EC1360F00"/>
the Hotham ſloop, bearing a flag of Truce. I ſhall now examine the remaining part of your <hi>anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> to Admiral GAMBIER's letter, where you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to juſtify a conduct which cannot be defended. This however is not the only inſtance wherein you have trampled on the law of nations and broken your public faith, in your independent capacity. Witneſs your breach of the ſtipulation at the <hi>Cedars,</hi> of the convention at <hi>Saratoga,</hi> which will ever brand the Congreſs with the blackeſt and moſt indelible infamy.</p>
            <p>To manifeſt the injuſtice of your procedure, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral GAMBIER had urged,
<q>That the reſolution on which the Congreſs now wiſh to juſtify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is ſubſequent in date to the fact of which they complain.</q>
You do not deny this fact, and conſequently, admit the charge. This, of itſelf, is ſufficient to expoſe the iniquity of your conduct; for what can be more contrary to juſtice, right, and reaſon, than to judge an action by a law which was made after the action was committed, and then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the perſon for that action, as if the law had been previouſly paſſed, and the action a voluntary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it? Can any thing be conceived more ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical?</p>
            <p>A law may be defined—<hi>the will of thoſe who are veſted with authority, requiring certain actions, and forbidding others, and guarded or enforced by ſanctions of rewards and puniſhments.</hi> An action, which is neither forbidden nor required by any law, is in its nature indifferent. We are permitted to do what is forbidden by no law; we may neglect whatever is not enjoined by any law; and hence that indubitable maxim—<hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> It evidently follows then, that laws, in order to be binding, ſhould be ſufficiently promulged or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016311_0018_0F9C2B0F761152E8"/>
made known to thoſe who are to obey them—and that a law cannot rightly take cognizance of any actions but ſuch as are ſubſequent to its date or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation.</p>
            <p>This being the caſe, it is no wonder that Admiral GAMBIER, or any other perſon of integrity and good ſenſe, whoſe object was truth, who was not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the chicane of verbal diſputation and ſophiſtry,
<q>ſhould imagine it difficult in the eyes of the candid world to explain away that paragraph,</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Admiral's letter of December <hi>25,</hi> to <hi>Mr. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> which was publiſhed after my firſt <hi>ſtrictures</hi> were ſent to the Printer.</note> which I have before quoted. You have attempted to do this by ſaying—
<q>that the reſolution of Congreſs, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſing the ſeizure of the flag, being ſubſequent to the fact complained of in that reſolution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>(requires)</hi> no juſtification; the fact muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily precede both the complaint and the meaſures for preventing the conſequences of the fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Very well, Sir! and pray what then? Is this any anſwer to the Admiral's argument? or does it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the charge brought againſt you, viz. judging and condemning Lieut. HELE by a <hi>poſt facto</hi> law or reſolution? Not in the leaſt—His argument is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, his charge unremoved. You have given us the cloudy ſubtilty of old ſchoolmen, joined to the diſingenuous, perplexing quibble of ſophiſts; but no refutation of the plea that was ſo juſtly urged againſt you: And if any man can extract one grain of conſiſtent, ſenſe or candour from this anſwer, he is welcome to it for his pains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016311_0019_0F9C2B1085439C48"/>But let us take a nearer view of this dark <hi>reſponſe,</hi> and try to diſcover its meaning, if perchance it has any.</p>
            <p>You ſay—
<q>that the reſolution of Congreſs, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſing the ſeizure of the flag, being ſubſequent to the fact complained of in that reſolution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no juſtification.</q>
No, Sir! I am humbly of opinion it does. I think, and am confident the candid world will think with me, that it requires a very full and ſatisfactory juſtification. If you mean that ſeizing, trying and puniſhing a man for an action which was committed before the date of the law by virtue of which he is ſeized, and by which he is tried, condemned and puniſhed—if you mean, I ſay, that this is a thing ſo evidently right and juſt in itſelf as not to ſtand in need of juſtification, it is an inſult on the underſtanding of mankind; for there are few points perhaps in which mankind are better agreed than in reprobating ſuch a procedure as unjuſt, cruel and tyrannical.—You condeſcend however to aſſign what, I preſume, you intended ſhould paſs for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why "it requires no juſtification;" and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a reader who is diveſted of prejudice, and capable of reaſoning, would naturally expect one very cogent —for cogent it muſt be which could induce him to acquieſce in a poſition ſo extraordinary. What then muſt his diſappointment and indignation be, when he finds that reaſon to be a poor, contemptible quibble! For, ſay you,—
<q>the fact muſt neceſſarily precede both the complaint and the meaſures for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſequences of the fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, this is only a play upon words—a mere evaſion. The charge exhibited againſt you was the puniſhing a man by a reſolution, whoſe date was ſubſequent to the fact he was tried for. Your anſwer
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016311_0020_0F9C2B13C5DEF1E8"/>
does not reach this charge; nor, if it did, would it juſtify you. Suppoſing what you ſay were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, as your words imply, (though in many inſtances it is falſe) yet it ſhews no more than this —that on complaint of certain facts, it frequently happens, and it is proper that due meaſures be taken —paſs laws, reſolutions, &amp;c.—to prevent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſimilar facts in future. All this was very evident before your involved reply made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but it can ſhew no more, with reſpect to the caſe in queſtion, without contradicting the cleareſt principles of equity and juſtice—it does not ſhew that the action which preceded the reſolution is rightly puniſhable by it.</p>
            <p>Were your anſwer to be conſidered merely in the light of a caſual repartee, which, by a jingle of words, would parry the attack of a briſk antagoniſt, it might paſs without cenſure. But for a body of men who aſſume the reſpectable character of legiſlators, and patrons of liberty, truth and virtue, ſolemnly to advance ſuch flimſy ſophiſtry, in a matter of the utmoſt moment, and with the deſign of juſtifying an atrocious crime, is truly ſhocking; it diſcovers an utter diſregard of truth, of the dignity of that character they aſſume; it manifeſts a conſciouſneſs of having a bad cauſe, which could not be vindicated by fair reaſoning, and that the charge could only be eluded by quibbling. Away then with ſuch trifling! It would diſgrace and injure a good cauſe; it ſerves to make a bad one and its abettors more deteſtable; ſuch men ſhould not obtrude themſelves thus on the world, which is too knowing to be amuſed with petulance and ſophiſtry; they ſhould retire where they ought, to their ploughs and trades; or repoſe with their quibbling brethren of the ſchools

in the corner of a gothic cloiſter, dark as their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, cold and unfeeling as their hearts.</p>
            <p>A fact was alledged which contained a heavy charge againſt Congreſs; they admitted the fact, for it was too notorious to be denied. The <hi>proclamation</hi> in queſtion was dated October 3; Lieutenant HELE, in the Hotham ſloop, ſailed from New-York with that proclamation the 5th of the ſame month, and two or three days carried him to the Delaware, where he was wrecked; The <hi>reſolution</hi> of Congreſs, by virtue of which he was ſeized and flung into a dungeon, was dated October 16, ſeveral days after his diſaſter: Thus ſtands the fact, which you could not deny, but try to anſwer it by a play on the ſound of words, and ſneak off with the pitiful ſubterfuge we have been conſidering. Had you repeated thoſe ludicrous lines—</p>
            <l>"The longitude miſt on</l>
            <l>"By wicked Will Whiſton,</l>
            <l>"And no better hit on</l>
            <l>"By Grave Maſter Ditton," &amp;c. &amp;c.</l>
            <p>They would have been as pertinent, fair and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory an anſwer as the one you have returned.</p>
            <p>The charge of ſeizing an officer with a flag of truce and puniſhing him by virtue of a <hi>reſolution</hi> which was paſſed not only after the date of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches and his departure from New-York, but even after his arrival in Delaware, contrary to every principle of equity and juſtice—This charge, I ſay, remains in full force. You have prudently declined the vindication of it, and left it to ſhift for itſelf— But I haſten to the next part of your anſwer.</p>
            <p>Admiral GAMBIER had ſaid,
<q>the Manifeſto in queſtion was addreſſed in the firſt inſtance to the Congreſs themſelves, and could not poſſibly be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</q>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:016311_0022_0F9C2B16074EA6B8"/>
This with the preceding facts and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been urged, not only in oppoſition to what was aſſerted in your reſolution of October 16, but to ſhew that your detention and impriſonment of Lieut. HELE was, in every point of view, and in all its circumſtances, contrary to juſtice and reaſon. To this allegation, you anſwer,
<q>that addreſſing the Manifeſto in the firſt inſtance to Congreſs, does not prove that it was not ſeditious, ſince it was at the ſame time addreſſed to the ſeveral aſſemblies of the United States, to the clergy, to the officers of the American army, and to the people at large, which inconteſtably ſhews it to be ſeditious and unwarrantable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I apprehend that the contents, the purport and deſign of the manifeſto ſhould decide whether it was ſeditious or otherwiſe; and not the perſons, of what deſcription or number ſoever they might be, to whom it was addreſſed. Were this laſt to determine the point, as your words ſeem to intimate, then the Congreſs, by their own rule, have iſſued many <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious</hi> manifeſtos; for it is certain that long before they had thrown aſide their allegiance, and whilſt they were ſolemnly invoking heaven and earth to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſincerity of their profeſſions and loyalty, the Congreſs addreſſed ſeveral manifeſtos not only to the inhabitants of North-America, but to thoſe of Great-Britain and Ireland, including all ranks and deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Is the Congreſs then, like the wicked ſervant, condemned out of its own mouth?</p>
            <p>If we look into the manifeſto we ſhall find its contents to be the reverſe of ſeditious. It exhorts not to war or tumults, but to peace and order; it holds out the moſt liberal overtures for accommoda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, a full redreſs of every grievance, would put a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016311_0023_0F9C2B164A6652B0"/>
ſtop to the effuſion of kindred blood, and arreſt the ravages of war in their deſolating career, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends theſe intereſting matters to the "ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all." Is this the language of ſedition? Is this the ſpirit it breathes? Are theſe the objects at which it aims?</p>
            <p>But were the matter as you affirm, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſent forth this manifeſto with a ſeditious deſign, I muſt take the liberty to ſay, that they are unſkilful proficients in the trade of ſedition, and they ought to have profited by your example; for the world muſt allow that you, Sir, and your aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates are very able practitioners in that <hi>noble art.</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by your tenets, and guided by your practice, they ſhould have purſued meaſures totally different from thoſe they adopted.</p>
            <p>Let us however drop this point, and for the preſent ſuppoſe the manifeſto was ſeditious, (making all due allowance for the bungling manner of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners on this plan) yet ſtill your treatment of Lieut. HELE is utterly indefenſible. The Manifeſto, in the preamble, was firſt addreſſed to you; orders were alſo given that it ſhould be delivered to you <hi>firſt</hi> —Circumſtances which ſhould fully remove all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of ſedition, either in the contents or deſign.</p>
            <p>You were veſted with ſupreme power over the <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen united ſtates,</hi> as you call them, and the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto was to come <hi>firſt</hi> into your hands. Were not you therefore to judge of its contents—to circulate or ſuppreſs them as you thought proper? You might receive or reject the Manifeſto; but what right did this give you to puniſh the innocent officer who brought it by order of his ſuperior, and who knew not the contents? Had Lieut. HELE been even detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016311_0024_0F9C2B170938BBA8"/>
in circulating the manifeſto privately, I have ſhewn from the practice of the Romans in an inſtance which not only comes up to that caſe, but goes beyond it, that you would not thereby be authoriſed to puniſh him; much leſs when he came without any ſuch deſign, and was wrecked on his paſſage.</p>
            <p>But ſay you—
<q>the manifeſto was addreſſed at the ſame time to aſſemblies, clergy, officers, and the people at large.</q>
True—the contents concerned all, was it not right therefore to reccommend them to the "ſerious conſideration of all?" And had not you, to whom they were firſt directed, full power to give them currency, like your paſte-board dollars, or over-rule them, as you pleaſed?</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, your vindication is your reproach, and betrays a ſecret you have long ſtrove to conceal. A ſubject happened to be touched which lay very near your heart—you took the alarm, and your frame was ſhocked. Nature got the better of your prudence, and the ruling paſſion which actuates you in all your meaſures, involuntarily ſtarteth up to view. The vulgar proverb ſays—<hi>It is dangerous to talk of a halter before a man whoſe father was hanged</hi>—it is equally ſo, I find, to hint at any thing before uſurpers, which even by a forced conſtruction, might be thought to call their ſupremacy in queſtion. The luſt of domination is a very unruly paſſion; when it hath once taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the human breaſt, it will ſoon ſubjugate all others, break through every reſtraint, and puſh men on to perpetrate the greateſt enormities.</p>
            <p>Is then the doctrine of <hi>abſolute paſſive obedience and non reſiſtance</hi> ſo current among you already? and are you ſo eager to have it enforced? According to the fundamental articles of your ſyſtem, the people
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016311_0025_0F9C2B17C47F7958"/>
are the fountain of all authority and power; this was a convenient doctrine till you were fairly and firmly ſeated on the pinnacle of power to which you aſpired. But is it prudent to turn ſhort ſo ſuddenly, and treat the people as your vaſſals, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is quite ended? Should you kick away the ladder ſo haſtily? Or is it right to prevent the people from taking into "ſerious conſideration," matters which next to their everlaſting ſalvation, are of greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and concern them moſt nearly? Is it right that the aſſemblies, who like yourſelves, have waded through blood, perjury and rebellion—or the officers, who have hazarded their lives, to ſerve you, and miniſter to your deſpotiſm—is it right, I ſay, that they ſhould have nothing to ſay or think in thoſe matters? Why ſo jealous of them, or fearful that a ray of loyalty, or a pang of conſcience ſhould hazard their fidelity?</p>
            <p>The clergy at leaſt—for I have a prodigious vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for them—deſerve a little more delicacy and indulgence; for believe me they have made a great ſacrifice in your cauſe. They have laid the goſpel under a temporary interdict, and adopted principles directly oppoſite to it; they have thrown aſide the ſpirit and manners of miniſters of the Prince of Peace, and acted like the votaries of Mars, or diſciples of Mahomet—and all this to help you. The pulpits of <hi>Diſſenters univerſally</hi> throughout the continent, and thoſe of a <hi>few renegado Churchmen</hi> to the ſouthward, have reſounded—not with the goſpel, but with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics—not with meek leſſons of peace, but with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exhortations to war—to ſtimulate the luke warm, animate the deſponding, and warmly engage all in your intereſts. Conſider this coolly, and then tell me, was it right to preclude thoſe men from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this unlucky manifeſto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016311_0026_0F9C2B18812EC3D0"/>O! ye Americans, my deluded countrymen! Into what abyſs of wretchedneſs have ye fallen! To be thus denied the privilege of rational beings, and treated like beaſts of burden, by the very men whom your infatuation and folly have raiſed to their preſent arbitrary and tyrannical power!</p>
            <p>"But hold." You cry —
<q>Have we not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that the papers aforeſaid, (meaning the manifeſtos) be printed in the ſeveral gazettes, more fully to convince the good people of theſe ſtates of the inſidious deſigns of the Commiſſioners.</q>
Very true, Sir. By looking into your famous reſolution of October 16, I find you have done ſo; but you took care previouſly to give a decided judgment of thoſe papers. You pronounced them
<q>ſeditious—ſent with a view to ſtir up diſſentions, animoſities, and rebellion among the people.</q>
You thus ſet them down in your <hi>index expurgatorius</hi>; and effectually prevented their being read to any good purpoſe.— Henceforward, every mouth was cloſed that would ſpeak in their behalf, and every hand arreſted that would move for their producing any ſalutary effect. The iron ſcourge of tyranny—fines, impriſonment or death, entirely reſtrained both. This you know was the caſe; and that the people were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to deliberate impartially about them, or to act as they choſe. The privilege of ſpeaking or writing their ſentiments, or acting according to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is reſerved for your warm partizans only.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of obſervation, how naturally people, engaged in the ſame purſuits, ſlide into the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for effecting their purpoſe. JAMES II. intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the luſt of domination, attempted, with the aſſiſtance of French papiſts—Plenipotentiaries and others—to ſubvert the conſtitution and liberties of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016311_0027_0F9C2B1935B0EF20"/>
Great-Britain and Ireland: Juſt as you, with the ſame inſtruments, would ſubvert the conſtitution and liberties of theſe colonies. When the Prince of Orange landed in England, in the memorable year 1688, he publiſhed a <hi>Declaration</hi> ſetting forth the danger of the nation, and his deſign of coming over to relieve it from thraldom. This <hi>Declaration</hi> fell into the hands of JAMES; and after inſerting his judgment of it—that it was <hi>ſeditious—ſent with a view to ſtir up diſſentions, animoſities and rebellion among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>—Like you, he <hi>recommended it to be printed and diſperſed.</hi> I could point out the exacteſt reſemblance between your meaſures, ſpirit and conduct, and thoſe of the leaders in the grand rebellion in the laſt century; which indeed any perſon may do by conſulting <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi>'s hiſtory. The preſent rebellion is the exact counterpart of that; begun on the ſame principles and carried on by the ſame arts of deception and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In ſhort, you ſeem to have ſtudiouſly trodden in the ſteps, and copied the example of the <hi>rump</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. We know its fate, and that of JAMES's manoeuvre; and I have the firmeſt confidence the the ſame kind providence, which then interpoſed to over-rule the deſigns of ambitious, bad men, and ſnatch the nation from deſtruction, will interpoſe now alſo, and work our deliverance.</p>
            <p>But really, Sir, it is curious to near you exclaim againſt diſſentions and rebellion, and thoſe concerned in them—You, that are yourſelves plunged in a moſt wanton rebellion againſt your rightful Sovereign—and to which you wholly owe your preſent conſequence!
<q>Thou that teacheſt another ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal?</q>
Methinks you might have profited better even by the Poet's ſatyr, and learnt from him not</p>
            <p>"To hate for arts which cauſed yourſelves to riſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:016311_0028_0F9C2B1A71795C08"/>I ſhall candidly own to you, however, that I do not think much worſe of you, than of Britiſh repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans in general. I never did, nor never ſhall expect better of them. Their character is uniform and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; they have ever been turbulent and ambitious of power, and never failed to abuſe it when it was in their hands; nor do I ſee any ſymptoms of their amendment. How it may be with foreign republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, I ſhall not determine, nor am I concerned to know; but as for thoſe of Britiſh growth, they will anſwer to the above deſcription. In the courſe of my acquaintance with them, I can truly ſay, that I ſcarce ever knew a thorough-paced Republican of our own <hi>breed,</hi> who was not bitter in his temper—Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and arbitrary in his principles—Impatient of reſtraint—or of a ſuperior—proud and ambitious as Lucifer. Hence their enmity to the Britiſh conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſets bounds to thoſe inordinate paſſions. Hence, for inſtance, the angry declamation of the <hi>modeſt and pious</hi> author or authors of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> (for ſome affirm that it had ſeveral; though one had aſſumed the honour, and beſtowed on it the name, like him in the Goſpel, only becauſe he was the moſt forward D—l of the crew) Hence, I ſay, <hi>his</hi> or <hi>their</hi> angry declamation againſt the mutual checks of King, Lords and Commons on each other. The gentry of this ſtamp, do not chuſe to have any check or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. The real friends of liberty, are friends of the Britiſh conſtitution; where all the benefits of the three ſimple forms of government are obtained—and where the inconveniencies to which each is ſubject, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the mutual checks of the conſtituent parts, and happy temperament of the whole.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>anſwer</hi> concludes with ſomething on the ſubject of Retaliation, and delivered with that air of petulence and ſecurity which diſtinguiſh moſt of your

productions. I am not diſpoſed to enlarge on the matter at preſent, and ſhall only remind you of the two following well known events. CATALINE and his aſſociates, for a conſiderable time, baffled the councils and arms of Rome, but were finally cruſhed CHARLES II, for ſeveral years, was deprived of his rights, and uſurpers occupied his dominions, yet was happily reſtored. The application is obvious, and I leave you to make it.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY contemptuouſly rejecting the late liberal overtures of accommodation—the moſt liberal perhaps that were ever held out by an injured Sovereign to revolted ſubjects, the Congreſs mean to continue the calamities of America; and by the violation of every obligation, human and divine, and adding the groſſeſt inſults to their other enormities, they ſeemingly intend to increaſe them.</p>
            <p>Were theſe calamities confined to your partizans only, who have aſſiſted to place you in the ſeat of uſurpation, it would be a matter of little moment— they would only reap the fruit of their <hi>patriotic</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But the innocent are equally involved with the guilty in the common ruin. Many thouſands
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016311_0030_0F9C2B1B8F3D36F0"/>
who utterly diſapproved of your proceedings, or who were ſeduced by ſpecious artifices, to favour your cauſe at firſt, or compelled by violence to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, now groan under a complication of miſeries; to ſay nothing of the multitudes who have fallen victims to your ambition and cruelty, and whoſe blood cries for vengeance againſt you.</p>
            <p>In each of theſe I find myſelf injured. That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſympathy which connects the children of Adam, and intereſts them in each other's weal or woe, leads me to take part with thoſe ſufferers. By examining your proceedings therefore, and developing your characters, I only comply with the dictates of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and diſcharge the duty of a good citizen to my fellow-ſubjects; for in proportion as you are known, you will be leſs dangerous. Unmaſk a deceiver, and his power to do miſchief is at an end.</p>
            <p>Men's characters are beſt known by their actions. Some parts of your conduct are of ſuch a complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that I am confident your warmeſt admirers muſt condemn them, when fairly ſcrutinized and laid open—theſe alſo will lend a clue to your real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and ſhew it in the true point of light.—Let me add, ſince the thought now occurs—that whoever would make any conſiderable progreſs in that moſt neceſſary branch of ſcience—a knowledge of human nature, muſt view it in its greateſt obliquities and depravation, as well as in its more amiable attitudes. Our reſearches in this way may be diſguſting, perhaps mortify our pride, but they are neceſſary for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; juſt as the diſſection of <hi>diſeaſed</hi> bodies, of vipers, vultures and wolves, is neceſſary to perfect the anatomiſt's knowledge—How happily furniſhed are you with proper ſubjects to carry on thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches!</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:016311_0031_0F9C2B1E9A490100"/>Your flagrant violation of the law of nations in the affair of Lieut. HELE, the wretched ſophiſtry and quibbling by which your Congreſs attempted to juſtify their iniquitous conduct, were made ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I flatter myſelf, to every diſcerning reader, in my <hi>ſtrictures</hi> on your <hi>anſwer</hi> to Admiral GAMBIER. Human nature is not capable of ſuch a degree of effrontery as to deny the facts I alledged; and all my reaſoning and concluſions neceſſarily followed from thoſe premiſes. Another <hi>anſwer</hi> of yours, equally famous, requires ſome animadverſion; the <hi>anſwer</hi> I mean is that to Sir HENRY CLINTON, dated Sept. 28, 1778, on the ſubject of the Convention Troops; and in which we trace a new line in the Character of the Congreſs. I give you, Sir, full credit for refuſing to ſign that <hi>anſwer</hi>; it ſhewed that all ſenſe of decency and ſhame, at leaſt in <hi>one</hi> member of Congreſs, was not extinguiſhed. The <hi>anſwer</hi> however was really and truly that of Congreſs, authenticated by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of <hi>Charles Thomſon, Secretary,</hi> the uſual <hi>index</hi> of their more trivial or dirty buſineſs.</p>
            <p>In the Convention at Saratoga, it was ſtipulated,— ARTICLE 2d.
<q>That a free paſſage be granted to the army under Lieut. General Burgoyne, to Great-Britain, on condition of not ſerving again in North-America during the preſent conteſt, and the port of Boſton is aſſigned for the entry of tranſports to receive the troops, whenever General Howe ſhall ſo order.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. Should any cartel take place, by which the army under Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne, or any part of it may be exchanged, the foregoing article to be void, as far as ſuch exchange ſhall be made.</q>
Theſe two articles compriſe all that relates to the final diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal or exchange of General Burgoyne's army, and they are very clear and definite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:016311_0032_0F9C2B1F93778D10"/>Requiſitions were repeatedly made by the King's commanders in chief, and commiſſioners, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs would fulfil thoſe articles; but thoſe requiſitions were as often neglected, or evaded by a ſeries of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, duplicity, and breach of public faith, unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled even in <hi>Punic,</hi> and to be equalled only in <hi>Gallic</hi> hiſtory. A ratification of the convention by the King was demanded; although not a ſyllable of this was mentioned at the convention, or in its articles; and every man of common ſenſe muſt know that a General in the field is perfectly competent to adjuſt whatever terms may be neceſſary, relative to his troops, in ſuch an exigency as that of General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne—a complaint from Gen. Burgoyne that you had violated the convention, was ſeized and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly made the occaſion of your violating it ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—a ſilly tale about cartouch boxes was trumped up to elude your compliance—a pretended attempt to corrupt the congreſs furniſhed matter for another evaſion. Theſe, and other like pretexts (for I do not recollect them all) equally frivolous, abſurd, and ridiculous, were alledged from time to time, to cover your perfidious breach of this treaty—your proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of public faith and honour.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty ſympathiſing with the ſufferings of his troops, which the fortune of war had flung into your hands—willing to deliver them from ſo diſagreeable a ſituation, and ſo far as he could, to remove all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for detaining them longer, inſtructed Sir <hi>Henry Clinton,</hi> to renew, and ratify, in his (the King's) name, the conditions ſtipulated by General Burgoyne. In conſequence of this inſtruction, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> wrote the following letter, dated September 19, 1778, directed to you, and which, for obvious reaſons, I ſhall tranſcribe.</p>

The neglect of the requiſitions already made on this ſubject is altogether unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented among parties at war.

                  </opener>
                  <p>Your letter of the 19th was laid before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and I am directed to inform you that the Congreſs of the United ſtates of America make no anſwer to inſolent letters.</p>

            <p>The luſt of power which always actuates uſurpers, and the timid jealouſy which is natural to them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in dictating your <hi>anſwer</hi> to Admiral GAMBIER: But what ſhall I ſay of this anſwer to Sir HENRY CLINTON? I have looked into the <hi>laconic</hi> and other <hi>apothegms</hi> of Plutarch—I have turned over the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, Repartees, Rejoinders, Bon Mots, &amp;c. of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons famous in their day, in the different walks of life; but this <hi>anſwer</hi> of yours ſurpaſſes them all: not in <hi>politeneſs,</hi> I confeſs, nor wit, nor poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, nor ſhrewdneſs, nor even in conciſeneſs, ſhort as yours is—but in downright unmixed brutality!</p>
            <p>In private life, Sir, a gentleman is diſtinguiſhed from a clown by his language and manners much more than by his dreſs; nor can he depart from the rules of decorum and good breeding without degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf. In public characters, a regard to theſe rules is ſtill more neceſſary—it is indiſpenſible. When a man is called to a high ſtation, and eſpecially when be repreſents others; not only his perſonal dignity, but that of his ſtation, and of thoſe he repreſents, demands his attention; deviating from the rules of decorum and good breeding, cannot fail to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on his ſtation, and on thoſe he repreſents.</p>
            <p>According to the aſſumed character of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, you are the Repreſentatives, the Supreme Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016311_0035_0F9C2B2182735D78"/>
of the <hi>Thirteen United States of North-America</hi> —TWELVE, I ſhould ſay, for alas! <hi>Georgia</hi> is gone! Conſiſtently with that character, (for I now reaſon with you on your own principles) you ſhould conſider yourſelves as indiſpenſibly bound to ſupport the public dignity of thoſe States, however education or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may diſpoſe you to rude language, to ſordid or ſavage actions. When you ſpeak, the people are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak by you, having choſen you on the preſumption that you are beſt qualified to ſpeak and act for them: and in whatever you do or ſay, the <hi>majeſty of the people</hi> is brought forward, and ought to be ſupported.</p>
            <p>Is this done in the preſent inſtance? A Britiſh Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the firſt rank and character—not more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for his noble birth, than by his military ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and other perſonal accompliſhments—writes a letter to your Congreſs, by the expreſs order of his Sovereign, on buſineſs of great importance. His letter was confined ſolely to that buſineſs; and with reſpect to ſentiment, ſpirit, and language, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly worthy of his character and exalted ſtation. <note n="*" place="bottom">I hope the Commander in Chief will excuſe the liberty I have taken to mention theſe and other particulars relative to him, and which was neceſſary to place the ſcandalous <hi>anſwer</hi> of the Congreſs in a right point of view. His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's character is too well known and eſtabliſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or receive any additional luſtre from my pen; and real merit, like chaſtity, is ever accompanied with a delicacy that would ſhun being mentioned. What is ſaid here, and much more, is indelibly written on the hearts of American Loyaliſts, who are more indebted to him in general, than perhaps to any other man living, our moſt amiable and gracious Sovereign excepted.</note> How did you demean yourſelves on this occaſion? Regardleſs of all decency, as well as of public faith, you returned an anſwer which would diſgrace a ſet
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016311_0036_0F9C2B22387A82E8"/>
of porters or ſavages! You were either ignorant, or did not conſider, that it could not injure Sir HENRY; but muſt reflect infamy on yourſelves, and on
<q>the unhappy people whoſe affairs are committed to you.</q>
For my part I cannot look into this <hi>anſwer</hi> but <hi>Gulliver</hi>'s idea of a
<q>modern repreſentative, which ſeemed to be—a knot of pedlars, pick-pockets, highway-men and bullies,</q>
obtrudes itſelf upon me: And were I even a friend to your inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, the point now in conteſt, I ſincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare I would deſpiſe and deteſt the Congreſs for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting their own character by ſuch methods, and ſinking the reputation of America.</p>
            <p>At preſent there are many ſtrangers from different parts of Europe, in this country. You muſt naturally expect that theſe will narrowly watch the ſeveral parts of your conduct, and ſcan them with a critical eye. What opinion do you imagine muſt they form of America from this mean ruſticity, this diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able breach of public faith in its <hi>Grand Congreſs?</hi> Their reports will certainly reach Europe, where you are anxious to appear reſpectable, and form alliances. Do you think that their details of theſe matters will inſpire the European ſtates with much ardor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of an alliance with you? Or are theſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to command reſpect abroad, build up an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at home, and take <hi>a diſtinguiſhed place in the ſcale of nations?</hi> As well might you expect to realize the ſyſtem of <hi>Utopia,</hi> or reconcile the moſt palpable contradictions.</p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Syndic,</hi> or in plain Engliſh, the <hi>Town-Clerk</hi> of <hi>Straſburg,</hi> the Plenipotentiary of your <hi>great and good ally,</hi> muſt ſecretly deſpiſe you in his heart, whilſt you thus ſtrive to ſerve his maſter's cauſe, at the expence of honour and decency; for the French,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016311_0037_0F9C2B22F779B4B8"/>
to do them juſtice, underſtand the forms of good breeding, and are obſervant of them—they are liberal enough of good language when it coſts them nothing, and can ſerve their purpoſes.</p>
            <p>When you were ſo much <hi>Frenchified,</hi> and running into the bad qualities of that nation, why did you not catch a little of their <hi>politeſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead of this, you have prepoſterouſly united <hi>Gallic</hi> perfidy with the coarſe, ill-bred ruſticity which is peculiar to the dregs of our countrymen!</p>
            <p>I am ready to make all due allowance for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of your ſituation. It was impoſſible to anſwer Sir HENRY's letter as it ought, and not comply with his requiſition. But could you not turn it off with a little ſophiſtry and quibbling, as in the caſe of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Hele, rather than expoſe yourſelves to the contempt of mankind by ſo brutal an anſwer? Was your invention ſo much jaded that nothing could be contrived to avoid the manners and language of ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians? Might not ſomething be conjured up againſt the convention troops that would have been as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, juſt, and weighty, as the affair of the cartouch boxes, to eaſe you of ſo heavy a load of ſcandal and reproach?</p>
            <p>Sir HENRY CLINTON, hath intimated a reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<q>to trouble you or the Congreſs again on the ſubject of the convention troops.</q>
Probably he was convinced of your determination not to hearken to reaſon—that any further application would be fruitleſs—that nothing but inſult could be expected from men who had repeatedly manifeſted a diſregard of public faith, a want of delicacy and diſtinction of perſons; and every one knows, that
<q>a bear in the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016311_0038_0F9C2B23B52028A0"/>
wilderneſs will as ſoon fix on a philoſopher as on a cottager.</q>
In compliance, however, with the King's inſtructions, Sir HENRY wrote to you, and the event fully juſtified his apprehenſions. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to you, this was one of thoſe critical junctures which neceſſarily require a conduct and meaſures that develope the heart, and decide the character. You took your meaſures, and they were deciſive on thoſe points. We ſee the groteſque figure which men, new to power, and void of honour, are always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to make on ſuch occaſions. We ſee that moſt diſguſting ſpecies of pride and inſolence—the low-bred inſolence and pride of uſurpers, who occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a ſtation for which they are by nature, education and principle, utterly diſqualified; and deſtitute of that addreſs, thoſe engaging poliſhed manners which are neceſſary to ſoften, and reconcile to us the ſtern aſpect of power.</p>
            <p>I am not conſcious of having repreſented your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this matter more unfavourably than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, or in a worſe light than it will be viewed by every impartial man of ſenſe and good breeding; even ſeparate from your flagitious violation of the Sarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga convention. But when that conſideration is added, it forms ſuch a complication of perfidy and rudeneſs, as cannot be matched in the annals of any nation.</p>
            <p>It was my intention to have added ſome furthet <hi>ſtrictures</hi> on your manner of obſerving treaties; but want of time will not admit of it now—they ſhall wait on you ſome future day. In the mean time, I ſhall preſent you with the following extract from Plutarch's treatiſe concerning <hi>an ignorant, untutored ruler,</hi> that is, one diſqualified for his ſtation by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and education. It is very pertinent to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us, and may ſerve to <hi>amuſe</hi> you. After
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016311_0039_0F9C2B272BC93698"/>
obſerving that thoſe among the lower claſſes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who are viciouſly inclined, cannot, through inability in their humble ſtate, do much miſchief; but when, by any accident, they are raiſed to power, prove very pernicious to ſociety, Plutarch proceeds thus—</p>
            <p>
               <q>The vices of men veſted with power cannot be concealed. For as perſons who labour under a certain kind of epilepſy, are ſeized, when expoſed to the cold, with a giddineſs, and their diſorder is betrayed by the agitation of their bodies; ſo, when fortune hath exalted vain and ignorant men, conferring wealth, honour, and power, on ſuch upſtarts, ſhe alſo gives ſure indications of their diſpoſition and fall. Moreover, as among empty veſſels, it is difficult to diſtinguiſh which is ſound, or which is leaky; but on pouring in ſome liquid, thoſe that have a flaw are diſcovered by the liquor flowing out; thus weak minds cannot bear pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—their flaws become manifeſt—they burſt forth with inordiuate deſires, in acts of rage, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, perfidy, and petulant folly.</q>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU would probably think yourſelf neglected, and unjuſtly deprived of that notice to which you are entitled, were I to paſs you over in ſilence when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the conduct of your Congreſs.—Certain it is that ſome tranſactions of that body ſince you were <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified</hi> with the title of its Preſident, deſerve the ſerious attention of all Americans. As you have ſucceeded to the ſeat lately occupied by Mr. <hi>Laurens,</hi> I hope he will not be diſpleaſed if I direct my future correſpondence to you. He has no juſter claim than you to my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and happily for me, who have no talent for adulation, I find myſelf under as little temptation of the kind when writing to the one as to the other. Beſides, as Mr. <hi>Laurens</hi> may by this <note n="*" place="bottom">About this time, the province of Georgia was reduced <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </note> time have ſome <hi>troubleſome viſitants</hi> pretty near him, he will have ſomething elſe to <hi>amuſe</hi> him.</p>
            <p>I frankly own it is with pain I addreſs you as a uſurper. Your firſt prepoſſeſſions led you a very
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016311_0041_0F9C2B296EB11448"/>
different way from what you have been lately, and are now purſuing. The morning of your life was ſerene and bright. Science diſcovered to your open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind the road which leads to eminence and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. You imbibed generous principles of virtue and honour, of religion and liberty, if at certain intervals ſome ſallies appeared which indicated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of temper, or inordinate pride and ambition, the partiality of your friends willingly attributed them to the ardour and inexperience of youth; whatever ſhade they might throw over your better qualities, yet the latter, joined to the abilities for which you had credit, were ſuppoſed to overbalance them; for your talents, though not the moſt ſhining, were ſufficient to gain reſpect, and make you a uſeful member of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Thoſe tranſient ebullitions of ambition, malignity and pride were clearly perceived by the more diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſiderably damped their expectations of your future worth; nor were they deceived. Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for you, the troubles of this unhappy period preſented an occaſion for calling thoſe dark paſſions into action; cheriſhed at the ſame time by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with bad, unprincipled men, they ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſtrength, laid your virtues proſtrate, and gave the predominant colour to your character. Tired and diſſatisfied with the ſober path of loyalty, and duties of a good citizen, you aſpired to be among the founders of a new empire. You entered indeed with reluctance into the deteſtable ſchemes of the babel builders of Congreſs; and no wonder, for they were directly oppoſite to all your firſt principles. But your efforts to ſubdue thoſe principles have been ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that you now figure among the foremoſt in the <hi>glorious</hi> work of rebellion, and ruining your country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:016311_0042_0F9C2B29C1B940F0"/>It would ſeem however that you ſtill have ſome ſevere conflicts. Men cannot eaſily eradicate their former impreſſions, nor become wicked in the extreme all at once. A troubleſome gueſt within them, will, in the calm hour of reflection, be obtruding advice, remonſtrating againſt their conduct, and laying open their guilt. Accordingly, you have repeatedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that in your political conduct <hi>you</hi> KNEW <hi>that you ſinned</hi>; but always gallantly added—<hi>and by G-d I am determined to ſin on!</hi> Agitated thus between the luſt of power and a ſenſe of duty, goaded by ambition and checked by conſcience, your ſituation is truly dreadful! The perpetual dictatorſhip of America would be a poor compenſation for the anguiſh and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that are inſeparable from it. You are a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proof how dangerous it is to depart <hi>knowingly</hi> from the path of rectitude; and I muſt tell you that the gentleman who grew tired of buckling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckling his ſhoes, and therefore hanged himſelf, found out a more effectual, and leſs pernicious method of removing his diſcontent.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe things as they afford a uſeful leſſon to thoſe who would ſtudy human nature, and guard againſt the irregular motions of the heart, which may carry us, if not reſtrained, to the moſt deſperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. Such as feel the force of thoſe generous attachments which are contracted in youth, will readily make allowance for my enlarging on them; for I really lament your deviations from rectitude and duty.</p>
            <p>You are now ſeated in the preſident's chair, and have reached the ſummit of that power to which you aſpired—as high, at leaſt, as it would be convenient to avow at preſent. Soon after your exaltation, a ſcene was brought forward which was very trying and difficult. Like ſome other late occurrences, it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:016311_0043_0F9C2B2A805BA4F0"/>
a neceſſity on your Congreſs of taking meaſures which were deciſive of their character and deſigns, and expoſed things to public view, which they would willingly have concealed.</p>
            <p>Your officious friend, Mr. <hi>Paine,</hi> happened to make this wonderful diſcovery—that the Congreſs was <hi>fallible,</hi> and that its members, like other folks, could purſue their private intereſt and emolument to the detriment of the public. This diſcovery was ſo new and extraordinary to him, that he made it known to the world; and conſidering the ſugar-plumbs with which he had ſo long treated the Congreſs, this muſt have been a very bitter pill to them.</p>
            <p>But this was not all. Among other things he flung out ſome hints which the <hi>Syndic</hi> i. e. the <hi>Town Clerk</hi> of <hi>Straſburg,</hi> deemed incompatible with the views of his maſter. That theſe colonies ſhould have the privilege of making the beſt terms for themſelves, and ſettling the conteſt with Britain in the manner that would be leaſt injurious to their honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, however reaſonable in itſelf, yet Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> well knew was never the deſign or purpoſe of the French king. For two centuries paſt, France hath been the common incendiary of Europe—the plague of every neighbouring ſtate, by interfering and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiling their affairs, to ſerve her own ambitious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. She is now playing the ſame game in America that ſhe played a thouſand times before in Europe; but had
<q>the United States preſerved the liberty of treating with Great-Britain ſeparately from their ally, as long as Great-Britain had not declared war againſt M. <hi>Gerard</hi>'s maſter,</q>
as Mr. <hi>Paine</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, M. <hi>Gerard</hi> was conſcious that the deſigns of his maſter and of France would be wholly defeated. Accordingly, the <hi>Syndic</hi> took fire at the pretended
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016311_0044_0F9C2B2B459031C0"/>
indignity offered to his maſter, and demanded an explanation from the Congreſs.</p>
            <p>With all the deſpotic power exerciſed by your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, they were afraid to diſavow ſo juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a poſition; they were ſtill more afraid to hazard the ſubſequent declaration which rivetted the chains of America, and muſt rouſe the indignation of all who poſſeſſed any ſenſe of national dignity or Britiſh freedom. You therefore evaded the demand for ſome time; but M. <hi>Gerard</hi> was peremptory, and at laſt bullied you into a compliance. You firſt <hi>explicitly diſavowed</hi> the obnoxious <hi>publications</hi> of Mr. <hi>Paine,</hi> and the <hi>aſſertions</hi> contained in them; and among others, <hi>the liberty of treating with Britain,</hi> above mentioned. This was done Jan. 12th; but the <hi>Syndic,</hi> who was no ſtranger to the art of chicane and duplicity, and therefore the better qualified to guard againſt yours, was not ſatisfied with this diſavowal, although into the bargain, <hi>Paine</hi> was ſacrificed to his reſentment. Even your <hi>obſequious</hi> epiſtle could not ſooth him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſomething more explicit—ſomething that would more effectually ſerve his maſter's deſigns, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. You were compelled to give way, and, like a French Parliament <hi>regiſtering an Edict,</hi> you reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as follows, Jan. 14.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas it hath been repreſented to this Houſe by the Hon. Sieur Gerard, Miniſter Plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of France, that <hi>it is pretended the United States have preſerved the liberty of treating with Great Britain ſeparately from their ally, as long as Great Britain ſhall not have declared war againſt his maſter</hi>; therefore reſolved unanimouſly, That, as neither France or theſe United States may of right, ſo theſe United States will not, conclude either
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:016311_0045_0F9C2B2C28E832D0"/>
truce or peace with the common enemy, without the formal conſent of their ally firſt obtained.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It were needleſs to dwell on the palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction between this <hi>reſolve</hi> and your declarations to the Britiſh Commiſſioners, or even the articles of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with France which you were pleaſed to publiſh formerly. Such inconſiſtency cannot now diſgrace the Congreſs. One alledged cauſe for your entering into this rebellion was the legal toleration of Popery in Canada, according to the expreſs ſtipulation of a public treaty; yet you afterwards offered a compleat eſtabliſhment of their religion to the Canadians, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would join in the rebellion—You ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appealed to Heaven for the ſincerity of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions when declaring yourſelves loyal, affectionate ſubjects of the King; and you made the ſame ſolemn appeal when declaring that he was a moſt execrable tyrant, and that you would have no further connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. I could adduce many other inſtances of the ſame kind to ſhew that the above contradiction is of a piece with the reſt of your conduct, which is marked in every part with duplicity and deceit. To what a bleſſed ſituation have you reduced the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans by this mode of procedure when you tell them that <hi>they have not preſerved,</hi> nor muſt they even <hi>pretend they have preſerved the liberty of making a truce or peace without the formal conſent of France!</hi> When in ſuch a ſtate of thraldom to France, what can remain of any value!</p>
            <p>The peculiarity of your ſituation in this buſineſs is worthy of notice. By the perfidious revocation of the edict of Nantz, contrary to public faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the fury of Popiſh bigotry, armed with ſecular power, was let looſe againſt the proteſtants of France. Not leſs than a <hi>million</hi> of them were put to the ſword,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016311_0046_0F9C2B3085277D10"/>
or baniſhed into foreign countries; beſides many millions more who were compelled to abjure their religion. Among others, your anceſtors were driven from their native land; ſtript of all their property, like poor loyaliſts in our day, they ſought an aſylum in the Britiſh dominions. They found an hoſpitable reception in America, a part of thoſe dominions, and full protection from their relentleſs perſecutors. How perverſe your deſtiny, Sir, to be made the inſtrument of inſulting the memory, the faith and fortitude of theſe your pious anceſtors, by now crouching to their perſecutors, by pronouncing their protectors your enemies! Were I capable of harbouring the moſt rancorous malice, and were that malice directed againſt you, it could not be more amply gratified than by the part you acted on this occaſion, as ſpokeſman of the Congreſs—offering incenſe to, and throwing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the feet of, that inſidious crown which has extinguiſhed liberty, and extirpated the proteſtant religion in all its territories—and at the ſame time, not only outraging, but like paricides, impiouſly plotting the ruin of your parent ſtate, where more liberty exiſts than in any other ſtate in chriſtendom, and which is the principal ſupport of the proteſtant religion!</p>
            <p>But whatever diſgrace this affair may reflect on you, and on the Congreſs, its conſequences are more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fatal to the American coloniſts—according to your <hi>reſolve,</hi> they are in a ſtate of vaſſalage to France. You have declared that <hi>they cannot of right, and ſhall not conclude either truce or peace with the common enemy,</hi> i. e. with their rightful ſovereign, <hi>without the formal conſent of their ally,</hi> meaning the French King, <hi>firſt obtained.</hi> So that whatever overtures are made by Britain to the colonies, however beneficial or honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, it matters not. As long as its ſuits the ambition, caprice, intereſt or policy of France, ſo
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:016311_0047_0F9C2B316FAFA058"/>
long muſt the coloniſts wage war with their brethern, and embrue their hands in kindred blood, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the utter deſtruction of both ſhould be the inevitable conſequence! It will not therefore be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating or going beyond the truth, when I confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently pronounce, that the Congreſs, ſo far as in them lay, have betrayed theſe colonies, with their deareſt intereſts, to France, and delivered them up to her vaſſalage.</p>
            <p>Were you to reply with your uſual chicance and ſophiſtry—
<q>That France is equally bound with the colonies; and that allies uſually engage not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert each other</q>
—it could only impoſe on ſuch as are ignorant or weak. Your caſe is totally different from that of France. France is not in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt; ſhe is not dependent on any other power; ſhe has in herſelf great reſources of men and money; her government is deſpotic, and none of her ſubjects are diſaffected.</p>
            <p>The reverſe of this in every particular is your caſe, ſave only in the article of deſpotiſm, which is a ſure indication of weakneſs in you, however it may enable France to exert her ſtrength. You are in a ſtate of revolt againſt your rightful ſovereign; and whatever tone or air of confidence you may aſſume, a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of this preys on your heart, and depreſſes your ſpirits; your inglorious alliance with France, by which you lie at the mercy of that perfidious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a demonſtration of your dependence on her for ſupplies; the wretched ſtate of your paper currency clearly ſhews how your reſources ſtand in the article of money; and as for men, you cannot raiſe an army without <hi>compelling</hi> thoſe to take arms who ſhould cultivate the earth; and this in a little time muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a famine, as it neceſſarily would in any other
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:016311_0048_0F9C2B31F8EC1520"/>
country, which was circumſtanced like America; the coloniſts are divided as to the object you have in view; and a majority of them, beyond all doubt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a conſtitutional union with Britain, to a nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal independency, and pernicious alliance with France.</p>
            <p>I dare appeal even to yourſelf for the truth of theſe ſeveral facts; and any perſon of plain underſtanding may readily ſee the conſequences. Your weakneſs compelled you to fly for ſuccour to France; and the longer the war continues, you muſt grow proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably weaker, and more dependent on her; and this dependence will give her an intire aſcendency and power over you.</p>
            <p>Nay, more. You have contracted a large debt to France. Your <hi>reſolve</hi> undeniably proves what was well known before—that you have MORTGAGED this counntry for that debt—a mortgage which France will take care to continue; for as that debt will unavoidably increaſe whilſt this conteſt ſubſiſts, (your trade being already ruined) the French King muſt in the end, according to your bleſſed ſchemes, be Lord Paramount and Proprietor of North-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. So that every American who is fighting againſt Britain, may have the pleaſure to reflect, that altho' he is riveting the ſhackles, and labouring for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruin, of this country, yet he is extending the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and glory of the <hi>grand Monarque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Go then, Sir, and tell your deluded partizans that <hi>France is equally bound with you, and you ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert your ally.</hi> Such an alliance, in your circumſtances, is nothing but ſervitude, and muſt end in the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of America; and thoſe who will be duped by ſuch ſophiſtry—who wilfully ſhut their eyes at the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016311_0049_0F9C2B32B9B6B438"/>
diſgrace and impending ruin of their country, and will not exert themſelves to avert them, deſerve no better fate than to become vaſſals of France, and wear wooden ſhoes. I will venture to affirm that France has too much policy to deſire more of you, for the preſent, than ſhe has gained already, in point of ſubmiſſion. She would check any further advances on your part, as ſubverſive of her deſigns; juſt as the Pope diſapproved of the precipitate meaſures of JAMES II, which, in fact, defeated the purpoſes of both.</p>
            <p>This is not the language of prejudice, but of truth; nor is there a propoſition in Euclid more evident or demonſtrable than that America muſt be enſlaved and ruined, on the plan you have laid. My conſolation is, that Britain, which firſt ſettled, indulgently foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and fully protected this country, is ſtill able, with the bleſſing of providence, to wreſt it from the uſupation of its domeſtic, and perfidious intruſion of its foreign, enemies.</p>
            <p>Britain has frequently humbled the pride, checked the ambition, and ſubdued the power of France; ſhe never was in a better condition to do ſo than at this inſtant. Notwithſtanding your fond dreams, and falſe inſinuations that ſhe was exhauſted and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſad experience will ſoon bring you conviction of the contrary. Never at any period was her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce more flouriſhing, her wealth greater, her fleets ſo formidable, or her armies more gallant or nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Your deceit and ſpecious pretences indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided her councils for a time; and this, with the mild ſpirit of her government, has protracted your uſurpation beyond all rational expectation. You have now diſſolved the charm by throwing off your maſk, and I moſt cordially thank you for the ſervice you
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:016311_0050_0F9C2B337A26DF10"/>
have done. Whatever diviſions may ariſe from the claſhing of perſonal intereſt in the Britiſh Parliament, where perfect freedom of debate is indulged, yet ALL are now ſufficiently united in the main point. The ſtrength of Britain will be no longer ſhackled or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; and when let looſe, you will find her le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not your own reſources or power, prevented this moſt deteſtable and wanton rebellion from being long ſince cruſhed.</p>

            <p>THE anxiety I feel for your welfare, and my apprehenſions of the ruin which is now hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over you, induce me to addreſs you, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the difficulties and diſcouragements that lie in the way to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Your preſent rulers are labouring to keep you in the dark. They not only conceal from you the moſt important tranſactions relative to America, in which they are concerned themſelves; but they do all in their power to hinder you from receiving informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from any other quarter, either reſpecting your own ſituation or the true ſtate of things in Europe. If a perſon goes out of the Britiſh lines, a guard is ſet over him and you are not permitted to converſe with him. If a newſ-paper or pamphlet from hence, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to find its way among you, you are obliged to read it privately and then hide it. Every man has a tyrant at his door, watching over him with the moſt ſuſpicious jealouſy. You are denied even the freedom of ſpeech, and cannot communicate your ſentiments with ſafety; much leſs are you ſuffered to act as your judgment and inclinations would lead you. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:016311_0052_0F9C2B373732F370"/>
of Spain, Portugal and Rome are not more diligent to keep their deluded vaſſals in profound ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; or to prevent Goſpel truth from reaching them, which would diſpel the thick cloud of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and error that covers them; than your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee and Congreſs men, your rulers in general are, to keep you in ignorance of your real ſtate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your eyes from being opened to ſee your preſent danger.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this; I muſt tell you that ſome of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are willing to be impoſed on, and to believe the ſpecious lies that are invented to deceive you. You will account him your enemy that would tell you the truth; you will pronounce him <hi>a wicked Tory,</hi> and that he <hi>is inimical to his country!</hi> But is this right, my brethren? Should you not liſten to truth? Do you not ſin againſt the God of truth and your own ſouls; when you wilfully turn a deaf ear to it? Is it not right that you ſhould know the true ſtate of your affairs—what you have to depend on—and what will be the real conſequences of the meaſures that are now purſuing?</p>
            <p>All men have their prejudices; and whoever is ſenſible of his own, will be ready to make due al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for thoſe of others. Notwithſtanding the prejudices which have influenced you, yet I know you ſo well, that I can ſafely rely on your candour and good ſenſe for an anſwer to the above queſtions. I am ſure the language of your hearts, is, that you <hi>ſhould</hi> know thoſe particulars—that you <hi>ſhould</hi> liſten to truth.</p>
            <p>You heartily lament with me the error, bondage and ſlavery which have, and do now overſpread ſo great a part of the earth. However tyrants may have
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:016311_0053_0F9C2B3896863858"/>
been blamed for this, yet I may affirm, that all the tyrants in the univerſe could not accompliſh it, had not the people themſelves been devoted to them; had they not been averſe to the means of information, attentive to plauſible deluſions, and ſubmiſſive to the yoke of ſlavery. To theſe cauſes we ſhould princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally refer the Heathen, Mahometan and Popiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition which hath formerly, and does now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the world; as well as the deſpotiſm under which ſo many of our fellow creatures have groaned. Nor is it poſſible for you, my countrymen, to avoid the yoke of deſpotiſm now, and probably the ſhackles of Popiſh ſuperſtition, and counting beads, unleſs you open your eyes, think and act for yourſelves as becomes free-men.</p>
            <p>I do not deſire you to take my word, or believe my aſſertions on theſe points, further than they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by plain facts and clear reaſoning. But th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I expect that you will aſſent to ſuch facts and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning when laid before you; that you will act as unbiaſſed reaſon and your intereſt direct in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them; that you will not be the dupes of prejudice, the tools of crafty, deſigning men, who have already deceived you often; and whoſe intereſt and conſequence entirely depend on your being ſtill under a deception.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be any ſatisfaction to you, I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare with the ſincerity of a martyr, that my aim in addreſſing you now, is to promote your welfare by warning you of your danger, and the ruin that is haſtening towards you. I have no intereſts that claſs with, or that are ſeparate from, yours. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my infancy imbibed generous principles of freedom, I cordially deteſt tyranny in every ſhape, and from whatever quarter it may come. In my
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:016311_0054_0F9C2B3994F05A00"/>
choice, I would fly to the uttermoſt parts of the earth to find a ſpot where I could enjoy rational li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which I eſteem the greateſt bleſſing; rather than ſubmit to the tyranny and oppreſſion of any man, or body of men.</p>
            <p>Yet righteous as my intentions are, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably aiming at your benefit, I would not venture to addreſs you now, were I not certain that your own feelings will, in ſome degree, convince you of your dangerous ſituation, and powerfully ſecond what I have to ſay. Tyranny may ſtiffle the voice of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or ſhackle the body—Deception may, for a while, by its bewitching influence, lead us in the path of error and deſtruction; but neither of them can ſuppreſs our feelings under injuries and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To your feelings therefore, to your reaſon, and to that knowledge you have acquired, even excluded as you are from the proper means of informations be the appeal for what I ſhall offer.</p>
            <p>I ſaid, that <hi>you have been often deceived</hi>; and pray reflect, is not this the caſe? Recollect the firſt riſe of this unhappy conteſt with the parent ſtate, when you were actually the moſt free and happy people upon earth. Your Congreſs then ſolemnly appealed to heaven and to you, that they were loyal and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate ſubjects of GEORGE III.—that they diſclaimed every idea of independency—that none but enemies could ſuggeſt they aimed at it—that their intereſt and happineſs depended on a conſtitutional union with Great-Britain—and that their ſole object was to obtain a redreſs of thoſe greviances which they either apprehended, or pretended to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>In the ſimplicity of your hearts, you believed thoſe declarations. But were you not deceived? Are you
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:016311_0055_0F9C2B3A4D2C0E18"/>
not convinced that your leaders impoſed on you? That revolt and rebellion were in their hearts, whilſt their declarations were filled with profeſſions of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to the king, and attachment to the parent ſtate? With ſuch artifice and ſubtility did they conduct matters, that it was next to impoſſible for the bulk of the people to penetrate into their real deſigns. To hint that the Congreſs had any thoughts of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, would endanger a man's life. In the ſpring of 1776, a gentleman came from Philadelphia to this city, and reported that the Congreſs were delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on that point. The committee of ſafety took fire at the <hi>calumny,</hi> ordered a ſearch to be made for the gentleman, who, to ſave himſelf from the fury of the mob, was obliged to take ſanctuary on board of one of the King's ſhips: yet the declaration of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency was publiſhed the July following! But to proceed:</p>
            <p>The Congreſs declared that a redreſs of grievances was the only object they had in view; and when that was obtained, all diſcord would ceaſe. You believed this alſo; yet when that redreſs was offered by the King's Commiſſioners—when terms more liberal than the moſt ſanguine republican could have hoped for, were held out, they were rejected by Congreſs with the utmoſt contempt and diſdain. The truth is, they had ſo entangled themſelves with France, had MORTGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GED theſe Colonies ſo deeply to that inſidious power, and the members of the Congreſs carried on ſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a traffic, that they did not <hi>chuſe,</hi> and <hi>would not</hi> break off the connection.</p>
            <p>By the loud declamations of your Congreſs-Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots againſt oppreſſion and taxes, you were taught to believe that they were the moſt diſintereſted of men, and aimed only at the public good; that all oppreſſion
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:016311_0056_0F9C2B3B08C70E18"/>
and taxes would ſoon be at an end, and a free trade carried on with the whole world. All this you ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and believed it to be as true as the goſpel. Yet theſe diſintereſted patriots are now trading on <hi>your</hi> credit, and raiſing immenſe fortunes at <hi>your</hi> expence. I appeal to the publications of Meſſrs <hi>Deane, Paine, Morris,</hi> and others in Philadelphia, for the truth of this; and were that whole maſs of corruption fully uncovered, it would aſtoniſh the world. You find thoſe pretended enemies of oppreſſion, the moſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting oppreſſors, and their little finger heavier than the King's Loins. Inſtead of an exemption from taxes, you are fleeced more than any other people this day on the face of the earth. In ſome provinces, a perſon who formerly—in the <hi>woeful</hi> days of <hi>Royal Oppreſſion</hi>—paid annually 10l. in taxes, now in the time of Congreſſional <hi>liberty and exemption from taxes,</hi> pays annually 1200l. in taxes, and ſo on in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Nor is there any proſpect of this ending. Were every improved farm, and all the vacant lands in the <hi>thirteen united ſtates,</hi> ſet up at public auction, were they ſold at the price which lands ſold at in the year 1772, yet the ſum total would not amount to the quantity of paper dollars, and other bills of credit which are now circulating among you: And this quantity of paper money, joined to the millions due to France, and the neceſſary expence of your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, muſt entail an inſupportable load of taxes on America, for ages to come, and overwhelm it with ruin! It is needleſs to tell you that you have not a free trade. Scarcely can any of your ſkulking ſloops peep out of an inlet, or a French interloper appear on our coaſts, but they are inſtantly ſeized by a Britiſh cruizer, or a <hi>Tory</hi> privateer.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be replied,
<q>that the above advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges could only be expected when independency was
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:016311_0057_0F9C2B3BB824D938"/>
eſtabliſhed, and the war at an end:</q>
I anſwer— that if independency was eſtabliſhed, and the war ended to-morrow, yet the debt due to France muſt be paid, unleſs the Congreſs mean to defraud the French, as they defrauded the Britiſh merchants to whom the Americans owed large ſums when the rebellion began. I anſwer again, that the above maſs of paper money and bills, is now in actual circulation, and muſt either be ſunk by taxes, or ſink of itſelf; beſides the expence of ſupporting the new governments, which could not be leſs than <hi>three millions ſterling</hi> annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and muſt be raiſed by taxes; for the Congreſs have acted juſt like a ſpendthrift heir who came too early to his eſtate, and madly involved himſelf in ſuch a debt, that the income of his eſtate cannot pay the intereſt, nor its intrinſic value diſcharge the principal. I anſwer further—that independency is now a mere dream, a phantom. The Congreſs have ſo entwined themſelves with France, that were even the Britiſh power ſet aſide, they could not break looſe from the former. If not dependent on Britain, the Colonies muſt be dependant on France; and were the Congreſs now to declare LOUIS XVI, ſovereign and liege Lord of North-America, it would not ſhock or ſurprize me ſo much as their <hi>Reſolve</hi> of Jan. 14, 1779.—
<q>That as theſe united ſtates may not of right, ſo they will not conclude either truce or peace with the common enemy, without the formal conſent of their ally firſt obtained.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I appeal to any man of plain underſtanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a declaration of the Congreſs that the <hi>French King</hi> was <hi>King of North-America,</hi> would he near ſo inconſiſtent with this Reſolve, or ſo great a ſtride from it, as this <hi>Reſolve</hi> is inconſiſtent with, and diſtant from, the repeated declarations of the Congreſs, long after this conteſt began. The powers of Britain and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:016311_0058_0F9C2B3C8036A060"/>
France now ſtand in the way of your independency; if the Congreſs can remove thoſe powers, they may accompliſh the point; but I apprehend they will meet with equal difficulty in doing this, as the man did in finding a place to fix his machines on to heave the earth from its place. But I return to the point from which I digreſſed to anſwer this objection.</p>
            <p>To induce you to take up arms, and join in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt your King, you were told at firſt that the rebellion would ſoon be over. Some of you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily believed this—you thought it would only be a ſhort <hi>frolick</hi>—that it was very clever to wear a cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade and regimentals—<hi>when you could get them,</hi> and ſtrut after a drum and fife. But here alſo you were deceived. After all your ſtruggles, and the loſs of at leaſt 60,000 lives on your ſide, by the ſword, or ſickneſs, the conteſt is not yet ended.</p>
            <p>You were made to believe at the beginning of each campaign, that it would be the laſt. You were told that New-York would certainly be evacuated laſt fall—laſt Chriſtmas—or this ſpring at the very fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt; yet you may be aſſured there is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of evacuating New-York, than there is to evacuate London.</p>
            <p>You have been aſſured a thouſand times that Britain was helpleſs and exhauſted—deſtitute of men and money—unable to carry on the war longer, and muſt give up the conteſt. But you have been as egregiouſly deceived in this as any of the former par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and perhaps it is the moſt fatal deception of any. Britain cannot now give up the conteſt—the Congreſs have put it out of her power. She muſt exert herſelf to prevent the colonies from becoming an acceſſion to the power of France, were there no
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:016311_0059_0F9C2B3D46EC9D10"/>
other reaſon. She never abounded more in reſources for carrying on a war than at this inſtant—in wealth, commerce and credit. No leſs than 77,000 ſeamen were in the King's ſervice laſt November; that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has been much increaſed ſince, and her land forces are in proportion. As ſhe is thus able, ſo alſo is ſhe fully <hi>determined</hi> to proſecute this war with vigour. When rouſed by injuries or inſults, ſhe hath frequently made her enemies tremble in every quarter of the Globe; nor have I the leaſt doubt but ſhe will, with the bleſſing of heaven, make her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic and foreign enemies ſorely rue their ungrateful, perfidious conduct in the preſent conteſt.</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible to enumerate every inſtance in which you have been thus deceived. Whenever any advance was to be made towards Rebellion— when any arbitrary, oppreſſive meaſure, which might raiſe an alarm, was to be carried—when an army was to be raiſed, or any other ſtep taken to ſerve the purpoſes of the Congreſs, a monſtrous lie was invented and circulated, and you generally were the dupes of thoſe artifices, and ſwallowed the bait. Thus have you been gradually led on to your preſent deplorable ſituation, and brought to the very brink of ruin.</p>
            <p>This, as far it goes, is a faithful and juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of your ſtate; for much remains yet to be mentioned. Were I even your enemy, I could not forbear commiſerating it; but as your friend I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely lament it. O what a maſs of happineſs— what bleſſings and privileges have you wantonly and fooliſhly flung away! How grating muſt your reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be, whilſt comparing your preſent with your form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtate. <hi>Eſan</hi> ſold his birth right for a meſs of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but you have ſold the birth right of Britiſh
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:016311_0060_0F9C2B3DF514F958"/>
ſubjects—You have exchanged freedom, ſecurity and wealth, for oppreſſion, miſrule and beggary, and for vaſſalage to France! Your farms, your eſtates and property are actually MORTGAGED to France. You plow and ſow, you labour and toil, you fight and bleed for France, and for thoſe who have betrayed you to France—Your Congreſs! Your grain, your tobacco, your produce of every kind, your cattle and lumber, muſt go for vile paper dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are no better than ſo many old rags! How long are you to remain in this diſgraceful, wretched ſituation? Where, my Countrymen, where is that good ſenſe, that innate love of freedom for which you were once famed? Are they totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed? Can you indeed ſubmit to be the tools of French Papiſts—to be doomed to poverty and ruin by a Congreſs, which is a creature of your own making, whilſt its members are FATTENING ON YOUR SPOILS?</p>
            <p>But me thinks I ſee a flaming <hi>patriot,</hi> who ſhares in thoſe ſpoils, or derives all his conſequence from your miſfortunes—methinks I ſee him knit his brow, and foaming with rage at what I ſay, declare to you moſt poſitively, <hi>that I am a curſed Tory—that all I tell you is a parcel of lies—that I only mean to ſow diſſention among the Americans, and thereby ſerve the cauſe of Britain, which has now no other hope of ſucceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt like this <hi>patriot,</hi> with ſimilar deſigns, and equally contrary to truth, did the firſt promoter of rebellion declare poſitively to <hi>Eve,</hi>
               <q>Ye ſhall not ſurely die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened; and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</q>
I could eaſily point out a parallel between the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here uſed, and thoſe which are uſually urged
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:016311_0061_0F9C2B42DF9F0050"/>
by falſe <hi>patriots</hi> on ſuch occaſions as the preſent; and alſo too near a reſemblance between the conſequences of hearkening to each.</p>
            <p>Believe me, my Countrymen, that Britain ſtands not in need of my feeble aid; and as for diſſentions, they already abound among you, God wot, as much as the moſt determined enemy of the Congreſs could wiſh. The greateſt part of thoſe particulars, I know to be true; and have ſuch evidence of the reſt, as leaves me in no doubt about them. Nay, I appeal to yourſelves for the truth of them. Conſult your own experience, your feelings, your memory and reaſon; liſten to them, if not to me. They will tell you much more than I have yet related. You ought to profit ſomething by the knowledge you have of theſe matters, for you have paid very dearly for it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is more conſiſtent with the character of rational beings, to attend the dictates of reaſon and that knowledge, and act as they and your intereſt require; or ſtill to be the dupes of artful deceivers, and tread the deſtructive path of rebellion and ſlavery into which they have led you, I leave you freely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. I am your ſincere friend,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON carefully reviewing the conduct of your Congreſs, I find a remarkable conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the rules laid down by Machiavel in his well known treatiſe, intitled, THE PRINCE. As it may contribute to place the character of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in a true light, I ſhall in this letter point out ſome of the inſtances in which that conformity is ſo evident, that it muſt ſtrike the dulleſt obſerver.</p>
            <p>However the world may be divided as to the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> which induced Machiavel to write that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, yet all agree that it contains the moſt execrable doctrines. It teaches the various methods by which uſurpers may arrive at power, and afterwards retain it.—Deceit, treachery, aſſaſſination, poiſon, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard of oaths, and all other obligations whatever, are among the ſeveral leſſons here inculcated, and of which uſurpers are to avail themſelves.</p>
            <p>Machiavel profeſſedly holds up Caeſar Borgia, or as he was commonly called, Duke Valentine, for a model which all uſurpers ſhould copy.
<q>I know no better pattern, ſays he, that can be propoſed for the imitation of a new Prince.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Machiavel's <hi>PRINCE,</hi> Chap 7.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> an uſurper. After giving a detail of Borgia's ſchemes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016311_0063_0F9C2B43F62C87C0"/>
Machiavel adds,
<q>upon a review of the Duke's actions, I ſee nothing worthy of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in them; on the contrary, I have propoſed them, and here propoſe them again, as a pattern for the Imitation of all ſuch as arrive at dominion by the arms and fortune of others.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prince, Chap. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>It will be proper to give ſome particulars of the man's character who is ſo earneſtly recommended as a pattern to others. Caeſar Borgia was the natural ſon of Pope Alexander VI; and a more ambitious, perſidious or cruel monſter perhaps never diſgraced humanity. Ambition was the reigning paſſion of his mind; to gratify it, he ſtuck at nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever infamous. Borgia aſſaſſinated his own brother, and ordered his dead body to be thrown into the Tyber. He cauſed the Pope's Swiſs guards to be aſſaſſinated to revenge himſelf on that nation for a pretended affront. He deprived hundreds of their property by violence to ſatiate his avarice; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Duke of Urbino, and took poſſeſſion of his territories; he murdered ſeveral Lords of the Urſini family becauſe they were obſtacles to his greatneſs, after he had decoved them to an interview by the warmeſt profeſſions of freindſhip; he cauſed a Venetian Lady of quality, whom he had raviſhed, to be flung into the Tyber and drowned. In ſhort, to uſe the King of Pruſſia's ſtrong language,
<q>He was the moſt abominable monſter that Hell ever vomited out upon the earth.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">See his Pruſſian <hi>MAJESTY'S</hi> Examen du Prince de Machiavel, Chap. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> Machiavel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates moſt of theſe particulars, and knew many more no leſs infamous, though he recommends Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia as a pattern for imitation!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:016311_0064_0F9C2B44C40F90E8"/>Be not ſtartled, Sir, nor think I lay my charge too high in ſaying that your Congreſs have acted on the principles laid down in a treatiſe which propoſes this wretch for a pattern. Borgia himſelf might not ſee the foulneſs and turpitude of his actions in the ſame light that others ſaw them. Blinded by irregular paſſions, and heated by ambitious purſuits, a deceitful veil was thrown over his crimes, nor did he take time to reflect on them. This may alſo be the caſe of others.</p>
            <p>I deſire no one to regard or apply the preſent charge further than it is ſupported by plain facts. I do not aver that every member of the Congreſs ſat down deliberately and read over Machiavel's PRINCE on purpoſe to practice his precepts. This is not my meaning, nor was it neceſſary. Uſurpers in China, in Italy, and in America, actuated by the ſame ſpirit, and having the ſame object in view, might naturally fall on the ſame methods of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that object. I do not aſſert that poiſoning, treachery and aſſaſſination have been practiſed here exactly as they were in Italy when Machiavel wrote. The preſent times would not well admit of, nor bear this. For as Monteſquieu obſerves,
<q>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be cured of Machiaveliſm; moderation is become neceſſary—what would formerly have been called a maſter-ſtroke of politics, would now, independent of the horror it might occaſion, be the greateſt imprudence.</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Spirit of Laws, Book xxi Chap. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> When Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieu wrote, he knew nothing of the American Congreſs, or their proceedings.</p>
            <p>But other expedients may be found, equally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the purpoſes of uſurpation, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing ſo much horror—ſuch as tarring and feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016311_0065_0F9C2B45765D2CE0"/>
riding of men on rails by mobs and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, which mobs and committees were the principal fabricators and ſupporters of the congreſs in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning —ſuch as chaining men together by dozens, and driving them, like herds of cattle, into diſtant provinces,<note n="¶" place="bottom">In the year <hi>1776,</hi> it was computed that <hi>two thouſand</hi> inhabitants were baniſhed from the province of New-York into New-England. Among theſe were ſeveral members of his Majeſty's Council, ſome of the Judges, the Members of the Aſſembly,and Magiſtrates, the Mayors of New-York and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany. Of the lower claſſes it was uſual to chain <hi>10, 15,</hi> or <hi>20</hi> together, and drive them, thus chained, ſome hundreds of miles. By confinement and hardſhips they contracted fluxes and other diſorders; and when any one was obliged to go and eaſe nature, the whole group muſt move with him. The jails were alſo filled with loyaliſts, and many hundreds loſt their lives by theſe ſeverities. This was the ſtate of things in the province of New-York; the caſe was ſimilar in other provinces. When the Congreſs had in ſome degree eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their power, and new modelled the government of each province, the more expeditious mode of trial by laws of their own framing, confiſcation, hanging, &amp;c. took place.</note> flinging them into loathſome jails, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcating their eſtates, ſhooting them in ſwamps and woods as ſuſpected tories, hanging them after a mock trial; and all this becauſe they would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their rightful Sovereign, and bear arms againſt him. You muſt be conſcious that theſe methods were conſtantly practiſed by your Congreſs and their partizans, that by theſe you gradually roſe to your preſent uſurped power; and although they differed ſomewhat from the Italian mode of poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſaſſination, yet they were done in the true ſpirit of Machiaveliſm, and ſerved your deſigns much better.</p>
            <p>What I aſſert is this—that there is a remarkable conformity between the conduct of the Congreſs and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:016311_0066_0F9C2B46386082A8"/>
the rules laid down in Machiavel's PRINCE. Whether that conformity proceeded from accident or deſign, is foreign to the queſtion, and of very little moment. Now let facts decide whether this aſſertion be true or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Prince,</hi> Machiavel in his treatiſe means an uſurper—a character which applies exactly to you: The power that is acquired by the inſtrumentality of mobs, by deceit, violence and the proſtration of law and order, muſt be uſurped, Agreeably to this character, and the ſpirit of his treatiſe, Machiavel teaches his uſurper to ſpurn every obligation, and throw aſide all regard to the rights, liberties and lives of others, whenever it would facilitate his way to power <note n="*" place="bottom">Prince, Paſſim.</note>.</p>
            <p>How well your Congreſs have practiſed thoſe leſſons, millions can teſtify. You broke through and ſpurned the moſt ſacred obligations that ſubjects can be under to a Sovereign—or fellow-ſubjects to fellow-ſubjects. You violated your own oaths, and compelled others to violate theirs. Altho' ſenſible that carnage, deſolation and ruin, muſt be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable conſequences of your proceedings, yet ſtill you perſiſted in brandiſhing the ſword of rebellion. When a redreſs of every grievance, real or pretended, was generouſly offered on the part of Britain— when every thing, except abſolute independence, was allowed—when even the ſubſtance of that was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and nothing but the bare name was witheld: Yet your Congreſs turned a deaf ear to all thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and contemptuouſly rejected the offers of peace. Nay, to rebellion you added the moſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous inſults; thereby provoking Britain to inflict ſevere puniſhments on her rebellious children whom ſhe would willingly have ſpared. Whilſt theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:016311_0067_0F9C2B470BE549C0"/>
evince your conformity to Machiavel's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; they alſo ſhew that the Congreſs -and the Congreſs <hi>only</hi>—are chargeable, before God and the world, with all the calamities that are ſuffered by America.</p>
            <p>Machiavel ſays—
<q>Experience ſhews that thoſe Princes of our own times, who have made leaſt account of their word and honour, have done the greateſt things; by the dint of craft and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention they have for the moſt part got the better of others who proceeded with ſincerity and regard to their engagements—A wiſe Prince therefore ought not to regard his word, when keeping it will be to his prejudice.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prince, Chap. <hi>18</hi>
               </note>—</p>
            <p>This <hi>precious</hi> doctrine hath been uniformly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by your congreſs. Your duplicity is become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial. The Treaty at the <hi>Cedars,</hi> and Convention of <hi>Saratoga</hi> furniſh us with illuſtrious ſpecimens of your regard to public faith and honour; juſt as the impriſonment of Lieut. <hi>Hele,</hi> manifeſts your venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the law of nations; to paſs by other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. —But to proceed—</p>
            <p>"A Prince," continues Machiavel,
<q>will never want colourable pretences to varniſh the breach of his faith—however it is highly neceſſary to diſguſe this craft, and to be a thorough maſter of ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſſimulation. For ſome men are ſo ſimple, and others ſo eager to get out of preſent difficulties, that whoever knows how to act his part well, will always find dupes to his hypocriſy.</q>
As a recent example, Machiavel mentions Pope Alexander VI, —
<q>whoſe life was one continued impoſition on mankind: He neither did nor thought any thing
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:016311_0068_0F9C2B47B567EBB8"/>
but how to deceive others: No man ever made ſtronger proteſtations of ſincerity, or took more ſolemn oaths to confirm them; no man ever ſhewed leſs regard to thoſe engagements: Yet Alexander was ſo well acquainted with the would, that he always found freſh people to work upon.</q>
—<note n="†" place="bottom">Prince, Chap. <hi>18.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>That the Congreſs have found pretences for their rebellion, and that they alſo found dupes to thoſe pretences, is certain. They wrote addreſſes to the King, the Parliament, the inhabitants of Great-Britain, Ireland and the Colonies. In theſe they made the moſt ſolemn profeſſions of loyalty to their Sovereign, though they undoubtedly meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and abjure him—of attachment and love to their European brethren, though they intended to ſeperate from them; and were even then taking meaſures to defraud and ruin them. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained bitterly of grievances in this country, which were not felt—of taxes, which were not levied—of ſavages employed to ſcalp them, although the ſavages were actually kept back by Government from the work of death—of tyrannical oppreſſion and loſs of freedom, when we were running wild with licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Theſe pretences, however falſe, were ſo colourable, ſo artfully managed, that they varniſhed over the real deſigns and perfidy of the Congreſs. Republicans indeed, from principle, crowded to your ſtandard here -they commenced your zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates in Europe. But beſides theſe, you gained, for a time, many to your cauſe, who had been among your warmeſt oppoſers, had they known your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe were dupes of your hypocriſy; but the charm has been long ſince diſſolved. The diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the loyal and honeſt ſoon ſaw through the flimſy diſguiſe, and inſtantly abandoned men who had
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:016311_0069_0F9C2B4C50954128"/>
abandoned truth and ſincerity. By throwing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the arms of France at laſt, and delivering this country, as far as you were capable, to the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage of that inſidious power, you have fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the world your diſregard of the liberties, welfare and happineſs of America.</p>
            <p>Machiavel, after ſaying that a uſurper
<q>ſhould have the appearance of good qualities, but to put them in practice would be to his prejudice,</q>
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs his uſurper how to fortify himſelf with proper caution.—"He muſt be conſtantly on his guard," ſays Machiavel,
<q>that nothing may ever drop from his mouth but what ſeems to flow from a heart full of goodneſs, mercy, truth, humanity and religion; but particularly of the laſt; for mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral form their judgment rather from appearances than realities: All men have eyes, but not many have the gift of penetration.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prince, Chap. <hi>18.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Senſible of the utility of this rule, you availed yourſelves of it. You profeſſedly undertook to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the liberties of America, and reſcue the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from taxation and tyranny. You proclaimed faſts, and appointed days of public humiliation. Theſe were popular things; and who <hi>could</hi> think otherwiſe than that they proceeded from hearts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with goodneſs, humanity and religion? All indeed had eyes to ſee theſe matters; and although many formed their judgment from appearances; yet ſome had the gift of penetration, and conſidered all this as a ſolemn mockery of God and man.</p>
            <p>They thought it highly farcical that men—many of whom believed as much of the Alcoran or Talmud as of the Bible—ſhould be the authors of religious
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016311_0070_0F9C2B4D39E745D0"/>
inſtitutions on the principles of Chriſtianity. They judged it a mockery of the Supreme Being to deſire his interpoſition in behalf of meaſures which were expreſsly forbidden in his word, and inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of his religion; or to boaſt of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, as was your caſe on any little ſucceſs you met with, when the diſciples of Mahomet, or of any other impoſter, equally ſucceſsful, might, according to this rule, lay a much better claim to the patronage of Heaven.</p>
            <p>It was alſo a mockery of men. The ſecurity of their rights and liberties was the oſtenſible object held up; yet meaſures were purſued which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſubvert both, as hath actually happened. Liberty is fled from that part of America which owns your ſway. There is more liberty in Turkey than in the dominions of the Congreſs. Can liberty exiſt where every man who differs in ſentiment from you, is not only precluded from the common rights of citizens, but is alſo liable to impriſonment, confiſcation and death? And as for taxes, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of your <hi>great and good Ally</hi> are not near ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily burthened in this way, as the Americans. That uſurpers ſhould gain power by deceit and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is no new thing—it has frequently happened: But that people, in queſt of liberty, ſhould tamely ſubmit to ſuch a yoke as this; or that in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they can be perſuaded their rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are preſerved and ſecure, is equally aſtoniſhing and new in the hiſtory of mankind.</p>
            <p>In caſe a war ſhould be protracted, and the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's ſubject grew tired of it, Machiavel tells him how to act,
<q>A prudent Prince, ſays he, ſometimes artfully buoys up his ſubjects with hopes that their ſufferings will ſoon be over; ſometimes he ſtrikes
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016311_0071_0F9C2B4DB5627D18"/>
a terror into them by magnifying the cruelty and blood-thirſtineſs of the enemy; and he will take other proper methods to fix the wavering, and quiet ſuch as are moſt clamorous <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prince, Chap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this rule you have been peculiarly attentive, and it has done you eſſential ſervice; without it, the rebellion had been long ſince ended. At the beginning of every campaign, you gave out that it would be the laſt—that all fighting, and the ſufferings of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, would ſoon be over. How often has the time been fixed when you were to take poſſeſſion of New-York? I queſtion whether there has been a month for more than two years paſt, that was not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you or your partizans, for the accompliſhment of that joyful event. The ſimple multitude always ſwallowed the bait, and their ſpirits were elated. Now that every hope of this ſort is vaniſhed, other fictions are propagated. I am told the prevailing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion at preſent, and what your partizans ſedulouſly promote, is—that Great Britain has offered indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to your Congreſs; and nothing but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of ſome articles relative to Canada, the Fiſheries, &amp;c. is wanting to ſettle the accommodation. Incredible as it may appear, yet I am aſſured that even this abſurd falſhood is ſwallowed with avidity! Such men would believe tranſubſtantiation, or deny that ſunſhine afforded light, if either of them happened to gratify their prejudices, or ſerve their intereſts.</p>
            <p>You made Europe and America ring with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful accounts of Britiſh cruelties; and yet in truth moſt of them were purely fictitious; others were exaggerated; and the reſt were ſuch as you yourſelves made neceſſary, or that are unavoidable in time of war. You publickly invited the Americans to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to you whatever reports they could glean up of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:016311_0072_0F9C2B4E810CE3F0"/>
the <hi>enemy's cruelties</hi>; and you appointed <hi>a Committee of Grievances</hi> to arrange and record the virulent tales that were ſent in by every ſeditious, republican zealot, however groundleſs. Theſe, and other like methods you practiſed in the true ſpirit of Machiaveliſm.</p>
            <p>It is by no means my intention to point out in every inſtance the conformity of your conduct with Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avel's rules: To do this, it would be neceſſary to write a hiſtory of the Congreſs, and tranſcribe his treatiſe. The ſpecimens I have given are quite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. I acknowledge however that in ſome Things you have departed, and do ſtill depart, from his rules; but you are excuſable perhaps in this, ſince thoſe rules are inconſiſtent with the general tenor of his treatiſe, and contrary to his other poſitions.</p>
            <p>Thus he aſſerts—
<q>that Princes, i. e. uſurpers, ſhould take care not to make themſelves hated or deſpiſed <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.</note>;</q>
which on his plan and yours, is utterly impracticable. He thinks that of the two
<q>It is better for uſurpers to be feared than beloved by their ſubjects <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.</note>;</q>
in which the ſentiments of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſeem to coincide exactly with his: But then he adviſes—
<q>that if they cannot gain the love, they ſhould avoid at leaſt the hatred of their ſubjects <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</q>
Cruelty and rapine are what generally occaſion the greateſt hatred and deteſtation againſt rulers. With reſpect to theſe, Machiavel ſays—
<q>A new Prince muſt not regard the imputation of cruelty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it is neceſſary to keep his ſubjects in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note n="¶" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.—Yet whoever uſurps the government of a ſtate, ſhould exerciſe what cruelties he thinks neceſſary at once, that he may not be obliged to renew them every day—Matters of this ſort ſhould
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:016311_0073_0F9C2B4F68CA2380"/>
be finiſhed at a blow, that they may give the leſs diſtaſte, and be the ſooner forgotten <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note>. But above all, he muſt take care not to touch the eſtates of his ſubjects; for a man will ſooner forgive the death of a father or a brother than the loſs of his patrimony. Beſides, as pretences for confiſcations are never wanting, when a man once indulges himſelf in rapine of that kind, he ſeldom deſiſts <note n="**" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That Congreſs have not obſerved the caution here recommended on thoſe two points, is evident from the number of confiſcations and executions which we are daily advertiſed of in your own news-papers <note n="††" place="bottom">In a late Boſton paper, the ſentence of perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was denounced on about 300 perſons, among whom were many of the moſt reſpectable inhabitants of Maſſachuſetts-Bay. The perſonal eſtates of about 400 people, heads of families, have been ſold and confiſcated, and their real eſtates ſequeſtered, in that province. In New-Jerſey, the number of eſtates real and perſonal which have been ſold and confiſcated, amounts to about ONE THOUSAND; and in Pennſylvania, the confiſcated eſtates are about 300—at this preſent time. Of theſe things we have almoſt daily accounts in the rebel newſ-papers; according to the greater or leſs degree of violence and perſecuting ſpirit in thoſe who rule in each province, the Loyaliſts, in each, are treated with greater or leſs ſeverity. I have not as yet taken a particular account of thoſe who have been hanged for the CRIME of Loyalty—but they amount to ſeveral hundreds.</note>, and of which we receive the moſt tragical accounts from all quarters by Refugees and others. In this you have therefore <hi>out-machiaveled</hi> even Machiavel himſelf; and I ſubmit it to your ſerious conſideration whether ſuch a conduct is prudent—at leaſt till mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had taken a more deciſive turn in your favour.</p>
            <p>Any candid perſon may now judge whether my aſſertion is not true—viz.—<hi>that there is a remarkable conformity between the conduct of your Congreſs and the rules laid down by Machiavel in his Prince,</hi> except in the articles laſt mentioned. Evidently, you have trod the path which he hath pointed out to uſurpers, and purſued the methods for attaining power which he recommends, as nearly as your ſituation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would admit. I have faithfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:016311_0074_0F9C2B4FF5739418"/>
his words, and fairly repreſented your conduct, without knowingly exaggerating any particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let both be compared, and then let truth and reaſon decide. Dominion was your object, and like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel's <hi>Prince,</hi> or like Agrippina, as characteriſed by the maſterly pen of Tacitus, you held every thing cheap—you ſacrificed every thing for the attainment of it.<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Decus, pudorem, cuncto regno viliora habere. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> 17.</note> In this light you are viewed by Loyaliſts; in this light you are, and will be viewed by the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, virtuous part of mankind, who really know you.</p>
            <p>It is much to be lamented that thoſe execrable methods have too often proved ſucceſsful; and that miſery and ruin have been thereby entailed on milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The artifices of inordinate ambition, ſeconded by the ſimplicity of the multitude, have been an over match for the dictates or truth, the leſſons of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and hiſtory, the remonſtrances of conſcience, and duty to mankind.</p>
            <p>Yet it ſhould not be forgotten that many more have failed, than have ſucceeded, in their attempts at uſurped power. Even Caeſar Borgia, the moſt artful and perſidious of men, and the pattern held up by Machiavel, was utterly ruined at laſt. As the latter part of his hiſtory may he comprized in a few words, and be inſtructive to thoſe who are engaged in purſuits ſimilar to his, I ſhall relate it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:016311_0075_0F9C2B53531479C8"/>Caeſar Borgia, like your Congreſs, entered into an alliance with the French King, LEWIS XII, to conquer the Milaneſe. Soon after, LEWIS made him Duke of Valentinois, and allowed him a penſion. Their joint efforts to ſubjugate the innocent Milaneſe, ſucceeded for a time; but were finally defeated. Borgia, about this time, concerted a ſcheme with his father, Pope Alexander VI. to poiſon nine newly created Cardinals that he might poſſeſs their effects; but the wine, which was prepared for the purpoſe, was, by miſtake, brought to, and drank by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A vigorous conſtitution, and the uſe of antidotes, reſtored Borgia; but Alexander died; and with him ended all Borgia's proſperity. Stripped immediately of his poſſeſſions and wealth, the fruits of his former crimes, he was baniſhed into Spain, and there impriſoned. After two years confinement, he made eſcape out of a window, and fled to Navarre; from whence he wrote to LEWIS, his <hi>great and good Ally,</hi> requeſting aſſiſtance to reſtore his Shattered fortunes. LEWIS, judging it would not be for his intereſt at that time to ſhew Borgia any countenance, not only refuſed to aſſiſt him, but alſo confiſcated his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and withdrew his penſion. Deſpiſed and deteſted by all, he dragged on a miſerable life of dependence, and was finally killed at the battle of Viana, where he ſerved as a volunteer.</p>
            <p>Such was the iſſue of Caeſar Borgia's ambition and perfidy. The puniſhment of his crimes overtook him even here; and Providence, for its own vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and in compaſſion to poor mortals, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibits ſuch examples of juſtice as a warning to others.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE preſent rebellion is one of the moſt ſingular occurrences in the hiſtory of mankind. When any remarkable event, like this, preſents itſelf, the mind is naturally led to aſſign ſome cauſe from which it originated. In accounting for the American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, many have fallen into very great errors, to my certain knowledge; their deciſions were haſty and partial—not the reſult of careful, unbiaſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, but of indolence and prejudice.</p>
            <p>Nations have been often plunged into civil war by the claims of pretenders to the regal authority, or by the impoſition of enormous taxes, or other oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But evidently theſe did not occaſion the preſent
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:016311_0077_0F9C2B558FE01640"/>
rebellion; for no ſuch claim, no ſuch taxes or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions exiſted in America.</p>
            <p>There was not a more free or happy people on earth than the Britiſh coloniſts. Without any taxes, but for the ſupport of their poor—as free from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of any kind as could conſiſt with a ſtate of ſociety, they were daily increaſing in wealth and numbers—daily improving in the arts and embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of civil life; and they had the moſt flattering proſpect of an unchecked progreſs in each of theſe. Yet they have wantonly renounced their rightful and moſt amiable ſovereign. They have not only waged war againſt that ſtate which gave them exiſtence, which always cheriſhed them with parental tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and raiſed them to their late flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, like parricides, they have combined with the inveterate enemies of that ſtate to effect its ruin! Plunging their country, at the ſame time, into the deepeſt calamities, for the avowed purpoſe of eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing an independent republic!</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that clamarous complaints were made of grievances and oppreſſions. But theſe undeniably were made to inflame peoples minds, and ſtimulate them to ſedition. Had the rebellion originated from real grievances, a redreſs of thoſe grievances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly offered on the part of government, had long ſince compoſed our troubles. Ample ſecurity againſt taxation was held out, an accommodation proffered; you contemptuouſly rejected both, and the rebellion went on with the ſame determined malice and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy as before.</p>
            <p>Ambition and a luſt of domination in ſome aſpiring individuals, have moſt frequently produced inteſtine wars. But ſuch men muſt always have proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:016311_0078_0F9C2B55FA9ACEC0"/>
to work upon—there muſt alſo be a particular concurrence of circumſtances to favour their deſigns, or elſe they could not be ſucceſsful. There were periods in the Athenian, Roman and Britiſh hiſtories when <hi>Piſiſtratus, Catiline</hi> or <hi>Cromwell</hi> could not have carried their deſigns into execution. The venal and verſatile diſpoſition of the Athenians proved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the firſt; the abandoned profligacy which reigned at Rome promoted the dark purpoſes of the ſecond; and the prevalence of enthuſiaſm and repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican principles in Britain, contributed to raiſe the laſt to deſpotiſm: Had not republican, Democratic principles been as prevalent in America as they were then in Britain, your Congreſs had not attained their preſent uſurped power.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſome of your European friends have aſſerted that neither the Congreſs, nor their adherents were tinctured with republicaniſm. But you very juſtly laughed at the folly of men who thus judged without knowledge, and decided without examination. You owed them no thanks for their officious zeal, ſince every part of your conduct gave the lie to their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and on their ſcheme, the whole of your procedure would be ridiculouſly prepoſterous and contradictory. The principles which you publiſhed to the world, and on which you attempted to juſtify your rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were perfectly democratic: Swarms of zealots ſtarted up in every province to vindicate thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and carry your meaſures into execution— meaſures directly calculated to eſtabliſh a republic, and baniſh every veſtige of monarchy—and meaſures to which you have ſince invariably adhered. After this, to deny that the American rebels were infected with republicaniſm, is at once a violation of truth, an inſult on our underſtanding, and an injury to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:016311_0079_0F9C2B57333B7E68"/>What thoſe cauſes were, whether local, political, or religious, which diffuſed a ſpirit of democracy through America—who were moſt infected with it, and conſequently, your moſt zealous partizans— what the circumſtances which prepared the way, or ſerved to inflame the rebellion, are points which I ſhall not enlarge on. They are pretty well known, and the diſcuſſion of them is foreign to my deſign. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay—that as matters were ſituated in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, ſome ſuch convulſion as the preſent was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, ſooner or later. All judicious men here expected it. Deep rooted republicaniſm, democratic, levelling principles, ever unfriendly to monarchy, had ſpread their baneful influence far and wide. Actuated by theſe, your adherents were diſpoſed to revolt: The ambition, artifice, and duplicity of the Congreſs did the reſt. From theſe combined cauſes ſprung this moſt deteſtable rebellion; neither of which ſingly had been adequate to ſuch an effect. I ſhall only add on this ſubject, that the particulars which ſome have falſly aſſigned as cauſes of the rebellion, were no more than circumſtances<note n="*" place="bottom">Such as the <hi>three penny</hi> duty on tea, ſome acts of parliament which were complained of here, and have been moſtly repealed, the oppoſition to government by the minority, on the part of Britain; and on this ſide of the Atlantic, the practice of ſmuggling, the hopes of defrauding creditors in Britain, and an apprehenſion in the coloniſts that they would be taxed beyond their due proportion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that haſtened matters to a criſis. They only contributed to kindle the flame, and ſet fire to a train, which had been laid for many years.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen in my laſt, the methods you purſued to ſubvert the beſt of civil conſtitutions, and eſtabliſh your new tyrannical ſyſtem. The effects of your
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:016311_0080_0F9C2B57853A97B0"/>
ambition, and of thoſe <hi>Machiavelian</hi> methods, come next to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Were the moſt abandoned uſurper—not even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Caeſar Borgia, or any member of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs—to foreſee all the evils, all the direful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his ambitious purſuits, I believe he would be petrified with horror, and ſtand aghaſt. There was certainly a time, when you, Sir, would have ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the calamities which you are now inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in accumulating on this devoted country. But you ſeem to be ſteeled pretty well againſt ſuch qualms at preſent, and have given them to the winds.</p>
            <p>America now groans under all the complicated miſeries which civil war, that ſevereſt ſcourge which incenſed Heaven can inflict on a guilty people, is capable of producing. Her provinces are filled with diſcord, animoſity and inhuman murders. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is ruined, induſtry and uſeful arts are drooping, and nearly extinguiſhed. Scenes of deſolation—of the deepeſt diſtreſs are every were to be ſeen. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who lived in eaſe and affluence are reduced to the loweſt ebb of poverty; or baniſhed from their once happy and peaceful habitations. The orphan's and the widow's tears are mingled with thoſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted parents, for their reſpective relatives, cut off by the deſtroying ſword. Thoſe who ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in offices of mutual tenderneſs, are ſtimulated by hoſtile rage againſt each other: Not only ſubject warring againſt fellow ſubject; but parent and child, brother and brother ſtand forth to ſhed each other's blood.</p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, are the fruits of your ambition! Theſe the effects of your uſurpation! Yet not content with theſe, you are reſolved to ſpread the circle of human
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:016311_0081_0F9C2B583A00F020"/>
woe ſtill wider; and maintain this unnatural conteſt, till the meaſure of this country's ruin is compleated!</p>
            <p>But that your <hi>merits</hi> and zeal for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of America, may be more conſpicuous, it will be proper to take a nearer view of what ſhe hath ſuffered, what loſſes ſhe hath ſuſtained by your efforts to <hi>ſave</hi> her.</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs over the malignant effects of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion on the morals of the people—Your horrid proſtitution of oaths—Compelling men to abjure their rightful Sovereign, and ſwear allegiance to you, contrary to the dictates of conſcience, or elſe be deprived of all their property or hanged. A more effectual method perhaps could not be deviſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh all ſenſe of duty and obligation, unhinge ſociety, and make mankind a ſet of unprincipled villains. I leave the diſcuſſion of thoſe matters to Divines—to ſuch I mean, has have not kicked the Goſpel out of their pulpits, nor ſubſtituted news-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and politics in its place.</p>
            <p>SIR WILLIAM PETTY, in his <hi>Political Anatomy of Ireland,</hi> has made an eſtimate of the loſſes ſuſtained by that Kingdom, during the great rebellion which began in 1641. His method is to rate at a certain va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the lives that were loſt, the houſes, cattle, &amp;c. that were deſtroyed, the decreaſe of rents and value of lands, the expence of armies, &amp;c. I ſhall follow the method pointed out by this acute and ingenious ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in eſtimating the loſſes of this continent by your rebellion, without knowingly exaggerating any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. It is impoſſible to be perfectly exact and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate in ſuch calculations. No more is to be expected than that we ſhould come as near the truth as we can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:016311_0082_0F9C2B58F73B6780"/>The number of American inhabitants, natives of this country and emigrants from Europe, who have periſhed by the ſword, or by hardſhips and ſickneſs occaſioned by the war; of thoſe who have removed to Europe and will not return, and conſequently are loſt to America, together with the multitudes you have hanged, and whoſe death you have occaſioned by confinement and other cruelties—The number of all theſe, I ſay, at a very moderate eſtimate, cannot be leſs than 70,000. In political calculations, the value of men, women and children, above a century ago in England, was ſtated at £.70 ſterling each, one with another. The comparative value of money was then greater than it is now, and conſequently, the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould now be higher; eſpecially as men only, who generally were in the vigour of life, are included in the above eſtimate. But to avoid the ſuſpicion of exaggeration, I ſhall fix it at £.70. The loſs of America therefore, by theſe 70,000 men, is £. 4,900,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>The rapid population of America was principally owing to the great number of emigrants who came from Europe. For twenty years immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 1775, the number of emigrants annually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, taking one year with another, was not leſs than 4000; but emigrations have ceaſed ſince that year, that is, for four years paſt, ſince the rebellion commenced; conſequently the emigrants for that ſpace, amounting to 16,000, ſhould be ſet down as ſo much loſs to America. Reckoning theſe at the ſame valuation as theſe in the laſt article, the ſum will be £. 1,120,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>About a twelve month ſince, your emiſſions of paper money, by your own confeſſion, amounted to
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:016311_0083_0F9C2B59C8CB4050"/>
               <hi>One Hundred and Twenty Millions of Dollars</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Since this letter was firſt printed, a very ſenſible writer, under the ſignature of <hi>An American Loyaliſt,</hi> aſſerts that,
<q>the emiſſions already iſſued by Congreſs, and now in circulation, amount to upwards of <hi>Three Hundred Millions of Dollars,</hi>
                  </q>
and he "dares the Congreſs to diſprove his aſſertion." This Gentleman ſeems to be well informed, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived authentic intelligence on this ſubject, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs have laboured to keep ſecret. They have uſed every method in their power to conceal from the Americans the ſums which they have emitted from time to time; and yet ſurely the people who are ſaddled with this enormous debt, ſhould know ſomething of the matter. But this procedure is ſimilar to the reſt of their conduct. I am inclined to believe the <hi>American Layaliſt</hi>'s aſſertion is true; and inſtead of £. 45,000,000 ſterling, which I ſet down for this article, the ſum ſhould be £. 67,5<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0,000 ſterling.</note>. If to this ſum, your expenditure ſince that time, be added; if to theſe again be joined your bills of credit now in circulation, and the expence of the preſent campaign, which to you will probably be the moſt expenſive of any, I may ſafely aver, that the whole will amount at leaſt to <hi>Two Hundred Millions of Dollars</hi>—It muſt greatly exceed that ſum, for which you have mortgaged every eſtate in America. Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning a dollar at 4s. 6d. ſterling, Two Hundred Million of Dollars are equal to £.45,000,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>I am credibly informed that Congreſs have lately acknowledged their debt to France to be £. 4,000,000 ſterling, for which alſo they have mortgaged every eſtate in America. This debt ſhould therefore be ſet down as a loſs to this country.</p>
            <p>Since the commencement of this unnatural war, the houſes that have been deſtroyed in the provinces of Maſſachuſett's Bay, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, and Virginia, cannot be fewer than 3500: In the Province of New-York only, 2000 have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:016311_0084_0F9C2B5C8AE15AC8"/>
Thoſe houſes, one with another, may be valued at £.150 ſterling. The whole then will amount to £. 520,000 ſterling <note n="*" place="bottom">Of thoſe Houſes, about 1600 were burnt by the Rebels, viz. At New-York, Long-Iſland, and Norfolk in Virginia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome other places. The King's troops burnt no houſes but thoſe from which they were fired at by the Rebels, as was the caſe at Charles-Town, near Boſton, and Kingſton, on Hudſon's River, both which might contain about 700 houſes, and were the only towns burnt by the Britiſh army. In every province that was the ſeat of war, many houſes were otherwiſe deſtroyed by both parties. The houſes of ſeveral ſettlements along the frontiers, have been burnt by the Indians; and the Rebels have retaliated on the Indians, by burning and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of their ſettlements.</note>.</p>
            <p>The cattle and ſtock of all kinds, and proviſions which have been deſtroyed in the courſe of the war, cannot be eſtimated at leſs than £. 200,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>The injury done to farms, the fences and timber deſtroyed, will certainly amount to £. 150,000 ſterl.</p>
            <p>Great numbers of negroes have been killed, or run away, ſo as to be loſt to their maſters. According to the uſual price of negroes, theſe may be valued at 50l. Sterling each; and the number of thoſe kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and run away, as above, may juſtly be reckoned 5000. For this article I may therefore ſet down 25,000l. Sterling.</p>
            <p>By a decree of your Congreſs, all exports from the <hi>thirteen</hi> revolted colonies, were ſtopped in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1775; from which time till this preſent month, June 1779, three years and eight months have elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The exports for that period, ſhould therefore be accounted as loſt to America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:016311_0085_0F9C2B5DF315CA10"/>If it ſhould be objected,
<q>That when Farmers did not export their grain, produce or other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of commerce, they could diſpoſe of them at home—that conſiderable exports were made to France and the Weſt-Indies, for which the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans received articles in return from thoſe plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer—that by prohibiting exportation, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of all produce and articles of commerce unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſunk; they muſt either remain on hand, or be ſold for Congreſs money, which is good for little or nothing. The exports to France and the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were very trifling; and the returns for them were chiefly ammunition, arms, cannon and military ſtores, which are of no uſe to the farmers of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and have been made the engines of their ruin. The few beneficial articles imported, ſuch as cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſugars, &amp;c. ſold at ſuch enormous prices— ſometimes <hi>at five hundred per cent.</hi>—but ofteneſt at <hi>five thouſand per cent.</hi>—that it can ſcarcely be ſaid, the Americans derived any advantage from them. That this is the ſenſe of the people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is evident from this circumſtance, that hardly any farmers raiſe more grain or other produce than what is barely neceſſary for the conſumption of their own families; and many of the moſt profitable arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of commerce are wholly laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Let me add, that the loſs of ſhipping, of intereſt upon money, of the labour of thoſe who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in your armies, and the decreaſe of the value of lands, without any advances towards ſettling the weſtern wilderneſs, are articles of great importance, for which I have ſet down nothing. Theſe however ſhould be conſidered, and will more than balance your illicit trade with France and the Weſt-Indies,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:016311_0086_0F9C2B5F457E20C0"/>
and the ſale of commercial articles at home. I may therefore aver, that the exports which could have been made during the above period, ſhould be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as ſo much loſs to the colonies. Indeed the feelings of the coloniſts will not permit them to doubt it.

HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS STERLING, has America loſt by the preſent rebellion! By ſo much is ſhe now poorer, than ſhe would have been, if this rebellion had not happened. I am perſuaded that many of thoſe articles are under-rated, and am not conſcious that any one of them is above the truth. I have allowed nothing for the pay and other expences of your armies, as theſe were defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with continental money, the credit of which is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievably ſunk, and is ſo much loſt to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Its pernicious conſequences will be ſenſibly felt by all the coloniſts; but they will be peculiarly ruinous to helpleſs widows and orphans.</p>
            <p>Now, for what has all this profuſe waſte of blood and treaſure been made?—For ſake of overturning the beſt of civil conſtitutions! For ſake of a nominal independency, which, if eſtabliſhed, would be more deſtructive to this continent, for ages to come, than even the preſent rebellion has been! For ſake of a ruinous alliance with France, the enemy of liberty and proteſtantiſm—of the honour of M. <hi>Gerard</hi>'s company for a few months, and that the Congreſs might bear ſway over theſe deſolated provinces!</p>
            <p>Whilſt mentioning the effects of your rebellion, the diſgraceful, wretched ſtate of France ſhould not be paſſed over. As ſhe ſhared in your guilt, ſo hath ſhe deſervedly and deeply ſhared in your calamities. France, in the time of profound peace with Britain, amidſt the moſt ſolemn profeſſions of friendſhip, and without even the pretence of provocation, took part in your rebellion, and ſent over a large fleet here to attack the power with which ſhe was at peace! Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hovering a few months on this coaſt, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing but to proclaim the perfidy of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>D'Eſtaing</hi> retreated to the Weſt-Indies. There,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:016311_0088_0F9C2B6075FB59E8"/>
one of the French iſlands was taken under his eye; and his own fleet blocked up at Martinico, without daring to venture out to ſea. The French Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia trade is nearly ruined. The French fiſheries at Newfoundland are annihilated—Pondicherry, the only place of any conſequence which France poſſeſſed in the Eaſt-Indies, is wreſted from her, and her Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia company and trade totally ruined. Her trade in Europe is in little better plight—her merchant ſhips taken, her fleets blocked up, her merchants bankrupt, her government without credit at home or abroad, and covered with indelible infamy, A juſt reward this of her perfidy! May all who act in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious manner, meet with a like fate!</p>
            <p>I ſhould now examine what your preſent ſtate and proſpects are; but as this would require too much time, I ſhall defer it to my next; and ſhall only add, for the preſent, ſome reflections of the excellent Mr. ADDISON on the nature and guilt of rebellion.— You cannot ſuſpect him of partiality to <hi>Tories,</hi> or of being diſaffected to the Congreſs. You may therefore ſafely attend to his ſentiments, and allow them their juſt weight—they are very applicable to the preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>"That rebellion is one of the moſt heinous crimes which it is in the power of man to commit, ſays this admired writer, may appear from ſeveral conſiderations. Firſt, as it deſtroys the end of all government, and the benefits of civil ſociety. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was inſtituted for maintaining the peace, ſafety and happineſs of a people. Theſe great ends are brought about by a general conformity and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that frame of laws which is eſtabliſhed in every community, for the protection of the innocent, and the puniſhment of the guilty. As on the one
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:016311_0089_0F9C2B614B0FF090"/>
ſide, men are ſecured in the quiet poſſeſſion of their lives, properties and every thing they have a right to: So on the other ſide, thoſe who offer them any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in theſe particulars, are ſubject to penalties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to their offences. Government therefore mitigates the inequality of power among particular perſons, and makes an innocent man, though of the loweſt rank, a match for the mightieſt of his fellow-ſubjects; ſince he has the force of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity on his ſide, which is able to controul the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence or injuſtice of any oppreſſor.—Now rebellion diſappoints all theſe benefits of government, by raiſing a power in oppoſition to that authority which has been eſtabliſhed among a people for their mutual welfare. So that rebellion is as great an evil to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as government itſelf is a bleſſing."</p>
            <p>"In the next place, rebellion is a violation of all thoſe engagements which every government exacts from ſuch perſons as live under it; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the moſt baſe and pernicious inſtance of treachery and perſidiouſneſs. The guilt of rebellion increaſes in proportion as theſe engagements are ſolemn and obligatory. Thus if a man makes his way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion through perjury, he gives additional horror to that crime which is in itſelf of the blackeſt nature."</p>
            <p>"We may likewiſe conſider rebellion as a greater complication of wickedneſs than any other crime we can commit. It is big with rapine, ſacrilege and murder. It is dreadful in its mildeſt effects, as it impoveriſhes the public; ruins particular families; begets and perpetuates hatreds among fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, friends and relations; makes a country the ſeat of war and deſolation, and expoſes it to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of its foreign enemies. In ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is impoſſible for it to take effect, or to make the ſmalleſt
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:016311_0090_0F9C20656E615250"/>
progreſs, but through a continued courſe of violence and bloodſhed, a robber or a murderer looks like an innocent man, when we compare him with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel."</p>
            <p>What a contraſt is there between theſe ſentiments, and thoſe of Machiavel, quoted in my laſt! In the former, we are warned of the guilt and ruinous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of rebellion and uſurpation, and diſſuaded from the perpetration of ſuch crimes: In the latter, men are ſtimulated to uſurpation, and the methods are taught by which their crimes may be crowned with ſucceſs. Addiſon, like one of thoſe pure intelligences that are delegated by infinite wiſdom to ſuperintend the government of the univerſe, would diffuſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, peace, harmony and happineſs among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Machiavel, like a dark friend, that delighted in human miſery, would ſubvert all order, lead men to the commiſſion of the greateſt enormities, and ſpread devaſtation and ruin throughout the earth.</p>
            <p>It were needleſs for me to ſay which of <hi>theſe</hi> it is that your Congreſs have liſtned to—<hi>whoſe</hi> precepts they have practiſed. The uſurpation and rebellion which now diſgrace America, with all their conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant train of evils—tyranny, bloodſhed, deſolation, &amp;c. will not ſuffer us to doubt that Machiavel's leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been reduced to practice on this Continent.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING briefly pointed out in my laſt, the cauſes which produced this unnatural Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and the effects of it, particularly the loſſes which America hath ſuſtained, I now wait on you to examine the preſent ſtate and proſpects of the Congreſs.</p>
            <p>You have invaded the rights, and trampled on the authority of your Sovereign—You have ſported with the lives, property and happineſs of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects—You have diffuſed wretchedneſs and miſery through this once flouriſhing country—and have employed every artifice of deceit, duplicity and violence—to attain your preſent uſurped power: What this ſituation, for which you have ſacrificed ſo much, now promiſes—what the probable iſſue of thoſe enormities will be, are queſtions in which you and every Britiſh ſubject muſt be deeply intereſted.</p>
            <p>Your Congreſs have kindly ſtepped forth to aſſiſt me in this inquiry. Your Addreſs <hi>to the Inhabitants of the United States,</hi> dated the 26th of laſt May, gives a gloomy picture of your affairs, and contains repreſentations which would be deemed by your partizans as the reſult of malignity, had they been made by me. I hope they will pay the more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:016311_0092_0F9C205AEE42C600"/>
to what I ſhall now ſay, as it has the ſuffrage of the Congreſs to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to examine minutely the whole of this Addreſs. I ſhall paſs over your uſual cant—your proſtitution of ſcripture—your ſophiſtry, and artful application to the paſſions of the people, by which you would cajole and reconcile them to their deſtruction. I ſhall content myſelf with offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few ſtrictures on ſuch parts as tend to elucidate the ſubject before us.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that ſtrikes me, is, the remarkable difference, as to your hopes of ſucceſs, between this Addreſs, and your <hi>Obſervations on the American Revolution</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This pamphlet is perhaps one of the moſt extraordinary that has appeared during the preſent conteſt. It was drawn up by a Committee of the Congreſs, and publiſhed by their authority. The greateſt part of it conſiſts of extracts from former addreſſes and other publications of the Congreſs; but "having the fear of M. Gerard before them," they have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly avoided that paſſage in their Addreſs to the people of Great-Britain, dated September 5, 1774, where the Congreſs tell their loving Friends and fellow Subjects,
<q>nor can we ſuppreſs our aſtoniſhment, that a Britiſh Parliament ſhould ever conſent to eſtabliſh in that country (Canada) a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (meaning Popery) which has deluged your Iſland in blood, and diſperſed impiety, bigotry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſecution, murder and rebellion through every part of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The apparent deſign of the Congreſs in the "Obſervations," was to counteract the tendency of the papers which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the Britiſh Commiſſioners and the Congreſs, and were publiſhed by the former previous to their departure hence, and reconcile the Americans to the criminal conduct of the Congreſs, in rejecting the liberal overtures of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an accommodation. A judgment may be formed of this pamphlet from the following particulars.—</p>
                  <p>It aſſerts, that the firſt Britiſh
<q>Adventurers to America, were in a ſtate of nature, alike free either to ſubmit to a ſociety exiſting, or to eſtabliſh one, as their inclination or intereſt might prompt— that they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> independent conſtitutions,—that ſtimulated by their neceſſities, and ſeduced by antient habits, they were prevailed on to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to the King of England, in conſequence of his ſolemn promiſe to afford them protection,—that the Britiſh Colonies were in fact ſo many independent ſtates, whoſe only political connection with each other, and with the ſeveral parts of the Britiſh empire, was by means of a common Sovereign.</q>
Page 2.3.</p>
                  <p>Had the Congreſs declared, that
<q>they were the children of the Sun, and ſent by their beneficent parent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and reclaim the Coloniſts,</q>
as MANCO CAPAC and MAMA OCOLLO declared to the Peruvians, it would not be a jot more fabulous or contrary to truth, than theſe aſſertions. It is aſtoniſhing how any men could have the effrontery to obtrude ſuch palpable falſehoods on the world, when there are ſo many hiſtories of theſe Colonies which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them. The Britiſh Colonies were ſettled under charters, thoſe charters were granted by the King, and ſpecified the civil conſtitutions of the Colonies reſpectively—the emigrants were as much ſubjects of the Britiſh Crown, as dependent on the ſupreme legiſlature of the empire, 'after,' as 'before', their emigration; and ſome of thoſe charters explicitly recognize the right of the Britiſh Parliament to tax the Colonies—But to proceed with the pamphlet—</p>
                  <p>It inſinuates, and would perſuade the world, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of his Majeſty's inſtructions to Sir HENRY CLINTON, authorizing Sir HENRY to ratify the Convention of Sarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, and which Sir HENRY tranſmitted to the Congreſs, was a FORGERY,
<q>that it had a fraudulent complexion— that it is very poſſible no ſuch letter, as the Secretary's of State containing thoſe inſtructions, was ever written, that we cannot argue againſt ſuch deceit from the baſeneſs of it; for thoſe who would do the many treacherous acts they had committed during the war—could hardly boggle at the ſending as an extract from a Secretary of States letter what really was not ſuch an extract.</q>

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:016311_0094_0F9C2063B67AD6A0"/>
brought to a concluſion:</q>
The Addreſs tells us that thoſe efforts are multiplied,—it evidently ſpeaks the language of deſpondency, and ſuggeſts the idea of a <hi>laſt ſpeech.</hi> You bid us indeed—"not think you deſpair of the Commonwealth;" but you manifeſtly betray deſpair—juſt as the tremor and agitation of a culprit betrays his guilt, though he loudly declares his innocence. From your own repreſentation of matters, it is impoſſible for any unprejudiced perſon to think otherwiſe than that your cauſe is deſperate. The truth is, your circumſtances are greatly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and your language is changed with them.</p>
            <p>After mentioning
<q>the great and increaſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation of your currency, and the miſchiefs that have flowed from it,</q>
you enumerate ſeveral cauſes, to which that depreciation, you think, was owing—ſuch as
<q>frequent emiſſions, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſums, emitted, the artifices of men who enrich themſelves, by monopolizing the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life, the miſconduct of inferior officers in the public ſervice, and farmers raiſing the price of their produce.</q>
But you have thought proper to conceal other cauſes which have contributed more than any of theſe to the depreciation of your currency—theſe are the fluctuating ſtate of your affairs, of your uſurped power, and the deſpotiſm of your government.</p>
            <p>Paper currency is the ſign or repreſentation of money, as money is, by general conſent, the ſign or repreſentation of all merchandize, of all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatever. Money, <hi>i. e.</hi> gold and ſilver, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:016311_0095_0F9C20660F229E58"/>
of merchandize, mutually repreſent each other. Hence, money has ah intrinſic value—this value is not impaired by any accident, by the moſt violent ſhocks of war; carry it to any part of the globe, its value will be acknowledged.</p>
            <p>The caſe of paper currency is totally different.— Having no <hi>intrinſic</hi> value, its credit and <hi>nominal</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue wholly depend on the ſecurity by which it is ſupported. Take away that ſecurity, and like an edifice whoſe foundation is removed, it inſtantly ſinks. If a man can have money at all times for his paper currency or bills, ſo far the currency is good, and anſwers the purpoſe of money. If moderately emitted, the credit of currency may alſo be provided for by taxes in times of peace and ſecurity; for in ſuch caſes the whole community is engaged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its credit, and can fulfil the engagement. This credit however at beſt can only be <hi>local,</hi> differing eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in this reſpect from money, which hath an intrinſic value, and is therefore univerſally received. Let me add, that it is in free and mild governments only that paper currency can maintain its credit. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny produces diſtruſt and unhinges ſecurity; theſe muſt neceſſarily deſtroy public credit. Thus it is obſerved, that in deſpotic ſtates, even money diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. Men frequently bury their money, as the only way to ſecure it; and thus many of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt Americans, when the deſpotiſm of the Congreſs commenced, actually buried their money and plate, and large quantities of each lie buried, to this day, without the Britiſh lines.</p>
            <p>The above obſervations are very plain and obvious, and I think incontrovertibly true. They will aſſiſt in accounting for the downfal of your currency. The firſt reaſon you aſſign for its depreciation, is certainly a good one. The ſums you emitted were
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:016311_0096_0F9C2066CBB62F28"/>
ſo enormouſly large, that all the taxable property of the revolted colonies was inſufficient to ſupport their credit; conſequently, the credit of that currency muſt inevitably ſink.</p>
            <p>But if it be farther conſidered, that thoſe monſtrous emiſſions had no legal ſupport—that the authority on which they reſted, was uſurped and conteſted—that the ſword of juſtice hung over thoſe who emitted the currency, and their power was utterly precarious and fluctuating—that their government was an uſurped tyranny which flung every thing into confuſion, and filled every breaſt with anxiety and diſtruſt: When theſe particulars are conſidered, the wonder is not that your currency ſhould be ſo much depreciated; but that it ſhould have any value whatever— Nothing but the bayonet has ſupported the ſmall degree of credit it hath hitherto retained; but that violent expedient can no longer afford it credit— it is irreparably ſunk, and paſt your power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve it.</p>
            <p>You very unkindly throw the blame of this diſaſter on others—on monopolizers, the miſconduct of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that is, in plain Engliſh, on peculators, who have robbed the public, and on farmers who raiſed the price of their produce. With reſpect to farmers, the accuſation is unjuſt, and a mere blunder of your own. It is miſtaking the effect for the cauſe. The currency did not ſink becauſe the farmer raiſed the price of his produce; but he therefore raiſed his produce, becauſe the credit of your currency had ſunk. And pray what is there unjuſt or unreaſonable in this? Why does the farmer toil and ſweat, but that he may enjoy the fruits of his labour? If your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency hath ſunk to a <hi>thirtieth</hi> part of its nominal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, is it unjuſt or unreaſonable in the farmer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:016311_0097_0F9C20678F253668"/>
               <hi>thirty</hi> times as much of that currency for any article as it formerly coſt?</p>
            <p>As to peculators and monopolizers, I have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with you. I believe you have juſt reaſon to complain of them. The large fortunes amaſſed by many of your dependents and partizans, ſufficiently evince your complaints to be well grounded. I could name a Pr—ſb-t—an Parſon, not many leagues from this city, who was not worth a groat when this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion began; but being a flaming patriot and friend of the Congreſs, he was put into the Commiſſary's department; and it is affirmed that he hath already realized an eſtate of 25,000l. reckoning a dollar at 8s.—this is only one inſtance out of very, very many that I could mention.</p>
            <p>But I am not pleaſed with the Congreſs for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting to ſhift the blame from themſelves in this matter, when they are chiefly guilty, and throw it on others. You ſtigmatize and accuſe others of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; but, are you innocent and ſpotleſs your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Mr. <hi>Deane</hi>'s publications, and others which they gave riſe to, induce the world to think you are not quite immaculate. The large eſtates now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by members of the Congreſs, who we <hi>know</hi> were bankrupts when they took their ſeats in that <hi>auguſt aſſembly</hi> heighten people's ſuſpicions. Nay, ſome do not heſitate to aver that the Congreſs have been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with French gold; for that nothing elſe can account for their adherence to France, contrary to every dictate of reaſon and duty—every principle of proteſtantiſm and good policy, and to the manifeſt intereſt of America. Nor are theſe ſuſpicions in the leaſt diminiſhed by a certain tranſaction which ſome of your members took ſpecial care to make public, and from which they affected to derive great merit,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:016311_0098_0F9C20685138FF20"/>
as if they were above corruption and bribery. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more frequent with deſigning men than to ſeize little incidents, and by their help lay in a ſtock of merit with the ſimple populace, at a cheap rate, to be employed on future occaſions, and turned to their own advantage. Hereby they think to act with more ſecurity, and indulge with leſs ſuſpicion in that very vice they ſeemed coy in admitting—juſt like ſome termagant females, who proſecute one man for a rape, whilſt they invite and run into the lewd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of another.</p>
            <p>But to leave thoſe matters which, I preſume, are among the "reproaches that are peculiar to you," as you tell the Americans, and advert to things which are unqueſtionably acknowledged. You ſay, by way of apology, that
<q>emitting paper money was an expedient which had been before frequently and ſucceſsfully practiſed on this continent.</q>
Very true—but you will pleaſe to remember that thoſe emiſſions were comparatively ſmall; and they had all the ſecurity that the Legiſlature, of which the King is an eſſential part, could give to ſupport their credit. Hence they derived ſtability and value, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſired purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now, are theſe caſes parallel? You know they are not—they differ in every material circumſtance. Your emiſſions were ſo immoderately large, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies were unable to ſupport their credit; they were iſſued in direct oppoſition to the King's authority, and in the midſt of tumults, when no adequate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity could poſſibly be given; their depreciation therefore was unavoidable. All this you knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, yet you daily emitted new ſums—each ſucceſſive emiſſion exceeding the one that preceded. Are not you then changeable with all the miſchiefs
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:016311_0099_0F9C2069D42DC580"/>
flowing from this diſaſter? In a word, your currency had its birth from rebellion, its ſupport from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and it muſt end in the ruin of thouſands, who will juſtly lay that ruin to the account of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
            <p>But in order to cheer the ſpirits of your partizans, you mention an expedient by which your currency may be retrieved; and that is <hi>Taxation.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you demand, with very little ceremony, the ſum of <hi>forty-five million of dollars,</hi> from the Coloniſts, in addition to <hi>fifteen millions</hi> which were demanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and both ſums amounting to <hi>ſixty millions of dollars,</hi> and equal to <hi>thirteen millions of pounds ſterl.</hi> are to be paid within the current year. This is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a vengeance! Such a demand by the French King, arbitrary as he is, from 16 millions of vaſſals, would throw France into convulſions.</p>
            <p>But hereby the credit of your currency is to be raiſed! Perhaps this is one of the groſſeſt impoſitions which the Congreſs have yet played off on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded vaſſals. Suppoſing this immenſe ſum were actually levied and paid in, will the quantity of your currency be leſs at the year's end, than when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan? No—the expenditure of the preſent year will require more than thoſe <hi>ſixty millions of dollars</hi>; and muſt not the money be ſtruck to anſwer that expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture, being immediately wanted? How great your expence muſt be, let any one judge, when you are obliged frequently to give 500l. to a man for ſerving in your army a few months.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing however that your debts and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of your currency ſhould not be greater, Jan. 1, 1780, than they were, Jan. 1, 1779; yet remember, the taxable property of your ſubjects will be greatly
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:016311_0100_0F9C206B1E306C90"/>
diminiſhed. Two of your <hi>States,</hi> I may ſay, are already gone; ſhould the other <hi>eleven</hi> even remain in your hands, which is not a very clear point, yet the ravages of war will certainly thin their inhabitants and deſtroy much property. Here then your debts and the quantity of your currency will continue the ſame, whilſt your ability to diſcharge the one and ſupport the other, will be very much diminiſhed. Even now, your currency, like an execrated thing, is ſhunned by all who can avoid it; at the cloſe of the current year, a Congreſs dollar will probably have no more value than a common rag of equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.</p>
            <p>To conſole your partizans ſtill further, you tell them,—
<q>the conduct of one Monarch, the Friend and protector of the rights of mankind, has turned the ſcale ſo much, that all the viſionary ſchemes of your gigantic adverſary,</q>
meaning your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, "have vaniſhed." In truth, Sir, conſidering the miſchiefs you have brought on France, it is a pity to quarrel with you for affording her ſome kind and gracious words, ſince you can give her no more. Yet it is worth obſerving how the Congreſs are fated to unite in themſelves the moſt glaring contradictions —profeſſing to be the patrons of liberty, candour and republicaniſm, they exhauſt our language in fulſom adulation to the moſt ambitious, reſtleſs and faithleſs Monarchy in chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>Whoever is acquainted with the hiſtory of France, muſt know, that to the efforts of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> ſhe owes her loſs of liberty, and the deſpotiſm of her monarchs; and that the maxims of that Machiavelian ſtateſman are thoſe by which the conduct of her government has been regulated ſince his time. Amongſt thoſe maxims, <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi> a Frenchman, tells us, the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016311_0101_0F9C206B49E1B190"/>
following is one—
<q>If there ſhould chance to be ſome unlucky honeſt man among the people, Cardinal Richlieu in his political teſtament ſeems to hint that a Prince ſhould take care not to employ him <note n="*" place="bottom">Spirit of Laws, Book III. Chap. 5.</note>.</q>
How far this maxim was adhered to in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your French <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> or in that of the <hi>Admiral</hi> who was ſent to your aſſiſtance, I ſhall not determine—you can beſt judge. Probably, this may have alſo become a faſhionable maxim with you.</p>
            <p>France, by the very act in which ſhe engaged to be your ally, announced her perfidy in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to remove all juſt confidence in her friendſhip. She would as ſoon break her treaty with you as with Britain, if ſhe could gain by it; and you muſt be conſcious, that it was not from affection to you or to the rights of mankind, but to ſerve her own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious purpoſes, that ſhe joined in your cauſe. By duplicity, intrigue, perfidy and violence, France has gained more provinces in Europe than you had to beſtow in America; and ſhe gained them without a claim half ſo plauſible as you gave her to the <hi>Thirteen United States.</hi> Burgundy, Alſace, the Netherlands &amp;c. &amp;c. can fully teſtify this, as well as the poor <hi>Corſicans</hi> within, our memory, who were ſold to France by their late republican maſters and tyrants. The Corſicans and French Proteſtants will, doubtleſs, join heartily in your panegyric.</p>
            <p>What you can rationally expect from France at preſent, is beyond my comprehenſion. She is unable to protect her own trade or foreign ſettlements, how then can ſhe protect or aſſiſt you? She cannot lend you money, for ſhe has it not to lend; and even
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:016311_0102_0F9C206E2FA73418"/>
your bills on France have been proteſted. Her King's palaces and gardens are going to ruins for want of money to repair them. The Agents of France are ſoliciting loans for the ſupport of her preſent arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in every neighbouring ſtate that has money to ſpare; yet her credit is ſo low, that they can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure a ſingle liyre. If you think, at leaſt, that ſuch a diverſion will be made by the French war, that this continent will be neglected by Britain, and you permitted to eſtabliſh your independency, you will find yourſelves egregiouſly miſtaken. The war with France will be principally on that element, where Britain confeſſedly ſurpaſſes any power in the world, in ſtrength, dexterity and ſkill. She can line this coaſt with ſhips of war, and ſtill retain a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force to cruſh the naval power of France. Your ally, for his own preſervation, muſt abandon you, and leave you to your fate. With all the infamy of a French faction, yet without French aſſiſtance, you muſt ſtruggle againſt your "gigantic adverſary;" who, beſides ſuperior ſtrength, has right and juſtice on his ſide, and the cauſe of liberty and the proteſtant religion to animate his exertions.</p>
            <p>Your paper currency and the French alliance were the principal ſupports of your rebellion. I have therefore dwelt the longer on them. In ſhewing the credit of the one to be irretrievably loſt, and the other to be of no advantage, but dangerous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful in the higheſt degree, I have ſo far pointed out your preſent ſtate. I now proceed to other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which ſhall be briefly diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>Before I enter on theſe, give me leave to inform you that Britain will not give up this conteſt, nor abandon America. Whatever hopes of this kind you may have entertained, whatever reports to this
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016311_0103_0F9C206F9399CE98"/>
purpoſe you have propagated to buoy up the ſpirits of your partizans, be aſſured they were falſe and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Britain is <hi>determined</hi> to aſſert her juſt claim, and ſhe will contend as earneſtly for her American colonies, as ſhe would for any county in England, were it invaded—ſet this down therefore as an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable truth.</p>
            <p>Your hopes of foreign loans are by this time va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. France cannot, Holland or Spain will not lend you money. In conjunction with France, you have endeavoured to drag Spain into the war. But the preſent diſtracted ſtate of the Spaniſh government is an effectual bar to it. Beſides, every maxim of ſound policy, every dictate of common ſenſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids Spain to countenance your rebellion —it would be teaching her own coloniſts to rebel—it would be ſetting up a rival power in the vicinity of her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which in time might wreſt them from her.— Accordingly, Spain is deaf to all your inflammatory exhortations to war.</p>
            <p>What then are your internal reſources with which you are to encounter your
<q>gigantic adverſary, prepared at all points, and of whom even mighty warriors were greatly afraid?</q>
—to uſe your own moſt <hi>military</hi> and <hi>elegant</hi> phraſeology. Men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are the ſinews of war. The caſh account has been already examined—You muſt depend on a wretched currency, which is paſt all hope, or the poſſibility of being retrieved—no, not even by the fale of the weſtern wilderneſs, the laſt anchor of your hope.</p>
            <p>America is thinned of its inhabitants. <hi>Seventy thouſand men,</hi> and thoſe generally the moſt uſeful and induſtrious are already ſwept away. In a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:016311_0104_0F9C207151D2A328"/>
ſo extenſive and ſo thinly inhabited as America, this loſs muſt be ſeverely felt. Thoſe that remain, are harraſſed with perpetual muſters, and called from their neceſſary labour to attend the operations of war. If a few determined republicans, and ſuch as are veſted with power, and are amaſſing fortunes by the public ruin, be excepted; the firſt enthuſiaſtic zeal for revolt and enterprize is ſubſided, even among your partizans. The people in general are heartily ſick of the conteſt. The calamities they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the ruin that threatens, joined to your deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, have brought them to their ſenſes. They are averſe to taking arms, and ardently wiſh for peace.</p>
            <p>Is not this indeed the caſe? Why elſe are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch difficulties in raiſing an army? Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any will inliſt even for a few months. Thoſe that do inliſt, are tempted by exorbitant premiums; nor would theſe avail, were not the poor wretches ſeduced by artful falſehoods—ſuch as accounts of victories never obtained—public rejoicings for thoſe victories—great and good news from Europe, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fictitious—loans, fleets and armies coming over, which never had an exiſtence, &amp;c. &amp;c.— Whence is the backwardneſs of the militia to turn out when called on? Or whence thoſe violent and arbitrary methods to draft the militia, and keep up the appearance of an army? Do not theſe things evidently ſhew that the people at large are averſe to your meaſures, that their hearts are not with you? So galling has been your yoke, ſo inſupportable your tyranny, and ſo deteſted by the coloniſts, that many thouſands of them would this moment <hi>cheerfully</hi> ſet fire to their own houſes, and deſtroy them, provided this would contribute to deliver them from their preſent thraldom, and reſtore to them
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:016311_0105_0F9C20720E06BE78"/>
the bleſſings of peace and liberty which they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed. When ſo many of your ſubjects are lukewarm, ſo many others diſaffected, and others again ſo highly exaſperated, your uſurped power muſt reſt on a very tottering foundation. Even in your army, diſtruſt and diſaffection prevail. If half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of your ſoldiers are ſeen converſing together, they are inſtantly diſperſed by an officer. This I have been aſſured of repeatedly by deſerters.</p>
            <p>You frequently and loudly complained that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had employed the ſavages to ſcalp you.— You did this, when government actually reſtrained the ſavages, and would not employ them; and when you were uſing every method in your power to gain the ſavages, that you might employ them againſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Such of the <hi>Oneidas, Houſatunnuk</hi> or <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Indians and others, as had been previouſly perverted from loyalty, joined you, and have fought your battles. You lately ſent a number of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Indian Chiefs, and attempts were made by the moſt flagrant falſehoods, to ſeduce them from the King—your artifices however proved abortive.</p>
            <p>For theſe and other reaſons it is become abſolutely neceſſary for government to employ the Indians; and employed they <hi>will</hi> be. You have impoſed this diſagreeable neceſſity on the Parent State. With very little encouragement, ſuch a number of Indians may be brought on your frontiers, that in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the loyaliſts, whom you have driven to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and compelled to join the Indians, they would cut out work enough for all the forces you can muſter. Doubtleſs every precaution and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will be taken to prevent the cruelties which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an Indian war; but it is to be feared that your barbarities to the ſavages will in ſome degree defeat
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:016311_0106_0F9C2072CC74B880"/>
thoſe precautions. You have cut off numbers of the Indians, you have deſtroyed their houſes and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they would not take up the hatchet to ſupport your rebellion. This will naturally ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate them to revenge, and all the conſequent hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors muſt be laid to your charge.</p>
            <p>Whilſt your weſtern frontiers are thus expoſed to the ravages of an incenſed enemy, the whole line of ſea coaſt on the eaſt is open to the Britiſh fleet and army. To the ſouthward and northward alſo you will feel the power of the Britiſh arms. In every quarter you are vulnerable, and in every quarter you will be preſſed; whilſt diſaffection and diſtruſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal feuds and animoſities weaken and conſume your ſtrength.</p>
            <p>To compleat the whole, this country, formerly the moſt plentiful perhaps in the world, and moſt abounding in proviſions of every kind, is now threatened with famine. The old ſtock, which our non-exportation kept on hand, is now conſumed or deſtroyed. The Americans muſt entirely depend upon their annual crops for future ſubſiſtence; theſe are ſcarcely half as large as they were formerly, and are liable to the ſame conſumption and deſtruction that have already ſwept off much greater quantities of grain. In moſt places the lower claſſes are in want of bread; I have been aſſured that ſome have even periſhed for want of that and the other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life. Theſe wants will unavoidably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, if the war continues; and your warmeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans in different provinces have declared it as their opinion that a general famine is approaching.</p>
            <p>Such is the ſtate of your affairs which an impartial ſurvey of them preſents to us. Yet ſtill you breathe
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:016311_0107_0F9C20738A9B2238"/>
war and defiance, and multiply your inſults and cruelties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like the devoted Jews when they compelled the mild and generous TITUS to inflict ſuch ſevere puniſhment on them. In my conſcience, I think there is not in the whole compaſs of hiſtory a caſe to be found ſo parallel to yours as that of the Jews at the period I mention. Without an object to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the calamities ſuffered by this country, without any rational proſpect of ſucceſs, and without ability to protect the people whoſe guardianſhip you have aſſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſubject them to all the miſeries of civil war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drag them,contrary to their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be ſlaughtered like ſheep, in the field of battle. This leaves you utterly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in the ſight of God and man, and covers you with guilt of the deepeſt dye!</p>
            <p>What then can your <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be in ſuch a ſituation? They muſt be gloomy and wretched indeed. Your apprehenſions muſt be terrible when you take time to reflect. But none can form a juſt idea of the ſenſations peculiar to your ſituation, except ſuch as are plunged equally deep in guilt and rebellion. Whatever terrors a conſciouſneſs of your demerits may ſuggeſt, I am clearly of opinion that you have more to dread from the reſentment of your much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured countrymen than from the reſentment of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or the ſword of juſtice. The inſtances are very numerous where uſurpers, who were inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in bringing ruin on a people by ſuch methods as you have practiſed, have fallen victims to the rage of thoſe people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have been torn to pieces by them, however they might have been once idolized. Private rage, impatient at the tardy progreſs of public juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which may he finally eluded, hath ſnatched them from its hand, and devoted them to inſtant deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beware of a ſimilar fate: Human nature is the ſame now that it was formerly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:016311_0108_0F9C20744C7A07E0"/>When matters are approaching to this criſis, it is not improbable that overtures of accommodation will be made by your Congreſs to the Britiſh Commander in Chief; or that they will authorize their deputies in Europe to attempt ſomething of the kind. With how good a grace ſuch overtures can come from you, after what has happened, I leave your own feelings to determine.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a matter of ſerious conſideration both to government, and to the good people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whether a treaty or any kind ſhould be held with the Congreſs—whether men, who have ſo much proſtituted their uſurped power, ſhould ever be admitted to have any hand in the ſettlement of the colonies. Certain I am, that good policy on the part of America, as well as of Britain, utterly forbids it. That this country will have a generous conſtitution, as much freedom and as great privilege, as any part of the Britiſh dominions, is what I firmly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly believe. No well informed perſon can doubt it. But theſe benefits ſhould immediately flow from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the people, through their legal, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional aſſemblies; not through the unhallowed mediation of uſurpers, who have laboured to ruin the whole empire, and would be attended with the moſt pernicious conſequences.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this letter, I cannot forbear pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tribute of applauſe which is due to the loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts of America—a tribute which truth and juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. If your invention was ſtrained to deviſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties for their trial, they have ſuſtained the ſhock with no leſs firmneſs and intrepidity. They have exhibited inſtances of und viating loyalty, of unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, attachment to principle, to the dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to the intereſt of their country, which
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:016311_0109_0F9C20750B35F6F0"/>
would do honour to any people, in any place, or at any period. They have literally FORSAKEN ALL, that they might adhere to theſe. Inſults and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, bonds and impriſonment, confiſcation and death, have been their bitter portion; yet their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſurmounted theſe, and they triumphed over you in their ſufferings; Your compaſſion was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from them, but they commanded your eſteem; and they had what you <hi>cannot</hi> have, the teſtimony of a good conſcience to ſupport them. Tho' privy to each others ſentiments, and under the ſtrongeſt inducements of ſelf-preſervation, emoluments and popular applauſe, to be treacherous; yet there is no inſtance where they violated the mutual confidence, or betrayed the truſt which they repoſed in each other: On the contrary, they have, at the riſque of their lives, always readily afforded whatever aid and affectionate aſſiſtance was in their power, to their loyal brethren, when in diſtreſs, or under difficulties. Such conduct, which is the reſult of a ſteady adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the voice of duty and conſcience, reflects luſtre on human nature, and in ſome meaſure atones for the baſeneſs, perfidy, and other atrocious crimes with which ſome of their deluded brethren diſgrace America at this day.</p>

            <head>LETTER IX. TO THE PEOPLE of NORTH-AMERICA.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Brethern and Countrymen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE conduct of the American Congreſs, in ſome of their recent and moſt important tranſactions, hath been developed in the preceding letters, by which a judgment may be formed of their character. Their duplicity and nefarious deſigns have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; the origin and cauſes of this rebellion, and its ruinous effects have been alſo briefly laid before you. Moreover, the preſent ſtate and proſpects of the Congreſs have been impartially examined. Each of theſe hath been done with all good faith and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; and with the ſole view that the truth might be known; and that thoſe concerned might profit by it.</p>
            <p>Before I cloſe theſe papers, I would willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs YOU, my countrymen, and lay before you ſome further particulars which are peculiarly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this time. My aim is to give you ſuch infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as will enable you to judge of matters right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and think for yourſelves. Happy ſhall I be, if my endeavours contribute to theſe purpoſes, and direct you to a proper conduct.</p>
            <p>Republicans, ſmugglers, debtors and men of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fortunes, were the principal promoters of this unnatural rebellion. If to theſe be added a very few
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:016311_0111_0F9C207692369CE8"/>
individuals who were ſtimulated by ambition to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure at the head of a new empire, and cared not what the conſequences would be, provided only they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, their ends, I am confident the liſt will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſum total of thoſe who were active and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for independency. Whether ſuch men were fit to take the lead, and decide wholly for you in things of ſuch moment, where your lives, liberties, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs were all at ſtake, I leave you to judge. Neceſſity and compulſion, it is true, drew in many to join theſe afterwards; others were impoſed on by ſpecious falſhoods, and thereby ſeduced from their allegiance and intereſt; but theſe only acted a ſubordinate part, and were not initiated into the grand myſteries of ſtate.</p>
            <p>The lenity of the Britiſh government was conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here to be the reſult of fear, puſillanimity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence; and afforded leiſure for the ſchemes of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ripen, and for the diſaffected to diſſeminate their poiſon. Hence the ſpirit of revolt and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpread much wider, and acquired more ſtrength. Whilſt every artifice was uſed to vilify government, and make it odious; plauſible objects were held up by the ſeditious leaders, which lulled ſuſpicion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved danger out of ſight, and promiſed the moſt flattering advantages. By theſe methods many well meaning people were duped, and influenced to join them, who have ſince lamented their folly, and now deplore the wretched ſtate of their country.</p>
            <p>Men ſeldom, if ever, purſue what is wrong or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, as ſuch. They always have ſome good, ſome benefit, real or imagined, in view. But unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, the weakneſs of the human intellect is ſuch, that it is often impoſed on, and miſtakes that for good and beneficial which is really the reverſe. Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:016311_0112_0F9C20775016D1F8"/>
aſſumes the garb of truth, and they are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſhed from each other. Vice puts on the ſemblance of virtue—ambition, that of patriotiſm and generous zeal for the good of others. In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all this, men's paſſions and prejudices mingle with their reaſonings, pervert their judgement and hurry them into many things which unbiaſſed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon utterly diſapproves. Hence, they frequently adopt principles which are not only inconſiſtent with, but ſubverſive of, their happineſs; and yet they act on thoſe principles with earneſtneſs and unremitting ardour. This perhaps is one of the moſt prolific ſources of human miſery, as experience evinceth; and it frequently happens in the courſe of affairs, that men not only impoſe on others, but even on themſelves.</p>
            <p>To paſs by thoſe who promoted this rebellion from ſelfiſh motives—to aggrandize themſelves, and lord it over their brethern—to defraud their creditors, or patch up their broken fortunes—there were many of you, my countrymen, I doubt not, who engaged in it with upright, ſincere intentions. You <hi>believed</hi> that you were ſerving your country. Fond and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering were the expectations of many on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Their heated imaginations preſented to them high ideas of empire—American fleets traverſing the ocean, and armies the continent—Ambaſſadors with their pompous trains from diſtant Courts, ſuing for alliance—the wealth and commodities of the univerſe pouring in—taxes aboliſhed—poverty and diſtreſs baniſhed—all party extinguiſhed, freedom ſeated on her peerleſs throne, and
<q>her temple thrown wide, as an aſylum to mankind.</q>
—Fine notions theſe, to be ſure! The misfortune is, that it was impoſſible to realize them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:016311_0113_0F9C207809C3D508"/>Whatever arguments or train of thought may have led you to theſe extravagant concluſions, or inſpired you with that belief, it is high time to re-examine them. If diſappointment is capable of producing diffidence, if experience can teach wiſdom, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings bring men back to ſober reflection, I am ſure you ought to review your conduct, and to aſk your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves —whether you have not been deceived and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken? Whether you have not viewed things thro' a falſe medium? Whether local prejudices and pride, under the appearance of true patriotiſm, have not warped your judgment, and plunged you into error?</p>
            <p>True patriotiſm conſiſts in a deſire, and in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, concomitant endeavours, to promote the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſs of our country, without injury or injuſtice to others. Virtue and rectitude are its inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable attendants, and benevolence will influence its meaſures. It is not a blind attachment to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſtrict, which would aggrandize <hi>that</hi> at the expence of all others. This is nothing but local prejudice and pride. Much even of the Roman pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, which has made ſuch noiſe in the world, was of this latter and ſpurious kind.</p>
            <p>Inſatiable ambition was the diſtinguiſhing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of the Romans. They gratified that ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by raiſing their own city on the ruins of every other ſtate. The whole world muſt bend and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Rome. Mankind were plundered, enſlaved, and butchered in order to exalt Rome. Will any one call this true patriotiſm?</p>
            <p>That many of you were actuated by a ſpecies of patriotiſm nearly reſembling this, is evident. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe could ſuggeſt the extravagant notions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and which you are conſcious were
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:016311_0114_0F9C207C8E40A6B0"/>
entertained by the abettors of this rebellion. Theſe notions could not be realized, even ſuppoſing it had been practicable, nor your independency eſtabliſhed, but by a ſeries of the moſt enormous crimes; and the end in view could not poſſibly juſtify theſe; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the liberties and welfare of America might be otherwiſe ſecured.</p>
            <p>As falſe patriotiſm, i. e. local prejudice and pride, thus ſeduced ſome, ſo others were perverted by a falſe principle of honour. Many, who, in their hearts, diſapproved of independency, who thought it would be ruinous, and ſhuddered at the crimes which would attend the accompliſhing it, yet were led by this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to ſupport the Congreſs. Several officers, to my certain knowledge, and ſome of high rank, in the beginning of the year 1776, expreſſed their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of independency, and poſitively averred that
<q>if the Congreſs, declared for independency, they would not only abandon them, but turn their ſwords againſt them.</q>
Yet when independency was declared that ſame year, theſe officers ſtill adhered to the Congreſs! They thought it would be a <hi>breach of honour</hi> to deſert the Congreſs, and the cauſe in which they had engaged! This was alſo the caſe of others.</p>
            <p>There are many abuſes of the word <hi>honour</hi>; but this is the moſt flagrant abuſe of it that I have met with. Separate from juſtice, truth, and virtue, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is a phantom; and may be proſtituted to the worſt purpoſes <note n="*" place="bottom">See SIR GEORGE MACKENZIE's Moral Gallantry <hi>Proving that the</hi> Point of Honour <hi>obliges men to be</hi> virtuous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. Could honour oblige thoſe men to act againſt the conviction of their judgment, and violate the moſt ſacred obligations? Was not their
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:016311_0115_0F9C207E51EC4990"/>
honour previouſly engaged to ſupport the juſt rights of their Sovereign, and the intereſts of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Were not thoſe rights invaded, thoſe intereſts ſpurned, and their country endangered, according to their own ſentiments, by the declaration of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency? And was not their veracity, as well as duty engaged to oppoſe independency, which would prove ruinous to millions? Did not the <hi>breach of honour</hi> rather conſiſt in the violation of theſe?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid,
<q>that theſe men were ſo deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on the ſide of the Congreſs, that they knew not how to diſentangle themſelves:</q>
I anſwer, that this plea may as well be urged for a continuance in any crime or vice—in any meaſures, however iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. To err is the lot of humanity; but when a man is convinced of his error, honour and duty require that he ſhould retract it; nor can the plea of his being deeply involved, be any excuſe, or extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his guilt. In the common affairs of life this aſſuredly is the caſe; I ſee no difference in the inſtance before us.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be alledged further, as it probably will,
<q>that theſe men had changed their ſentiments, and thought independency would be beneficial to this country;</q>
I am willing to join iſſue on this ground, and examine the truth of this plea.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then that the independency of America could be eſtabliſhed, this muſt be done by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your French alliance, as is acknowledged on all hands. Do you really imagine that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of America, or the proteſtant religion would not be thereby endangered? If you think ſo, you muſt be utter ſtrangers to the genius of popery, to the ambitious, enterpriſing ſpirit of that inſidious monarchy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:016311_0116_0F9C207ECC8932B0"/>Beſides the advantages allowed to France by the treaty of alliance (the whole of which has not yet been laid before the public) ſhe muſt pour in ſuch ſuccours, and otherwiſe entangle the colonies with her own intereſts, by bringing them in debt for mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtores, merchandize, &amp;c. and obtaining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſecurity, that before your independency, with reſpect to Britain, could be ſecured, you muſt be dependent on France. She muſt unavoidably gain an entire aſcendency over the colonies, and they would lie at her mercy.</p>
            <p>Even already the Congreſs have declared,
<q>that the United States may not of right, nor will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude either truce or peace with the common enemy, without the formal conſent of their ally firſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
So that you and your brethren muſt continue butchering each other, till it ſuits the intereſt and policy of France to bid you ſtop. If the colonies are ſo much at the devotion and beck of France now, what will the caſe be when they are ſtill weaker and more exhauſted than they are at preſent; and when they are involved deeper with France, and are much more in her power? Theſe things carry terror with them, when the aſpiring views of France are conſidered—her aim at univerſal monarchy, and her repeated encroachments on the rights of every neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtate for accompliſhing that deſign. The perſon who is acquainted with theſe matters, and yet is not apprehenſive for the liberties of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is either regardleſs of thoſe liberties, or he ſhuts his eyes againſt the cleareſt conviction.</p>
            <p>The French alliance looks with no leſs malignant an aſpect on the Proteſtant religion, than on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of America. Sad experience had taught our anceſtors, that ſevere laws and penalties, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:016311_0117_0F9C207FB009E1D0"/>
of the civil magiſtrate were indiſpenſibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to reſtrain the reſtleſs ſpirit of popery—and that theſe were ſcarcely ſufficient to prevent popiſh prieſts from perverting Proteſtants to their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe laws were extended to the colonies.</p>
            <p>But under the Congreſs this procedure is reverſed. Inſtead of laws to reſtrain, the door is thrown wide open to receive popery. Its prieſts are favoured and countenanced—they meet with every encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whilſt proteſtant clergymen, who will not <hi>perjure</hi> themſelves to ſupport the Congreſs, are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, impriſoned, and otherwiſe cruelly perſecuted.</p>
            <p>Is popery then changed? Is it purged from error and become leſs perſecuting? No—it is now the very ſame as formerly. Its inquiſition ſtill reeks with the blood of Proteſtants, and of others whom it pronounces to be heretics. Not one erroneous or ſuperſtitious article has been yet expunged from its creed—nor hath any reformation taken place in its idolatrous worſhip. Its prieſts are as zealous as ever to make proſelytes, and to impoſe their ſpiritual tyranny on mankind.</p>
            <p>With ſuch countenance from the Americans— with ſuch zeal to propagate the tenets of popery— with ſuch artful emiſſaries as are always employed in this work—and with French influence to ſupport them, what progreſs may we not expect that intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſuperſtition will make in a ſhort time! Every Proteſtant who has any regard for his religion—a religion which has been ſealed with the blood of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs—and martyrs to popiſh fury—every ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, I ſay, muſt be greatly and juſtly alarmed at this proſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:016311_0118_0F9C20804E82A538"/>Think not, my countrymen, that theſe things are flung out merely to frighten you, or that theſe fears and apprehenſions are groundleſs. The caſe ſpeaks evidently for itſelf. Circumſtances leſs threatening have frequently rouſed our anceſtors againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of Popery; and to this jealouſy and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance it was owing, humanly ſpeaking, that they and we have hitherto been preſerved from its yoke. But I ſhall further ſubmit the following indubitable facts to your conſideration, and then judge whether thoſe apprehenſions are groundleſs.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak againſt popery, which is the religion of France, would draw as ſevere perſecution from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt zealous abettors of Congreſs, as to ſpeak againſt the Congreſs itſelf. They will not permit a word to be ſaid to the diſadvantage of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, In very many diſtricts of the continent— and in ſome of New-England—where popery was formerly deteſted, and ſcarcely a papiſt was to be ſeen, numbers of popiſh books are now diſperſed, and read with avidity I could name a member of the rebel council in one of the New-England colonies, who was formerly conſidered as a zealous proteſtant diſſenter, who not long ſince harrangued a large aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of people on ſome of the diſputed points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween proteſtants and papiſts; ſuch as the invocation of ſaint, purgatory, tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. After palliating each of theſe, ſtraining the ſenſe to put the moſt favourable and leaſt offenſive conſtruction on them, and ſoftening them with as much art as the moſt ſubtle diſciple of <hi>Loyola</hi> could uſe, he finally declared that <hi>he ſaw nothing amiſs or erroneous in them</hi>; and his audience ſeemed to be wonderfully pleaſed and edified. I could name another proteſtant diſſenter, whoſe antipathy to popery ſeemed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to border on enthuſiaſm; yet who lately declared
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:016311_0119_0F9C20811C7F1310"/>
his wiſh <hi>to ſee a popiſh prieſt ſettled in every county throughout America</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The mention of theſe facts cannot give juſt offence to any loyal diſſenter, and indeed none is intended. It would be as ridiculous to take umbrage at it, as for a Churchman to he offended at the mentioning of <hi>Waſhington, Jay,</hi> or any other of his apoſtate brethern who joined in the rebellion. I have no doubt but rebel Churchmen are juſt as favourable to popery as rebel diſſenters. The reaſon why <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> were named in the above anecdotes, was to place the amazing change of people's ſentiments in favor of popery, a conſequence of the French alliance, in a more ſtriking point of light; for Proteſtant Diſſenters were ſuppoſed formerly to be more averſe from popery than other proteſtants. Why then ſhould not the truth be ſpoken? Can it injure the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? Or ſhould it be ſuppreſſed to ſcreen the guilty? The true diſtinction at preſent, and the only one I make, is, that of loyaliſt, a friend to the King and conſtitution; and that of rebel, a friend to independency and a French faction. I ardently wiſh that every other political diſtinction may ceaſe, or be wholly forgotten.</p>
                  <p>That a very large majority of the American <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> have zealouſly concurred in promoting this rebellion, is a fact ſo notorious, that it cannot be denied. But this circumſtance inſtead of diſgrace, reflects the more honour on thoſe who were loyal, and entitles them to greater applauſe; For hereby their virtue and loyalty were put to the ſeverer tryal; and in general, they have fared no better among the rebels than loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al churchmen. It ſhould alſo be remembered, that preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in Scotland have been amongſt the moſt loyal of the King's ſubjects on this occaſion. Perhaps that nation has been more united in ſupport of government, than either England or Ireland. This is one inſtance, among many, of the generous, unſhaken attachment to their Sovereigns, which has uniformly been manifeſted by that gallant people, and is become one of their national characteriſtics—A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in my humble opinion, greatly to their honour, which is the reaſon why I mention it.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Large importations of Popiſh Prieſts, beads, and other ſuch trumpery, have been made into the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſince the French alliance took place. Upwards
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:016311_0120_0F9C2081C9C269C0"/>
of <hi>twenty Prieſts</hi> were ſaid to be in one French ſhip that was chaſed by a Britiſh cruizer in Cheſapeak Bay; the French veſſel eſcaped, and this information was given by the Priſoners in a French prize which was taken ſoon after. Several <hi>thouſand popiſh beads</hi> were found on board a prize lately brought into this port—the prize came from Havannah, and was bound to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>I have the moſt authentic vouchers and documents to prove theſe facts; and could mention many more of the ſame kind, were it neceſſary. But why ſhould I dwell on ſuch anecdotes to evince this point? The Congreſs and Rebel Legiſlature of Pennſylvania have lately given the moſt publick and unequivocal proof of their countenance and good will to Popery They have ſet an example which they unqueſtionably wiſh others to follow. In a Philadelphia Newſpaper of July 7, Inſt. we have the following relation.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>On ſunday laſt, being the Anniverſary of the independence of America, his Excellency, the Preſident, and the honourable Members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs attended divine worſhip in the forenoon— When a ſermon, ſuitable to the occaſion, was preached by the Reverend Mr. <hi>White,</hi>—one of the chaplains of Congreſs.</q>

—I ſhall leave you to make your
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016311_0121_0F9C20829688BCE0"/>
own reflections on this moſt <hi>edifying</hi> exhibition. CHARLES I. was called a <hi>Papiſt</hi> for permitting his Queen, who was bred a Roman Catholic, to attend maſs: What are we to think of the American rulers, who not only permit their wives to attend maſs, but attend it themſelves in perſon! And offer up their <hi>devout</hi> oriſons in the language, ſervice and worſhip of Rome!</p>
            <p>All theſe particulars ſufficiently ſhew the preſent ſtate of Things on this head—what encouragement popery has met with, in conſequence of the French alliance—What progreſs it has already and is likely to make, and that the apprehenſions of its increaſe are well founded.</p>
            <p>Now mark how differently it is treated within the King's lines. This will clearly appear from the following fact: In February, 1778, a large French ſhip of force was taken near Cheſapeak Bay. The Rev. Mr. <hi>De La Motte,</hi> a regular prieſt, of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. Auguſtin, was her Chaplain. The prize was brought to New-York; and Mr. <hi>De La Motte,</hi> with the other officers were permitted to go about, having given their parole of honour. <hi>De La Motte</hi> was ſolicited to ſay Maſs; but being apprized that a law of this Province prohibited the exerciſe of the Popiſh religion within its limits, he aſked the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant's permiſſion for the purpoſe. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was <hi>refuſed</hi>; though <hi>De La Motte</hi> afterwards alledged, that through ignorance of the Engliſh language, he miſtook the Commandant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the permiſſion was granted. <hi>De La Motte</hi> officiated: and for this he was taken up, and put into confinement; and in confinement he remained, till exchanged and ſent to Boſton, where, I preſume, he exerciſed his function without any interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:016311_0122_0F9C20834AFA1EA0"/>Some perhaps may flatter themſelves that America will be able not only to maintain its independency and be happy; but alſo to guard againſt any deſigns of France, that would be injurious to its liberties, or the proteſtant religion.—This notion is altogether chimerical, and contrary to the cleareſt evidence; yet as I am willing to try the validity of every plea that has any plauſibility, I ſhall beſtow a few words in the examination of this.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing Britain and France were ſet aſide, would the liberties of America be ſecure under the Congreſs? Would the Americans be a peaceable and happy people, and ſubject to few taxes? Theſe are intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions; for theſe contain all that the abettors of independency can rationally aim at; and yet no propoſition can be more clear than that you would fail of attaining theſe, in caſe America ſhould now become independent.</p>
            <p>By liberties, I mean ſuch as you formerly enjoyed, and ſuch as are the portion of Britiſh ſubjects.— Frenchmen have what they call liberties—and even Turks—the ſtaunch allies of France—have what they call by the ſame name. But I conceive you would not be content with ſuch liberties. You look for liberties, ſimilar, at leaſt, to thoſe which you once poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>The experience of <hi>three</hi> years has taught you how far theſe are attainable under a Congreſſional govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You have been ruled with a rod of iron. Deſpotiſm has marked the footſteps of your rulers. Nor was this merely owing to the preſent conflict— the conſequence of your ſtruggle with the parent ſtate. It reſulted from the genius and ſpirit of the Congreſs. The internal ſtructure of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016311_0123_0F9C20840BBE4D48"/>
which has been huddled up in the midſt of war and tumults, is ſuch, that it is neceſſarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of liberty, and muſt lead to tyranny.</p>
            <p>Liberty cannot exiſt for any time, where the ſupreme power of a ſtate is not divided. A right diſtribution of that power is the ſpring of liberty; in this alſo conſiſts the excellency of any civil conſtitution. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and a thirſt of power are naturally inherent in man. Theſe will ſtimulate bodies of men, as well as individuals to encroach on the rights of others. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there is ſome power to reſtrain thoſe encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, liberty muſt vaniſh.</p>
            <p>In Britain, the conſtitution has guarded againſt ſuch encroachments. The ſupreme power is divided into three branches; each of which can check and control the others, when neceſſary. If any one of them ſhould attempt to paſs its proper limits, to the injury of the others, or of the community, the other branches can interfere immediately, and fruſtrate its deſigns before they can to executed. Hence ariſe the permanence and ſtability of Britiſh liberty.</p>
            <p>In America, the caſe is wholly different. The Congreſs have found means to unite and centre in themſelves the power of King, Lords and Commons. They are abſolute, paramount and unreſtrained— without check or controul. They may paſs what laws, or take what meaſures they pleaſe, and there is nothing to reſtrain them. They may ſell you and your liberties, with the ſoil of America to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bidder, and you have no remedy.</p>
            <p>Have you not already experienced in part what is here alledged? Do you approve of all the proceedings of the Congreſs? And if not, what remedy can you
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016311_0124_0F9C2084CE144750"/>
apply? I do not aſk you whether you have <hi>unanimouſly</hi> approved; but did a <hi>majority</hi> approve of the Congreſs's declaration of independency—Of their withholding from you the propoſals made by the Britiſh Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſoon after—Of their rejecting the offers of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation by the Britiſh Commiſſioners lately, without diſcuſſion or examination—Of their alliance with France, and their reſolve of Jan. 14, by which this country was virtually, and as for as they could betrayed to that inſidious power—Of their ſecreting from you their moſt important tranſactions—Of their emitting ſuch enormous ſums of paper currency, by which you are brought to the brink of ruin—Of their burthening America with ſuch a debt, by this currency and their traffic with France, as muſt impoveriſh and depreſs this country for generations to come? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may diſapprove of any, or all of theſe, yet it is paſt your power to redreſs them.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be urged—
<q>that the members of the Congreſs are elected by the people—that their fears become vacant after a ſhort term; and that this is a ſufficient ſecurity for the liberties of America.</q>
I anſwer, it is by no means a ſufficient ſecurity. When the members of the congreſs are once elected, they become inveſted with abſolute unreſtrained pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There is nothing to check their proceedings. In one ſeſſion the liberties of America may be laid proſtrate; and when an act or acts are paſſed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pernicious, they cannot be recalled. The thing is done, and is therefore remidileſs, as to you. Can the vaſſals of Turkey be in a worſe ſituation?</p>
            <p>
               <q>But muſt not they participate in your burdens, and be equally involved in your loſs of liberty, and other evils?</q>
—Yes, verily —juſt as the thirty tyrants of Athens, Julius Caeſar, and Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:016311_0125_0F9C208590197D90"/>
with their reſpective aſſociates, participated in the burdens of their countrymen, and were involved in the common evils. Experience ſhews that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of this ſort will not prevent the abuſe of power. You cannot be more zealous for a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican Government, nor more averſe to the yoke of deſpotiſm, than the Athenians, Romans, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh were, at the periods abovementioned: Yet they were compelled reſpectively to ſubmit to that yoke. The emoluments of office would more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the pecuniary part of the burden; and ambition will ſtick at nothing to graſp its favourite object—domination.</p>
            <p>Be not deceived therefore, my countrymen, with the ſound of names; nor think there is any neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connection between liberty and a Congreſs. You may be enſlaved by a Congreſs as ſoon as by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch—much ſooner than by a limited monarch.</p>
            <p>The American Congreſs have ordered matters ſo that they are veſted with abſolute power—they can turn the collective ſtrength of the community againſt any individual, or to any object they pleaſe: Yet, as a body, they are reſponſible to none, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to check them, none who can call them to an account. No man therefore, who wiſhes well to America, but muſt tremble at the apprehenſions of ſuch a power. To live under it is nothing but an expreſſion denoting ſervitude.</p>
            <p>Independency is pregnant with many other evils. To ſupport the civil, naval and military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this new empire, would require nearly <hi>four Millions of Pounds Sterling,</hi> annually in time of peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:016311_0126_0F9C208660542F20"/>This, with the debts already contracted by the Congreſs, and the ſinking their paper currency, would ſubject you to heavier taxes than are paid by any people in chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>The ſeeds of animoſity and diſcord, of deadly feuds and bloody conteſts, are already ſown—the ſpirit which will cheriſh theſe, and bring them to full maturity, even now begins to work. Scarcely can the terror of the Britiſh arms, joined to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Congreſs, reſtrain ſome provinces from hoſtility and war about their mutual claims to certain diſtricts—and ſome of thoſe diſtricts deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Savages. Inſtigated by the ſame am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which led them to throw off their connection with the parent ſtate, a few provinces lay claim to the whole of the weſtern unſettled lands, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the reſt. It is manifeſt that the poſſeſſion of ſo immenſe a territory, would, in time, enable thoſe provinces to ſubjugate the others, and ſwallow them up. Religious prejudices would certainly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and ſtruggles for ſuperiority would enſue; for whatever may be the opinion of ſome to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is abſolutely certain, that on the part of many, the preſent is a <hi>Religious War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe claſhing intereſts, prejudices and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are at this hour fermenting, would burſt out with deſtructive violence the moment that the claims and ſuperintendence of Britain are entirely removed. Perhaps you are not apprehenſive that thoſe evils would follow; neither were you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the <hi>preſent</hi> evils when the conteſt began. But theſe conſequences would infallibly attend your independency at this time. All thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by which this country flouriſhed, would be changed; its ſtate and condition muſt neceſſarily be changed alſo. What were the circumſtances that promoted our growth and oppulence?—The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Britiſh, the mildneſs of our government,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:016311_0127_0F9C2087A08CCB50"/>
an exemption from taxes, the influx of Europeans, and a ſpirit of peaceful induſtry. Each of theſe, in caſe of independency, would indubitably be reverſed; muſt not the benefits ariſing from them be alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed? America would be a ſcene of bloody diſcord and deſolation for ages—the moſt miſerable diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country on earth. In this wretched ſtate it would continue, 'till a few provinces, or one ſect had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugated the reſt; as this would probably end in the depotiſm of <hi>one</hi> perſon. Such has been the uniform courſe of human affairs on ſimilar occaſions.</p>
            <p>Let me add, that it is impoſſible for ſo extenſive a country as America to remain under a republican form of government—the form now adopted. The experience of mankind, as far as we have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, clearly evinceth this; as well as the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of human nature. We can no more change the laws of nature in this reſpect, than in any other— no more than we can change the laws of gravity, or thoſe which guide the ſeaſons, or regulate the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. The republican form may do well enough for a ſingle city, or ſuch a little ſpot as Holland, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice or the Swiſs Cantons, but is utterly unſuitable to ſuch a wide extended continent as this; nor does hiſtory afford one inſtance of the kind. No ſooner had the ſpirit of conqueſt enlarged the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire beyond the limits which were adapted to their republican government—and thoſe limits not a <hi>fifth</hi> part as large as North-America—than the deſpotiſm of one perſon was the conſequence.</p>
            <p>Such is the proſpect, my countrymen, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency preſents to you. I truſt you will give theſe matters a ſerious, diſpaſſionate examination, and weigh them with that attention which their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance demands. All that is dear or valuable to man on earth is now at ſtake with you—all that can make life deſirable is ſuſpended on the deciſion of this conteſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:016311_0128_0F9C2087CC983288"/>Nothing but the power and interpoſition of Britain ſtands between you and the evils which I have now mentioned. Were ſhe to break off her connection, thoſe evils would ruſh in upon you like a torrent; nor could ſhe take a ſeverer revenge for the injuries and inſults ſhe hath received, than leaving you to yourſelves. Of all this, I know many of you are fully ſenſible; yet deluſion ſtill holds you in her faſcinating chains.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto reaſoned with you on the above ſuppoſitions, purely to meet your prejudices, examine the validity of your ſeveral pleas, and the grounds of your expectations reſpecting independency. But I muſt now tell you plainly that independency is UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATTAINABLE. Britain is <hi>determined</hi> to aſſert her juſt claim to her American colonies, and ſhe is able to carry her determination and claim into execution. Happy is it for you that ſhe hath ability and will to do ſo; this alone can reſcue America from the foreign and domeſtic evils we have been conſidering.</p>
            <p>France cannot protect her own trade, or ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how then can ſhe protect or aſſiſt you? Or, were ſhe able, would ſhe beſtow that freedom and liberty on you, which ſhe cruelly denies to her own children? Do you expect that Spain will aſſiſt to eſtabliſh your independency? Were ſhe even to do ſo, contrary to every principle or national intereſt and good policy, (of which however there is not the leaſt probability) be aſſured there are other Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an powers ready to interfere, and aſſiſt Britain; and theſe would more than balance the weight of Spain. Do you flatter yourſelves that becauſe the war has been ſo much prolonged, you have a chance yet to ſucceed? Reflect, I beſeech you, that Britain is ſlow in her operations at the beginning of every war, and often unſucceſsful. The freedom of her conſtitution ſubjects her to this inconvenience, and occaſions embarraſſments that are unknown to arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:016311_0129_0F9C208ACBF032B8"/>
You remember the laſt war. You may recollect what loſſes ſhe ſuſtained; how gloomy the proſpect of America was; that it was threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the yoke of France, for <hi>four years</hi> after the war began: Yet Britain finally triumphed over France and Spain, not only here, but in every quarter of the globe. That Freedom, from which embarraſſments ariſe at firſt, enables her, when tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly rouſed, to exert a vigour which the daſtard ſons of ſervitude can neither attain nor withſtand.</p>
            <p>Conſider the numbers of your brethren that have been already ſwept off—the deſolation and miſery that overſpread this country. Do you think the ſword hath not yet devoured enough? Or ſhould the ravages of war be invited to hold on their dreadful career, and conſume whatever yet remains? That the Congreſs mean to continue thoſe ravages, is evident. Sooner than part with their honours, emoluments and power, the ſweets of which they have now taſted, they will ſacrifice the life of every individual who will be ſtupid enough to ſupport or adhere to them.</p>
            <p>What can attach you to men who have ſhewn ſuch a diſregard to your welfare—ſuch inſenſibility to your miſeries? Who, contrary to all rational hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, perpetuate your calamities; and although utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable to protect you, yet drive you out to be ſlaughtered? And who by their duplicity and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have diſgraced America!</p>
            <p>So void of humanity are the Congreſs towards you, that altho' they compel you to be enrolled as militia, and this ſubjects you to all the penalties of rebellion; yet they will not redeem you from captivity, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change you, unleſs you happen to be taken on actual ſervice; and great numbers, as you very well know, are taken who are not thus on ſervice. They oblige you to take arms againſt your rightful Sovereign; yet you muſt expect no relief from them when
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:016311_0130_0F9C208C123F2C50"/>
ſuffering for that crime, although they can eaſily afford relief. If taken, you may languiſh and rot in priſon, or die, and your families ſuffer; but they neither care for you, not yours.</p>
            <p>Even their Continental troops fare no better.— Many hundreds of them, officers and men, are now confined in this place, ſome of whom were made priſoners as early as 1776; beſides multitudes that have died. Whatever falſhoods you may have heard concerning thoſe priſoners, be aſſured they have had to the full the uſual allowance of proviſions for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and have been as well uſed otherwiſe as the ſtate of things would admit. They were confined in large buildings, or on board of ſhips; nor could they be otherwiſe accommodated unleſs thay had been ſent off the continent. The Officers were permitted to go at large on their parole, although upwards of an <hi>hundred</hi> of them have ſhamefully violated that parole and ran off.</p>
            <p>Why have thoſe unhappy men been thus brutally abandoned? Not content with neglecting their zealous partizans, the Congreſs have added inſult and mockery to cruelty. They have ſeveral times appointed commiſſioners to meet others from the Britiſh Commander in Chief, to treat of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners. Yet in truth they meant to do nothing but trifle with us, to amuſe and deceive you and the rebel priſoners. A deſire of exchange was pretended; yet the exchange was evaded, not only by a breach of public faith, by propoſals utterly inadmiſſible, but by a ſeries of chicane and duplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which would be held in deteſtation by men of any honour or principle. They undervalued you on thoſe occaſions; alledging, that <hi>one of their men was not worth a Britiſh or German ſoldier—that it would be prejudicial to them to part with the remains of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's army on equal terms</hi>; as if Britain could not eaſily replace two or three thouſand men; and the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:016311_0131_0F9C208D60727908"/>
priſoners of that army in their hands do not exceed that number! In their late <hi>Addreſs,</hi> the Congreſs have more than inſinuated that the American merchants, farmers, and the inferior officers employed in their Service, are a Set of mercenary wretches, who care nothing for the public if they can only enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: In their procedure reſpecting priſoners, they have declared by words and actions, that you are not worth exchanging, and are beneath their regard or notice.</p>
            <p>The true and ſecret ſpring of this conduct is as diſhonourable to Congreſs, as it is injurious and provoking to you. The real fact ſtands thus— While the Congreſs have thoſe priſoners, they are ſure that a great number of Engliſh guineas muſt be ſent for their ſupport—they are no leſs ſure that many or moſt of theſe will infallibly find their way to themſelves; and however they may extricate his Majeſty's perſon, they like very well to view his <hi>picture in gold.</hi> Hereby they can make proviſion for themſelves againſt an evil day in ſome foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which their own currency will not do. Beſides, by detaining thoſe priſoners, the Congreſs imagine they have pledges of ſecurity for their own <hi>precious</hi> perſons in caſe of a diſaſtrous iſſue in their affairs, or that any of themſelves ſhould be made priſoners.— Theſe are the <hi>laudable</hi> motives which induce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to neglect their friends, leave them to ſtruggle with all the hardſhips of confinement, and their families to ſtarve.</p>
            <p>For my part, I ſhould not be ſurprized if all the rebel priſoners, thoſe we now have, or ſuch as may hereafter be taken, were ſent to ſome diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Here, they put government to a great expence, without any advantage whatever, as the Congreſs will not exchange them. The poor wretches are a burden to themſelves, and uſeleſs to mankind. By ſending them off, they might be diſpoſed of ſo as to be ſerviceable to themſelves and others. Good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:016311_0132_0F9C208DDBE4EA38"/>
in my opinion, dictates ſuch a meaſure; and I am ſure humanity muſt approve of it.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I enlarge further? The time would fail me to recount the ſeveral enormities of thoſe men, who ſeem to be intended only as a ſcourge for this devoted country. Conſult your own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, your memory and experience: What have you known but violence, oppreſſion and miſery ſince the reign of the Congreſs commenced? What have you in proſpect, if you adhere to them, but deſtruction and ruin? Why then adhere longer to men, whom duty, honour, patriotiſm and ſelf preſervation call loudly on you to abandon? Whoſe tyrannical ſyſtem you ſhould exert yourſelves to overthrow?</p>
            <p>Turn your Eyes, my countrymen, to Britain, your parent ſtate—the ſtate from which you origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated—which protected and foſtered you with tender care, and raiſed you to your late flouriſhing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied condition. She holds out to you the bleſſings of peace, freedom and ſecurity—an exemption from the evils which now threaten you.</p>
            <p>Were the Americans left to their unreſtrained choice, Britain is the country, and the <hi>only</hi> one, with which they ſhould deſire an union. Her conſtitution inſures real, ſubſtantial liberty to every ſubject—all are under the protection of equal laws—none are expoſed to the caprice of arbitrary will—the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perſon, the civil and religious liberties of every man are perfectly ſecure. Britain is the only ſtate whoſe maritime power can effectually protect Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica from foreign inſult or invaſion—ſhe is the only ſtate whoſe immenſe trade can employ and give vent to the various commodities of this weſtern hemiſphere to advantage—and ſhe is the only ſtate who can fully and on advantageous terms, ſupply America with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral manufactures of linen, woollen, metals, &amp;c. that ſhe requires. No other ſtate can furniſh theſe of equal quality, in the ſame quantity and at the ſame price. Let me add, that the ties of blood, religion, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016311_0133_0F9C208E94EE0458"/>
laws and manners, ſtrongly impel each to a coalition, which cannot be ſaid of any other ſtate, with reſpect to America, but Britain. Providence, nature and reaſon, therefore point out and demand this union—and that union, I firmly believe and truſt in God, <hi>will</hi> take place.</p>
            <p>Yes—I ſee the auſpicious aera near approaching, when Britain and America will be united—when a generous conſtitution, guarding againſt former incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, will be eſtabliſhed, and from which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſional and Gallic deſpotiſm will be banniſhed— when both countries, ſupporting and ſupported by each other, will riſe to eminence, proſperity and ſtrength, unknown to paſt ages, bid defiance to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and domeſtic enemies, and become the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and envy of mankind.</p>
            <p>This is no flight of fancy, unſupported by reaſon. It is not like the dreams of independency, which muſt vaniſh like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion. Each of theſe particulars, is founded in truth, in the actual ſtate of things at preſent; nor have I a doubt but each will be realized. Neither France nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs can wreſt thoſe bleſſings from us, nor reverſe the courſe of nature. Whilſt this proſpect ſhould animate the friends of government, liberty and peace; it ſhould alſo engage <hi>all</hi> to unite and exert themſelves in arreſting the ravages of war, and checking the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of deſolation. The ſooner this is done, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Your part therefore is, to contribute what you can to ſhake off ſpeedily the yoke of republican ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and re-unite yourſelves to the parent ſtate, from which republican ambition, phrenzy and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion have ſevered you.</p>
