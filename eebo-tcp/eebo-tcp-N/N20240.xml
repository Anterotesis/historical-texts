            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON the 4th day of March, 1794, the brig Falmouth ſailed from Port-Royal, Jamaica, bound to Belfaſt, in Ireland, to which place ſhe belonged. At the time ſhe ſailed, the following perſons were on board:</p>
            <p>William Corran maſter, Francis Turner mate, Henry Gilmore, J. Douthard, — Boyd, — Carrol, Joſeph York, (mariners) William Willams, a cabin-boy, Joſeph Porter, a paſſenger, and a black, ſervant to mr. Porter.</p>
            <p>Nothing materially happened on the voyage, 'till two of the hands, Boyd, and Carrol, were taken ſick, and died apparently of violent fevers, the one immediately after the other.—During their illneſs, the captain uſed to enquite after their ſituation, and to look at them down the hatchway, and ſent them frequently from the cabin both ſoup and coffee.</p>
            <p>After the death of theſe men, which happened pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the 2d of May, there appeared an apparent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the conduct of the captain, which ſhewed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in particular inſtances of harſh treatment towards one or other of the crew, whom he charged with an
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026534_0004_0FD08FFBDFBC34E0"/>
intention to poiſon him and to run away with the veſſel.</p>
            <p>Very ſoon after the death of the man, they ſpoke an American ſchooner, the maſter of which captain Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran had before been acquainted with; and who, on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had loſt two of his men, offered to ſupply him with two more. Captain Corran thanked the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican for his friendſhip, but told him he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do with the hands he had. This circumſtance appeared ſtrange to the crew, as the loſs of the men had rendered them but weak-handed.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of May, he took from the mate a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, which he had given to him ſoon after their ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and likewiſe took from him his books of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; taking into his own hands the entire navigation of the veſſel.</p>
            <p>Mr. Porter, the paſſenger, was in an extreme ill ſtate of health, and was ſo feeble as to be confined to his bed, which was in the ſtarboard ſtate room. In this ſituation he lay till the 24th of May, when the mate, being in the larboard ſtate-room, and the captain and mr. Porter's ſervant in the cabin, the mate heard captain Corran, in warm language, abuſing mr. Porter, —ſwearing that he ſhould not ſtay any longer in the ſtate room, and ordering his black boy to go immediately and bring his maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cabin. This the boy attempted; but finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to effect it, and mr. Porter, at the ſame time, begging, for God's ſake, that he might be ſuffered to lay where he was, the captain entered the ſtate-room, and, with the aſſiſtance of the black boy, took mr. Porter, by force, out of his bed, and ſupporting him himſelf under one arm, and the black boy under the other, they brought him into the cabin, (he being unable to walk himſelf) and ſat him down in a chair. The captain then ordered the black boy to bring out his maſter's bed, and make it up in the cabin, upon two cheſts belonging to mr. Porter.— This being done, he compelled the black boy to lay his maſter on the bed, and then ſent for one of the top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026534_0005_0FD08FFD2EB0D9B0"/>
ſtudding ſails, of which he made a ſort of a curtain to ſurround the bed. After this tranſaction, he ordered the black boy out of the cabin, and going upon deck, gave general orders that neither the black boy nor any other perſon, ſhould come into the cabin without his leave, and that no perſon ſhould concern himſelf with mr. Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as he would take care of him himſelf.</p>
            <p>On the night of the 26th of May, about midnight, the captain ſent for the cabin boy; the boy came to him, and the captain ordered him to fetch a candle; after he had brought it, he demanded of the boy where he had been? the boy replied, it was his watch below: He then ordered him to ſtrip off his jacket, after which he bid him go to the locker and bring the cat-o'-nine-tails.—The boy went to the locker, and told the captain he could not find it: He threatened to ſtrike him with a cutlaſs, if he did not find it immediately; the boy not being able to find it, he accordingly ſtruck him with the flat of his cutlaſs. After which he took a pair of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuffs out of a drawer in the cabin, and put it upon the boy's hands. He then put a piſtol to his breaſt, and threatened to ſhoot him. After ſome little time, the boy took the firſt opportunity to make his eſcape out of the cabin, and as he ran acroſs the deck, he deſired the man at the helm, if the captain enquired for him, to tell him, that he had jumped overboard. The boy ran forward, got into the hold, and hid himſelf for three days, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on ſome Indian corn and ſugar, which he found in the hold. Immediately after the boy left the cabin, the captain fired his piſtols through the cabin windows, and ſhattered them conſiderably.</p>
            <p>The 27th of May, between the hours of 10 and 11 o'clock at night, the captain called Henry Gilmore, and ordered him to bring a light. When Gilmore came with the light, the captain gave him a drink of grog, and told him that he hoped he would be in his favour, and that he was not afraid of the law. Gilmore replied, that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026534_0006_0FD08FFD54A19208"/>
he did not wiſh to be againſt him or any perſon. —The captain ſoon after came upon deck, and deſired that no perſon ſhould be permitted to come into the cabin, without orders from him, and that the watch, then on deck, ſhould give the ſame charge to the watch which was to ſucceed. About a quarter paſt 12 o'clock the whole crew were alarmed with the cries of mr. Porter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming "Murder! Murder! &amp;c"—through a hole in the bulk-head, which parted the ſteerage from the cabin; and by looking down the companion-door, ſeveral of the crew ſaw captain Corran ſtriking at mr. Porter as he lay in his bed, with a cutlaſs. After ſtriking him for ſome time, he deſiſted for a ſhort ſpace, and coming up the companion ladder, began to abuſe mr. Porter, d—ing him, and declaring he was not worth five pounds in the world. He then returned into the cabin again, and began to cut mr. Porter as he had done before.—Mr. Porter again cried out and begged the captain not to cut him ſo—to take a piſtol and ſhoot him. He d—d him, and ſaid he would not ſhoot him, but would cut him every half hour till day light. In a ſhort time, mr. Porter begged him to deſiſt, as he was dying; and it is ſuppoſed that he expired about this time, as his cries were heard no more. Between one and two o'clock the captain came again upon deck, with a cutlaſs in his hand, and ſtruck mr. Porter's black boy acroſs the ſhoulders, and bid him go down and dreſs his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's wounds. He alſo called for a light, and went down with the boy into the cabin, and made ſeveral ſtrokes at mr. Porter's body with the cutlaſs, exclaiming "What, d—n you, are you aſleep?"</p>
            <p>About day light, the captain called John Douthard in the cabin, who, on his entering it, found mr. Porter with his knees on the cabin-floor, and his face reſting on his bed, apparently lifeleſs. Capt. Corran ordered him to take hold of mr. Porter's legs, and lift him on the bed. While Douthard was in the act of doing this,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026534_0007_0FD08FFF12465458"/>
he made ſeveral ſtrokes at the body over his head, which ſo intimidated Douthard, that he dropped the body and ran upon deck, and acquainting his companions that the captain had murdered their paſſenger.—At 4 o'clock, the captain came upon deck, and ordered Douthard to go down into the cabin, and ſew mr. Porter up in a blanket, and told him that mr. Porter's ſervant ſhould aſſiſt him. Douthard refuſing to do this, he ſeized him and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by force to go into the cabin. By the captain's order, with the aſſiſtance of the black boy, he laid mr. Porter's body on one of his own blankets, ſewed him up in it, and tied a white handkerchief round his head. The body was mangled in a moſt ſhocking manner; there were large gaſhes about the hips, above a foot long—he was alſo much cut about the arms: the ſheet was very bloody, and much clotted blood was upon the floor, near the bed. After the body was ſewn up, captain Corran ordered Douthard and the black boy to throw it out of the cabin-window.—Douthard told him they were not able, and requeſted his permiſſion to call another perſon. He replied, that he would let no other perſon come into the cabin to help them. On finding, however, that they were not able to effect the purpoſe themſelves, he conſented that Henry Gilmore ſhould be called. By the aſſiſtance of Gilmore, the corpſe was brought upon deck, and laid upon a board in the gang-way. From the companion door to the gang-way, there was a conſiderable quantity of blood, which had run through the blanket as they were carrying the body along.—While the corpſe was lying in the gang-way, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain came upon deck, leaned over the quarter-rail, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his eyes with his hands, and appeared, for ſome minutes, much confuſed. He was rouſed from this reverie by John Douthard, who aſked him, if they ſhould heave the deceaſed overboard? He ſeemed ſtartled by the queſtion—but bid them "away with him." The body was accordingly committed to the ſea: immediately
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026534_0008_0FD090022F973E28"/>
after this, he ordered the veſſel to be kept away N. W. and ſet the ſtudding ſails.</p>
            <p>The mate was obliged to keep out of the captain's way, and was once forced to go in the fore-top—and at other times to conceal himſelf in the hold, as he had threatened to take away his life, and had purſued him apparently for that purpoſe, — being, whenever he came upon deck, conſtantly armed with a cutlaſs and a pair of piſtols.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of May, the captain ſent ſeveral meſſages to the mate, deſiring him to come on deck, and declaring that he ſhould not hurt him. The mate accordingly came up the fore ſcuttle; and being afraid to go aft, remained before the windlaſs. Capt. Corran obſerving his ſhyneſs, and that his eye appeared perpetually on him, told him <hi>he kept a d—d ſharp look out.</hi> After this he went down in the cabin, and kept for a conſiderable time hammering with a maul, which led the crew to fear that he wanted to force out the lumber-port in order to founder the veſſel, but it afterwards appeared, that he was driving a great number of ſpikes into the after-ſcuttle, to faſten it down.—About noon, Henry Gilmore, who had been ſteering, was relieved from the helm, and came forward, where the mate was, who inquired of him, what courſe they were ſteering? He informed him N. W.—On which the mate replied, that that courſe would fetch no port in Europe, and that he was apprehenſive that the captain had ill deſigns, both on them and the veſſel. The mate then conſulted as many of the crew as he conveniently could, who agreed to take the firſt opportunity to ſecure the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. About an hour afterwards, the captain came on deck, and having walked to the tiller ropes, and turned round to proceed down the deck, Joſeph York, who was then at the helm, ſeized his arms behind, and ſtruggling with him, the reſt of the crew came to his aſſiſtance, bound him, and brought him into the cabin, where they ſecured his hands with a pair of hand-cuffs which they found in his cheſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026534_0009_0FD090034A753348"/>Previous to his impriſonment, when he ordered the veſſel to be ſteered N. W. he informed the crew that they were near the Engliſh channel: But on the 30th of May, when the mate had got poſſeſſion of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, and was enabled to take an obſervation, he found they were very near the latitude of this place, and in about half an hour after they ſaw land; but a thick fog coming on, they were not able to make a harbour 'till four days afterwards, when they came to anchor in Roſe Bay, between La Have and Lunenburgh. On ſearching for the books of navigation, after confining the captain, they found that he had cut cut of every book the Table of the Sun's Declination.—Immediately on their arrival there, the mate went on ſhore, and made report to the magiſtrates of the tranſaction on board the brig Falmouth. The captain was carried on ſhore; and the depoſitions of the people being taken, he was committed to priſon, and afterwards brought to Halifax, where the court of admiralty was aſſembled, on Friday the 11th of July, at the court-houſe, for the trial of this unfortunate man, for the murder of Joſeph Porter, a gentleman who took paſſage on board the brig Falmouth, at Port Royal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jamaica.—The court being opened with the cuſtomary ſolemnities, the priſoner was arraigned, and pleading not guilty, was remanded for trial on Monday. On that day the trial commenced, and continued by adjournment, till Tueſday; when the examination on the part of the crown being ended—the priſoner was called upon by the court to make his defence: But declining to offer any thing in his defence—he was again recommitted, and the court adjourned to nine o'clock on Tueſday.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the court again aſſembled, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner having nothing to ſay in his defence, the court was ordered to be cleared. After a ſhort period, the court was again opened, and the priſoner brought to the bar, when his excellency governor Wentworth, the preſident of the court, addreſſed the priſoner: and declared, that

the court have deliberately conſidered all the evidence which had been ſubmitted to them, were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly of opinion, that he was guilty of the Murder of Joſeph Porter.

               </gap>ge, why ſentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced upon him? After he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating a few moments, the priſoner began an imperfect narration of the proceedings on board the brig Falmouth, from her ſailing from Jamaica, paſſing over the period when the Murder was committed; of which, however, he declared he was not Guilty. Having nothing further to offer, the preſident pronounced the awful Sentence of Death upon him, and he was adjudged to be hanged on Monday the 21ſt of July, between the hours of 10 and 1 o'clock, at Point Pleaſant, between the ebbing and flowing of the tide.</p>
            <p>On Monday, the 21ſt of July, this unhappy man was carried from the Priſon to the Beach at Point Pleaſant; where he ſatisfied, by the Forfeiture of his Life, the injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laws of the Country.</p>
            <p>The above Narrative contains every material fact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on the trial of William Corran; and perh there never was a trial in which every witneſs called, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly corroborated the teſtimony of his fellow—but, in the midſt of this coincidence of evidence, the mind is left at a loſs for a clew, by which to unravel the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that could induce Capt. Corran to commit a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, attended by ſo many aggravated circumſtances.—The witneſſes all declared, they were unable to aſſign any reaſon:- that they knew of no quarrel that ſubſiſted between him and the deceaſed, previous to the 24th of May, when he was ordered out of the ſtate-room:- that previous to that period, he had treated mr. Porter very kindly- and that his uniform conduct, both in the paſſage from Belfaſt to Jamaica, and on the paſſage home, till the 2d of May, had been ſuch as to give no juſt cauſe of complaint to any of them.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026534_0011_0FD0900D2D3472E0"/>Many have conjectured that a temporary inſanity, at leaſt, muſt have been the occaſion of this horrid deed. To this conjecture every feeling mind muſt wiſh to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, eſpecially when the teſtimony of reſpectable perſons, who have known capt. Corran previous to this tranſaction, unite in deſcribing him as a man diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the general quietneſs and inoffenſiveneſs of his manners.</p>
            <p>Captain Corran was born in Ireland, in the town of Port-a-Ferre in the County of Down. He was a man of a middle ſtature; of a robuſt, athletic habit, and poſſeſſing great bodily ſtrength and activity. He was in the 32d year of his age; and has left a father, two brothers and a ſiſter, to lament his untimely end.</p>
            <p>He was in this place a few year ago, being then a foremaſt hand on board a ſhip laden with proviſions from Ireland. His activity and behaviour were ſo pleaſing to his captain, that before he left this port, he appointed him mate of the ſhip.</p>
            <p>What a contraſt do the pleaſing ideas that floated in his imagination at this period of his firſt advancement in life, form with the painful reflections that muſt have crowded into his mind in his laſt painful viſit to Halifax! He feelingly noticed the contraſt himſelf—"Here," he exclaimed, "I was firſt made mate of a veſſel"—and heſitating, he ſeemed by his manner, as if he would have added, "Here all my worldly proſpects end—here I muſt make my exit."</p>
            <p>At the mention of his father's name, by a gentleman who attended him in his laſt moments, he burſt into a flood of tears, and appeared more affected by a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the diſtreſs which his death muſt occaſion to his parent, than he had ever ſhewn on his own account.</p>
