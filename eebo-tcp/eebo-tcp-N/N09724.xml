            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FOR the Wages of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle having, in this chapter, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the obligations Chriſtians are under to avoid ſin and lead a virtuous life; he, in the cloſe of it, declares the different ends of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked: how happy one will be, and how miſerable the other. See the two verſes immediately preceeding our text, <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed? for the end of thoſe things is death. But now being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruits unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</hi> And here our text follows— <hi>For the wages of ſin is death; but the gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable here, that the puniſhment of the wicked is called wages, to ſhew that it is the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of their crimes; and that the reward of the righteous, is called the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt, to ſhew that it is not merited by their good works, but is a free gift procured for them by Jeſus Chriſt, the great Mediator between God and man.— It is obſervable alſo, that the puniſhment of the wicked is called Death, and the reward of the righteous Life, to ſhew the greatneſs both of the one and of the other:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012375_0004_0F893F1F638CA988"/>
It being uſual in ſcripture to expreſs the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by life, and the greateſt miſery by death; life being the greateſt of bleſſings, as it is the foundation of all others, and death the greateſt of evils to thoſe who have their portion in this world, not only as it is painful and terrible in itſelf, but alſo as it deprives them of all their enjoyments, and fixeth them in a ſtate of miſery, which is the natural conſequence as well as puniſhment of their ſins.</p>
            <p>Our text, as it ſtands connected with the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing context, will lead to the conſideration of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things.</p>
            <p>That the end of a wicked life, will be everlaſting miſery. And</p>
            <p>That this is the due wages, or juſt demerit of the ſinners crimes.</p>
            <p>That the end of a religious life, will be eternal happineſs. And</p>
            <p>That this is, in no meaſure, merited by the good works of the righteous, but is the free gift of God. And</p>
            <p>That this unſpeakable gift, is procured for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered is,</p>
            <p>That the end of a wicked life will be everlaſting miſery; that is, to thoſe who continue in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and die without repentance. Some repent, and apply to Chriſt, and through him, obtain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. Yea God is ſome times pleaſed, to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to thoſe, who have lived in a long courſe of ſin; and have been guilty of very heinous tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; even ſuch as the wiſdom of human govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has thought fit to puniſh with death. I ſay God is ſometimes pleaſed, in great mercy to ſuch, to give them grace to repent and receive an offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and then they are plucked as brands out of the burning, and made happy forever. But when ſinners
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012375_0005_0F893F2025D52670"/>
refuſe to be reclaimed, and continue in their ſins till they leave the world; there is then nothing for them but <hi>a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to devour them.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x.27.</note> They then <hi>go away into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxv.46.</note> and <hi>ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jude 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By death, in our text, may be implied temporal as well as eternal death: For that is alſo the wages of ſin; as appears not only from that threatening of God to Adam—<hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> but alſo from what is ſaid in Rom. v.12. <hi>As by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And an untimely, violent, and ignominious death is the wages of thoſe atrocious crimes, which render the committers of them dangerous to others, and peſts to ſociety: Or when the public good requires their being made examples of, for a terror to others. This is the puniſhment which they receive from men. But this, how ſevere and terrible ſoever it may ſeem, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that, which if they die impenitent, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, more immediately from the hand of God. For, what is mainly intended by death, in our text, is eternal miſery; as appears by its being put in oppoſition to eternal life: And from the ſame oppoſition in Mat. xxv.46. where it is alſo expreſly ſaid to be everlaſting, <hi>theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012375_0006_0F893F20E3185830"/>It appears from theſe paſſages of ſcripture, that the puniſhment of the wicked, in another world will not only be everlaſting, but exceeding great in degree: Since it is repreſented by that which is capable of putting us to the greateſt miſery in this world; namely, burning in the hotteſt fire. And as their torment will be exquiſite, ſo it ſeems it will be without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or mitigation: They will not be allowed ſo much as a <hi>drop of water to cool their tongues.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xvi.23, 24, 25.</note> And into this dreadful ſtate of exquiſite and everlaſting miſery, ſinners paſs as ſoon as they leave the world. They go, with Judas, to their own place <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts i.25.</note> and in hell they lift up their eyes being in torment.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding this puniſhment is thus great and everlaſting; yet</p>
            <p>It is but the due wages and juſt demerit of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's crimes. It is what God has ordered, and therefore muſt be juſt and right: And what the ſinner will not have the leaſt reaſon to complain of.—Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? If any ſhould enquire, how it can conſiſt with the juſtice of God, to puniſh temporary crimes with eternal miſery let them conſider,</p>
            <p>That the dignity of the perſon againſt whom a crime is committed, greatly inhances the crime. The ſame crime, as to the matter of it, is much greater when committed againſt a king, than when committed againſt one of our fellow ſubjects: And doubtleſs the ſame crime committed againſt God, riſeth in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſuperiority and dignity above a temporal king: And in the ſame proportion, the puniſhment of it may be juſtly increaſed. 1 Sam. ii.25. If one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him? Again, let them conſider,</p>
            <p>That God ſets before men, life and death, rewards and puniſhments, and deals with them according to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012375_0007_0F893F21A3701908"/>
their own free choice: And that this is agreeable to juſtice, cannot be denied. We have the offer of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, for a ſhort life of obedience, as well as the threatening of eternal miſery, for a ſhort life of ſin: And it is not only left to us which we will chuſe, but various powerful means are uſed with us to induce us to avoid death and miſery, and to chuſe life and happineſs; and if after all we chuſe death, and wilfully expoſe ourſelves to the threatened puniſhment; is it not juſt in God to let us have our choice, and leave us to ſuffer the ſad effects of our folly? To uſe the words of another—
<q>Since the rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are both eternal, the terms on both ſides are equal; and ſince it is in our power, by the help of divine grace, to avoid the puniſhment, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the reward, the condition is ſuch, as any wiſe man would be thankful for; far from complaining, that the terrors of puniſhment are joined to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of reward; that all motives concur to make him happy; and that God, in his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, has uſed all means, both inward by his grace, and outward by his threats and promiſes, to bring him to ſalvation.</q>
Once more, let them conſider,</p>
            <p>That it ſeems to have been neceſſary, that eternal puniſhment ſhould be threatened againſt the violaters of the divine laws, ſince a leſs puniſhment would not have been ſufficient to ſecure man's obedience to them. We ſee, now eternal miſery is threatened, it is not ſufficient, with the greateſt part of mankind, to deter them from ſin; and if a leſs puniſhment had been threatened, it would have had a proportionably leſs influence. And God's end in threatening is not that he may puniſh, but that he might prevent men's wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which hath a neceſſary connection with miſery; and to excite them to a religious life, the end whereof is happineſs. Since then God's goodneſs was the foundation of his threatenings, it was certainly juſt for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012375_0008_0F893F2263DB7568"/>
him to threaten as he hath done; and if it was juſt for him to threaten, then it is juſt for him to execute his threatenings; and that he will execute them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his truth and veracity; Num. xxiii.19. <hi>God is not a man, that he ſhould lie, nor the Son of man, that he ſhould repent; hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Thus it appears that the wicked will be puniſhed, in the world to come, with everlaſting miſery; and that this is the due wages, and juſt demerit, of their crimes.— I now proceed to the next thing propoſed, which was to ſhew,</p>
            <p>That the end of a life of piety and virtue, in this world, will be eternal happineſs, in the world to come. This alſo, God, who is truth itſelf, hath declared and promiſed. See the verſe immediately preceeding our text,—<hi>But now being made free from ſin, and become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</hi> And Mat. xxvth chap. and laſt verſe, <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment; but the righteous unto life eternal.</hi> By life eternal, is not only intended, a ſtate of eternal exiſtence, for ſo the wicked will live forever; but by it is intended, a ſtate of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs. When the righteous leave this world, they leave all ſorrow and trouble with it, and enter into an unchangeable ſtate of eaſe, comfort and happineſs. They go into <hi>God's preſence,</hi> where there <hi>is fullneſs of joy,</hi> and are placed <hi>at his right hand,</hi> where there <hi>are pleaſures forever more.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The next thing propoſed was to ſhew, that this glorious and eternal ſtate of happineſs, is in no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012375_0009_0F893F2323000D70"/>
merited by the good works of the righteous, but is the free gift of God. The Phariſees among the Jews, thought they could do God much ſervice, and merit a reward of him, by their good works. And the Papiſts among Chriſtians, hold the ſame doctrine now. But this is a vain notion, and without the leaſt foundation, either in reaſon or ſcripture; but what is plainly condemned by both. Reaſon tells us, that as we are God's creatures, and depend entirely on him for life, breath, and all things, all the ſervice we can poſſibly render him, is moſt juſtly due to him. And therefore that when we have done our utmoſt, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demand a reward of him, for what we have done, any more, than we can demand a reward of our neighbour for paying him a debt, which we juſtly owed him. The ſcriptures alſo plainly teach us the ſame; Luke xvii.7—10. <hi>Which of you, having a ſervant plowing or feeding cattle, will ſay to him by and by, when he cometh from the field, go and ſit down to meat? And will not rather ſay unto him, make ready wherewith I may ſup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gird thyſelf and ſerve me, 'till I have eaten and drank, and afterward thou ſhalt eat and drink. Doth he thank that ſervant becauſe he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all theſe things that are commanded you; ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants; we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> As we are God's ſervants, all our time, ſtrength, and abilities—all we have and are, are his; and therefore we ſhould be conſtantly employed in his ſervice. And when we are ſo, we do but our duty, and muſt ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants. This we ought to ſay, if we did all that is commanded us, which we know we never do; and therefore we are not only unprofitable, but ſinful, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient ſervants. There is none that doeth good, and ſinneth not. And therefore inſtead of meriting any thing at God's hands, we ſtand in continual need of his pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012375_0010_0F893F23E24529B0"/>All the good things therefore which we receive at God's hands (or in other words, all we enjoy, for we receive all from him) are the effects of his free grace and bounty. Not unto us therefore, not unto us— but to his name the praiſe is due.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing propoſed, was to ſhew,</p>
            <p>That this unſpeakable gift of eternal life, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. We are all ſinners; and ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law; the penalty whereof is death. The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die; that is, be miſerable forever.</p>
            <p>By Sin we had ruined and deſtroyed ourſelves, but in God and Chriſt was our help found. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let us now make ſome improvement of what has been thus briefly ſaid on this ſubject, And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Will the end of a ſinful life, be eternal death and miſery? How exceeding fooliſh then are they who lead ſuch a life! And alas! how many ſuch are there! What multitudes <hi>live, as without God in the world, and as if they were made to ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures?</hi>— are under no reſtraint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>commit all manner of ſin with greedineſs</hi> How ſtrange is it that rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012375_0011_0F893F2588968450"/>
ſhould act ſo mad and fooliſh a part! Sinners may flatter themſelves, <hi>that they ſhall have peace though they walk in the imaginations of their hearts, adding drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs to thirſt</hi>; and to that innumerable other abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; but as ſure as God is juſt, and his word true, they <hi>ſhall not,</hi> unleſs they repent, and ſecure an intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>eſcape the damnation of hell.</hi> Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider where the way you are in will lead you; even down to the regions of eternal woe and miſery! <hi>the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone</hi>; into which you muſt ſoon inevitably fall, unleſs you alter your courſe. And oh! be perſuaded immediately to <hi>break off from your ſins by repentance, and from your iniquities, by turning unto God. Turn ye—turn ye, for why will ye die</hi> and be miſerable forever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is eternal miſery the due wages, and juſt demerit of ſin? This ſhews the evil nature and great maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. For how vile a thing muſt that be, which deſerves ſo great a puniſhment? God who knows the true nature of things, is repreſented in ſcripture as having the greateſt hatred to ſin: It is ſtiled <hi>the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable thing which his ſoul hates.</hi> Shall not we then deteſt and abhor it, and uſe our utmoſt endeavours to avoid it? When we are tempted to ſin, let us tremble at the thought; and ſay, with Joſeph, <hi>how ſhall we do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Is this puniſhment but the due wages, and juſt deſert of ſin? We hence ſee, who the wretched Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of hell muſt blame, that they are thus miſerable. They will be without excuſe: Their own conſciences will condemn them; and they will have none to blame but themſelves, that this awful puniſhment is inflicted on them. They will ſee that their condemnation is perfectly juſt; and that it is entirely their own fault that they periſh. And Oh! What an aggravation will it be of their miſery, to act on their folly and madneſs, in thus ruining and deſtroying themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012375_0012_0F893F262C914188"/>4. Is eternal life the gift of God, how great then is his goodneſs? And what gratitude, thankſgiving and praiſe are due to him, from all who have the offer of it? We have forfeited all favour at God's hands; and deſerve nothing but miſery and deſtruction: And yet he offers us unſpeakable and everlaſting happineſs, on the eaſy terms of the goſpel. What obligations are we then under to him! Shall we not <hi>love him with all our heart, and ſoul, and mind, and ſtrength?</hi> Shall we not <hi>praiſe him, while we live, and give thanks unto him, as long as we have a being?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Is eternal life the gift of God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt? Let us then ſeek for it as ſuch. Let us look upon it as what Chriſt hath procured for us, by what, in his great condeſcenſion and goodneſs, he has done and ſuffered for us. And let us apply to the Father, in his name, for it. Let us not think to merit it, by any thing we can do. For alas! What can we do? Our very beſt performances are attended with ſin.— And if they were not, they are but our duty; and we are ſtill unprofitable ſervants. But as they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended with ſin; the wages of that ſin, is death and miſery; we are by that ſin, tranſgreſſors of the law; and by the law we cannot be juſtified, for it condemns us: It <hi>curſes every one that continues not in all things that are written therein to do them.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. iii.10.</note> We all lie at mercy. If ever we are ſaved, it muſt be by grace, thro' Chriſt. <hi>By grace,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. ii.8.</note> We ſhould look upon ourſelves as loſt, and undone by ſin; and as deſtitute of all help, and hope, but in the mercy of God, and the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. And we ſhould give up all ſelf-dependence, and rely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on God's mercy, in the Redeemer, for pardon, grace and glory. And Oh! How earneſt ſhould we be in our ſupplications to the throne of grace; that God would be pleaſed, to behold us in his Son,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012375_0013_0F893F26E3B66908"/>
and extend his mercy to us, through him, without which, me muſt periſh everlaſtingly? Thoſe lines of Mr. Sternhold (however inconſiderable his ſkill in poetry was) have been admired, by ſome celebrated maſters of that art, as being moſt expreſſive of the abſolute need, poor guilty ſinners, as we all are, ſtand in of the divine mercy; and of the fervency and earneſtneſs, with which we ſhould pray for it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Mercy, good Lord! Mercy I crave:</l>
               <l>This is the total ſum.</l>
               <l>For mercy Lord, is all my ſuit:</l>
               <l>Lord, let thy mercy come.</l>
            </q>
            <p>May we all entertain theſe ſentiments, and adopt this language; or language equivalent. May we imitate the humble Publican; who, not preſuming to lift up his face before God, bowed his guilty head, and ſmote on his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner. In this way, we may hope to be heard, and juſtified, as he was.</p>
            <p>And in this way, <hi>Bryan Sheehen,</hi> you muſt look for ſalvation, if you expect to obtain it. You acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you are a great ſinner; and the wages of ſin, you ſee, is death; that is, exquiſite and everlaſting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. And this puniſhment, though inexpreſſibly great and awful, is but the due wages, and juſt deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a ſinner's crimes. It is what he really deſerves. Since God has threatened it, and has expreſly declared he will inflict it; we may depend upon it, it is juſt and right. Now to this awful puniſhment you are expoſed; and this you muſt ſuffer; yea and in a few hours enter into, unleſs God delivers you from it.— And what reaſon have you to expect this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance? God has expreſly told us, that unleſs a ſinner repents, he ſhall periſh. But have you repented? I wiſh—heartily wiſh, I could tell you, I really thought you was a true penitent; but I am conſtrained to ſay, thus much at leaſt, that I ſtand in great doubt of you.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012375_0014_0F893F27A4E678E0"/>
I think you have not, as yet, diſcovered ſufficient marks of real repentance. You have not appeared to have that lively ſenſe of your ſin and danger, and of the great things of religion, and another world, which might reaſonably be expected, from one in your cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. And what is moſt diſcouraging of all is, your denying the main fact, for which you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;<note n="*" place="bottom">He own'd he was guilty of Adultery, but not of a Ra<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </note> though it was proved to the full ſatisfaction both of the Judges and Jury, and almoſt all who heard your trial.</p>
            <p>And if you have not repented, but ſtill lie under the guilt of all your ſins—how ſad is your caſe!—How awful your condition!—Within a few hours of death and the eternal world; and in a temper of mind, fit only for the company of devils and damned ſpirits in hell. I don't ſay this, <hi>Bryan,</hi> to reproach you—far be it from me. I do it, that I may, if poſſible, now at length, rouſe and awaken you to a proper ſenſe of your condition; and excite you to uſe your utmoſt endeavours, to prepare for that great and awful change, which is ſo very near you, and which will determine your ſtate forever. I pity you from my heart, and almoſt tremble to conſider your danger.—There is, I believe, hardly a perſon, in this great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but pities you: And every chriſtian, I truſt, prays for you. And while others are thus concerned for you; is it poſſible that you ſhould not be greatly concerned for yourſelf—for your own immortal ſoul, now on the borders of the eternal world; and, it is to be feared, on the brink of hell!—That <hi>lake which burns with fire and brimſtone forever.</hi> One would think, that the thoughts of your danger would make you ſhudder; and cauſe every joint in you, to tremble.— For, if the king of Babylon trembled, when he ſaw the hand-writing on the wall, though he knew not what it was, but only imagined, from a conſciouſneſs of his guilt, that it was a threatening againſt himſelf,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012375_0015_0F893F286429CC18"/>
or a ſign of his approaching ruin; I ſay, if this great <hi>king's countenance was then changed, and his thoughts ſo troubled him,</hi> that <hi>the joints of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmite out againſt another</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. v.6.</note> what reaſon have you to tremble, when you know your days are now numbered and finiſhed, and that death, a change awful and important beyond all conception, is ſo near you? If Felix trembled, when Paul reaſoned of judgment to come; <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxiv.25.</note> what reaſon have you to tremble, now you are juſt going to appear before your Judge; and to receive a ſentence, perhaps, to a ſtate of woe and miſery, unutterable and everlaſting? Oh! <hi>Sheehen,</hi> be perſuaded, by theſe <hi>terrors of the Lord,</hi> to exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the utmoſt, in preparing for death, judgment, and eternity. Improve the ſhort ſpace, God is yet giving you, with the greateſt diligence. Your caſe, it is true, is exceeding hazardous and difficult; and if you are ſaved, it will be out of God's uſual way. But we have reaſon to believe, he is ſometimes pleaſed to ſhew mercy to ſinners, even at the laſt hour. So it is ſuppoſed the thief on the croſs was ſaved.<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is to be feared that this inſtance of ſucceſs in the thief on the croſs, has been abuſed by many to their eternal ruin. To prevent this in others, let them conſider, that ſome ſuppoſe he might repent ſome time before, while he was in goal, though it was not publicly known till he hung on the croſs. But if his repentance did not commence, 'till he was on the croſs, and ſo juſt going out of the world: Though it may give ſome grounds of hope to ſinners, when brought to this laſt extremity; eſpecially if they have been under diſadvantages in their education and way of life, and ſinned in a great meaſure through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; yet it gives no manner of encouragement to any, purpoſely to continue in their ſins, and put off their repentance to the laſt, with a dependance on God's mercy to ſave them, when they can indulge their luſts no longer. This is ſuch a vile abuſe of God's goodneſs, and ſo heinouſly wicked, that it may provoke him to cut them off ſuddenly in their ſins, or to deprive them of their reaſon when firſt ſeized with their laſt ſickneſs, or before they apprehend their danger: or to refuſe to hear them when they cry to him, in their diſtreſs and anguiſh; agreeable to that righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but awful threatening of his, which I earneſtly intreat all ſinners ſeriouſly to conſider, and lay to heart: Prov. xxiv.20. "Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you. Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me."</note> Don't
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012375_0016_0F893F2924059A78"/>
deſpair then, and give yourſelf up as loſt. While there is life, there is ſome reaſon to hope. God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is great; and Chriſt's blood is ſufficient to cleanſe from all ſin. Though your time is ſhort, God can enable you to do much in this ſhort time. In an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of ſuch infinite importance, a bare poſſibility of ſucceſs, ſhould be a ſufficient motive to the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertions. And the greater the difficulty and danger are, the more earneſt ſhould men be in their endeavours. Oh then! ſtrive with your might—be <hi>fervent in ſpirit,</hi> in this moſt momentous affair. Look back upon your paſt life, and call to mind as many of your ſins as you can; and confeſs and lament them before God, and ſtrive to be humble and penitent.— And let me once more remind you, that you cannot be a true penitent, unleſs you undo what you have done amiſs, as far as it is in your power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if what you have hitherto ſaid of the woman, who accuſed you, be falſe; if you do not unſay it, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in it to the laſt, there is no hope for you; but you muſt be miſerable forever: For <hi>all liars, ſhall have their part, in the lake that burns with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone forever.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxi.8.</note> Oh then! if you love your own ſoul, don't go out of the world, under the guilt of falſhood; nor of any other ſin; for the leaſt ſin, unrepented of, will be ſufficient to ſhut you out of heaven, and plunge you into hell. Confeſs and lament, all your ſins before God: Not only thoſe that have been more immediately againſt him; but thoſe, whereby you have injured your neighbour, and yourſelf. They are all tranſgreſſions of God's law, and muſt be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily repented of.

things; yet you muſt not truſt in them as meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that is, as what you can earn, or purchaſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and happineſs by. Whatever you have been taught, in your younger years; <note n="*" place="bottom">He was educated a Papiſt.</note> you may depend upon it, there is no proper merit in any thing you, or I, or any perſon on earth can do. Eternal life is the gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt. Seek for it then as ſuch: As what you are utterly unworthy of; and what you depend entirely on God, and Chriſt for. God hath given his Son, and his Son hath ſuffered and died, to make way for the beſtowment of it, on thoſe, who apply for it, with a humble, penitent, prayerful dependence on Chriſt. God pardons ſin, and receives ſinners to favour and happineſs, not for any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, but on the account of what Chriſt has done and ſuffered. <hi>Chriſt is the way, the truth and the life; none can come to the Father but by him.</hi> Apply then in Chriſt's name, and make mention of his righteouſneſs only. Bow your ſoul before God, and acknowledge you have forfeited all favour at his hands, and deſerve nothing but deſtruction; but beg of him to ſpare you for Chriſt's ſake, who is worthy though you are unworthy. Conſider yourſelf, as loſt, and undone by ſin; and as deſtitute of all help, but from God, through Chriſt. And caſt yourſelf on the mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Look to him, whom God hath ſet forth to be the propitiation for our ſins, to Jeſus Chriſt, that lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world. There is ſalvation in no other; neither is there any name given among men, whereby we can be ſaved, but Chriſt</hi>'s. Look to him then, by faith; truſt in his merits; and commit your ſoul into his hands, to be ſaved by him, in his own appointed way.<note n="†" place="bottom">This, ſays Dr. Doddridge, is the great act of ſaving faith. See his Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The riſe and progreſs of religion in the ſoul, page 69, a book which I heartily wiſh was in every family in the province, and throughout the land.</note> And the Lord have mercy on you, and work in you true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

            <p>I would now call upon all ſinners, here preſent, to take warning, by the unhappy priſoner before them. You ſee what ſin hath brought him to; and what it may bring you to, if you perſiſt in it.</p>
            <p>It is by degrees that ſinners are brought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit great and heinous ſins. When the Prophet told Hazael, what he would do to the Iſraelites—that he would rip up their women with child, and daſh their little ones againſt the ſtones: He cried out, What! is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do theſe things?<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap>
               </note> Yet, by indulging himſelf in ſin, he by degrees, grew bold and hardy enough, to do that, which he before ſeemed to abhor, and think it impoſſible he ſhould ever be guilty of. Oh then, take care, that you do not get a habit of ſinning? Don't venture to proceed any further in your evil ways; ſince you know not what monſters ſin may ſoon make of you, if you ſhould.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe who have been preſerved from great and heinous tranſgreſſions, be thankful for God's reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. Let young perſons take care to preſerve their innocence; and uſe their utmoſt endeavours to ſuppreſs the firſt motions to ſin. Let thoſe who have entered upon a courſe of ſin, come to an immediate ſtand: and tremble at the thought, of proceeding any further! And may all ſinners be enabled to ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite evil and danger of ſin, and be excited immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to break off from their ſins by repentance, and from their iniquities, by turning unto God. And let all be careful to ſhun and guard againſt all temptations to, and occaſions of ſin, particularly thoſe, which have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012375_0019_0F893F2B63083748"/>
proved ſo fatal to the poor criminal here before us.— Such as bad company, eſpecially that of lewd women. Bad company in general is exceeding enſnaring and dangerous; and has been the ruin of multitudes: And as to a whoriſh woman—her houſe is the way to hell; going down to the chambers of death. Avoid intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate drinking of ſpirituous liquors. This counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts the great deſign of the divine law; which is to reſtrain men's luſts and paſſions, and make them act as becomes rational creatures. I ſay, intemperate drinking, in direct oppoſition to this, clouds and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens reaſon, and inflames men's luſts and paſſions, and makes them fit inſtruments of the devil, to accompliſh his helliſh deſigns. This ruins both the ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thouſands and ten thouſands; and, I believe, I may add millions! How lamentable is it then, that it is become ſo common among us? Abſtain from the horrible ſin of profane curſing and ſwearing. A ſin which is highly provoking to Almighty God; and what greatly expoſes perſons to his awful judgments.</p>
            <p>Neglect not the aſſembling of yourſelves together, on the Lord's day, as the manner of too many among us is. This unhappy man owns, that for near twenty years paſt, he has ſeldom or never attended any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, till now ſince his condemnation. If he had ſteadily attended the public worſhip, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſuch religious impreſſions would have been made on his mind, as would have prevented his perpetrating the heinous crime, for which he muſt now die. But the time will not permit me to enlarge.</p>
            <p>To conclude,</p>
            <p>Let all ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well. And let them do it immediately, ſince their time is ſhort and uncertain. You pity the criminal, becauſe he has but a ſhort time—but a few hours to live. But conſider—your time perhaps, may be as ſhort, nay
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012375_0020_0F893F2C22434550"/>
ſhorter than his! Inſtead of hours, you may have but a few minutes to live. So it has been with others, who have thought themſelves as ſafe, as you think yourſelves now; and of ſeveral, not far from us, ſince this man was condemned. They have been ſeized ſuddenly, when about their buſineſs, or perhaps at their diverſions, and hurried, in a few moments, out of time, into eternity. Oh! conſider your awful danger and provide againſt it, by repenting immediately, and ſecuring an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby a title to life and happineſs. And the Lord make us all wiſe for our ſouls, and for eternity; and grant that whenever death comes, though it be never ſo ſoon or ſuddenly, we may be ready; and may die in peace, and ſleep in Jeſus; and in the morning of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appear, we alſo may appear with him in glory, and ſo be forever with the Lord.</p>

            <p>THE unhappy man, previous to whoſe execution the preceeding diſcourſe was delivered, was born in Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and educated in the principles of the Church of Rome. In his 20th year he came over to America, lived about a year at Boſton, and then went to Caſco-Bay, where he married, and had a number of children. His wife and all his children, except one, died ſome time before his tragical end. In the time of the laſt war, he was ſix years and an half in the army, and was finally at the taking of the Havannah. His buſineſs before and after this was that of a mariner. He was employed ſometimes in the fiſhery, ſometimes in the coaſting buſineſs, and ſometimes in foreign voyages. Though he appeared to be tolerably well acquainted with reading and writing, yet he was very ignorant in things of Religion, having almoſt entirely neglected the means of religious knowledge. For a number of years, he attended no publick worſhip, ſeldom looked into the bible, or any other book on religious ſubjects. And when he did read, he confined his reading, as he told me, to hiſtory and books of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. In conſequence of this, he was a moſt abandon'd ſinner; living as without God in the world, and as if he had been made to ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures. He was horribly profane; was addicted to intemperate drinking, whoring, lying, fighting and quarrelling, and almoſt all manner of wickedneſs; and finally was charged with, and convicted of the heinous crime which brought him to the gallows.</p>
            <p>It appeared on his trial that he went up, in the middle of the night, to the room where Mrs. <hi>Hollowell</hi> lay, found her aſleep, awaken her, and ſwore, if ſhe made the leaſt noiſe, he would kill her; and then ſtopping her mouth, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the atrocious crime. After which (to prevent, it ſeems, a pregnancy) he abuſed her with his hand, in an unheard-of, cruel and ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Inſomuch that her life was for ſome time almoſt deſpaired of; and ſhe was not able for ten days after to get off her bed without help. It was obſerved by the honourable court, that they never had a cauſe of this kind before them, wherein the evidence againſt the criminal was more full and clear. Yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied both the Rape and the abuſe after it; and inſiſted that his living with her, which he owned, was by mutual agreement. This be perſiſted in during the whole time of his confinement in goal, and even to the laſt; though he was often urged to confeſs the truth, and put in mind of the dreadful conſequence of going out of the world with a lie in his mouth. This has induced many to entertain hard thoughts of the woman, and to think more favourably of him: And many have ſaid he ought not to have been hanged.</p>
            <p>I think juſtice to the woman's character requires that this matter be ſet in its true light.<note n="*" place="bottom">He did not blame the Judges nor Jury; but ſaid the evidence was ſo full againſt him, that he knew he ſhould loſe his life, long before his trial was over. He blamed only the woman, and the other witneſſes.</note> Let it then be conſidered; that though it be ſhocking to think of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet there is no doubt but there have been inſtances of perſons going out of the world denying the truth, and it is to be feared many.<note n="†" place="bottom">Some no doubt endeavour to conceal their guilt, hoping thereby to obtain a reprieve, and entertaining this hope to the laſt, and fearing to confeſs their guilt, leaſt they ſhould prevent it, they die with a lie in their mouths.</note> One ſuch inſtance I ſuppoſe it is generally thought there was, not many years ſince, at Cambridge.— And conſidering <hi>Sheehen</hi>'s general character before his death, and eſpecially what I have heard of him ſince, I ſhould as readily believe it of him, as of any man I ever knew.</p>
            <p>Some ſuppoſe he was drunk and did not know, and therefore could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he did. But it is difficult to conceive how he ſhould be drunk, as not to know what he did, and yet be capable of committing ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a crime. I am therefore more inclined to believe he was one of thoſe hardened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> daring wretches (as the man, who was hanged at Cambridge, was ſuppoſed to be) who venture to go out of the world denying the truth.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Some put an end to their own lives, and ſo venture to go out of the world under the awful guilt of Self-murder: And this, it is ſaid, he himſelf ſometimes talked of doing.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, let it be conſidered, that notwithſtanding he pretended to have renounced the errors of the church of Rome, yet he died a Papiſt. This appears from the teſtimony of an intimate friend of his, of the ſame religion; who was with him
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012375_0022_0F893F2E68AA8D90"/>
in goal, and attended him at the gallows. Now we know one tenet of the church of Rome is, that they are not obliged, in ſome caſes, to perform their moſt ſolemn vows to Hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he might poſſibly think that if he might ſwear falſely, he might doubtleſs ſpeak falſely to Hereticks, as they call all whoſe religious principles differ from theirs.</p>
            <p>Again, let it be conſidered that it appears evidently from ſcripture, that God is ſometimes provoked to give heinous ſinners up to blindneſs of mind and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart—to leave them to the power of their luſts and of the devil. When they commence devils—contract the temper of the infernal ſpirits before they leave the world, and go to that place of puniſhment which is prepared for the devil and his angels. And when men are thus blinded and hardened, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and arguments of religion, have little or no influence on them. And that <hi>Sheehen</hi> was ſuch an one, there is great reaſon to believe, not only from his general character, and behaviour in goal, but alſo from what I am now going to relate.</p>
            <p>Two credible perſons have, ſince his execution, informed me, that there was a young woman, daughter of one <hi>Williams,</hi> of Gouldſborough, in the Eaſtern part of this province, abuſed in the ſame manner Mrs. <hi>Hollowell</hi> was. That ſhe was way-layed in the evening, between her father's houſe and a neighbour's; was ſeized, forced, and wounded to ſuch a degree, that her friends were obliged to carry her home, ſhe being unable to walk, and that the next morning early ſhe died. That the villain, who perpetrated this crime, returned after he had done it, to his companions, who, it ſeem, were before, or then, made acquainted with his enterprize; for ſuch wretches declare their ſin as Sodom: And that one of them told him he would probably have a child to maintain: He anſwered no, that he had taken care to prevent that, and that ſhe would never have a child by him, nor by any other man. That he was taken up, and confined in a private houſe, they having no goal, and that after two or three days, he made his eſcape. My informers were, at that time, both of them, at a place very near to Gouldſborough, heard the talk about the affair, and the man's name, and are pretty confident it was <hi>Bryan Sheehen.</hi> And they ſay, he was ſaid to be an Iriſhman, and a married man, and that his wife was at Caſco-Bay.<note n="*" place="bottom">He mentioned to me his going a coaſting from Caſco to the Eaſtward, in a little boat owned by him and another man.</note> Soon after this <hi>Sheehen</hi> left Caſco-Bay (fearing, I imagine, he ſhould be purſued and taken there) came to Marblehead, changed his name, and went a fiſhing from thence. While he was in goal, there was a man in town from Gouldſborough, or ſome place adjacent, who was aſked if he knew the man that abuſed <hi>Williams</hi>'s daughter, in that cruel, fatal manner. He ſaid he knew him well, that he had often ſeen him, and then deſcribed him: And the deſcription anſwered pretty exactly to <hi>Sheehen.</hi> He was told there was a man in goal, who ſome thought might be the ſame man. He went to the goal, ſaw him, and when he returned, declared he was the ſame. Now if he was the man, and I think there is the higheſt proba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bility that he was; there can be no doubt of his guilt with reſpect to Mrs. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowell.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">I was preſent when Mrs. <hi>Hollowell</hi> viſited him in goal after his condemnation, and obſerved critically, not only what they ſaid, but alſo their behaviour, and was of opinion that ſhe talked and behaved much more like an innocent perſon than he did.</note> And as I would hope there are not many ſuch monſters upon earth, ſo I think it a favour that the earth is rid of him.</p>
            <p>Let all hear, and fear and do no ſuch wickedneſs. Oh conſider the evil na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and dreadful conſequences of ſin! Dreadful in this world, and infinitely more ſo in the world to come. Exhort one another daily, leſt any be hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin.—hardened paſt remedy—hardened to their ruin here, and eternal miſery hereafter.</p>
            <p>Let women conſider their danger from whoremongers and adulterers: And let them be ſo far from truſting themſelves in their power, as to ſhun and avoid them, as they would bears and tygers.</p>
            <p>Let parents be careful to bring up their children in the fear of God. Let them conſider of what vaſt importance this is. That if they are neglected in childhood and youth, they may contract ſuch habits of ſinning, as it will be as hard for them to break off, as it is for the Ethiopian to change his ſkin or the leopard his ſpots; whereas if they are trained up in the way of religion, they will be likely never to depart from it.</p>
