            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE events related in the following pages, naturally became a frequent ≈øubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation with my children and my friends.

I confe≈øs to you, my dear boy, that often when I have endeavoured to amu≈øe you with the leading incidents and extraordinary vici≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitudes of fortune which chequered the whole of that ≈øeries of adventures, and ob≈øerved the eager attention with which, young though you were, you li≈øtened to the recital, the tender ≈øen≈øibility you di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo≈øed at ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages, and the earne≈øt de≈øire you expre≈ø≈øed that "I ≈øhould the whole relate," I have felt an almo≈øt irre≈øi≈øtible impul≈øe to indulge you with an accurate and faithful narrative, and have more than once ≈øat down at my bureau for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe: but ≈øober and deliberate reflection ≈øugge≈øted that it was too ≈øoon, and that, by complying with your de≈øire at ≈øuch a very early period of your life, I ≈øhould but render the great end I propo≈øed by it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033487_0013_0FF72210AB67A220"/>
abortive, fru≈øtrate the in≈øtruction which I meant to convey, and impre≈øs the mere incident on your memory, while the moral deducible from it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily evaporate, and leave no trace, or rather excite no idea, in a mind not ≈øufficiently matured for the conception of ab≈øtract principles, or prepared by practice for the deduction of moral inferences.</p>
               <p>I am aware that there are many people, who, contemplating only the number of your days, would con≈øider my undertaking this arduous ta≈øk, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to your reflection, even now, premature: but this is a ≈øubject on which I have ≈øo long and ≈øo deliberately dwelt, which I have di≈øcu≈ø≈øed with ≈øo much care, and examined with ≈øuch impartiality, that I think I may be acquitted of vanity, though I ≈øay I am competent to form a judgment on it. The re≈øult of that judgment is, that I am determined to indulge you without further delay; and I tru≈øt that you will not, on your part, render it an empty indulgence, but, on the contrary, by turning every circum≈øtance to its be≈øt u≈øe, by converting every feeling which the≈øe pages may excite in your heart into matter of ≈øerious reflection, and by making every event (as it happens to de≈øerve) an example to promote either emulation on the one hand, or circum≈øpection and caution on the other, ju≈øtify me in that opinion of you on which I found this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
               <p>I remember, that when, at an early age, I entered upon that ≈øtage of cla≈ø≈øical education at which you are now, at an earlier age, arrived‚ÄîI mean the Aeneid‚ÄîI was not only captivated with the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ≈øtory of the Hero, in the ≈øecond Book, but drew certain inferences from parts of it, which I ≈øhall never forget, and which afterwards ≈øerved to give a direction to the growth of my ≈øentiments on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of a ≈øimilar nature: above all, the filial piety of Aeneas made a deep impre≈ø≈øion on my mind, and,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033487_0014_0FF722123B3B6FD8"/>
by imperceptibly exciting emulation in my bo≈øom, augmented con≈øiderably the natural warmth of my affection and re≈øpect for my father. It is under the recollection of this ≈øen≈øation, and a firm per≈øua≈øion that your heart is fully as ≈øu≈øceptible of every tender impre≈ø≈øion, and your under≈øtanding as fit for the reception of u≈øeful hi≈øtory, as mine was then, that I overlook your extreme youth, and write to you as though you were an adult. If there be a thing on earth of which I can boa≈øt a perfect knowledge, it is my FREDERICK'S heart: it has been the object of my uninterrupted ≈øtudy almo≈øt ≈øince it was fir≈øt capable of manife≈øting a ≈øen≈øation; and, if I am not very much mi≈øtaken in it indeed, the lively intere≈øt he feels in the occurrences of his father's life, is the re≈øult, not of idle curio≈øity, but unbounded filial affection. Such an amiable motive ≈øhall not be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in its end; and while I di≈øcharge the duty of a parent in gratifying it, I ≈øhall be encouraged and ≈øu≈øtained under my labours by the ≈øanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that he will derive from my exertions the mo≈øt ≈øolid advantages in his future progre≈øs through life. As tho≈øe advantages are expected al≈øo to extend to my dear boy JOHN, who≈øe tender years di≈øqualify him from making the ≈øame immediate reflections on the various ≈øubjects as they occur, my FREDERICK will perceive that it becomes his duty, not only as a good ≈øon, but as an affectionate brother, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt and enforce them upon his mind, to explain to him the difficulties, and furni≈øh him with his rea≈øonings and inferences on them, ≈øo as that they may make, as nearly as po≈ø≈øible, equal impre≈ø≈øions on the heart and under≈øtanding of both. <q>"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum:"</q> And though few have the felicity to be warned by other men's misfortunes or faults, becau≈øe they ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom make deep impre≈ø≈øions on their feelings, I am

               <p>A VARIETY of unpropicious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances gave ri≈øe to my journey to the Ea≈øt Indies, while dome≈øtic calamity marked my departure, and, at the very out≈øet, gave me a foreta≈øte of tho≈øe mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which fate had re≈øerved to let fall upon me in the ≈øequel. The channels from which I drew the means of ≈øupporting my family in that ≈øtyle which their rank and connections obliged them to maintain, were clogged by a coincidence of events as unlucky as unexpected: the war in India had interrupted the regular remittance of my property from thence: a ≈øevere ≈øhock which unbounded genero≈øity and beneficence had given to the affairs of my father, rendered him incapable of maintaining his u≈øual punctuality in the payment of the income he had a≈ø≈øigned me; and, to crown the whole, I had been deprived, by death, of two lovely children (your brother and ≈øi≈øter), whom I loved not le≈øs than I have ≈øince loved you and your brother.</p>

               <p>Of all the weakne≈ø≈øes to which the human mind is ≈øubject, ≈øuper≈øtition is that again≈øt which I would have you guard with the utmo≈øt vigilance. It is the mo≈øt incurable canker of the mind. Under its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting dominion, happine≈øs withers, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding becomes ob≈øcured, and every principle of joy is bla≈øted. For this rea≈øon I wi≈øh to account for tho≈øe pre≈øages, by referring them to their true phy≈øical cau≈øes, in order thereby to prevent your young mind from receiving, from what I have written, any injurious impre≈ø≈øion, or ≈øuper≈øtitious idea of <hi>pre≈øentiment,</hi> as it is fa≈øhionably denominated.</p>
               <p>If the mind of man be examined, it will be found naturally prone to the contemplation of the future‚Äî its flights from hope to hope, or fear to fear, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in≈øen≈øibly from objects pre≈øent and in po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, to tho≈øe remote and in expectation‚Äîfrom po≈øitive good to ≈øuppo≈øitious better, or from actual melancholy to imaginary misfortune. In the≈øe ca≈øes, the mind never fails to ≈øee the pro≈øpect in colours derived from the medium through which it is viewed and exaggerated by the magnifying power of fancy. Thus my mind, labouring under all the unea≈øine≈øs I have de≈øcribed, ≈øaw every thing through the gloomy medium of melancholy, and, looking forward, foreboded nothing but misfortune: acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent afterwards fulfilled tho≈øe forebodings; but accident, nay, the mo≈øt trifling change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, might po≈ø≈øibly have ≈øo totally changed the face of my ≈øub≈øequent progre≈øs, that good fortune, in≈øtead of mi≈øadventure, might have been my lot,

and ≈øo all my forebodings been as illu≈øory and falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as all ≈øuch phantoms of the imagination really are. Thus I argue now‚Äîand I am ≈øure I argue truly; but if rea≈øon be not timely called in, and made, as it were, an habitual inmate, it avails but little again≈øt the overbearing force of ≈øuper≈øtition, who, when ≈øhe once gets po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the mind, holds her ≈øeat with unrelenting tenacity, and, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a whole ho≈øt of horrors, with de≈øpair at their head, to her aid, entrenches her≈øelf behind their formidable powers, and bids defiance to the a≈ø≈øaults of rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>Thus it fared with me‚ÄîUnder the dominion of a gloomy pre≈øentiment, I left London; and my journey down to Margate, where I was to take ≈øhipping, was, as SHAKSPEARE emphatically ≈øays, <q>a phanta≈øm, or a hideous dream‚Äîand my little ≈øtate of man ≈øuffered, as it were, the nature of an in≈øurrection:</q>‚Äîthe chaos within me forbade even the approach of di≈øcriminate reflection; and I found my≈øelf on board the packet, bound to O≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, without having a ≈øingle trace left upon my mind, of the intermediate ≈øtages and incidents that happened ≈øince I had left London.</p>
               <p>It has been ob≈øerved‚Äîand I wi≈øh you always to carry it in memory, as one of the be≈øt con≈øolations under affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE pride of the Engli≈øh is remarked all over the globe, even to a proverb! But pride is a word of ≈øuch dubious meaning, ≈øo undefined in its ≈øen≈øe, and ≈øtrained to ≈øuch various imports, that you ≈øhall hear it violently execrated by one, and warmly applauded by another‚Äîthis denouncing it as a ≈øin of the fir≈øt magnitude, and that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it to be the mo≈øt vigilant guardian of human virtue. Tho≈øe differences in opinion ari≈øe not from any defect in the intellects of either, but from each viewing the ≈øubject in that one point in which it fir≈øt ≈øtrikes his eye, or be≈øt ≈øuits his ta≈øte, his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or his prejudices. I have no doubt, however, but a full con≈øideration of the ≈øubject would ≈øhew, that pride, as it is called, is only good or bad as the object from which it ari≈øes is mean or magnificent, culpable or meritorious. That noble pride which ≈øtimulates to extraordinary acts of genero≈øity and magnanimity, ≈øuch as, in many in≈øtances, has di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed, above all others, the nobility of Spain, exacts the homage and admiration of mankind: But I fear very much that our Engli≈øh pride is of another growth, and ≈ømells too rankly of that over-≈øtrained commercial ≈øpirit which makes the ba≈øis of the pre≈øent grandeur of Great Britain, but which, in my humble judgment, rai≈øes only to deba≈øe her

In ≈øhort, we are approaching, I fear, with daily accelerated ≈øteps, to the di≈øpo≈øition and ≈øordid habits of the Dutch, of whom Doctor GOLDSMITH ≈øo very pertinently and truly ≈øpeaks, when he ≈øays, <q>"Ev'n Liberty it≈øelf is barter'd here!"</q>

               <p>Without leading your mind through a maze of di≈øqui≈øition on this ≈øubject, which might fatigue with ab≈øtru≈øene≈øs and prolixity, I will bring you back to the point from which the matter ≈øtarted, and content my≈øelf with remarking, that the pride of the Engli≈øh, ≈øpeaking of it as a part of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal character, is the meane≈øt of all pride. The inflation of bloated, overgrown wealth, an over-weening affection for money, an idolatrous wor≈øhip of gain, have ab≈øolutely confounded the general intellect, and warped the judgment of the many to that exce≈øs, that, in e≈øtimating men or things, they always refer to "what is he worth?" or, "what will it fetch?"

The people ≈øeemed cheerful and happy, and the markets were tolerably ≈øupplied.</p>
               <p>Several fine canals run in a variety of directions from Bruges: by one of them, boats can go, in the cour≈øe of a ≈øummer's day, to O≈øtend, Neuport, Furnes, and Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The water of tho≈øe canals is ≈øtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without the lea≈øt motion; yet they can, in half an hour, be all emptied, and fre≈øh water brought in, by means of their well-contrived ≈ølui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This water, however, is never u≈øed for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or even for culinary purpo≈øes; a better ≈øort being conveyed through the town by pipes from the

two rivers Lys and Scheldt, as in London; for which, as there, every hou≈øe pays a certain tax.</p>
               <p>Although the trade of this city has, like that of all the Low Countries, been gradually declining, and daily ≈øucked into the vortices of Briti≈øh and Dutch commerce, there were, till the French en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it, many rich merchants there, who met every day at noon in the great market-place, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tran≈øact bu≈øine≈øs, which was chiefly done in the Flemi≈øh language, hardly any one in it ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing French; a circum≈øtance that by this time, is much altered‚Äîfor they have been already made, if not to ≈øpeak French, at lea≈øt to ≈øing <hi>Ca-ira,</hi> and dance to the tune of it too, to ≈øome purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>The once-famed grandeur of this city con≈øi≈øted chiefly, like that of all grand places in the dark periods of Popery, of the gloomy piles, the o≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious frippery, and unwieldy ma≈ø≈øes of wealth, accumulated by a long ≈øeries of monki≈øh impo≈øture ‚Äîof Gothic ≈øtructures, of enormous ≈øize and ≈øable a≈øpect, filled with dreary cells, calculated to ≈øtrike the ≈øouls of the ignorant and enthu≈øia≈øtic with holy horror, to in≈øpire awe of the places, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the per≈øons who dared to inhabit them, and, by enfeebling the rea≈øon with the mixed ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of horror, wonder, and reverence, to fit the credulous for the reception of every impo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however gro≈øs in conception, or bungled in execution.

               <p>What a powerful engine has ≈øuper≈øtition been, in the cunning management of prie≈øts! How lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to think, that not only all who believed,

up, in honour of the Supreme Being. This city having been for centuries the ≈øee of a bi≈øhop, who is ≈øuffragan to the archbi≈øhop of Mecklin, and at the ≈øame time hereditary chancellor of Flanders, it is not to be wondered at, if eccle≈øia≈øtical indu≈øtry ≈øhould have ama≈ø≈øed ≈øome of tho≈øe little trinkets which con≈øtitute the chief or only value of their church. The mitre of this place conveys to the head that wears it a dioce≈øe containing ≈øix cities, from the names of which you will be able to form ≈øome ≈ømall judgment of the opulence of one poor ≈øon of ab≈øtinence and mortification.‚ÄîTho≈øe cities are, in the fir≈øt place, Bruges it≈øelf, then O≈øtend, Sluys, Damme, Middleburgh in Flanders, and Oudenberch‚Äînot to mention one hundred and thirty-three boroughs and villages; and if you could compute the number of inferior clergy with which the ≈øtreets and highways are filled, you would be thunder≈øtruck. There, and in all tho≈øe Popi≈øh countries, they may be ≈øeen, with grote≈øque habits and bald pates, buzzing up and down like bees, in ≈øwarms, (a precious hive!)‚Äîand, with the mo≈øt vehement prote≈øtations of voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in their mouths, and eyes uplifted to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ≈øcrambling for the good things of the earth with the eagerne≈øs of a pack of hounds, and the rapacity of a whole roll of lawyers! With loaded thighs (I might ≈øay, loaded arms too, for they have large pockets even in their ≈øleeves, for the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moveables), they return to the great hive, where, contrary to the law of bees, the drone lives in idle ≈øtate, and he plunders them: contrary, too, to the habits of tho≈øe u≈øeful in≈øects, they bani≈øh the queen bee, and ≈øuffer no female to approach their cells, but keep them in contiguous hives, where, under cover of the night, they vi≈øit them, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil in private that which they deny in public‚Äîthe great command of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:033487_0040_0FF7225D10E1AF90"/>The fir≈øt building in nominal rank, though by no means the fir≈øt in value, is the great cathedral, which has at lea≈øt bulk, antiquity, and gloomine≈øs enough to recommend it to the faithful. It is by no means unfurni≈øhed within, though not in ≈øo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a manner as to induce me to fill a letter with it. In a word, it is an old Popi≈øh cathedral, and cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed wanting in wealth: at the time I write, it has been ≈øtanding no le≈øs a time than nine hundred and twenty-nine years, having been built in the year 865.</p>
               <p>The next that occurs to me, as worthy of notice, is the church of Notre Dame, or that dedicated to <hi>our Lady</hi> the Virgin MARY. This is really a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ≈øtructure of the kind‚Äîindeed magnificent. Its ≈øteeple is beyond conception ≈øtupendous, being ≈øo very high as to be ≈øeen at ≈øea off O≈øtend, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not elevated in the ≈ømalle≈øt degree by any ri≈øe in the ground; for, ≈øo very flat is the whole intermediate country, that I believe it would puzzle a ≈økilful leveller to find two feet elevation from high-water-mark at O≈øtend up to this city. The contents of this church are corre≈øpondent to its external appearance‚Äîbeing enriched and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a va≈øt variety of ≈øacerdotal trinkets, and fine tombs and monuments. As to the former, the ve≈øtments of that ≈øame THOMAS A BECKET whom I mentioned in my la≈øt, make a part of the curio≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties depo≈øited in this church: this furious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible impo≈øtor was archbi≈øhop of Canterbury; and his ≈øtruggles to en≈ølave both the king and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England, and make them tributary to the Pope, have canonized him, and obtained the very honourable depot I mention for his ve≈øtments. To do ju≈øtice, however, to the ≈øpirit and ≈øagacity of the holy fathers who have ≈øo long taken the pains to pre≈øerve them, it mu≈øt be commemorated, that they are, or at lea≈øt were ≈øet with diamonds, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033487_0041_0FF7225EA1AE1200"/>
other precious ≈øtones! Probably, among the many prie≈øts who have, in ≈øo many centuries, had the cu≈øtody of tho≈øe divine relics, ≈øome one, more ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious than the re≈øt, might conceive, that, to lie in a church, and be ≈øeen by the all-believing eyes of the faithful, a little coloured gla≈øs was ju≈øt as good as any precious ≈øtone, and wi≈øely have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the originals to ≈øome better purpo≈øe. If ≈øo, it will be ≈øome con≈øolation to Holy Mother Church to reflect, that ≈øhe has bilked the <hi>Sans-culottes,</hi> who certainly have got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Saint THOMAS A BECKET'S ≈øacerdotal petticoats; and, if they have been ≈øound enough to ≈øtand the cutting, have, by this time, converted them into comfortable cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigning breeches. O mon≈øtrous! wicked! abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable!‚Äîthat the Royal MARY, ≈øi≈øter to the great Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, ≈øhould, ≈øo long ago as the Reformation, have bought at an immen≈øe price, and depo≈øited in the trea≈øury of the church of <hi>our Lady</hi> the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin MARY, the ve≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a ≈øaint, only to make breeches, in the year 1794, for a French ≈øoldier! The time has been, when the bare ≈øugge≈øtion of ≈øuch ≈øacrilege would have turned the brain of half the people of Chri≈øtendom: but tho≈øe things are now better managed.</p>
               <p>Of the tombs in this church, I ≈øhall only mention two, as di≈øtingui≈øhed from the re≈øt by their co≈øtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, magnificence, and antiquity. They are made of copper, well gilt. One of them is the tomb of MARY, heire≈øs to the Ducal Hou≈øe of Burgundy; and the other, that of CHARLES (commonly called <hi>the Hardy</hi>), Duke of Burgundy, her father.</p>
               <p>In Bruges there were four great abbeys, and an amazing number of convents and nunneries. The buildings, I pre≈øume, yet ≈øtand; but there is little doubt that their contents, of every kind, have been,

before this, put <hi>in requi≈øition,</hi> and each part of them, of cour≈øe, applied to its natural u≈øe.</p>
               <p>The church once belonging to the Je≈øuits, is built in a noble ≈øtyle of architecture: and that of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans has not only its external merits, but its internal value; for, be≈øides the u≈øual ≈øuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rich chalices, &amp;c. it po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes ≈øome very great curio≈øities‚Äî</p>

               <p>Secondly, a picture‚Äîand ≈øo extraordinary a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! Before I de≈øcribe it, I mu≈øt appri≈øe you that your faith mu≈øt be almo≈øt as great as that of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh Chri≈øtian to believe me‚Äîto believe that the human intellect ever ≈øunk ≈øo low as, in the fir≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, to conceive, and, in the next, to harbour and admire, ≈øuch a piece.

               <p>This picture, then, is the repre≈øentation of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage!‚Äîbut of whom? why, truly, of JESUS CHRIST with Saint CATHARINE of Sienna.

               <p>AS I was going to the barque, at Bruges, to take my departure for Ghent, the next town in my route, I was ≈øurpri≈øed to ≈øee a number of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, bu≈øy, poor fellows, crowding round my effects, and ≈øeizing them‚Äî≈øome my trunk, ≈øome my portmanteau. &amp;c. I believe two or three to each: but my a≈øtoni≈øhment partly ≈øub≈øided when I was told that they were porters, who plied on the canal, and about the city, for ≈øub≈øi≈øtence, and only came to have the <hi>honour</hi> of carraying my baggage down to the ve≈ø≈øel. Noting their eagerne≈øs, I could not help ≈ømiling.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033487_0045_0FF7226AC64EEDE0"/>
work. Every one of my men demanded a remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for his labour: one man could have ea≈øily done the work of five‚Äîbut I re≈øolved not to ≈øend them away di≈øcontented: he is but a ≈øordid churl that would; and I paid them to their full ≈øatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here, my dear FREDERICK, let me offer you (≈øince it occurs) my parental advice on this point‚Äîfrom the practice of which you will gain more ≈øolid felicity than you can po≈øsibly be aware of now: never weigh ≈øcrupulou≈øly the value of the work of the poor; rather exceed than fall ≈øhort of rewarding it: it is a very, very ≈ømall thing, that will put them in good humour with you and with them≈øelves, and relax the hard furrows of labour into the ≈øoft ≈ømile of gratitude‚Äîa ≈ømile which, to a heart of ≈øen≈øibility ≈øuch as yours, will, of it≈øelf, ten-thou≈øand-fold repay you, even though the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice of it ≈øhould abridge you of a few of tho≈øe things called plea≈øures, or detract a little from the weight of your pur≈øe.</p>
               <p>Being again ≈øeated in my barque, I ≈øet off for Ghent, a city lying at a di≈øtance of twenty-four miles from Bruges. I mu≈øt here remark to you, that the company one meets in tho≈øe ve≈ø≈øels is not always of the fir≈øt rank; it is generally of a mixed, motley kind: but to a man who carries along with him, through his travels, a love for his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a de≈øire to ≈øee men, and their cu≈øtoms and manners, it is both plea≈øant and eligible‚Äîat lea≈øt I thought it ≈øo, and enjoyed it. There were tho≈øe among≈øt us who ≈øpoke rather loftily on that ≈øubject: I ≈øaid nothing; but it brought to my mind a reflection I have often had occa≈øion to concur in, viz. that a fa≈øtidious u≈øurpation of dignity (happily denominated <hi>≈øtateline≈øs</hi>) is the never-failing mark of an up≈øtart or a blockhead. The man of true digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ≈øelf-erect and ≈øtrong, needs not have recour≈øe, for ≈øupport, to the comparative wretchedne≈øs of his

fellow-creature, or plume him≈øelf upon ≈øpurious ≈øuperiority. You will under≈øtand me, however! When I ≈øay, "the man of true dignity," I am far, very far, from meaning a lord, a ≈øquire, a banker, or a general officer‚ÄîI mean a man of intrin≈øic worth‚Äîhomo emunctae naris‚Äîone who, in every ≈øtation into which chance may throw him, feels firm in the con≈øciou≈øne≈øs of right‚Äîwho can ≈øee and cheri≈øh merit, though enveloped and concealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a ≈øhabby ≈øuit of clothes‚Äîand who ≈øcorns the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Although the face of that part of the country through which we are now pa≈ø≈øing, like that of the preceding ≈øtage from O≈øtend to Bruges, wants di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity, it has its charms, and would be particularly delightful in the eye of an Engli≈øh farmer; for it is covered with the thicke≈øt verdure on each ≈øide of the canal, and the banks are decorated all along by rows of ≈øtately trees, while the fields in the back ground are cultivated to the highe≈øt degree of perfection, and bear the a≈øpect of producing the mo≈øt abundant harve≈øt.</p>
               <p>You will be able to form a judgment of the trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling expence of travelling in this country, from my expences in this ≈øtage of twenty-four miles. I had an excellent dinner for about fifteen pence of our money; my pa≈ø≈øage co≈øt me but ≈øixteen more, amounting in all to two ≈øhillings and ≈øeven pence: compare that with travelling in England, where one cannot ri≈øe up from an indifferent dinner, in

               <p>Ghent is the capital of Flanders, and is to be reckoned among the large≈øt cities of Europe, as it covers a ≈øpace of ground of not le≈øs than ≈øeven miles in circumference; but there is not above one half of that occupied with buildings, the greater part being thrown into fields, gardens, orchards, and plea≈øure-grounds. Situated on four navigable rivers, and inter≈øected into no fewer than twenty-≈øix i≈ølands by a number of canals, which afford an ea≈øy, cheap, and expeditious carriage for weighty merchandize, it may be con≈øidered, in point of local advantages for commerce, ≈øuperior to mo≈øt cities in Europe; while tho≈øe i≈ølands are again united by about a hundred bridges, ≈øome great and ≈øome ≈ømall, which contrbute much to the beauty of the city.</p>

               <p>Ghent was once extremely well fortified, and calculated, by nature as well as by art, to repel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment. It had a very ≈øtrong ca≈øtle, walls, and ditches; and now, though not otherwi≈øe ≈øtrong, the country may, by ≈øhutting up the ≈ølui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be, for above a mile round, laid in a very

               <p>This town is di≈øtingui≈øhed by the nativity of two celebrated characters: one was the famous JOHN of Gaunt, ≈øon of King EDWARD the third of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gland; the other, the Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, who was born there in the year 1500.</p>
               <p>It was in this city that the Confederation of the States, well known under the title of the Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ghent, which united the Provinces in the mo≈øt la≈øting union of intere≈øt and laws, was held: this union was chiefly owing to the vigorous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted efforts of WILLIAM the Fir≈øt, Prince of Orange, to who≈øe valour and virtue may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the independence of the United States.</p>
               <p>In this city there were computed to be fifty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of trade≈ømen, among whom were manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured a variety of very curious and rich cloths, ≈øtuffs, and ≈øilks: it is certain, that the woollen manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture flouri≈øhed here before it had made the ≈ømalle≈øt progre≈øs in England, who≈øe wool they then bought. There was al≈øo a good branch of linen manufacture here, and a pretty bri≈øk corn trade, for which it was locally well calculated. You will ob≈øerve, once for all, that in ≈øpeaking of this country, I generally u≈øe the pa≈øt ten≈øe; for, at pre≈øent, they are utterly undone.</p>
               <p>Ghent was the ≈øee of a bi≈øhop, who, like the bi≈øhop of Bruges, was ≈øuffragan to the archbi≈øhop of Mechlin. Thus, in mo≈øt Chri≈øtian countries, are the intellects, the con≈øciences, and the ca≈øh too, of the people, ≈øhut up and hid from the light, by prie≈øt within dean, and dean within bi≈øhop‚Äîlike

a ring in the hand of a conjurer, box within box ‚Äîtill at la≈øt they are enveloped in the great recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of all deception, the capacious pocket of the archbi≈øhop. Let not ≈øceptered tyrants, their legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their ≈øcaffolds, and their ≈øwords, bear all the infamy of the ≈ølavery of mankind! Opinion, opinion, under the management of fraud and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øture, is the engine that forges their fetters!!‚Äî JANSENIUS, from whom the Jan≈øeni≈øts took their name, was the fir≈øt bi≈øhop of this place; and the late bi≈øhop, I think, may be reckoned the la≈øt.</p>
               <p>The municipal government of this city is correct, and well calculated to ≈øecure internal peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The chief magi≈øtrate is the high bailiff; ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to whom are burgoma≈øters, echivins, and coun≈øellors.</p>
               <p>Ghent is not deficient in ≈øtately edifices; and, true to their ≈øy≈øtem, the holy fathers of the church have their ≈øhare, which, in old Popi≈øh countries, is at lea≈øt nineteen twentieths. In the middle of the town is a high tower, called Belfort tower: from whence there is a delightful pro≈øpect over the whole city and its environs. Mona≈øteries and churches, there, are without number; be≈øides ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals and market-places: that called Friday's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, is the large≈øt of all, and is adorned with a ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of CHARLES the Fifth, in his imperial robes. The ≈øtad-hou≈øe is a magnificent ≈øtructure‚ÄîSo is the cathedral, under which the reverend fathers have built a ≈øubterraneous church. What deeds are tho≈øe which ≈øhun the light! Why tho≈øe holy patriarchs have ≈øuch a de≈øire for burying them≈øelves, and working like moles under ground, they them≈øelves be≈øt know, and I think it is not difficult for others to conjecture.</p>
               <p>This cathedral, however, is well worth atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on account of ≈øome capital pictures it contains. The marble of the church is remarkably fine, and

the altar-piece ≈øplendid beyond all po≈ø≈øible de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, indeed, in all the others, there are paintings, eminent for their own excellence, and for the celebrity of the ma≈øters who painted them.</p>
               <p>In the mona≈øtery of St. PIERRE, there is a grand library, filled with books in all languages; but it is chiefly remarkable for the ≈øuperlative beauty of its ceiling, one half of which was painted by RU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BENS.</p>
               <p>Thus you may perceive, my dear FREDERICK, the charity of the clergy!‚Äîhow, in pure pity for the ≈øins of mankind, and in paternal care of their ≈øouls, they exact from the laity ≈øome atonement for their crimes, and con≈øtrain them at lea≈øt to repent ‚Äîand, with unparalleled magnanimity, take upon them≈øelves the vices, the gluttony, the avarice, and the ≈øen≈øuality, of which they are ≈øo careful to purge their fellow-creatures.</p>

               <p>HAVING given you a general outline of the city of Ghent, I ≈øhall now proceed to give you an account of one of the mo≈øt excellent, and certainly the mo≈øt intere≈øting, of all the curio≈øities in that place.

               <p>Both the father and the ≈øon were, for ≈øome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence again≈øt the ≈øtate, condemned to die. Some favourable circum≈øtances appearing on the ≈øide of the ≈øon, he was granted a remi≈ø≈øion of his ≈øhare of the ≈øentence, upon certain provi≈øions‚Äîin ≈øhort, he was offered a pardon, on the mo≈øt cruel and barbarous condition that ever entered into the mind of even monki≈øh barbarity, namely, that he would become the executioner of his father! He at fir≈øt re≈øolutely refu≈øed to pre≈øerve his life by means ≈øo fatal and dete≈øtable: This is not to be wondered at; for I hope, for the honour of our nature, that there are but few, very few ≈øorts, who would not have ≈øpurned, with abhorrence, life ≈øu≈øtained on conditions ≈øo horrid, ≈øo unnatural. The ≈øon, though long inflexible, was at length overcome by the tears and entreaties of a fond father, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented to him, at all events, his (the father's) life was forfeited, and that it would be the greate≈øt po≈ø≈øible con≈øolation to him, at his la≈øt moments, to think, that in his death he was the in≈øtrument of his ≈øon's pre≈øervation. The youth con≈øented to adopt the horrible means of recovering his life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he lifted the axe; but, as it was about to fall, his arm ≈øunk nervele≈øs, and the axe dropped from his hand! Had he as many lives as hairs, he would have yielded them all, one after the other, rather than again even conceive, much le≈øs perpetrate, ≈øuch an act. Life, liberty, every thing, vani≈øhed before the dearer intere≈øts of filial affection: he fell upon his father's neck, and, embracing him, triumphantly exclaimed, "My father, my father! we will die together!" and then called for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther executioner to fulfil the ≈øentence of the law.</p>

The ≈øtatue repre≈øents the ≈øon in the very act of letting fall the axe.</p>
               <p>Lay this to your mind, my dear FREDERICK: talk over it to your brother; indulge all the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øympathetic ≈øen≈øations it communicates; never let a mi≈øtaken ≈øhame, or a fal≈øe idea (which ≈øome endeavour to impre≈øs) that it is unmanly to melt at the tale of woe, and ≈øympathize with our fellow-creatures, ≈øtop the current of your ≈øen≈øibility‚Äîno!

               <p>From Ghent to Bru≈ø≈øels (the next great ≈øtage in my way), I found, to my regret, that there was no conveyance by water: I therefore was obliged to go in a voiture, and ≈øtopt at Alo≈øt, as an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ≈øtage; and mathematically intermediate it is‚Äî for it lies at equal di≈øtance from Ghent and Bru≈ø≈øels, being exactly fifteen miles from each.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:033487_0053_0FF722804FC39D30"/>This is a ≈ømall, but exceeding neat town, ≈øituated on the river Dender; and being a remarkably great thoroughfare accommodations of every kind are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably good in it. It would be idle to ≈øuppo≈øe, that Catholic zeal had left ≈øo many ≈øouls unprotected and undi≈øciplined, where there were ≈øo many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies capable of drudgery to pay for it.

How they all fare by this time, it is difficult for me to determine.</p>

               <p>The territory of this city is of pretty large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and is called a county, having, in ancient times, had counts of its own; and the whole of it is extremely fruitful in pa≈øture, corn, hops, flax, and mo≈øt other productions of tho≈øe climes.</p>
               <p>I made but a very ≈øhort ≈øtay at Alo≈øt, when I proceeded on to Bru≈ø≈øels; and, having thus brought you through that part of the Netherlands called Au≈øtrian Flanders, I think I ought to give you a general account of the country at large, as I have hitherto confined my≈øelf merely to the cities and towns of it; but as this letter is already of a length that will not allow of any great addition, I ≈øhall po≈øtpone my intended de≈øcription to my next.</p>

               <p>This country is bounded, to the north, by the Scheldt; to the north-we≈øt, by the Northern Sea: to the ≈øouth, and ≈øouth-we≈øt, by Artois, one of the fine≈øt Provinces of France; and to the ea≈øt, by Brabant. Its greate≈øt length is ≈øeventy-five miles; and its greate≈øt breadth, fifty-five. The air is good; but it is ≈øaid to be better in proportion as it recedes from the ≈øea. The winters are ≈øometimes long and ≈øevere, and the ≈øummers ≈øometimes wet and ≈øultry; yet, in general, the climate is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ≈øoil is in mo≈øt parts fertile, and in ≈øome to a degree equal to that of any part of Europe. It is chiefly famous for its pa≈øturage; in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, great numbers of black cattle, hor≈øes and ≈øheep, are bred in it, and immen≈øe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of butter and chee≈øe made.

It is true, that in ≈øome parts they have not corn ≈øufficient for the inhabitants; but this is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compen≈øed by other productions, with the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of which they purcha≈øe the ≈øuperfluous grain of their neighbours‚Äîfor, where the inhabitants do follow tillage, the produce is unequalled, and the ≈øuperfluity mu≈øt of cour≈øe be great.</p>
               <p>The ≈øuperior fecundity of the ≈øheep of this country is very remarkable, and difficult, perhaps, to be accounted for‚Äîa ewe here bringing forth con≈øtantly three lambs at a birth, ≈øometimes four,

≈øometimes five, and ≈øome have been known to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many as ≈øix and ≈øeven‚Äîno ≈ømall in≈øtance of the prodigality of nature in providing for this ≈øpot.</p>
               <p>At ≈øome di≈øtance from the ≈øea-coa≈øt, the face of the country is decorated with a profu≈øion of wood, fitted either for timber or for fuel; and towards the coa≈øt, where nature has been rather niggard of that ble≈ø≈øing, the inhabitants ≈øub≈øtitute, in its ≈øtead, for fuel, a kind of turf, which they find at the depth of four or five feet from the ≈øurface of the earth, and which makes a fire, not only cheerful, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant, and hot, but remarkably whole≈øome, being free from the de≈øtructive ≈øulphurious and bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapour attendant upon coal.</p>
               <p>Perhaps no part of the world is better ≈øupplied than this province with all ≈øorts of fi≈øh, as well tho≈øe of ≈øea as fre≈øh water: fowl and veni≈øon were extremely plenty and rea≈øonable; and a great deal of excellent beer was brewed in it. It is wa≈øhed by ≈øeveral rivers, four of which are noble ≈øtreams, namely, the Scheldt, the Lys, the Scarpe, and the Dender; and there are ≈øeveral canals, the chief of which is that between Bruges and Ghent.</p>
               <p>Thus in whatever way it be con≈øidered, nature ≈øeems to have made ample provi≈øion for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the people: how far they are ≈øo, you ≈øhall hear when I come to give a general view of the Netherlands‚Äîthat which is applicable to Au≈øtrian Flanders being equally ≈øo to all the other parts of the Netherlands, excepting tho≈øe under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Republic of the United States.</p>

the commoners were made up of the burgoma≈øters, pen≈øioners and deputies of the cities and di≈øtricts. But the only religion profe≈ø≈øed or tolerated in this country, was the Roman Catholic.</p>
               <p>Of the people of Au≈øtrian Flanders a celebrated Author gives the following account, which I tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe for your u≈øe, the rather as my ≈øtay there was too ≈øhort to enable me to make any material ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on them, or their manners.‚Äî</p>

               <p>Many arts which now enrich other nations, and the importance of which has excited conte≈øts and ≈øtruggles of the mo≈øt ≈øerious kind in the political world, were invented or improved in that country.

               <p>In all parts of the Netherlands through which I travelled, I could not help admiring the uniform decorations of the roads, rivers, and canals, with rows of lofty trees, which form a mo≈øt agreeable ≈øhade from the ≈øummer's burning ≈øun, and yet do not ob≈øtruct any great extent of pro≈øpect, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ≈øo extremely flat. And one thing I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which certainty ≈øeems at fir≈øt view, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, is, that in the great extent of country through which we have hitherto pa≈ø≈øed, from O≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Bru≈ø≈øels, being ≈øixty-eight miles, I ≈øcarce ≈øaw one nobleman or gentleman's ≈øeat‚Äînothing above the hou≈øe of a hu≈øbandman, a curate, or ≈øome per≈øon of ≈ømall fortune: and yet the country is extremely rich; and I ≈øaw many ≈øpots, as I went along, charming beyond de≈øcription, and ≈øuch as would tempt, I ≈øhould think, a man of ta≈øte and opulence to ≈øettle in them.

                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:033487_0060_0FF72294E70DA670"/>As I approached the city of Bru≈ø≈øels, I was ≈øtruck with a mixed ≈øen≈øation of ≈øurpri≈øe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light at the appearance it made‚Äînone that I had ever ≈øeen being comparable to it, and not one in Europe, by the account of travellers, being in that re≈øpect ≈øuperior to it, Naples and Genoa only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: like them, however, it, when entered, falls far ≈øhort of the expectation rai≈øed by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance, being all compo≈øed of hills and hollows, which not only fatigue, but render the appearance of the ≈øtreets, though well built, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and mean.</p>
               <p>Bru≈ø≈øels ≈øtands on the beautiful little river Senne, on the brow of a hill. The city is about ≈øeven miles in circumference, has ≈øeven gates, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive ≈øuburbs, and is encompa≈ø≈øed with a double wall made of brick, and ditches; but its ≈øize is too great for ≈øtrength, as a face of defence of ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent could not po≈ø≈øibly hold out a long ≈øiege‚Äîa great and in≈øuperable defect in ≈øuch a country as I have de≈øcribed.</p>
               <p>Great as is the extent of ground on which this city ≈øtands, it is neverthele≈øs very well built, and extremely populous. It is ornamented with no fewer than ≈øeven ≈øquares, all of them remarkably fine, particularly the great ≈øquare or market place, which is reckoned to be perhaps the fine≈øt in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Around it are the halls of the different trades, the fronts of which are adorned, in a ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb manner, with emblematical ≈øculpture, with gilding, and a variety of Latin in≈øcriptions. One quarter of this ≈øquare is entirely occupied by the town-hou≈øes, a noble pile of building, in which there were apartments where the States of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

made ≈øuch a bu≈øtle, and promi≈øed ≈øuch a ≈øpectacle, as made me regret the nece≈ø≈øity I lay under of proceeding on my journey. The town-hou≈øe was put into the highe≈øt order, and ≈øub≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fell a ≈øacrifice to the great and important event for which it was prepared.</p>
               <p>The ≈øteeple of this building is of a mo≈øt ≈øtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous height‚Äîthree hundred and ≈øixty-four feet; and on the top of it is erected a ≈øtatue of Saint MICHAEL killing the Dragon, of the enormous height of ≈øeventeen feet: this colo≈ø≈øal ≈øtatue is ≈øo con≈øtructed as to ≈øerve for a weather-cock; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of copper, well gilt, is at once con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, magnificent, and ornamental.</p>
               <p>The public buildings of Bru≈ø≈øels, particularly the palaces and courts of the ≈øeveral princes, counts, and other per≈øons of di≈øtinction, (and, you may be ≈øure, the churches and cloi≈øters too), are ≈øpacious, expen≈øive, and magnificent. Behind the imperial palace, which ≈øtood in the highe≈øt part of the city, but was burnt down many years ago, is a park, well ≈øtocked with deer, and planted with trees, like St. James's-park at London, for the inhabitants to walk in. At the farther end of it is a fine plea≈øure-hou≈øe, built by the Emperor CHARLES the fifth, after his abdication.</p>
               <p>The palace is a magnificent ≈øtructure: the rooms of it are fini≈øhed in a ≈øtyle far ≈øuperior to tho≈øe of any palace in England, and enriched with many fine paintings: that of the family of HECTOR, in the council chamber, lays claim to the fir≈øt rank of eminence. Of the other buildings (the grandeur of which entitle them to the names of palaces), tho≈øe of the Prince de la Tour and Taxis, and the Briti≈øh Earl of Ayle≈øbury, are di≈øtingu≈øhed by great beauty and magnificence. Indeed, in all the pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there are collections of original paintings, by the mo≈øt eminent ma≈øters, both Italian and Flemi≈øh.</p>

Chri≈øtian butchery in Mexico, in Europe, in A≈øia, in every place where Popery ever ≈øet its bloody hoof.</p>
               <p>You are not, from what I ≈øay, to infer that I entertain any illiberal animo≈øity to Popery, as many men, and more women, do, merely becau≈øe its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith differ from tho≈øe in which I was bred; I tru≈øt my heart and under≈øtanding are above ≈øuch very degrading prejudices: but I abhor every thing that militates again≈øt human happine≈øs‚Äîevery thing that cru≈øhes the operations of intellect‚Äîevery thing that ≈øtops the current of opinion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents its cour≈øe from enlarging and meliorating our condition: I abhor the impertinent and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intru≈øion of all churchmen upon national or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øtic concerns; the more, when that intru≈øion is mi≈øchievous; and more ≈øtill, when it a≈ø≈øumes the ma≈øk of piety‚Äîfor that is at once a fraud upon man and an abu≈øe of GOD.

               <p>IN the ar≈øenal of Bru≈ø≈øels was another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øity, which I overlooked in my la≈øt‚Äîa model of a cannon, con≈øtructed ≈øo as to throw ≈øeven balls at once. It is ≈øome con≈øolation to philanthropy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that of all the abominable engines and in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the inventive faculties of man have di≈øcovered to increa≈øe the cruelty and carnage of war, not one has been of late times adopted. This model lies here, therefore, only as a memorial of the diabolical genius of the inventor.</p>
               <p>The opera-hou≈øe of Bru≈ø≈øels, accounted the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble≈øt and large≈øt in Europe, is built after the Italian manner, with rows of lodges or clo≈øets, in mo≈øt of which are chimneys. One of tho≈øe, which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a prince, who≈øe title I now forget, was hung with looking-gla≈ø≈øes, in which, while he ≈øat by the fire, took refre≈øhments, or reclined on his couch, he could ≈øee the whole repre≈øentation, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expo≈øed to the view of either the actors or the audience.</p>
               <p>The markets of Bru≈ø≈øels are very remarkable. The dukes of St. Pierre paid no le≈øs than forty thou≈øand florins, or upwards of three thou≈øand pounds Sterling, for four pictures of them, painted by RUBENS and SYNDER‚ÄîLEWIS the Fourteenth of France offered an immen≈øe ≈øum of money for them; but they found their way at la≈øt into the collection of the Briti≈øh Earl of Orford. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them is ≈øaid, by connoi≈ø≈øeurs, to be beyond computation.</p>
               <p>Bru≈ø≈øels is extremely well ≈øupplied with water: for, be≈øides the river, it has twenty public foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033487_0066_0FF722A36A8813A8"/>
adorned with ≈øtatues, at the corners of the mo≈øt public ≈øtreets; and the lower part of the city is cut into canals, which communicate with the great one, extending from Bru≈ø≈øels to the Scheldt, fifteen miles: by means of this canal, which was fini≈øhed in 1561, and co≈øt the city eight hundred thou≈øand florins, a per≈øon may ≈øail from Bru≈ø≈øels to the North Sea; and barques do actually go twice a-day to Antwerp, and back again.</p>
               <p>This city is full of churches, of which the mo≈øt remarkable is that of Saint MICHAEL and Saint GUDULA, commonly called the cathedral. It is a ≈øuperb, old Gothic ≈øtructure, and, from its celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ≈øituation, a mo≈øt beautiful ornament to the city. It is not only grand in its external appearance, but finely adorned within. The pillars which ≈øupport the roof are lofty and elegant: and again≈øt each is a ≈øtatue of ten feet in height. There are no le≈øs than ≈øixteen chapels in it; and each chapel is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with abundance of ≈øplendid ornaments, altar finery, candle-≈øticks, crucifixes, &amp;c. and with ≈øome excellent pictures too: a picture of JESUS CHRIST pre≈øenting the keys of Paradi≈øe to Saint PETER, which is reckoned among the chef-d'oeuvres of RUBENS, hangs in one of tho≈øe chapels. There are ≈øome monuments, al≈øo, of very great merit, in the choir of this church. But that which I think by far the greate≈øt and mo≈øt admirable curio≈øity (I mean of human workman≈øhip) in the church, is a pulpit‚Äîone of the riche≈øt and mo≈øt exqui≈øitely wrought pieces I have ever ≈øeen: at the bottom are ≈øeen ADAM and EVE as large as life, repre≈øented as at the moment when the angel drove them out of Paradi≈øe: in both of their faces are deeply and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øively marked the traits of a mind agoni≈øed with angui≈øh and remor≈øe: behind EVE is a figure of Death, which follows them; and on the top of the pulpit are ≈øeen the figures of JESUS CHRIST and the Virgin MARY cru≈øhing the head of the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033487_0067_0FF722A5157D6760"/>
Serpent. The ≈øtrong expre≈ø≈øions in the faces of all tho≈øe figures, and the exqui≈øite turn of the workman≈øhip. is the more remarkable, as it is all cut out of oak wood.</p>
               <p>Of ≈øupernatural curio≈øities, one of the chapels in this cathedral contains ≈øome, that, for miracle, yield to none in the long catalogue of monki≈øh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. Three ho≈øts or wafers are daily wor≈øhipped by the people; which ho≈øts or wafers, the prie≈øts firmly a≈ø≈øert, and the people as firmly believe, were, ≈øo long ago as the year 1369, ≈øtabbed by a Jew, and bled profu≈øely. They are expo≈øed on every fe≈øtival, in a chalice richly ≈øet with diamonds; and on the fir≈øt Sunday after every thirteenth of July, there is a yearly proce≈ø≈øion in memory of this ≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and bleeding, when the ho≈øts are carried in great ≈øtate round the city, embelli≈øhed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of precious ≈øtones, and attended by all the clergy, ≈øecular and regular, the magi≈øtrates, the courts of ju≈øtice, and even by the governor of the province: the chapel where they are kept is of marble, and the altar of ≈øolid ≈øilver.</p>
               <p>Great GOD! what an opprobium to the human under≈øtanding, that, at the time when the mind of man is ≈øufficiently enlightened to avoid the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øhameful credulity, a whole people ≈øhould ≈øtoop to ≈øuch extravagant impo≈øition! what a ≈øhame to ju≈øtice and hone≈øty, that tho≈øe who are tru≈øted to guard the rights of a people, and who certainly are too well informed to yield their belief to ≈øuch tra≈øh, ≈øhould yet join in, and give the weight of their authority to ≈øo gro≈øs, ≈øo wicked a deception on a community! The magi≈øtrates, the courts of ju≈øtice, and the governor‚Äîthey walk, too, in company with the bald-pated impo≈øtors‚ÄîGood GOD! can more be ≈øaid? volumes of comment could not elucidate or render it more con≈øpicuou≈øly ab≈øurd than the bare recital of the fact it≈øelf.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:033487_0068_0FF722AAD5124598"/>It is impo≈ø≈øible for me to recount to you the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of nunneries, of various orders, in which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate women were cloi≈øtered up, ≈øome from bigotry, and others by force, in this city. There were, however, two of them Engli≈øh‚Äîone of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican ladies, founded by Cardinal HOWARD, in the reign of CHARLES the Second, of which a lady of the noble Hou≈øe of Norfolk was always abbe≈øs: the other is of Benedictine nuns; the Beguinage of the latter is like a little town, ≈øurrounded with a wall and ditch, and divided into pretty little ≈øtreets, where every Beguine has her apartment; the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them amounts in general to ≈øeven or eight hundred, ≈øometimes more.</p>
               <p>If population be the true ≈øtrength of a nation, this part, of Popery is very impolitic. The ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion of women in this one convent ≈øince the reign of CHARLES the Second, mu≈øt amount to many thou≈øands.

               <p>In wading through ≈øuch a torrent of offen≈øive ideas as the innumerable ab≈øurdities and deceptions of Popi≈øh countries continually rai≈øe in the mind, it is a plea≈øing circum≈øtance to be relieved by the contemplation of ≈øome really u≈øeful, humane in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;

               <p>You have read, I pre≈øume, that in the days of Heatheni≈øm, the Deities of that curious Mythology were ≈øuppo≈øed to rejoice in the number Three.

               <p>Of the number I have heard, I will mention one anecdote only, and one remarkably expre≈ø≈øion of JOSEPH'S, which will ≈øerve to ≈øhew in its true light what his di≈øpo≈øition was; and when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider them as the act and ≈øentiment of a young man

               <p>In his journey to the low countries, he vi≈øited Wurtzaurg; and, in his perambulating alone and <hi>incog,</hi> ≈øtopped at a little public-hou≈øe, where the people were bu≈øily employed in entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves: he went in, and inquired why they were ≈øo merry‚Äî"Sir," ≈øaid one of the country people, "we are celebrating a marriage." "May I be permitted to join the company?" ≈øaid the di≈øgui≈øed Emperor. The ho≈øt obtained that permi≈ø≈øion for him. When he entered the room, the married couple were pre≈øented to him, and he received them with great gaiety, ≈øat down, drank their health, and, having informed him≈øelf of their ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, took leave of the company: but what was their a≈øtoni≈øhment, when, on lifting up a bottle of wine, they found a draft for ≈øix hundred florins, ≈øigned JOSEPH, and payable for the u≈øe of the married couple.</p>
               <p>At Luxembourg, when the people called aloud on Heaven to ≈øhower down ble≈ø≈øings on him for his affability, he made u≈øe of this remarkable expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while his feelings moi≈øtened his eyes: "I wi≈øh I could make you as happy in my care, as I am in your affection!"</p>
               <p>The affability of monarchs has often been magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the fooli≈øh, and often blamed by the wi≈øe: But, if all the in≈øtances of eonde≈øcen≈øion practi≈øed by kings were like that I have recited of JOSEPH; if they aro≈øe from a ≈øound, unque≈øtionable ≈øpirit of philanthropy, not from gaping curio≈øity, broad fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or a peurile inqui≈øitive habit; and if, in≈øtead of conceiving tho≈øe they vi≈øit paid for their intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion with the honour of having conver≈øed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty, and leaving them churli≈øhly, they would ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerou≈øly pay them with hard ca≈øh, as the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror JOSEPH did; then, indeed, their affability
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033487_0075_0FF722B732D682D8"/>
might defy the exaggeration of fools, and mu≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly command the applau≈øe of the wi≈øe.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of July, the ceremony of inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took place at Bru≈ø≈øels. Nothing could equal the ≈øplendour of the place but the general joy of the people: the crowds were beyond all conception immen≈øe, and every thing was carried on with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity till evening, when, in playing off ≈øome fire-works, that noble building the town-hou≈øe took fire, and was burnt: ≈øix unfortunate per≈øons lo≈øt their lives, and twenty were dangerou≈øly hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: tho≈øe who peri≈øhed were ab≈øolutely roa≈øted, and their cries were beyond de≈øcription piercing.

               <p>But now we are to view the rever≈øe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. The ≈øound of their prayers for his welfare, and prai≈øes of his goodne≈øs, had hardly died away upon their lips, ere their minds turned to revolt and rebellion. I will not ≈øay that they were not right in one or other, or which of tho≈øe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes: certainly they could not be right in both; much le≈øs can their ≈øub≈øequent conduct be ju≈øtified, or accounted for, in any principle of human nature, but that of the mo≈øt abject meanne≈øs, da≈øtardly fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs, and gro≈øs folly. They returned to their allegiance, and be≈øought forgivene≈øs: that forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs was granted. How they have behaved ≈øince, I have already informed you, (≈øee Letter IV.); and I have now to add, that, pillaged by the French, and likely to be left unprotected, they have again held their necks out, ≈øoliciting the protection and the yoke of Au≈øtria, and have actually offered to rai≈øe 100,000 men for the Emperor, <hi>if</hi> he will again

               <p>How a people, once formed for manly pith and love of freedom, could bend ≈øo low, is unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

               <p>Upon a retro≈øpective view of the Hi≈øtory of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, it will be found, that for a long time after the birth of CHRIST, Germany was divided among ≈øuch petty rulers as I have de≈øcribed, who each held his little ≈øtate in ≈øovereignty, and was called <hi>Princeps</hi> in Latin, or, in plain Engli≈øh, <hi>Prince.</hi> After the downfal of the We≈øtern Empire, a nation called <hi>Franks,</hi> from that part called <hi>Franconia,</hi> over-ran a great part of Gaul and Germany, and in the fifth century took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of that part of Gaul which lay north of the river Loire. In the year 800, CHARLEMAGNE, the ≈øon of PEPIN, their king, formed an immen≈øe empire in the we≈øt, comprehending a great part of Germany, France, Italy, and a part of Spain.

A≈ø≈øuredly, the impo≈øing a bi≈øhopric upon him mu≈øt be a great act of violence on his inclinations: for I cannot think it po≈ø≈øible that a Chri≈øtian divine would, in the fir≈øt place, commit the crime of ≈øimony by ≈øeeking preferment, and gaining it by pro≈øtitution; much le≈øs can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he would be guilty, at the holy altar, of a ≈øolemn act of perjury, by ≈øwearing <hi>nolo epi≈øcopari,</hi> if he was not actually, and <hi>bon√¢ fid√™,</hi> aver≈øe to a bi≈øhopric.</p>
               <p>The bi≈øhop of Liege, however, may be fairly acquitted on the ≈øcore of his temporal half, for the ≈øhare of tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions committed by his ≈øpiritual half.

               <p>Of all kinds of ≈ølavery, that nation groans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the wor≈øt, which has the name, without the e≈ø≈øence, of a free con≈øtitution; and Germany abounds with ≈øuch. By the con≈øtitution of this bi≈øhopric, the government con≈øi≈øts of three ≈øtates, the fir≈øt is the chapter of Liege; the ≈øecond, the nobility; and the third, the deputies of the towns and capital. The≈øe, however, are very ≈øeldom call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, except to <hi>rai≈øe taxes,</hi> or on ≈øome ≈øuch <hi>extraordinary</hi> emergency: but there is a committee of the ≈øtates who meet three times a-week, and in time of war daily; they are always about the prince bi≈øhop, to make remon≈øtrances, and demand the redre≈øs of grievances‚Äîfrom whence we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonably infer, that the people are well protected, or at lea≈øt well governed; the continual intercour≈øe between the committee and bi≈øhops, no doubt, tending to promote a very happy influence in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the people!</p>
               <p>In forming this con≈øtitution, ≈øpecial care has been taken to give the fir≈øt ≈øtate a great preponderance. The chapter is to con≈øi≈øt of ≈øixty per≈øons, who mu≈øt either prove their nobility for four generations, both by father and mother, or have been doctors or licentiates of divinity for ≈øeven years, or of law for five years, in ≈øome famous univer≈øity, before they can be admitted.</p>
               <p>How is it that the profe≈ø≈øion of the law ≈øhould bear ≈øuch potent ≈øway in almo≈øt all countries‚Äîthat even in Liege, a Catholic country and eccle≈øia≈øtical government, five years ≈øtudy of the law ≈øhould be deemed an equal qualification of ≈øeven of divinity?
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:033487_0088_0FF722DC38C48438"/>
In England, and its dependencies, the a≈øcendancy of the law is ≈øtill greater; and even in America, that profe≈ø≈øion is the fir≈øt ≈øtep to ≈øtate honours. The truth is, that the ≈øcience of the law, which, however de≈øpicable in practice, is the noble≈øt of human ≈øciences, quickens and invigorates the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding more than all the other kinds of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together; while the ≈øtudy of divinity (I do not mean real divinity or morality, but that whim≈øical jumble of miracles and incongruities, of ful≈øome cant and ≈øen≈øele≈øs rhap≈øody, called ≈øo by churchmen) contracts the under≈øtanding, and bends it into a kind of crooked cunning. Formerly, the clergy were the di≈øpen≈øers of the laws, and they alone ≈øtudied it‚ÄîHappy times! happy people! When the united powers of both lawyers and prie≈øts were lodged in the ≈øame per≈øon, it is no wonder that they were able to en≈ølave the per≈øons, when they had got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the under≈øtanding, of the people‚Äîthat we at this day ≈øee ≈øo many ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous monuments remaining of their pride and power, and that the bloated load of epi≈øcopacy ≈øtill has its votaries and ≈øupporters.</p>
               <p>The bi≈øhopric of Liege is very populous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive, containing many large towns, many baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ≈øeigniories, ≈øeventeen abbeys for men, who mu≈øt be all gentlemen, and eleven for ladies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øive of ≈øwarms of inferior note. In this di≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the abbeys, male and female, I do not think that ≈øufficient regard has been had to equality of numbers: I really think the fathers have been ill u≈øed. The ladies, though, I dare ≈øay, are well enough contented with the arrangement.</p>
               <p>Although, as I have already apprized you, I do not mean to enter into a minute de≈øcription of towns, ≈øo very ea≈øily found in many volumes of geography and hi≈øtory, there occa≈øionally occur cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain curio≈øities in ≈øome of tho≈øe towns, which it would be unpardonable in me to pa≈øs over, as they

               <p>AIX-LA-CHAPELLE‚ÄîThe imperial city of Aix-la-Chapelle, by the Germans called Achen, lies at the di≈øtance of twenty-≈øix miles, nearly ea≈øt, of Liege. As it was a moderate ≈øtage, the weather fine, and the face of the country around beautiful, I found my journey extremely plea≈øant, and entered that famous city in as good a di≈øpo≈øition to be plea≈øed with it, as circum≈øtances and reflections ≈øo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly as mine (which, in ≈øpite of every effort, would intrude them≈øelves) may be ≈øuppo≈øed to allow.

they carried their conque≈øts; and it lay in ruins till it was rebuilt by CHARLEMAGNE, who made it the ≈øeat of his empire on this ≈øide of the Alps.

               <p>Although there are many Prote≈øtants, both Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans and Calvini≈øts, in this city, they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to go to church two miles off, at a place called Vaels, in the dutchy of Limburg; ≈øo that Popery prevails with ≈øome portion of its intolerance.

               <p>We have already had, and are likely yet to have ≈øuch a clum≈øy load of cathedrals to attend to, that I ≈øhould not mention that of Aix-la-Chapelle (a large, gloomy, dreary, old-fa≈øhioned, Gothic pile), were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But that which, above all things, renders Aix-la-Chapelle worthy of notice, is the ≈øalubrity of its waters, which bring from England, and all other European nations, a va≈øt concour≈øe of valetudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who contribute at once to the gaiety and opulence of the city and adjacent country.

               <p>I ≈øtaid to ≈øhort a time at Aix-la-Chapelle, that I could not, without the aid of ≈øome of the miracles wrought by the ≈øaints of the Romi≈øh church, or Sir JOHN MANDEVILLE, acquire a ≈øufficient knowledge of the people, to attempt a de≈øcription of them, or their manners‚Äîbut it and Spa are ≈øo well known, that you cannot have much trouble in finding a de≈øcription of them already written.</p>

               <p>BIDDING adieu to the famous city of Aix-la-Chapelle, which, very untraveller-like, I pa≈ø≈øed without drinking of its waters. I pu≈øhed on, and ≈øoon arrived at the city of Juliers, the capital of a dutchy of that name, ≈øixteen miles from Aix. The country it≈øelf is wonderfully fruitful, teeming with abundance of all ≈øorts of corn, wood, pa≈øture, woad, coal, and cattle; above all, a mo≈øt excellent breed of hor≈øes, of which great numbers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
               <p>As to the city, though a capital, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that I thought worth attention‚Äîthat of neatne≈øs is its greate≈øt prai≈øe. It is not, like Liege, overloaded with enormous church edifices; but, what is much better, the people are opulent, the poor well ≈øupplied, and all happy. In all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, this is owing to the inhabitants being a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Prote≈øtant and Roman Catholic; for, by a treaty between the Elector Palatine and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Brandenburg, re≈øpecting the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of the territories of the Duke of Cleves, both the Lutherans and Calvini≈øts of this dutchy, and of Berg, are to enjoy the public exerci≈øe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and all other religious rites.</p>
               <p>If experience would allow us to wonder at any thing in the management of the rulers of nations, it mu≈øt ≈øurely be matter of a≈øtoni≈øhment, that in an article of ≈øuch con≈øequence as eternity, and which mu≈øt be directed by private ≈øentiments alone, ≈øuch violence ≈øhould ≈øy≈øtematically be offered to opinion, and that mankind ≈øhould be dragooned, as they have been for ≈øo many weary centuries, into

               <p>Travelling over a very even road, and a country extremely flat, (for from Aix-la-Chapelle I met with but one hill), I arrived at Cologne, the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, not only of the archbi≈øhopric of that name, but of the Circle of the Lower Rhine. My ≈øpirits, which were not in the very be≈øt tone, were not at all rai≈øed on entering the city, by the ringing of church-bells, of all tones and ≈øizes, in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Being a ≈øtranger, I thought it had been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing day; but, on inquiry, found that it was the con≈øtant practice. Never, in my life, had I heard ≈øuch an infernal clatter: never before had I ≈øeen any thing ≈øo gloomy and melancholy‚Äîthe ≈øtreets black‚Äîdi≈ømal bells tolling‚Äîbald-pated friars, in myriads, trailing their long black forms through the ≈øtreets, moulding their faces into every ≈øhape that art had enabled them to a≈ø≈øume, in order to excite commi≈øeration, and begging alms with a melancholy ≈øong calculated for the purpo≈øe, ≈øomewhat like that

of our blind beggars in London, and productive of the ≈øame di≈øagreeable effect upon the ≈øpirits. In ≈øhort, I was not an hour in Cologne, when tho≈øe circum≈øtances, con≈øpiring with the in≈øuperable melancholy of my mind, made me wi≈øh my≈øelf out of it.</p>
               <p>Neverthele≈øs, Cologne is a fine city; and if it be any ≈øatisfaction to you to ≈øpin tho≈øe fine imaginary ligaments that, in the brain of the book-worm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the ancient and modern world, I will inform you, that it was anciently called <hi>Colonia Agrippina,</hi> becau≈øe AGRIPPINA, the mother of NERO, was born there, and honored it with a Roman colony, becau≈øe it was her birth-place. The mind, forced back to that period, and contemplating the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of that mon≈øter NERO, cannot help wi≈øhing that Cologne had been burnt the nigth of her birth, and Mi≈øs AGRIPPINA buried in the ruins, ere ≈øhe had lived to give birth to that ≈øcourge of the world.</p>
               <p>Although the e≈øtabli≈øhed religion here be the Roman Catholic, extraordinary as it may appear, they are very jealous of power; and though the elector, by his officers, admini≈øters ju≈øtice in all criminal cau≈øes, they will not permit him, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, to re≈øide above three days at a time in the city, nor to bring a great train with him when he vi≈øits it; for this rea≈øon he commonly re≈øides at Bonne.</p>
               <p>Cologne has a very con≈øiderable trade, particularly in Rheni≈øh wine; and its gin is reckoned the be≈øt in the world, and bears a higher price than any other in all the nations of Europe.</p>
               <p>Like all great Roman Catholic cities, it has a profu≈øion of churches, cro≈ø≈øes, miracles, ≈øaints, and church trinkets; and I really think it has more ≈øteeples and bells than any two cities in Germany. As Liege was called the Paradi≈øe of Prie≈øts, this ought to be called the Golgotha of Skulls and Skull-caps. In the church of Saint URSULA, they ≈øhew, or pretend at lea≈øt to ≈øhew, the bones of

eleven thou≈øand virgin martyrs. The ≈økulls of ≈øome of tho≈øe imaginary virgins are in ≈øilver ca≈øes, and others in ≈økull-caps, of cloth, of gold, and velvet. And in the church of Saint GERION, are no le≈øs than nine hundred heads of Moori≈øh cavaliers, of the army of the Emperor CONSTANTINE, (previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to that ≈øaint's conver≈øion to Chri≈øtianity), who they ≈øay was beheaded for refu≈øing to ≈øacrifice to idols: by the bye, the Popi≈øh divines burn, in≈øtead of beheading, for not ≈øacrificing to idols‚ÄîEvery one of tho≈øe heads, however, has a cap of ≈øcarlet, adorned with pearls.

This, you will conclude, I ≈øaid to my≈øelf: an avowal of my ≈øentiments in that place might have given my head a title to a ≈øcarlet cap and pearls; and as I had ≈øome further u≈øe for it, I did not think it expedient to leave it behind me in the church of Saint GERION ‚Äî≈øo, very prudently, kept my mind to my≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Coming out of the church, a multitude of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, all in canonicals, or ≈øtudent's habits, ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, be≈øeeching me for alms‚Äîone, pour l'amour de DIEU; another, pour l'amour de la Sainte Vierge; a third, pour le ≈øalut de no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When I had gone as far as I wi≈øhed in donations, another attacked me: though I told him my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity-bank was exhau≈øted, he per≈øevered, and was uncommonly ≈øolicitous‚Äîtill at length, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hau≈øted

the whole catalogue of ≈øaints that are to be found in the calendar, he rai≈øed his voice from the mi≈øerable whine of petition, and exclaimed with great energy, "Par les neuf cent tetes des Cavaliers Maures qui ≈øont ≈øantifies au Ciel, je vous conjure de me faire l'aumone!" This was too formidable an appeal to be ≈ølighted; and ≈øo, in homage to the ≈økulls and red caps, I put my hand in my pocket, and ≈øtopped his clamours.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe mi≈øerable modes of peculation are the mo≈øt pardonable of any produced by the church: we have no right to regret a trifle ≈øacrificed at the ≈øhrine of compa≈ø≈øion, even when that compa≈ø≈øion is mi≈øtaken; but our rea≈øon revolts at impo≈øition, when it calls coercion to its aid, and a≈ø≈øumes the name of right.</p>
               <p>Without any national predilection, which you know I am above, I think our church affairs in Scotland are arranged upon a better ≈øy≈øtem than any other that I know of: hence their clergy are in general examples worthy of imitation, for learning, piety, and moral conduct.</p>

               <p>LABOURED inve≈øtigations to e≈øtabli≈øh connections between the hi≈øtory of the ancient and bu≈øine≈øs of the modern world, and virulent di≈øputes about trifles of antiquity, ≈øuch as in what year this place was built, or that great man was born, when and where JULIUS CAESAR landed in England, whether he pa≈ø≈øed this road or that, what route HANNIBAL took over the Alps. and ≈øuch like, are ≈øo e≈ø≈øentially unintere≈øting, u≈øele≈øs, and unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ≈øo unprofitable, and, one would think, ≈øo

painful too<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that it is wonderful how ≈øo many men of great learning have been unwi≈øe enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their lives in the re≈øearch.</p>
               <p>It does not follow, however, that when informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that tends to recall to our minds the great men of antiquity is pre≈øented to us, we ≈øhould reject it. A man of cla≈ø≈øical ta≈øte and education feels a delight in tho≈øe little memorials of what gave him plea≈øure in his youth. I know a gentleman, who, being at Seville; in Spain, travelled to Cordova, for no other purpo≈øe but to ≈øee the town where LUCAN and SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NECA were born: and I dare ≈øay, that if you were at Cologne, you would be much plea≈øed to ≈øee the town-hou≈øe, a great Gothic building, which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a variety of ancient in≈øcriptions; the fir≈øt to commemorate the kindne≈øs of JULIUS CAESAR to the Ubii, who inhabited this place, and of whom you have found mention made by him in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, and al≈øo his building two wooden bridges over the Rhine: a ≈øecond commemorates AUGUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS ≈øending a colony here. There is al≈øo a cro≈øs-bow of whalebone, twelve feet long, eight broad, and four inches thick, which they who ≈øpeak of it conjecture to have belonged to the Emperor MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIN. There are al≈øo ≈øome Roman in≈øcriptions in the ar≈øenal, the import of which I now forget.</p>
               <p>It is very extraordinary, but certainly a fact, that there are, about Cologne, families yet exi≈øting, who indulge the ≈øen≈øele≈øs ambition of pretending to be de≈øcended from the ancient Romans, and who actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally produce their genealogies, carried down from the fir≈øt time this city was made a colony of the Roman empire. Of all kinds of vanity, this is perhaps the mo≈øt extravagant; for, if antiquity merely be the object, all are equally high, ≈øince all mu≈øt have originated from the ≈øame ≈øtock; and if it be the pride of belonging to a particular family who were di≈øtingui≈øhed for valour or virtue, a claim which often only ≈øerves to prove the degeneracy of

the claimant, it could not apply in the ca≈øe of a whole people: but this is among the frailties of humanity; and we are often ≈øo dazzled with the ≈øplendour of terre≈øtrial glory, that we endeavour to be allied to it even by the mo≈øt remote and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous connections. I heard of a man, who≈øe pride and boa≈øt, when drunk, was, that Dean SWIFT had once thrown his mother's oy≈øters (≈øhe was an oy≈øter-wench) about the ≈øtreet, and then gave her half a crown as an atonement for the injury. On the ≈øtrength of this affinity did he call the Dean nothing but <hi>Cou≈øin Jonathan,</hi> though the Dean was dead before he was born!</p>
               <p>But of all the ≈øtories I have ever heard as illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrative of this ≈øtrange ambition, that which the late Lord ANSON has left us is the mo≈øt ≈øtriking. When that great man was travelling in the Ea≈øt<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> he hired a ve≈ø≈øel to vi≈øit the i≈øland of Tenedos<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> his pilot, a modern Greek, pointing to a bay as they ≈øailed along, exclaimed in great triumph, "There, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>While tho≈øe doughty de≈øcendants of the ancient Romans indulge the cheerle≈øs idea of their great and illu≈øtrious line of ancient ance≈øtry, the prince who rules them felicitates him≈øelf with the more ≈øub≈øtantial dignities and emoluments of his modern offices. As elector and archbi≈øhop of Cologne, he has dominion over a large, fruitful, and opulent country: he is the mo≈øt powerful of the eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal electors: he has many ≈øuffragan princes, lay and ≈øpiritual, under him: and he is archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire.

would not barter tho≈øe good things for the power to demon≈øtrate that LUCRETIA was his aunt, BRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS his grandfather, and the great JULIUS CAESAR him≈øelf his cou≈øin-german.</p>
               <p>CHRIST cho≈øe his di≈øciples out of fi≈øhermen. The Chapter of Cologne is, perhaps, on the contrary, the very mo≈øt ari≈øtocratic body exi≈øting, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of forty canons, who are princes or counts of the empire‚ÄîOf tho≈øe, twenty-five choo≈øe the archbi≈øhop, and many advance one of their own body to that great and wealthy dignity, if they plea≈øe.</p>
               <p>From Cologne I proceeded to the town of Bonne, which is ≈øaid to take its name from the plea≈øantne≈øs of its ≈øituation. Here the elector re≈øides, and has a very fine palace. The country around is extremely fruitful and plea≈øant, and is ble≈ø≈øed with mo≈øt of the good things which render the rich magnificent and happy, and remind the poor of their inferiority and wretchedne≈øs‚Äîparticularly wine, which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably excellent. It contains churches, prie≈øts, convents, cloi≈øters, &amp;c.; but I need not mention them‚Äîwhat place could exi≈øt without them?</p>
               <p>I ≈øhould not forget to tell you, that, at this place, JULIUS CAESAR built one of his bridges acro≈øs the Rhine‚Äîworks which would have handed down to po≈øterity the name of a common man, for the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the ≈øtructure and ingenuity of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but are lo≈øt in the crowd of a≈øtoni≈øhing talents which di≈øtingui≈øhed that brighte≈øt of morals. The greate≈øt biographer of antiquity ≈øays of him, that he was as great a general as HANNIBAL, as great an orator as CICERO, and as great a politician as AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSTUS; but it might be added, that he was among the fir≈øt poets of his day‚Äîthat he was of the fir≈øt mechanical genius, and the fine≈øt gentleman, in Rome.</p>
               <p>Nature ≈øeems to have formed, in CAESAR, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious union of all human talents, as if to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate

how unavailing they were when oppo≈øed to ≈øtrict rigid hone≈øty and virtue in the character of BRUTUS.</p>
               <p>To go from Bonne to Frankfort, there are two ways‚Äîone over the mountains of Wetterania, the other up the river Rhine. I made no he≈øitation to adopt the latter, and was rewarded for my choice with the view of as ≈øine a country, inhabited by as fine a race of people, as I had ever ≈øeen. Valleys filled with herds, plains enamelled with corn-fields, and the hills covered with vineyards, regaled the eye, and conveyed to the mind all the felicitating ideas of plenty, natural opulence, and true pro≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

               <p>THE country about Frankfort is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, rich and fruitful, and watered by the beautiful river Maine, which divides the city into two parts, that on the north being called Frankfort, and that on the ≈øouth, Saxenhau≈øen, from the Saxons, who are ≈øuppo≈øed to have been the founders of it.

The magi≈øtrates, and great part of the inhabitants, are Lutherans or Calvini≈øts; notwith≈øtanding which, mo≈øt of the churches are in the hands of the Roman Catholics‚Äîa laudable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the true tolerant ≈øpirit of a wi≈øe and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in≈øtitution, and a heavy reflection upon, as well as a noble example to the Popi≈øh Powers of Europe.</p>
               <p>The territory belonging to Frankfort is of very con≈øiderable extent; and the trade carried on through it, by means of the rivers Rhine and Maine, of very great importance, not only to the country it≈øelf, but to other commercial nations, and particularly to Great Britain, who≈øe manufactures
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:033487_0106_0FF723101A069CE8"/>
are ≈øent to Frankfort, and thence circulated through the Continent. in amazing quantities.</p>
               <p>The fairs of Frankfort are talked of all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ‚Äîof ≈øuch importance are they in the world of commerce. They are held, one at Ea≈øter, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in September, and continue for three weeks, during which time the re≈øort of people there from all quarters is a≈øtoni≈øhing. Every thing is done by the government to render them as attractive to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants as po≈ø≈øible; and taxes or duties are extremely low‚Äîa bale of the value of ten or twenty thou≈øand crowns paying duty only about ten or eleven pence of our money. All commodities from all parts of the world are ≈øold there, and circulated through the empire; but, particularly, books are ≈øold in prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious quantities. After the fairs are over, the ≈øhops of the foreign merchants are ≈øhut up, and their names written over their doors.</p>
               <p>To give an idea of the great importance the≈øe fairs are to commerce, I need only mention, that in the pre≈øent war, the impediments thrown by the French in the way of the tran≈øit of goods up the Rhine, and the ≈øhutting up that fair, gave a mo≈øt alarming paraly≈øis to the manufacturing e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of England, and a ≈øhock to public credit in con≈øequence, that would, but for the timely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Parliament, have, in all probability, been fatal to the national credit.</p>
               <p>Frankfort is in many re≈øpects a plea≈øant place: the merchants are extremely convivial and ≈øociable, and form clubs, where they meet to drink tea and coffee, and play at cards. There is a playhou≈øe al≈øo, a great number of coffee-hou≈øes, and other hou≈øes of entertainment in abundance. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try around is covered with woods and vineyards, and the circumjacent villages are very plea≈øant, and well ≈øupplied with hou≈øes of entertainment, to which the inhabitants of the city re≈øort in the

Summer ≈øea≈øon: and the inns in Frankfort are excellent.</p>

               <p>In the town here is pre≈øented the original Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bull, or Pope's Authority, which contains the rules and orders to be ob≈øerved at the election of the Emperors.

               <p>It is ≈øaid of Frankfort, that the Roman Catholics po≈ø≈øe≈øs the churches, the Lutherans the dignities, and the Calvini≈øts the riches. It is therefore one of the few places in Chri≈øtendom where the churches and the riches do not go into the ≈øame hands.</p>
               <p>From Frankfort to Aug≈øburgh, I pa≈ø≈øed through a number of towns, all of them ≈øo very incon≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as not to merit any particular de≈øcription.

               <p>This city of Aug≈øburgh is the capital of a bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opric of that name in the Circle of Suabia, and is worthy of the attention of the cla≈ø≈øical traveller for its antiquity. About twelve years before the birth

of CHRIST, AUGUSTUS CAESAR ≈øubdued all this country, and, on the place where Aug≈øburgh now ≈øtands, formed a colony, gave the town the name of Augu≈øta Vindelicorum, and put it under the government of DRUSUS the brother of TIBERIUS, afterwards emperor of Rome. The inhabitants of this place were the Vindelici, a branch of the Illyrians. But, ancient though it be, it has little more of antiquity to entitle it to notice than the bare name; for it has been pillaged ≈øo often, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by that mon≈øter ATTILA, that there are ≈øcarcely any remains of its antiquity to be found.</p>
               <p>Aug≈øburgh, is now, however a hand≈øome city‚Äî the public buildings in general magnificent, and adorned with fountains, water engines of a curious con≈øtruction, and ≈øtatues.</p>
               <p>The mo≈øt rich and ≈øplendid part of the town belongs to a family of the name of FUGGERS (ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaly de≈øcended from a weaver), who enriched them≈øelves by commerce, and one of whom render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only him≈øelf, but the whole family, con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, by entertaining the emperor CHARLES the Fifth in a ≈øuperb manner, and ≈øupplying him with money, and then throwing his bond into the fire; in return for which, the emperor, made him a count of the empire.</p>
               <p>This city is remarkable for gold≈ømiths' ware; and its mechanics are equal to any in the world, for works in gold, ivory, clocks, and time-pieces; and they engrave better than any people in Germany, which brings them con≈øiderable profits. But what they are, above all other people, eminent for, is the manufacturing ≈øteel-chains ≈øo prodigiou≈øly fine, that when one of them, of a ≈øpan in length, has been put about the neck of a flea, it lifts up the whole of it as it leaps; and yet tho≈øe are ≈øold for le≈øs than a ≈øhilling of our money a piece.</p>

               <p>FOR the rea≈øons mentioned in my la≈øt, Aug≈øburgh is a mo≈øt agreeable place to live in. Touched with the ≈øen≈øations natural to a man who loved to ≈øee his fellow-creatures happy, my heart expanded to a ≈øy≈øtem of peace and harmony, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole globe: my mind expatiated involuntarily on the ble≈ø≈øings and advantages deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ≈øuch a ≈øy≈øtem; and, taking flight from the bounds of practicability, to which our feeble nature is pinned on this earth, into the regions or fancy, had reared a fabric of Utopian mold, which, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, exceeded in extravagance the works of all the Utopian architects that ever con≈øtructed ca≈øtles in the air.</p>
               <p>Hurried on by this delightful vi≈øion, my per≈øon paid an involuntary obedience to my mind; and the quickne≈øs of my pace increa≈øing with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuo≈øity of my thoughts, I found my≈øelf, before I was aware of it, within the chapel-door of the convent of the Carmelites. Ob≈øerving my error, I ≈øuddenly turned about, in order to depart, when a friar, a goodly per≈øon of a man, elderly, and of a benign a≈øpect, called me, and, advancing towards me, a≈øked, in terms of politene≈øs, and in the French language, why I was retreating ≈øo abruptly‚ÄîI was confu≈øed: but truth is the enemy before whom confu≈øion ever flies; and I told him the whole of my mi≈øtake, and the thoughts from which they aro≈øe.</p>

               <p>Quitting the chapel, and going towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory, the friar ≈øtood, and, looking at me with a ≈ømile of gaiety, ≈øaid, "I have yet ≈øomething to ≈øhew you, which, while lady Madonna marks the time, will help us to pa≈øs it; and, as it will make its way with more force and ≈øubtlety to your ≈øen≈øes than tho≈øe I have yet ≈øhewn you, will be likely to be longer retained in remembrance."</p>

               <p>"You mu≈øt know," ≈øaid the friar, "that the convent of Carmelites at Aug≈øburgh has for ages been famed for beer unequalled in any part of the world; and I have brought you here to have your opinion‚Äîfor, being an Engli≈øhman, you mu≈øt be a judge, the Britons being famed for luxury, and a perfect knowledge of the <hi>≈øcavoir vivre."</hi> He pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and drank to me: it looked liker the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Champaigne than beer‚ÄîI never ta≈øted any thing to equal it; and he ≈øeemed highly gratified by my expre≈ø≈øions of prai≈øe, which I lavi≈øhed upon it, as well from politene≈øs, as regard to truth.</p>

again≈øt the incur≈øion of an enemy, that there is not a pa≈øs which leads to it that is not through ≈øome narrow defile between mountains almo≈øt inacce≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and on the rocks and brows of tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øes, the emperor has con≈øtructed forts and citadels, ≈øo advantageou≈øly placed, that they command all the valleys and avenues beneath.</p>
               <p>After a variety of windings and turnings through mountains of ≈øtupendous height and awful a≈øpect, I began to de≈øcend, and entered the mo≈øt delightful valley I had ever beheld‚Äîdeep, long, and above a mile in breadth‚Äî≈øurrounded with enormous piles of mountains, and diver≈øified with the alternate beauties of nature and cultivation, ≈øo as to form an union rarely to be met with, and delight at once the eye of the farmer, and the fancy of him that has a true ta≈øte for rural wildne≈øs.

               <p>The country of Tyrol, ≈øuch as I have de≈øcribed it, formed bv nature for the re≈øidence of the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van deities, rich in the products of the earth, the people contented and happy, and the whole the region of peace; manufactures, the fir≈øt root of low vices, and commerce, the great in≈øtigator of war, have ≈øcarcely been able to ≈øet their feet there: hence it happens, that there is no channel through which tho≈øe exuberant ≈øpirits I have alluded to can take their cour≈øe, or expand their force.

They are found, therefore, ≈øcattered all over the Continent: and as it rarely happens that opportunities occur in life of ≈øignali≈øing ≈øuch talents in a dignified line, rather than be idle they do what they can, and apply to chicanery as a wide and appropriate field for their genius and vigour to work on‚Äîthe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Tyrole≈øe are, therefore, by mo≈øt nations of the continent, reckoned among the mo≈øt expert and accompli≈øhed ≈øharpers in the world‚Äîthe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, however, who remain at home, are of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent character‚Äîthey are, generally ≈øpeaking, tall, robu≈øt, and vigorous; the women ≈øtrong, and very fair; and both ≈øexes exhibit a very plea≈øing mixture of German phlegm and Italian ≈øprightline≈øs; or, to ≈øpeak more properly, they are a mean between tho≈øe two extremes.</p>
               <p>Inn≈øpruck, though a ≈ømall city, is hand≈øome and agreeable, ≈øtanding in a very beautiful valley, ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with mountains, which, while their lower
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033487_0122_0FF7233C319F3388"/>
parts are well cultivated, are capped on the tops with perennial ≈ønow. The ca≈øtle formerly the re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Au≈øtrian princes is ≈øtately and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, adorned within with fine paintings, and decorated without by natural and artificial foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ≈øtatues, plea≈øant gardens, groves, walks, and covered galleries, leading to five different churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A-propas</hi>‚ÄîLet me not forget the churches! In a chapel of the Franci≈øcan church, there is an image of the Virgin MARY as big as the life, of ≈øolid ≈øilver, with many, other images of faints of the ≈øame metal. If ≈øome of tho≈øe ≈øilver deities were transferred to Paris, I fear their divinity would not ≈øave them from the hands of the ≈øacrilegious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. One thing, however, is well worth the attention of travellers, particularly tho≈øe who wi≈øh to wipe away the ≈øins of a decea≈øed friend, and get them a direct pa≈ø≈øport to happine≈øs‚ÄîThis Franci≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can church is held to be one of the mo≈øt ≈øacred and venerable in the world, on account of the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences granted to it by ≈øeveral popes; ≈øo that one ≈øingle ma≈øs ≈øaid in it, is declared to be ≈øufficient to deliver a ≈øoul from the pains of purgatory. When we con≈øider the great and important extent of their power in that re≈øpect, we cannot wonder if they had all the ≈øaints in the calendar, and the Virgin MARY to boot, in ≈øolid ≈øilver, even of the ≈øize of the Colo≈ø≈øus at Rhodes.</p>
               <p>Hall, the ≈øecond city in Tyrol, lies one league from Inn≈øpruck: it is famous for its ≈øalt-works, and for a mint and ≈øilver mines, in which ≈øeven thou≈øand men, women, and children are con≈øtantly employed.</p>
               <p>At a royal palace and ca≈øtle called Ombras, lying at equal di≈øtance from Inn≈øpruck and Hall, there is an ar≈øenal, famous for a prodigious collection of curio≈øities, ≈øuch as medals, precious ≈øtones, ≈øuits of armour, and ≈øtatues of ≈øeveral princes on hor≈øeback, in their old rich fighting accoutrements; be≈øides

great variety of military ≈øpoils and trophies taken by the Hou≈øe of Au≈øtria; in particular, a ≈øtatue of FRANCIS the Fir≈øt and his hor≈øe, ju≈øt as they were taken at the battle of Pavia, and two others of Turki≈øh ba≈øhaws, with the co≈øtly habits and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which they were taken, embelli≈øhed with gold, ≈øilver, and precious ≈øtones. But, above all their curio≈øities, the mo≈øt extraordinary is an oak inclo≈øing the body of a deer: this la≈øt, however unaccountable, is fact; and equals, I think, any of the wonders in the metamorpho≈øes of OVID.</p>
               <p>Leaving Inn≈øpruck, I proceeded on my journey, and ≈øoon entered into the mountains, which are there of a terrible height‚ÄîI was the be≈øt part of a day a≈øcending them: as I got near the top, I was ≈øhewn, by my driver, the ≈øpot where FERDINAND, king of Hungary, and the Emperor CHARLES the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Although this mountain, called Bremenberg (or Burning-hill), is covered with ≈ønow for nine months in the year, it is inhabited to the very top, and produces corn and hay in abundance; at the highe≈øt part there is a po≈øt-hou≈øe, a tavern, and a chapel, where the traveller is accommodated with fre≈øh hor≈øes, provi≈øions, and, if he choo≈øes, a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of prayers‚ÄîI availed my≈øelf of the two fir≈øt; but the latter being not altogether in my way, I declined it, for which I could perceive that I was, by every mouth and eye in the place, con≈øigned to perdition as a heretic.</p>

               <p>Although it is but thirty-five miles from Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpruck to Bri≈øen, it was late when I reached the latter; and as it contained nothing worth either the trouble or delay attending the ≈øearch of it, I ≈øet out the next morning, and, travelling with high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on one ≈øide, and a river all along upon the other, arrived at a town called Bol≈øano, in the bi≈øhopric of Trent. The country all along was thickly inhabited, and the mountains perfectly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated and manured even to their highe≈øt tops. On entering the valley of Bol≈øano, I found the air becoming obviou≈øly ≈øweet, delightful, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; the vineyards, and all the trees and ≈øhrubs, olives, mulberries, willows, and ro≈øes, &amp;c. of all the mo≈øt lively green, and every thing marking the mo≈øt luxuriant vegetation.</p>
               <p>Bol≈øano is a ≈ømall, but extremely neat and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant town‚Äîbut nothing I ≈øaw about it plea≈øed me ≈øo much as their vineyards, which are planted in long terraces along the ≈øides of the hills, and are formed into the mo≈øt beautiful arbours, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Perhaps no part of the habitable globe is, within the ≈øame comparatively ≈ømall compa≈øs of earth, ≈øo wonderfully diver≈øified by the hand of nature in all her extremes, as that through which I have ju≈øt carried you. There, under almo≈øt the ≈øame glance

               <p>PERHAPS the learned unwi≈øe men of the world, who ≈øpend their lives poring after impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, have never met with a more copious ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of puzzle-pated enjoyment than the derivation of the names of places.

Doctor GOLDSMITH, in his <hi>Citizen of the World,</hi> has thrown this matter into high ridicule; and I recommend it to your peru≈øal, le≈øt this ≈øhadow of literature ≈øhould one

day wheedle you from more re≈øpectable pur≈øuits. Trent has afforded va≈øt exerci≈øe to book-worm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures in this way; for, while ≈øome pronounce it to be derived from Tridentum, and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe will have it that NEPTUNE was wor≈øhipped there, though ≈øo far from the ≈øea-others claim the di≈øcovery of its derivation from Tribus Torren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, or three ≈øtreams which run there. Now, as to the fir≈øt, exclu≈øive of forcing NEPTUNE all the way from the Gulph of Venice to their temples, I cannot find any ≈øuch ≈øimilarity in the ≈øound of Trent and Trident to warrant the inference; and as to the Tribus Torrentibus, they might as well ≈øay that a primmer or hornbook was found there, and that thence it was derived from the alphabet, ≈øince the ≈øame analogy ≈øub≈øi≈øted between them, namely, that the letters T, R, E, N, T are to be found in both. But, in the name of God, what ≈øignifies what it was called after? Its name is Trent; and if it had been Putney, or John o' Groat's hou≈øe, the town would be neither the better nor the wor≈øe, nor the trea≈øures of literature ≈øuffer any defalcation from the difference.</p>
               <p>The bi≈øhopric of Trent is about ≈øixty miles long, and forty broad‚Äîfertile, and abundant in wine, oil, fruit, and pa≈øture‚Äîand plea≈øant, the beautiful river Adige meandering through the whole of it from north to ≈øouth. The inhabitants are bigoted Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics‚Äîyou will the le≈øs wonder, then, that the bi≈øhop ≈øhould have ≈øo exten≈øive a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, and an annual revenue of forty thou≈øand crowns.</p>
               <p>As I receded from Germany, and advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Italy, I found the air, the per≈øons, and the manners of the people, to di≈øplay a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and to re≈øemble tho≈øe of the Italians more than tho≈øe of the Germans. Though Popi≈øh big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otry be pretty ≈øtrong in many parts of Germany, it no where there a≈ø≈øumes the gloomy, dete≈øtable a≈øpect that it does in Italy.</p>

               <p>AS I approached Venice, I was much delighted with its appearance. Its ≈øtately ≈øteeples and noble buildings ≈øeemed as if ju≈øt emerging from the ≈øea, and floating on the ≈øurface of it; and it required no great ≈øtretch of fancy to imagine, that it undulated with the agitated waves of its parent the Adriatic. On all the ≈øurrounding coa≈øts, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and art ≈øeemed to have vied with each other in pouring the greate≈øt profu≈øion of their gifts, while thou≈øands of ma≈øts, ≈øcattered like fore≈øts over the ≈øurrounding bays, denoted that Venice, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with her own, ≈øhared in the wealth and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of other climes.</p>

                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:033487_0131_0FF7235608663CF0"/>It is indeed difficult to conceive a more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and plea≈øing appearance than this city makes at a di≈øtance, whether you approach it from the ≈øea or from the continent. Built not like towns in Holland, where immen≈øe moles and walls pu≈øh the ≈øea forward, and encroach on his dominion, it ≈øtands on piles erected in the ≈øea; and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the hou≈øes almo≈øt touching the water, gives it the appearance of floating on its ≈øurface. The ≈øteeples are ≈øeen at ≈øea at the di≈øtance of thirty miles; and the pro≈øpect becomes more beautiful the nearer it is approached‚Äîpre≈øenting in many views the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of floating i≈ølands.</p>
               <p>To erect a city thus upon the water, while ≈øo many thou≈øands of acres ≈øtand unoccupied, at fir≈øt ≈øight ≈øeems extraordinary‚Äîbut all tho≈øe great and ≈øtrange deviations from the ordinary path pre≈øented by nature, have their ≈øource in nece≈ø≈øity; and it is not till long after the nece≈ø≈øity has been fir≈øt lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards obviated, that experience comes into aid, and demo≈øtrates, that, from her, ≈øecurity and utility have often ari≈øen. Thus it is with Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, who, fortified by her local ≈øituation (the effort of nece≈ø≈øity), ≈øits ≈øecure, and bids defiance to the world.</p>
               <p>The place where Venice now ≈øtands, is ≈øuppo≈øed to have been formerly a mar≈øhy ground, on which the Adriatic Sea had gradually encroached, leaving the more elevated parts of it above water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forming a va≈øt number of little i≈ølands, hence called Lagunes: on tho≈øe the fi≈øhermen of the neighbouring ≈øhores built their huts; and when Italy was invaded by the Goths under AIARIC, and afterwards by that barbarous race the Huns, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ATTILA, both of whom ≈øpread ruin and de≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wherever they came, va≈øt numbers of people from the circumjacent ≈øhores of the Adriatic, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from Padua and Aquileia, ≈øled hither, and brought along with them immen≈øe wealth.

inquiry that I could make, I found that there was only one ≈øhip ready to ≈øail, and no probability of any other for a con≈øiderable time after‚ÄîI did every thing I could to avail my≈øelf of this conveyance, but was di≈øappointed, owing to a young lady being pa≈ø≈øenger, who was daughter to the owner of the ve≈ø≈øel‚Äîand the old gentleman did not approve of an Engli≈øh officer being of the party with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>Hearing, however, that a ≈øhip lay at Trie≈øte, which was to ≈øail thence for Alexandria in Egypt, I determined to embrace that opportunity, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of my former intended route, go to Grand Cairo, thence to Saez, and ≈øo down the Red Sea, by way of Mecca, to Moca, and thence to Aden, which company's ve≈ø≈øels, or India country traders are always to be found going to one or other of the Briti≈øh ≈øettlements.</p>
               <p>I accordingly ≈øet out for Trie≈øte, with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of a ≈øanguine mind, anxious to change place, eager to pu≈øh forward, and full of the new route I had laid down‚Äîthe charms of which, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of ≈øeeing Grand Cairo, the Land of Egypt, and the Pyramids, were painted by my imagination in all the glowing exaggerated colours of romance. The captain of the ve≈ø≈øel was then at Venice, and I accompanied him to Trie≈øte, which is about ≈øixty miles from Venice.</p>
               <p>Soon after our arrival at Trie≈øte, I had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to find, that the ve≈ø≈øel was by no means

likely to keep pace with the ardour of my mind, and that, owing to ≈øome unfore≈øeen event, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was to be delayed; ≈øo, after a few of tho≈øe effu≈øions which may be ≈øuppo≈øed on ≈øuch an occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to e≈øcape a man of no very cool temper hanging on the tenter-hooks of expectation, I found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to ≈øit down, and patiently wait the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time and event, which nothing could either impede or accelerate.</p>
               <p>It has often been remarked, and is held as a point of faith by Prede≈øtinarians, that ≈øome men are doomed by fate to di≈øappointment‚Äîand that, when they are ≈øo, no wi≈ødom can obviate, no vigilance provide again≈øt, nor no re≈øolution re≈øi≈øt, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; but, that, in ≈øpite of all the efforts of rea≈øon and indu≈øtry, a ≈øeries of ≈øini≈øter events ≈øhall pur≈øue them through life, and meet them at every turn they attempt to take. Such has been my lot for the greate≈øt part of my life‚Äîbut I have neither faith enough in prede≈øtination, nor ≈øelf-love enough ≈øo far to blind me to my own faults, as to ≈øuppo≈øe that lady Fate had any thing at all to do with it. No, no; it was often owing to a temper, warm, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and uncontroled, which, in almo≈øt all cares of momentary embarra≈ø≈øment, cha≈øed rea≈øon from her office, u≈øurped her place, and decided as chance directed.

               <p>On my arrival at Alexandria, I found, to my fre≈øh mortification, that the plague was raging all over Egypt‚Äîand as, if this was not of it≈øelf ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to block up my intended route, an irruption of the Arabs, who in formidable bodies infe≈øted all the roads, put a period to all my hopes of ≈øeeing Grand Cairo, and viewing the curio≈øities of that country, which all who, like us, have the Bible put early into their hands, are taught to venerate as ≈øoon as they are taught to read.

               <p>Alexandria was built by ALEXANDER the Great, ≈øoon after the overthrow of Tyre, about 333 years before CHRIST, and is ≈øituated on the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, twelve miles we≈øt of that mouth of the Nile, anciently called Canopicum. A very extraordinary circum≈øtance is related as a proof of the ≈øuddenne≈øs of ALEXANDER'S re≈øolution to build it: After he had directed the number of public ≈øtrictures, and fixed the places where they were to ≈øtand, there were no in≈øtruments at hand proper for marking out the walls, according to the cu≈øtom of tho≈øe
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:033487_0146_0FF7237F01749EA0"/>
times: upon this, a workman advi≈øed the King to collect what meal was among the ≈øoldiers, and ≈øift it in lines upon the ground, in order to mark out the circuit of the walls: the advice was followed, and the king's ≈øooth≈øayer interpreted it to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of the future pro≈øperity and abundance of the city. This prophecy was certainly afterwards ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; for it ≈øoon became the emporium of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, of arts, and of ≈øciences.</p>
               <p>By the de≈øcription of STRABO and other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, it appears that this city was built upon a plan well worthy the va≈øt mind of its founder; and the fragments of its ornaments afterwards made part of the grande≈øt embelli≈øhments of Rome and Con≈øtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In the mu≈øeum of the royal palace, which occupied a fourth part of the city, the body of ALEXANDER was depo≈øited in a golden coffin‚Äî but the dete≈øtable SELDUCUS CIBYOFACTES viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the monument, took away the golden coffin, and ≈øub≈øtituted a gla≈øs one in its place.</p>
               <p>This city like mo≈øt others of antiquity, has been the ≈øcene of terrible ma≈ø≈øacres. About two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after its foundation, it was totally depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated by PTOLEMY PHYSCON‚Äîthe very few who e≈øcaped ≈øtronger, flying into other countries. De≈øirous, however, not to reign over empty hou≈øes, he ≈øeduced inhabitants from the neighbouring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and again, for ≈øome ≈ølight offence, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a general ma≈ø≈øacre of the young men; and accordingly, when they were one day a≈ø≈øembled in the Gymna≈øium, or place of public exerci≈øe, he ordered it to be ≈øet on fire, ≈øo that all peri≈øhed, either in the flames, or by the ≈øwords of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, whom he had placed at all the avenues.

<pb n="148" facs="unknown:033487_0147_0FF72382854E0840"/>
murdered, without di≈øtinction of age or ≈øex; ≈øo that, in one night's time, the whole city floated in blood, and every hou≈øe was filled with carca≈øes: the mon≈øter him≈øelf, retiring to the temple of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis, was all the time imploring the protection of the Deity‚Äîa proof that practical devotion and the mo≈øt atrocious inhumanity may meet in the ≈øame bo≈øom. As if this had not been ≈øufficient ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, he ≈øtripped the city of all its ancient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges‚Äîordered all ≈øtrangers who lived there to depart‚Äîand, that the few who remained might not have the ≈øatisfaction of ≈øeeing one another, he cut off all communication of one ≈øtreet with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by walls built for the purpo≈øe, and guarded with troops.</p>

Nothing can equal the maje≈øty of this monument: ≈øeen from a di≈øtance it over-tops the town, and ≈øerves as a ≈øignal for ve≈ø≈øels; approaching it nearer, it produces an a≈øtoni≈øhment mixed with awe: one would never be tired of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the beauty of the capital, the length of the ≈øhaft, nor the extraordinary ≈øimplicity of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øtal. Some years ago, a party of Engli≈øh ≈øeamen contrived, by flying a kite, to draw a line over the pillar, and by that means made a kind of a ≈øhroud, by which they got up, and on the very top of it drank a bowl of punch, to the utter a≈øtoni≈øhment of a multitude who came to ≈øee them; they broke off one of the volutes of the column, but amply compen≈øated for this mi≈øchief by a di≈øcovery they made, as, without their evidence, the world would not have known, at this hour, that there was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally a ≈øtatue on this column, one foot and ancle of which, of enormous ≈øize, are ≈øtill remaining.‚Äî The other is the obeli≈øk of CLEOPATRA, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe ≈øize, and of one ≈øingle piece of granite mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p>The whole i≈øland, as well as particular towns, was entirely con≈øecrated to the godde≈øs VENUS, who thence was called VENUS CYPRIA, or DEA CYPRIA, and is repre≈øented by the poets as taking a preculiar plea≈øure in vi≈øiting it; and this unque≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably aro≈øe from the loo≈øe habits and la≈øcivious temperament of the women there, who certainly are, at this time, not remarkable for cha≈øtity.</p>
               <p>I mu≈øt confe≈øs, however, that I felt great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in entering Cyprus; it was, as I have already ≈øtated, cla≈ø≈øic ground, and dedicated to the Queen of Love. But a traveller who vi≈øits it with ≈øhapes of amu≈øement, will be much di≈øappointed; for in no one particular did it ≈øeem to me to re≈øemble that Cyprus famed in the Heathen Story and Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Of the Cyprian queen's favours the ladies ≈øeemed to boa≈øt no one ma≈øk, ≈øave the mo≈øt nau≈øeous, di≈øgu≈øting lewdne≈øs; and the natural fertility of the ≈øoil is half lo≈øt beneath the oppre≈ø≈øive yoke of the ≈øervants of the Turki≈øh government. Thus, in the extraordinary revolutions that human affairs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øantly undergoing, that i≈øland which for its ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior beauties was ≈øuppo≈øed to be the re≈øidence of love, which gave birth to the philo≈øophers ZENO, APPOLLONIUS, anD XENOPHON, is now a mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, half-cultivated ≈øpot, peopled with a mixture of wretched Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Chri≈øtians
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:033487_0153_0FF72392E95135A0"/>
‚Äîgroaning under the tyranny of a barbarous de≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic abu≈øe of delegated power‚Äîinfe≈øted with locu≈øts which devour the fruits of the earth‚Äîand di≈øgraced by a race of ignominious women, who e≈øteem it to be an act of religion to pro≈øtitute them≈øelves to all ≈øtrangers.</p>
               <p>Our RICHARD the Fir≈øt made a conque≈øt of this i≈øland on his way to the Holy Land, and conferred the royalty of it on GUY LUSIGNAN, king of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem. The Venetians po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves of it in the year 1480‚Äîbut, in the ≈øixteenth century, the Turks di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed them, and have ever ≈øince kept it under the yoke‚ÄîI ≈øhould have remarked that then wine is excellent.</p>
               <p>Continuing my route, I hired another boat, after only forty-eight hours ≈øtay at Cyprus, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Latichea, which, as I have ≈øomewhere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, is a con≈øiderable ≈øea-port town of Syria, built on a promontory of land, which, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the ≈øea, occa≈øions its being continually refre≈øhed with breezes. Fortune, who had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been not very liberal in her di≈øpen≈øations, now favoured me; for, ju≈øt as I arrived at Latichea, a caravan was preparing. The con≈øul of the Turki≈øh Company at Cyprus received me with great polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and ho≈øpitality‚Äîgave me a letter to the re≈øident at Latichea; and by his in≈øtruction and a≈ø≈øi≈ø≈øtance, after a very ≈øhort ≈øtay, I ≈øet out on my way to Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po with the caravan.</p>
               <p>As I ≈øhall hereafter have occa≈øion more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to de≈øcribe the nature or tho≈øe caravans, I ≈øhall, for the pre≈øent, tell you, that this was compo≈øed of no other bea≈øts of burden than mules and a≈ø≈øes, of which there were not le≈øs than three or four hundred in number.</p>
               <p>Mounted on a mule, I travelled along, well plea≈øed with the fertile appearance of the country, and delighted with the ≈øerenity of the air‚ÄîWe were, as well as I can now recollect, near ten days on the road; during which time we travelled only

in the morning early, and in the heat of the day repo≈øed under the ≈øhade of trees.</p>
               <p>I was informed, that if, in≈øtead of going to Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea, I had gone to Scandaroon (otherwi≈øe Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta), I ≈øhould, in the road from thence to Aleppo, have travelled through a country, in which the mo≈øt ≈øingular and extravagant cu≈øtoms prevail that exi≈øt in any country emerged from barbari≈øm‚ÄîSeveral of tho≈øe I heard; but one in particular was, that the men pro≈øtituted their wives and daughters to all comers‚Äîand that this originated from a principle of religion, though there was every rea≈øon to believe, that, like many of their religious in≈øtitutions, it was made at la≈øt ≈øub≈øervient to the gratification of avarice.</p>
               <p>On my way to Aleppo, I was met by a Mr. ‚Äî, an Engli≈øh gentleman, who had heard of my coming, and who, in the mo≈øt kind and ho≈øpitable manner, in≈øi≈øted upon my living at his hou≈øe in≈øtead of the Briti≈øh con≈øul's, where I ≈øhould otherwi≈øe have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øided during my ≈øtay there; and his manner of a≈øking me was ≈øo engaging, intere≈øting, and impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive, that I found it impo≈ø≈øible to refu≈øe him.</p>

In all the various nations through which we have pa≈ø≈øed, a certain parity of ≈øentiment, ari≈øing from the ore great ≈øub≈øtratum, Chri≈øtianity, gave the ≈øame general colouring to all the ≈øcenes, however they might differ from each other in their various ≈øhadings.

                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:033487_0156_0FF7239BC2DD3720"/>In the empire now before us, were we to leave our judgment to the guidance of general opinion of Chri≈øtian nations, we ≈øhould have, on the contrary, to contemplate man under a variety of forms and modifications, ≈øo entirely different from tho≈øe to which habit has familiari≈øed our minds, as at fir≈øt to impre≈øs us with an idea of a total di≈øruption from our nature, and induce us, as it has already the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of our people, to divorce them from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of all tho≈øe ≈øympathetic feelings which ≈øerve to enforce the di≈øcharge of mutual good offices among men. Deducing all their principles, not only of moral conduct, but municipal government, from a religion radically different from, and e≈ø≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally adver≈øe to, ours; deluded by that ≈øy≈øtem into a variety of opinions which liberality it≈øelf mu≈øt think ab≈øurd; unaided by that enlightened philo≈øophy which learning, and learned men, acting under the influence of comparative freedom, and a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the art of printing, have diffu≈øed through the ma≈øs of Europeans; and living under a climate the mo≈øt unfavourable to intellectual or bodily exertion, they exhibit a ≈øpectacle which the philo≈øophic and liberal mind mu≈øt view with di≈øapprobation, regret, and pity‚Äîthe illiberal fierce Chri≈øtian with unequalifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dete≈øtation and di≈øgu≈øt: while, on their part, bigoted to their own principles and opinions, they look on us with abhorrence, and indulge as con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious a contempt of, and antipathy to Chri≈øtians, which I apprehend no lap≈øe of time, without a great change of circum≈øtance, will be able to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Should Mahomedani≈øm and Chri≈øtianity ever happen to merge in Dei≈øm (but not otherwi≈øe), the inhabitants of Syria and Europe will agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider each other even as fellow creatures. In Spain and Portugal, Jew, Turk, and indeed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant, are without di≈øtinction called hogs. In Turkey, Jews and Chri≈øtians are di≈øcriminately called dogs; each thinking the other completely

excluded from the pale of humanity, and well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the dagger of any TRUE BELIEVER who would have the <hi>piety</hi> to apply it.</p>
               <p>You will allow, my dear FREDERICK, that it mu≈øt have been rather an important contemplation to your father, to have perhaps two thou≈øands miles to travel through the immen≈øe and almo≈øt trackle≈øs wilds of a country inhabited by ≈øuch people, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation of any others to accompany him in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for, unle≈øs a public di≈øpatch was to overtake me, there was little probability of my having a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle European partner of my fatigue and perils.</p>
               <p>However, as the period was not yet arrived at which I was to go forward, or even determine my mode of travelling, I endeavoured to ≈øoothe my mind as much as I could into content, and to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my ≈øtay at Aleppo, to acquire all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge po≈ø≈øible of the place, that is to ≈øay, of that city in particular, and of the Turki≈øh government and manners in general.</p>
               <p>A di≈øtant view of Aleppo fills the mind with expectations of great ≈øplendour and magnificence. The mo≈øques, the towers, the large ranges of hou≈øes with flat roofs, ri≈øing above each other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ≈øloping hills on which they ≈øtand, the whole variegated with beautiful rows of trees, form altogether a ≈øcene magnificent, gay, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful: but, on entering the town, all tho≈øe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected beauties vani≈øh, and leave nothing in the ≈øtreets to meet the eye, but a di≈ømal ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of high ≈øtone walls, gloomy as the rece≈ø≈øes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or ≈øtate pri≈øon, and unenlivened by windows, embelli≈øhed, as with us, by the human face divine. The ≈øtreets them≈øelves, not wider than ≈øome of the meane≈øt alleys in London, overca≈øt by the height of the pri≈øon-hou≈øes on either ≈øide, are rendered ≈øtill more formidably gloomy by the ≈øolitude and ≈øilence that pervade them; while here and there a lattice towards the top, barely vi≈øible, ≈øtrikes the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033487_0158_0FF7239FF8CFCED8"/>
≈øoul with the gloomy idea of thraldom, coercion, and impri≈øonment.</p>
               <p>This dete≈øtable mode of building, which owes its origin to jealou≈øy, and the ≈øcandalous re≈øtraints every man is empowered by the laws and religion of the place to impo≈øe upon the women con≈øigned either by ≈øale or birth to his tyranny, extends not to the in≈øide of the hou≈øes, many of which are magnificent and hand≈øome, and all admirably ≈øuited to the exigencies of the climate, and the dome≈øtic cu≈øtoms and manner of living of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The city is adorned, it is true, here and there, with mo≈øques and appendant towers, called Mina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, from which cryers call the faithful to prayers; and in ≈øome of the ≈øtreets there are arches built at certain di≈øtances from each other, ≈øo as to carry the eye directly through them, and form a vi≈øta of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable grandeur: but all the≈øe are far from ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to counterbalance the general a≈øpect or gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine≈øs and ≈øolitude which reigns over the whole, and renders it ≈øo peculiarly di≈øgu≈øting, particularly at fir≈øt ≈øight, to an Engli≈øhman who has enjoyed the gaiety and contemplated the freedom of a city in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>The mo≈øques (Mahomedan temples) are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly numerous in this city; indeed almo≈øt as much ≈øo as churches and convents in the Popi≈øh countries of Chri≈øtendom. There is nothing in their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance to attract the notice of the traveller, or indulge the eye of the architect; they are almo≈øt all of one form‚Äîan oblong quadrangle: and as to the in≈øide, I never had an opportunity of ≈øeeing one; none but Mu≈ø≈øulmen being permitted to enter them, at lea≈øt at Aleppo.</p>
               <p>The next buildings of a public kind to the mo≈øques that de≈øerve to be particularly mentioned, are the caravan≈øeras‚Äîbuildings which, whether we con≈øider the ≈øpirit of beneficence and charity that fir≈øt ≈øugge≈øted them, their national importance, or
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033487_0159_0FF723A377BFA6F8"/>
their exten≈øive utility, may rank, though not in ≈øplendour of appearance, at lea≈øt in true value, with any to be found in the world.</p>
               <p>Caravan≈øeras were originally intended for, and are now pretty generally applied to, the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ≈øtrangers and travellers, though, like every other good in≈øtitution, ≈øometimes perverted to the purpo≈øes of private emolument or public job: they are built at proper di≈øtances through the roads of the Turki≈øh dominions, and afford the indigent or weary traveller an a≈øylum from the inclemency of the weather; are in general very large, and built of the mo≈øt ≈øolid and durable materials; have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly one ≈øtory above the ground floor, the lower of which is arched, and ≈øerves for warehou≈øes to ≈øtow goods, for lodgings and for ≈øtables, while the upper is u≈øed merely for lodgings; be≈øides which, they are always accommodated with a fountain, and have cooks ≈øhops and other conveniencies to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wants of the lodgers. In Aleppo the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>avan≈øeras are almo≈øt exclu≈øively occupied by merchants, to whom they are, like other hou≈øes, rented.</p>
               <p>The ≈øuburbs of Aleppo, and the ≈øurrounding country, are very hand≈øome, plea≈øant, and, to a per≈øon coming out of the gloomy city, in ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects intere≈øting. Some to≈ø≈øed about into hill and valley lie under the hands of the hu≈øbandman; others are covered with hand≈øome villas; and others again ≈øaid out in gardens, whither the people of Aleppo occa≈øionally re≈øort for amu≈øement.</p>
               <p>The roofs of all the hou≈øes are flat, and formed of a compo≈øition which re≈øi≈øts the weather effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. On tho≈øe mo≈øt of the people ≈øleep in the very hot weather: they are ≈øeparated from each other by walls; but the Franks, who live contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to one another, and who, from their di≈øagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circum≈øtances with regard to the Turks, are under the nece≈ø≈øity of keeping up a friendly and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033487_0160_0FF723A5F8F6D708"/>
harmonious intercour≈øe together, have doors of communication, which are attended with the≈øe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and plea≈øing advantages, that they can make a large circuit without de≈øcending into the ≈øtreets, and can vi≈øit each other during the plaque, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running the ri≈øk of catching the infection by going among the natives below.</p>
               <p>There is a ca≈øtle in the city which I had nearly forgotten to mention‚ÄîThe natives conceive it to be a place of great ≈øtrength. It could not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with≈øtand the ≈øhock of a few pieces of ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a day. It is e≈øteemed a favour to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ≈øee it; and there is nothing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øe one for the trouble of obtaining permi≈ø≈øion, unle≈øs it be the pro≈øpect of the ≈øurrounding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which from the battlements is exten≈øive and beautiful.</p>
               <p>Near this ca≈øtle ≈øtands the ≈øeraglio, a large old building, where the ba≈øhaw of Aleppo re≈øides: the whole of it ≈øeemed to me to be kept in very bad repair, con≈øidering the importance of the place. It is ≈øurrounded by a ≈øtrong wall of great height: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides which, its contiguity to the ca≈øtle is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; as, in ca≈øe of popular tumults, or inte≈øtine commotions, the ba≈øhaw finds an a≈øylum in the latter, which commands and overawes the city, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without a numerous garri≈øon under the command of an Aga.</p>
               <p>Such is the ≈øummary account I have been able to collect of Aleppo, the capital of Syria; which, mean though it is when compared with the capitals of European countries, is certainly the third city for ≈øplendour, magnificence, and importance, in the va≈øt extent of the Ottoman Empire‚ÄîCon≈øtantinople and Grand Cairo only excelling it in tho≈øe points, and no other bearing any ≈øort of competition with it.</p>

               <p>HOWEVER faction may agitate or abu≈øe irritate the minds of men again≈øt the executive branch of their government, the people of every nation under Heaven are di≈øpo≈øed to think their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutional ≈øy≈øtem the be≈øt; and the artful intertexture of religion with governments confirms them in that opinion, and often con≈øigns the under≈øtanding to unalterable, error and illiberal prejudice. It would be wonderful, then, if the Turki≈øh con≈øtitution, founded on the Koran, was not looked upon with abhorence by the bulk of the Chri≈øtian world; and more wonderful ≈øtill, if the outrageous zealots of the Chri≈øtian church, who for ≈øo many centuries engro≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the learning of Europe to them≈øelves, ≈øhould not have handed down with exaggerated mi≈ørepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentation every circum≈øtance belonging to the great enemies of their faith. But that, at this day of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual illumination, mankind ≈øhould be envelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ≈øuch error and darkne≈øs, with regard to the government of ≈øo large a portion of the globe as Turkey, is extraordinary; and only to be accounted for by a reference, in the fir≈øt place, to tho≈øe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious prejudices which we ≈øuck in from our nur≈øe, and which habit, ince≈ø≈øant document, and every part of our education, tend to confirm in our mind; and in the next, to that indi≈øpo≈øition the human mind feels to part with its old prejudices, and the general indolence and incapacity of men to acquire knowledge by the arduous and fatiguing paths of ≈øtudy.</p>

belief of Europeans, we ≈øhould ≈øuppo≈øe that the life and property of every being in that va≈øt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were irremediably at the mercy of the Grand Seignior‚Äîand that, without laws to protect, or any intermediate power whatever to ≈øhield them, they were entirely ≈øubject to the capricious will of an inexorable tyrant, who, ≈øtimulated by cruelty, ≈øharpened by avarice, and unre≈øtrained by any law human or divine, did every thing to oppre≈øs his ≈øubjects, and carry de≈øtruction among mankind. I firmly believe, that, from the combination of ideas ari≈øing from tho≈øe prejudices, there are few Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who think or hear of the grand Turk, that do not, by an involuntary act of the mind, in≈øtantly think of blood and murder, ≈øtrangling with bow-≈øtrings, and ≈ølicing off heads with cimeters.</p>
               <p>As there is no part of your education more near my heart than the eradicating illiberal prejudices from your mind, and fortifying you again≈øt their a≈ø≈øaults; I find it impo≈ø≈øible to refrain from giving you my opinion of the Turki≈øh government, which I have been at ≈øome pains to collect, as well from oral information as from the be≈øt authors; and which, though very far from what a generous and univer≈øally philanthropic di≈øpo≈øition would wi≈øh them to have, is very different from that which is generally attributed to them, and unque≈øtionably far more limited in its powers than the governments of ≈øeveral Chri≈øtian countries I could mention.</p>
               <p>The con≈øtitution of that country is laid down ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly in the Koran.

limited and under control. But that is not all‚ÄîIt is equally certain that the Turki≈øh government is partly republican; for, though the people at large have no ≈øhare in the legi≈ølation, and are excluded by the Koran from it (which Koran has e≈øtabli≈øhed and preci≈øely a≈øcertained their rights, privileges, and per≈øonal ≈øecurity), yet there is an intermediate power which, when rou≈øed to exertion, is ≈øtronger than the Emperor's, and ≈øtands as a bulwark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the extremes of de≈øpoti≈øm and them. This body is the ULAMA, compo≈øed of all the members of the Church and the law, ≈øuperior to any nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, jealous of their rights and privileges, and partly taken from the people, not by election, but by profe≈ø≈øion and talents.‚ÄîIn this body are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øed the Moulahs, the hereditary and perpetual guardians of the religion and laws of the empire: they derive their authority as much as the Emperor from the Koran, and, when nece≈ø≈øary, act with all the firmne≈øs re≈øulting from a conviction of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which they often demon≈øtrate by oppo≈øing his mea≈øures, not only with impunity, but ≈øucce≈øs. Their per≈øons are ≈øacred; and they can, by means of the unbounded re≈øpect in which they are held, rou≈øe the people to arms, and proceed to depo≈øe. But, what is much more, the Emperor cannot be depo≈øed without their concurrence.</p>
               <p>If, by this provi≈øion of the con≈øtitution, the power of the monarch is limited, and the per≈øonal ≈øecurity of the ≈øubject a≈øcertained, on the one hand; the energy of the empire in its external operations is, on the other, very frequently and fatally pal≈øied by it. Declarations of war have been procra≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, till an injurious and irrecoverable act of ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility has been ≈øu≈øtained; and peace often protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when peace would have been advantageous. The Ulama being a numerous body, it has been found always difficult, often impo≈ø≈øible, to unite ≈øo many different opinions; and nothing being to
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033487_0164_0FF723AF18045C78"/>
be done without their concurrence, the executive power finds it often impo≈ø≈øible to take a deci≈øive ≈øtep in a cri≈øis of advantageous opportunity. But as this code of laws and government is received as a divine revelation, binding both prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ≈øuppo≈øed to be ≈øealed in Heaven, the breach of it would be ≈øufficient to confign even the monarch to depo≈øition and death.</p>
               <p>As to the military force, which in the hands of all De≈øpots has been made the in≈øtrument of the people's ≈ølavery, that of the Turk could avail him nothing; and, whenever it does interfere, acts only to his overthrow. The very reverence they have for his per≈øon ari≈øing from obedience to their religion, they are, <hi>√† fortiori,</hi> governed by it, not him. He holds no communication with them; and the ≈øtanding force of the Jani≈ø≈øaries is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ma≈øs of the people, only a handful. Some wild accounts, indeed, have ≈øtated it at 300,000; but the be≈øt informed fix it below 60,000 of which a great part con≈øi≈øts of fal≈øe mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and abu≈øes‚Äîgreat multitudes being enrolled to obtain certain privileges annexed to the office of Jani≈ø≈øary. The fact is, that the chief force of the empire is a militia compo≈øed of the people; who, with re≈øpect to obedience and ≈øubordination, are ≈øo loo≈øe that they leave their duty whenever they plea≈øe, without receiving any puni≈øhment. How far the people of Turkey are protected from the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of power, will appear from the recital of a fact related by one of the be≈øt and mo≈øt liberal of our hi≈øtorians on that ≈øubject, and which is of too great notoriety to be doubted.</p>

was determined that the only certain means to do ≈øo was, to leave a ≈øpace of clear ground all round it, for which purpo≈øe the contiguous hou≈øes ≈øhould be purcha≈øed from the proprietors, and demoli≈øhed. All the owners of the hou≈øes agreed to the ≈øale, except one old woman, who pertinaciou≈øly refu≈øed: ≈øhe ≈øaid ≈øhe was born, and had lived all her life, in that ≈øpot, and would not quit it for any one. Now, in England, for the convenience of a private canal, the Parliament would force her to ≈øell. But what did they ≈øay in Turkey?

No! an≈øwered the magi≈øtrates and the Ulama, it is impo≈ø≈øible! it cannot be done! it is her property. While the power of the monarch is thus limited, and the rights of the people thus a≈øcertained by the Koran, and in things manife≈øt and open to view rigidly adhered to, ju≈øtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man is rarely admini≈øtered; for, though the laws them≈øelves are good, the corrupt admini≈øtration of them di≈øarms their effect, and di≈øtorts them from their purpo≈øe.

               <p>Thus it is between the Turks and us‚Äîthe little of their affairs which the prejudice of the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans have allowed them≈øelves to communicate, or ≈øuffered others to glean among them, has been in general ≈øo mi≈øu≈øed, di≈øtorted, and mi≈ørepre≈øented by the prejudices of the Chri≈øtians, that it is not going beyond the truth to ≈øay, there exi≈øt not a people in the civilized world who≈øe real hi≈øtory and genuine ≈øtate are ≈øo little known as tho≈øe of the Turks: and the wor≈øt of it is, that not one mi≈ørepre≈øentation, not one ≈øingle mi≈øtake has fallen on the generous, charitable ≈øide; but all, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception tend to repre≈øent the Turk in the mo≈øt degraded and dete≈øtable point of view.

               <p>One ≈øtriking feature in the con≈øtitution of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key is, that neither blood nor ≈øplendid birth are of them≈øelves ≈øufficient to recommend a man to great offices. Merit and abilities alone are the pinions which can lift ambition to its height. The cottager may be exalted to the highe≈øt office in the empire; at lea≈øt there is no ab≈øolute impediment in his way; and I believe it has often happened. Compare this with France under its late monarchy, where no merit could rai≈øe a man from the Canaille: this, I ≈øay, is one of the criterions of a free con≈øtitution, and Turkey is ≈øo far democratic.</p>
               <p>The very fir≈øt principle ingrafted in the minds of the Mahomedan children, is a high contempt of all religions but their own; and from the minute babes are capable of di≈øtingui≈øhing, they are taught to call Chri≈øtians by the name of Ghiaour, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del: this grows up in their manhood ≈øo ≈øtrong in them, that they will follow a Chri≈øtian through the ≈øtreets, and even ju≈øtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But let us recollect how a Turk would be treated in Spain or Portugal, and we ≈øhall ≈øee that inhuman bigotry may be found in a greater degree among Chri≈øtians than even Mahomedans.

               <p>The Mahomedans are divided into two ≈øects, as the Chri≈øtians are into many. Tho≈øe are the ≈øect of Ali, and the ≈øect of Omar. Now, I have never heard among them of one ≈øect burning the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately: but the Roman Catholics, even now, burn Prote≈øtants by juridical ≈øentence‚Äîburn their fellow Chri≈øtians to death for differing from them in a mere ≈øpeculative point of doctrine. Which then are the better men? I am ≈øure it is unnece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to ≈øay; though bad are the be≈øt.</p>
               <p>The Turks are allowed, by tho≈øe who know them be≈øt, to have ≈øome excellent qualities; and I think, that in the prodigality of our cen≈øure, which, tho' ≈øtow acquainted with them, we are forward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little, it would be but fair to give them credit for many of tho≈øe good qualities, which even among our≈øelves it requires the greate≈øt intimacy and the warme≈øt mutual confidence and e≈øteem to di≈øclo≈øe or di≈øcover in each other. That they have many vices is certain. What people are they that have not? Gaming they dete≈øt; wine they u≈øe not, or at lea≈øt u≈øe only a little, and that by ≈øtealth; and as to the plurality of women, it can in them be ≈øcarcely deemed a vice, ≈øince their religion allows it. One vice, and one only, of a dark dye is laid to their charge; and that has been trumpeted forth with the grievous and horrid addition, that though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to nature, it was allowed by their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This I have rea≈øon to believe is one of the many fabrications and artifices of Chri≈øtian zealots, to render Mahomedani≈øm more odious: for I have been informed from the mo≈øt competent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpectable authority, and am therefore per≈øuaded, that the dete≈øtable crime to which I allude, is forbidden both by the Koran and their municipal laws; that it is openly condemned by all, as with us; and

his hand to a woman: this is, doubtle≈øs, right, with ≈øome limitations; but they carry it ≈øo far as to allow no provocation, be it what it may, ≈øufficient to ju≈øtify u≈øing force or ≈øtrokes to a woman; the utmo≈øt they can do is, to ≈øcold and walk off. The con≈øequence of this is, that the women often run into the mo≈øt violent exce≈ø≈øes.

               <p>Among the variety of errors and moral ab≈øurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fal≈øely a≈øcribed to the Mahomedan religion, the exclu≈øion of women from Paradi≈øe holds a very con≈øpicuous place, as a charge equally fal≈øe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd; on the contrary, the women have their fa≈øts, their ablutions, and the other religious rites deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mahomedans nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation.

               <p>The difficulty of obtaining information of any kind in Turkey, is very great; of their religion chiefly they are extremely tenacious; and as to their women, it is allowed by the be≈øt informed men, who have lived there for many years, in departments of life that gave them the be≈øt means of obtaining information Europeans can have, that, at be≈øt, but a very imperfect knowledge can be had of them. Yet travellers who probably never migrated farther than "from the green bed to the brown," have given us di≈ø≈øu≈øe accounts of their religion; and adventurers who never were beyond the purlieus of Drury, have ≈øcaled Seraglio walls, and carried off the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Sultans.</p>
               <p>The truth is, my dear FREDERICK, the Turks, like all other people, have their ≈øhare of vices, but are by no means countenanced in them by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and from what I have been able to collect, as well from my own inquiries and ob≈øervations, as from reading the be≈øt hi≈øtorians, I am per≈øuaded that they have not, in the whole ≈øcope of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dani≈øm, one doctrine ≈øo ≈øubver≈øive of virtue, or ≈øo encouraging to the indulgence of vice, as many that are to be found in that curious code, Popery.</p>
               <p>The malice of our intemperate zealots again≈øt Mahomedani≈øm has been of cour≈øe extended to its founder with more than common exaggeration and additions. They have repre≈øented Mahomet to be a man of mean origin, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing a mind unenlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by ≈øcience or literature, and an under≈øtanding and faculties naturally gro≈øs.

and fortitude; and the two fir≈øt caliphs lived as poor as Mahomet him≈øelf, although they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe revenues, commanded va≈øt armies, and were lords of great provinces. As to his under≈øtanding I can only ≈øay, that perhaps he was the very la≈øt man in the world who≈øe intellectual powers ≈øhould be called in que≈øtion. His genius was unbounded, his ≈øpirit enterpri≈øing, his powers of addre≈øs were unequalled, he was allowed to be the greate≈øt ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his time; and yet, with all the≈øe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his under≈øtanding was ≈ølighted. It is a logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth, that when people prove too much, they prove nothing at all: our Chri≈øtian zealots, in this in≈øtance, have over≈øhot the mark, and thereby rendered all their other information at lea≈øt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Perhaps the con≈øummation of all policy was Mahomet's pretending to be an idiot, in order to make his great and wonderful effu≈øions appear to be the immediate in≈øpiration of Heaven‚ÄîHe call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him≈øelf THE IDIOT PROPHET.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mohammed.</note>

               <p>The whole of Mahomedani≈øm may be reduced ≈øimply to this one article of faith‚Äî"There is but one GOD, and MAHOMET is the prophet;" but upon this they have ≈øuperinduced, from time to time, ≈øuch a variety of ab≈øurdities as would require volumes to de≈øcribe: however, in ≈øtrict candour let us reflect, and a≈øk our own hearts the que≈øtion, whether ≈øprinkling with holy water, or wor≈øhipping a bit of white wafer as GOD, can be exceeded, or are le≈øs ab≈øurd than the periodical ablutions of the Turks, or their going on a pilgrimage to Mecca?</p>

be like one of tho≈øe mi≈øerable animals I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed. There may be chara≈øters more wicked‚ÄîI know none ≈øo utterly contemptible.</p>
               <p>All extremes are bad; but the exceedings of virtue even where they run into error, are ≈øtill preferable to vice. However ludricous it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we cannot ab≈øolutely de≈øpi≈øe or condemn the prudery of the Turki≈øh women, though it runs into ≈øuch extravagance, that, when feeding their poultry, they keep carefully vieled if there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be a cock among them, ≈øo fa≈øtidiou≈øly aver≈øe are they to the odious male creature ≈øeeing their pretty faces.</p>
               <p>When the circum≈øtances under which the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh women ≈øtand are con≈øidered, it mu≈øt appear amazing, that cha≈øtity, from principle, is univer≈øal among them, as it is confe≈ø≈øed to be: the nature of man urges him to de≈øire, with greate≈øt ardour, that which is mo≈øt forbidden; and women who are much confined, may well be ≈øuppo≈øed to have their pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions inflamed by the exaggerated workings of the imagination. Infidelity, however, to the marriage-bed, is much le≈øs frequent among the men there, than among the women here; and the tide or fa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which in this country gives ≈øuch a rapid and irre≈øi≈øtible circulation to vice and adultery, runs there in an oppo≈øite direction; and contrary to our cu≈øtoms, no man is ≈øo unfa≈øhionable in Turkey as he that has interrupttd the dome≈øtic peace of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily by ≈øeduction.</p>
               <p>Among the many virtues which may with ≈øtrict ju≈øtice be a≈øcribed to the Turks, ho≈øpitality holds a con≈øpicuous place. It is not confined to common civility, it extends to per≈øonal protection. Many deem it ab≈øolutely their duty to ri≈øk their lives in defence of their gue≈øts; nor will any motive, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cogent, be allowed to ju≈øtify the violation of it. Nay, to ≈øuch a ≈øy≈øtem is it carried up, that an engagement with a ≈øtranger is accepted as an excu≈øe

for not obeying the ≈øummons of a great man, when no other apology, not even that of indi≈øpo≈øition, would be admitted.</p>
               <p>While the Turks abhor and de≈øpi≈øe all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions but their own, their government is by no means intolerant in ≈øpiritual concerns. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of all religions is free, and at Con≈øtantinople (we are told) Monks dre≈øs in their habits, and are allowed at funeral proce≈ø≈øions to elevate the cro≈øs, which is more than the Engli≈øh tyranny allowed the Roman Catholics of Ireland to do, till very lately: a Turk, however, convicted of apo≈øtacy, could not by any means e≈øcape death. Meantime it mu≈øt be ob≈øerved, that if they keep up a decent ≈øemblance of the forms of their religion, no intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive inquiry is made unto their real faith: and though it is one of the injunctions of Mahomet to endeavour to convert unbelievers, and they ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in obedience to that command ≈øolicit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion of Chri≈øtians and others; they never ≈øail to con≈øider any renegado, or per≈øon who becomes a convert, with contempt, if not di≈ølike.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this letter with an extract from that mo≈øt valuable and accurate work, Ru≈ø≈øel's Hi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of Aleppo, which will give you a better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe a true, notion of Turki≈øh morals, than you are likely to receive from general opinion. "Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole," ≈øays he, "whether it be a≈øcribed to the influence of their political con≈øtitution, or to the ab≈øence of various temptations, which in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope often lead to the violation of better laws; there are perhaps few great cities where many of the private and dome≈øtic virtues are in general more prevalent than at Aleppo."</p>

               <p>THE u≈øe of periodical ≈øtated times of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is univer≈øally admitted, and the nece≈ø≈øity of adopting them makes a part of the Chri≈øtian code. The Mahomedan religion, however, exceeds it far in the rigid attention to, and frequency of, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. There are no le≈øs than five ≈øtated times of prayer in every twenty-four hours, fixed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpen≈øable, at none of which a true believer fails; and the fervency of their praying exceeds even the frequency.

And to tell a truth of them, if the Chri≈øtian cur≈øe them, they are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty even with them in return, never failing to pray for di≈øcord, enmity, and di≈ø≈øen≈øion among their enemies, as well as health and pro≈øperity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; and to the efficacy of tho≈øe prayers they fondly attribute all the wars and di≈ø≈øen≈øions which ince≈ø≈øantly hara≈øs Chri≈øtendom. A bell tolls as a public notice of prayer; and when a true Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan hears it, let him be where he will, whether at home or abroad, in the highway or in the market, be the place dirty or clean, wet or dry, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditely falls down and wor≈øhips.</p>
               <p>As ≈øub≈øidiary to prayer they have their ablutions, in which they are full as ≈øcrupulou≈øly punctual as in their prayers. One is preparatory to prayer, another

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another again incidental. Tho≈øe they never neglect to perform, unle≈øs ≈øome in≈øuperable ob≈øtacle lies in the way. Charity, that mo≈øt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doctrine of any religion, is enjoined by the Koran under the mo≈øt heavy denunciation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly vengeance, in ca≈øe of neglect; and by it they are charged to regard no bounds in liberality to the poor. Many Mu≈ø≈øulmen in their zeal to di≈øcharge this duty have given a fourth, many a third, and ≈øome one half of their property. Nay, the in≈øtances are not unfrequent of men giving away their all, and living afterwards them≈øelves upon alms. To do ≈øtrict ju≈øtice it mo≈øt be ≈øaid, that poverty is no where ≈øo re≈øpectfully attended to, honoured, or reverenced, as among the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans; who have a ≈øaying among them, "that the fear of want is a mark of the judgment of GOD."</p>
               <p>Ab≈øtinence is con≈øidered as a virtue among them, and very ≈øtrictly enjoined as a religious duty. The great fa≈øt appointed by the Koran continues for the month of Ramedan, during which time they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat, drink, nor conver≈øe with their wives, from ≈øun-ri≈øe till the ≈øtars appear, or the lamps are hung out at the mo≈øques. Any man who breaks it is puni≈øhed with death; but the wor≈øt of it is, that they will not allow even travellers, the ≈øick o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The la≈øt and greate≈øt ordinance of their religion is the pilgrimage to Mecca, which when once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed is ≈øuppo≈øed to be a dire≈øt pa≈ø≈øport to Heaven; and there are few of them who do not at one time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You will ob≈øerve from what I have already ≈øaid, that, excepting the mere points of religious faith, the moral ordinances of Mahomedani≈øm compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend mo≈øt of tho≈øe parts of the Chri≈øtian religion, on the practice of which the reputation of piety is founded; and that for ≈øtrict obedience to tho≈øe ordinances the Mahomedans are more remarkable than we are. Adultery is not frequent among them; wine is ≈øeldom or never u≈øed; theft is little known; ≈øo is murder. Then in the practical parts of devotion, there are in the fir≈øt place prayers; ≈øecondly, ab≈øtinence or fa≈øting; thirdly, charity. Tho≈øe are all Chri≈øtian doctrines, more zealou≈øly ob≈øerved by them than by us. Their ablutions are at lea≈øt no injury to the cau≈øe of morality or piety; but rather, being done as a religious exerci≈øe, ≈øerve to keep up the ≈øeries of intercour≈øe which ≈øhould ≈øub≈øi≈øt between the creature and his Creator: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, I cannot help thinking with our inimitable poet Thom≈øon, that

And as to the pilgrimage to Mecca, however irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional it may appear to us, it is at lea≈øt recommended by ≈øincerity and zeal, and is doubtle≈øs in the eye of an all-≈øeeing Providence meritorious. HE, we are to ≈øuppo≈øe, will judge, not by the value of the act, but the purity of the motive; and will accept it as the offering of a frail, blind mortal, bending in obedience to that which he conceives to be the will of Heaven.

               <p>Bani≈øh then, my FREDERICK! bani≈øh from your heart all illiberal and uncharitable prejudices, if any have yet found their way to it. Revere and cling to your religion as the be≈øt and mo≈øt conducive to eternal and temporal happine≈øs; and the more good becau≈øe it enjoins us to be charitable even to the Jews as well as to the Gentiles: but never think that you advance the cau≈øe of that religion, or do ≈øervice to your GOD, by waging war again≈øt your fellow-creatures for opinions they can no more help entertaining than you can help having yours, or by denouncing again≈øt them that eternal ≈øentence which re≈øts with the Almighty alone to judge of or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.</p>

               <p>Among the gro≈øs mi≈ørepre≈øentations of which I complain, and which for the ≈øake of mankind I lament, is that general fal≈øehood, the infidelity of the Turki≈øh women. The re≈øpectable author whom I have before taken the freedom of quoting, I mean Dr. Ru≈ø≈øel, declares that in twenty years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidence at Aleppo, he did not remember a public in≈øtance of adultery; and that in the private walks of ≈øcandal tho≈øe he heard of were among the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt cla≈øs, and did not in number exceed a dozen. "In re≈øpect to the Franks (continues he) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is attended not only with ≈øuch ri≈øk to the individual, but may in its con≈øequences ≈øo ≈øeriou≈øly involve the whole ≈øettlement, that it is either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted, or is concealed with a ≈øecrecy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled in other matters. I have rea≈øon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that European travellers have ≈øometimes had a Greek courte≈øan impo≈øed on them for a ≈øultana; and after having been heartily frightened, have been induced to pay ≈ømartly, in order to pre≈øerve a ≈øecret which the day after was known to half the ≈øi≈øterhood in town." He remarks, however, that at Con≈øtantinople the ≈øtate of gallantry is different.</p>
               <p>On the ≈øubject of the Turki≈øh moral character, I have endeavoured to be as conci≈øe as ju≈øtice would allow me to be; and yet I find that I have gone to ≈øome length. I cannot however di≈ømi≈øs it without giving you a trait to which the mo≈øt ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate polemical prejudice, and the mo≈øt inveterate hatred, mu≈øt in ≈øpite of them pay the tribute of

applau≈øe. Their treatment to their ≈ølaves is beyond all example among us humane, tender, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ≈øuch as may well bring a blu≈øh into the faces of Chri≈øtian dealers in human fle≈øh. When young ≈ølaves, male or female, are bought by a Turk, they ≈øeem to be introduced into the family rather in the condition of an adopted child; they receive the ≈øame education, perform nearly the ≈øame offices, and are bound to no greater marks of re≈øpect than their ma≈øter's own children‚Äîand in fact feel none of the galling circum≈øtances of a ≈øtate of ≈øervility; the very wor≈øt treatment they ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is to be put on a footing with the menial do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øtics, or ordered to the ≈øame duty as a valet or a page. It often happens, on the other hand, that they are married into the family, and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are promoted to high offices in the ≈øtate. If they adopt the religion of their ma≈øters, it is always ≈øpontaneou≈øly; and even to ≈ølaves taken in war, no compul≈øion is u≈øed to make them change their faith.</p>
               <p>The following is the be≈øt de≈øcription I am able to give you of an Ea≈øtern caravan. It exactly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incides with my own ob≈øervations, and with the various accounts I have had from others.

                  <p>A CARAVAN, which is ≈øo often mentioned in the hi≈øtory and de≈øcription of the Ea≈øt, and in all the tales and ≈øtories of tho≈øe countries, is an a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of travellers, partly pilgrims, partly merchants, who collect together in order to con≈øolidate a ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

force to protect them, in travelling through the hideous wilds and burning de≈øerts over which they are con≈øtrained to pa≈øs for commercial and other purpo≈øes; tho≈øe wilds being infe≈øted with Arabs, who make a profe≈ø≈øion of pillage, and rob in mo≈øt formidable bodies, ≈øome almo≈øt as large as ≈ømall armies. As the collection of ≈øuch a number requires time, and the embodying of them is a ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern, it is concerted with great care and preparation, and is never attempted without the permi≈ø≈øion of the prince in who≈øe dominions it is to be formed, and of tho≈øe al≈øo through who≈øe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions it is to pa≈øs, expre≈ø≈øed in writing. The exact number of men and carriages, mules, hor≈øes, and other bea≈øts of burthen, are ≈øpecified in the licen≈øe; and the merchants to whom the caravan belongs, regulate and direct every thing appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its government and police during the journey, and appoint the various officers nece≈ø≈øary for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting it.</p>
                  <p>Each caravan has four principal officers: the fir≈øt, the caravanbachi, or head of the caravan; the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the captain of the march; the third, the captain of the ≈øtop or re≈øt; and the fourth, the captain of the di≈øtribution. The fir≈øt has the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable authority and command over all the others, and gives, them his orders: the ≈øecond is ab≈øolute during the march; but his authority imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cea≈øes on the ≈øtopping or encamping of the caravan, when the third a≈ø≈øumes his ≈øhare of the authority, and exerts it during the time of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at re≈øt: and the fourth orders the di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every part of the caravan, in ca≈øe of an attack or battle. This la≈øt officer has al≈øo during the march the in≈øpection and direction of the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of provi≈øions, which is conducted under his management by ≈øeveral inferior officers, who are obliged to give ≈øecurity to the ma≈øter of the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van; each of them having the care of a certain
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:033487_0186_0FF723E20F35E7D8"/>
number of men, elephants, dromedaries, camels, &amp;c. &amp;c. which they undertake to conduct and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh with provi≈øions at their own ri≈øque, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an agreement ≈øtipulated between them.</p>
                  <p>A fifth officer of the caravan is the pay-ma≈øter or trea≈øurer, who has under him a great many clerks and interpreters, appointed to keep accurate jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of all the material incidents that occur upon the journey. And it is by the≈øe journals, ≈øigned by the ≈øuperior officers, that the owners of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan judge whether they have been well or ill ≈øerved or conducted.</p>
                  <p>Another kind of officers are the mathematicians, without whom no caravan will pre≈øume to ≈øet out. There are commonly three of them attached to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan of large ≈øize; and they perform the offices both of quarter-ma≈øters and aides-de-camp, leading the troops when the caravan is attacked, and a≈ø≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quarters where the caravan is appointed to encamp.</p>
                  <p>There are no le≈øs than five di≈øtinct ≈øorts of cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans; fir≈øt, the heavy caravans, which are compo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of elephants, dromedaries, camels and hor≈øes; ≈øecondly, the light caravans, which have but few elephants; thirdly, the common caravans, where there are none of tho≈øe animals; fourthly the hor≈øe caravans, where there are neither dromedaries nor camels; and la≈øtly, ≈øea caravans, con≈øi≈øting of ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels; from whence you will ob≈øerve that the word caravan is not confined to the land, but extends to the water al≈øo.</p>
                  <p>The proportion ob≈øerved in the heavy caravan is as follows: When there are five hundred ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, they add a thou≈øand dromedaries and two thou≈øand hor≈øes at the lea≈øt: and then the e≈øcort is compo≈øed of four thou≈øand men on hor≈øeback. Two men are required for leading one elephant, five for three dromedaries, and ≈øeven for eleven cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. This multitude of ≈øervants, together with the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033487_0187_0FF723E965A89830"/>
officers and pa≈ø≈øengers, who≈øe number is uncertain, ≈øerve to ≈øupport the e≈øcort in ca≈øe of a fight, and render the caravan more formidable and ≈øecure. The pa≈ø≈øengers are not ab≈øolutely obliged to fight; but according to the laws and u≈øages of the caravans, if they refu≈øe to do ≈øo, they are not entitled to any provi≈øions whatever from the caravan, even though they ≈øhould agree to pay an extravagant price for them.</p>
                  <p>Every elephant is mounted by what they call a nick: that is to ≈øay, a young lad of nine or ten years old, brought up to the bu≈øine≈øs, who drives the elephant, and pricks it with a pointed iron to animate it in the fight: the ≈øame lad al≈øo loads the fire-arms of the two ≈øoldiers who mount the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, with him.</p>
                  <p>The day of the caravan ≈øetting out being once fixed, is never altered or po≈øtponed<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ≈øo that no di≈øappointment can po≈ø≈øibly en≈øue to any one.</p>

If they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øed, they generally come to ≈øome agreement; the conditions of which are pretty well ob≈øerved, e≈øpecially if the a≈ø≈øailants are native Arabians. The carrying on of robberies with ≈øuch armies may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a≈øtoni≈øhing; but when the temptation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, and when it is known that one caravan only is ≈øometimes enough to enrich tho≈øe princes, much of our ≈øurpri≈øe vani≈øhes.</p>

When therefore they arrive near a town, the inhabitants of the town and the people of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan hold a ≈øolemn conference concerning the ≈øtate of their health, and very ≈øincerely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to each other the ≈øtate of the ca≈øe, candidly informing each other whether there be danger on either ≈øide.‚ÄîWhen there is rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect any contagious di≈øtemper, they amicably agree that no communication whatever ≈øhall take place between them; and if the caravan ≈øtands in need of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, they are conveyed to them with the utmo≈øt caution over the walls of the town.</p>
                  <p>The fatigues, hard≈øhips, and hazards, attending tho≈øe caravans, are ≈øo great, that they certainly would never be undertaken, if the amazing profits did not in ≈øome mea≈øure counterbalance them.‚Äî The merchant who travels in them mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ≈øuch provi≈øions as he can get, mu≈øt part with all his delicacies, and give up all hope of ea≈øe; he mu≈øt ≈øubmit to the frightful confu≈øion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and nations; the fatigues of long marches over ≈øands, and under a climate almo≈øt ≈øufficiently hot to reduce him to a cinder: he mu≈øt ≈øubmit cheerfully to exorbitant duties fraudulently levied, and audacious robberies and ≈øubtle tricks practi≈øed by the herd of vagabonds who follow the caravans ‚Äîfor preventing which, the merchants have a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of well contrived locks, that can only be opened by tho≈øe who know the knack of them.</p>
                  <p>But in ≈øome tracks of caravans there are dangers, and horrible ones again≈øt which no human fore≈øight or power can provide, and beneath which whole caravans ≈øink, and are never after heard of.</p>

The lea≈øt mi≈øchief it occa≈øions is, to dry up the leathern bags which contain the provi≈øion of water for the journey. This wind, to which the Arabs give the epithet of poi≈øoned, often ≈øtifles in a moment tho≈øe who have the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to meet it; to prevent which, they are obliged to throw them≈øelves immediately on the ground, putting their faces clo≈øe to the burning ≈øands which ≈øurround them on all ≈øides, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their mouths with ≈øome linen cloth, le≈øt by breathing they ≈øhould ≈øwallow in≈øtantaneous death, which this wind carries with it wherever it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. ‚ÄîBe≈øides which, whole caravans are often buried under moving hills of burning ≈øand, rai≈øed by the agitation of the winds.</p>

                  <head>ACCOUNT OF THE CEREMONIES OBSERVED BY PILGRIMS ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT MECCA.</head>
                  <p>The caravans are generally ≈øo ordered, as to arrive at Mecca about forty days after the Fa≈øt of Ramedan, and immediately previous to the Corban, or Great Sacrifice. Five or ≈øix days before that fe≈øtival, the three great caravans, viz. that from Europe, that from A≈øia Minor, and that from Arabia, unite; and all, con≈øi≈øting of about two hundred thou≈øand men, and three hundred thou≈øand bea≈øts of burthen, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp at ≈øome miles from Mecca. The pilgrims form them≈øelves into ≈ømall detachments, and enter the town to arrange the ceremonies preparatory to the Great Sacrifice. They are led through a ≈øtreet of continual a≈øcent, till they arrive at a gate on an eminence, called the Gate of Health. From thence they ≈øee the great mo≈øque which inclo≈øes the Hou≈øe of Abraham. They ≈øalute it with the mo≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found re≈øpect and devotion, repeating twice, "Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Alek Iru≈øoul Allah!" that is to ≈øay, "Peace be with the Amba≈ø≈øador of God!" Thence, at ≈øome di≈øtance, they mount five ≈øteps to a large platform faced with ≈øtone, where they offer up then pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they then de≈øcend on the other ≈øide of it, and advance towards two arches, of the ≈øame kind of dimen≈øions, but at ≈øome di≈øtance from each other, through which they pa≈øs with great ≈øilence and devotion. This ceremony mu≈øt be performed ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times.</p>
                  <p>From hence proceeding to the great mo≈øque which inclo≈øes the Hou≈øe of Abraham, they enter the mo≈øque, and walk ≈øeven times round the little building contained within it, ≈øaying, "This is the Hou≈øe of GOD, and of his ≈øervant Abraham." Then ki≈ø≈øing with great veneration a black ≈øtone, ≈øaid to have de≈øcended white from Heaven, they go to the famous well called Zun Zun, which the angel

                  <p>At fifteen miles from the town of Mecca there is a hill called "Ghiabal Arafata," or "the Mount of Forgivene≈øs." It is about two miles in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference‚Äîa mo≈øt delicious ≈øpot. On it ADAM and EVE met, after the LORD had, for their tran≈øgre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, ≈øeparated them forty years. Here they cohabited and lived in exce≈øs of happine≈øs, having built a hou≈øe on it, called "Beith Adam," that is to ≈øay, "the Hou≈øe of Adam." On the eve of the day of Sacrifice, the three caravans, ranged in a triangular form, ≈øurround this mountain‚Äîduring the whole night the people rejoice, clamour, and riot‚Äîfiring off cannon, mu≈økets, pi≈øtols, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, with an ince≈ø≈øant ≈øound of drums and trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.

                  <p>"For that the ble≈ø≈øed, pious, and merciful GOD, giver of all good gifts, commanded his ≈øecretary, Abraham, to build him≈øelf a hou≈øe at Mecca, whence his de≈øcendants might pray to the Almighty, and their de≈øires be fulfilled.</p>

               <p>IN my la≈øt letters I endeavoured to give you an account of the Turki≈øh government, laws,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:033487_0194_0FF723FB6AEC0980"/>
and con≈øtitution in general, ≈øo far as I was able to collect information on the ≈øubject. I will now proceed to a de≈øcription of tho≈øe particular parts of that va≈øt empire through which I had occa≈øion to travel.</p>
               <p>During my ≈øtay at Aleppo, I experienced much politene≈øs and ho≈øpitality from the European gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try re≈øident there, and particularly from Mr. ‚Äî, at who≈øe hou≈øe I entirely re≈øided; and as the Franks live on a very good footing with each other, the time pa≈ø≈øed ≈øo agreeably, that were it not for "that within," I ≈øhould have been happy enough ‚ÄîWe rode out occa≈øionally, ≈øometimes hunting, ≈øometimes merely for the ride ≈øake. Sometimes with an intelligent native whom I got to walk with me, or with ≈øome of the Franks, I walked about the town, in order to amu≈øe away the time and ≈øee what was going forward, notwith≈øtanding the cry of "Frangi Cucu!" or "Cuckold Frank!" which frequently followed us for the length of a ≈øtreet. Sometimes we went of evenings to ≈øome of the outlets, where preperation was made for our recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ≈øervants, previou≈øly di≈øpatched for the purpo≈øe, and there regaled with coffee, wine, fruits, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt day we went on a party of the la≈øt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned kind, Mrs. ‚Äî did us the honour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us: the place appointed was in a range of beautiful rural gardens that lie along the ≈øide of a river; where the well cultivated earth teeming with a va≈øt abundance of the be≈øt e≈øculent plants, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, flowering ≈øhrubs and fruit-trees, afforded a mo≈øt delicious regale to the ≈øen≈øes; and the plane, the willow, the a≈øh, the pomegranate, and a variety of other trees, clu≈øtered together in almo≈øt impervious thickets, yielded a delightful ≈øhady retreat from the piercing rays of the ≈øun. It was on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion that I got the fir≈øt ≈øpecimen of Turki≈øh illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, which, as I was entirely unprepared for it
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:033487_0195_0FF7240047614070"/>
confounded me, and nearly deprived me of temper and of prudence. As we walked along, I ob≈øerved ≈øeveral Turks addre≈ø≈øing them≈øelves to Mrs. ‚Äî and me, who walked arm in arm, and ≈øpeaking with a loudne≈øs of voice, contortion of countenance, and violence of ge≈øticulation, attended with a clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of hands, which, though I did not under≈øtand their language, I could plainly perceive carried the appearance of a menace or in≈øult. I was at a lo≈øs what to think of it: Mrs. ‚Äî blu≈øhed, and ≈øeemed much hurt: Mr. ‚Äî and the other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were ≈øilent, and betrayed not the lea≈øt mark of emotion or re≈øentment. At length, when we got from them, I a≈øked what it meant? and was told, that it was all aimed at Mrs. ‚Äî, or at lea≈øt occa≈øioned by her: that, bigoted to the cu≈øtoms of their own country, and utterly ignorant of tho≈øe of any other, they were affected with great indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at her dre≈øs, occa≈øional derangement of her veil, and, above all, at the ≈øhamele≈øs and unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably wicked circum≈øtance of a woman walking ≈øo openly and familiarly in the company of men.‚Äî Talking of this affair afterwards with Mr. ‚Äî, the lady's hu≈øband, he a≈ø≈øured me, that there was not an opprobrious and infamous epithet which the vulgar ingenuity of the brighte≈øt que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was beyond mea≈øure a≈øtoni≈øhed at the coolne≈øs with which he bore it, and ≈øaid, that if I had under≈øtood what they had ≈øaid, I ≈øhould mo≈øt certainly have been unable to re≈øtrain my≈øelf, and would have knocked one of them down as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the re≈øt.

in the place, and you would your≈øelf fall a ≈øacrifice to it.</p>
               <p>Not long ≈øince I was conver≈øing on this ≈øubject with a gentleman of my acquaintance, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it with ≈øome a≈øperity, as ari≈øing from a ≈øpirit of bigotry peculiar to Mahomedans. "My good Sir," ≈øaid he, "let me undeceive you! the very ≈øame would be done in mo≈øt parts of Spain. I was one day," continued he, "walking in a town in Spain, in company with the wife of a gentleman who re≈øided there, who were both well known, and bore the mo≈øt unexceptionable character. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me however walking with her, the populace, as we pa≈ø≈øed, held up two fingers ≈øignificantly, and cried to her, What a cuckold is your hu≈øband! and concluded with 'Todas las Ingle≈øas ≈øon putas,' or, "All Engli≈øh women are ‚Äîs." He added, "that he was even in Cadiz, where commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercour≈øe renders them rather more liberal than in other part of the country, frequently acco≈øted by little children them≈øelves, with 'Crees in Dios?' Do you believe in God? and ≈øometimes forming a cro≈øs with the thumb of the right hand and the forefinger, 'Crees en e≈øte? Crees en e≈øte? No! No! Ah Judio! Moro! Barbaro! Bruto! Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtante! Puerco! Voia al los Infernos!!' In Engli≈øh‚ÄîDo you believe in this? Do you believe in this? No! No! Ah Jew! Moor! Barbarian! Prote≈øtant! Hog! Go to Hell!!"</p>
               <p>So much for human beneficience and charity, under the fo≈øtering au≈øpices of religion!</p>
               <p>The hou≈øe of Mr. ‚Äî, where I was ≈øo ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitably lodged, was a magnificent edifice, built in all the fulne≈øs of Ea≈øtern grandeur and luxury, and furni≈øhed with all the ≈øplendour and ≈øtate of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, united with the ta≈øte and opulence of Great Britain. It was indeed a hou≈øe in which voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øt it≈øelf might ≈øit down with ≈øatisfaction‚ÄîThe mo≈øt unaffected ho≈øpitality and generous benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:033487_0197_0FF724037748F828"/>
≈øpread the board, and politene≈øs and affability pre≈øided over all. Never ≈øhall I forget it‚Äînever ≈øhall I think of it without gratitude and e≈øteem.</p>
               <p>A gentleman of the opulence and con≈øequence of Mr. ‚Äî, with a hou≈øe ≈øuch as I have de≈øcribed, and a di≈øpo≈øition to ≈øocial enjoyment, was not, you will conclude, without a re≈øort of company and friends; in truth, he had friends even among the better ≈øort of Turks. Parties of plea≈øure had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termi≈ø≈øion while I was there; and as the ladies of Europe or of European extraction in that country are highly accompli≈øhed, ≈øpeak many languages, are indefatigable in their efforts to plea≈øe, and receive ≈øtrangers from Europe with a joy and ≈øatisfaction not to be de≈øcribed, Aleppo would have been to me an Ely≈øium, if the plea≈øures of the place did not from the beginning ≈øuffer diminution from my own painful ≈øen≈øations, which were aggravated at la≈øt by an incident that aro≈øe from my intercour≈øe there‚Äî of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>While I remained at Aleppo, I walked as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told you, frequently about the ≈øtreets; and I think I never was witne≈øs to ≈øo many broils in all my life put together, as I was in my wanderings there‚ÄîNot a time I went out that I did not ob≈øerve one, two, three, and ≈øometimes half a dozen or more. They have nothing terrible in them however, and, were it not extremely di≈øgu≈øting to ≈øee men ≈øcold, would be very entertaining; for I will venture to ≈øay that a ≈øtreet battle "√† la Turque" is one of the mo≈øt ludicrous exhibitions in the world. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties approach to each other, and retreat mutually, as the action of the one gives hopes to the other of victory, lifting their hands, and flouri≈øhing them in the air, as if ready to ≈øtrike every moment, grinning and gna≈øhing their teeth, while their beard and whi≈økers be≈øprent with the ≈øpume of their mouths, and wagging with the quick motion of their lips and gha≈øtly contortions of their jaws, pre≈øent the
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:033487_0198_0FF7240603B7FEF0"/>
mo≈øt ridiculous ≈øpectacle imaginable. They remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at the time of a ver≈øe in an old Engli≈øh bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad:‚Äî

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing, in fact, can exceed the extravagance of their ge≈øture: the vehement loudne≈øs of their voice, or the whim≈øical di≈øtortions of their countenances, in which are di≈øplayed ≈øometimes the quicke≈øt vici≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitudes of fear and fury, and ≈øometimes the mo≈øt laughable combination of both. All this time, however, not a ≈øingle blow is actually ≈øtruck; but they compen≈øate for the want of bodily prowe≈øs by the exerci≈øe of the tongue, denouncing vengeance again≈øt each other, threatening in≈øtant demolition, lavi≈øhing every bitter reproach, every filthy epithet, and every horrible imprecation that they can think of, and both boa≈øting occa≈øionally of their patience and forbearance, which fortunately enabled them to refrain from annihilating their adver≈øary. At la≈øt the fray gradually decays: exhau≈øted with fatigue, and half choaked with du≈øt and vociferation, they retreat gradually backwards to their own doors; where ≈øumming up all their malignity into a mo≈øt horrid execration, they part for the time, and retire to vaunt in empty threat, and growl away their rage, in the rece≈ø≈øes of their haram.</p>
               <p>Yet tho≈øe people are found terrible in battle by the Chri≈øtian troops that have from time to time been oppo≈øed to them: here, if proof be wanting of the effects of religion on the human mind, is an incontrovertable one of its powerful operations. Under the influence of their faith, which tells them that they go to Paradi≈øe in≈øtantly if killed in battle with Infidels, they perform prodigies of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour fighting again≈øt Chri≈øtians; while, forbidden by that faith to imbrue their hands in the blood of a true believer, their pa≈ø≈øions have been gradually brought under the dominion of their religion, till
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:033487_0199_0FF7240A0F0ED3F0"/>
that which at fir≈øt was faith at la≈øt becomes habit, and the appropriate energy and courage of the man has ≈øunk into the degrading and ema≈øculant efforts of the woman.</p>
               <p>The practice of fighting, or per≈øonal conflicts between individuals of the ≈øame ≈øociety, ≈øeems to have been condemned by the univer≈øal con≈øent of all religions. The Gentoos, as well as all the other ≈øects of the various parts of the Ea≈øt through which I have travelled, give vent to their pa≈ø≈øion in near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ≈øame manner as the Turks. The Chri≈øtians too are mo≈øt ≈øtrictly forbidden to ≈øtrike one another by the great Author of their faith: but it is their good fortune, that they not only have the be≈øt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world for their guidance, but that they are the only people in the world who claim exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the penalties of that religion, and think them≈øelves wronged and their per≈øonal rights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, if they are refu≈øed the privilege of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through its rules whenever tho≈øe rules are at variance with their convenience.</p>
               <p>Be it your care, my dear child, to fortify your mind with the ≈øpirit of true religion and ≈øound morality, and let your practice in life be ever guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their precepts.</p>

               <p>In Turkey, where the art of printing has not yet been known, were the circulation of literary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions is chained down within the narrow compa≈øs of manu≈øcript, and where therefore the efforts of genius are repre≈ø≈øed by di≈øcouragement, the bu≈øine≈øs of ≈øtory-telling makes in it≈øelf a profe≈ø≈øion, which, as it is acquired by ≈øtudy and pro≈øecuted with art, is followed with con≈øiderably profit.</p>
               <p>One day a friend (a French gentleman) who e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted me through the town called to draw me out with him for a walk; he ≈øaid he wi≈øhed to ≈øhew me ≈øome of the caravan≈øeras, ob≈øerving that he thought I ≈øhould be entertained with a view of them.

eating-hou≈øes and coffee-hou≈øes, and every appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage that could render them convenient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.

"Come hither," ≈øaid he, after a minute's pau≈øe‚Äî "come into this coffee-hou≈øe, here is ≈øomething going forward that may amu≈øe you."</p>
               <p>We accordingly entered the coffee-hou≈øe, where we ≈øaw a number of people, ≈øome ≈øeated in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh fa≈øhion, ≈øome on low ≈øtools, and ≈øome ≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in the middle a man walking to and fro, ≈øpeaking in an audible voice, ≈øometimes ≈ølowly, ≈øometimes with rapidity, varying his tones occa≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with all the inflections of a corre≈øponding ≈øen≈øe. I could not under≈øtand him, but he ≈øeemed to me to ≈øpeak with "good empha≈øis and good di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:" his action was ea≈øy to him, though expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive and emphatical; and his countenance exhibited ≈øtrong marks of eloquent expre≈ø≈øion. I could not help ≈øtaring with a≈øtoni≈øhment at a ≈øcene ≈øo new to me, and felt great approbation of the tones and manner of this extraordinary orator, though I could not under≈øtand a ≈øingle word he ≈øaid. He was li≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to by all with great attention, and the Turks (albeit not u≈øed to the laughing mood) frequently betrayed ≈øtrong ≈øymptoms of ri≈øibility: but in the height and torrent of his ≈øpeech he broke ≈øuddenly off, ≈øcampered out of the door and di≈øappeard. I ≈øet it down that he was a maniac or lunatic of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious kind, and was for going away. "Stay," ≈øays my friend, "re≈øt where you are for a few minutes, let us hear further."</p>
               <p>The orator had ≈øcarcely been gone three minutes when the room was filled with the buzz of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation, a word of which I could not under≈øtand, but which my guide li≈øtened to very attentively. At length the buzz began to grow loud, and ≈øoon increa≈øed into clamour; when a ≈øcene en≈øued of ≈øo very ludricious a kind as forced me to cram my

handkerchief into my mouth to ≈øuppre≈øs a laugh, or at lea≈øt ≈øo to ≈øtifle it as to avoid ob≈øervation. In ≈øhort, they were di≈øputing violently, and the beards were, as I once before mentioned to you, ALL WAGGING. I became more convul≈øed with mirth; and my friend ≈øeeing that I was likely to give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, took me under the arm and hurried me out of the coffee-hou≈øe: we retired into a porch in the caravan≈øera, where I gave vent to my ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed laughter till my ≈øides were ≈øore and my eyes ran tears.</p>
               <p>"In the name of God, my friend!" ≈øaid I, "tell me what is the meaning of all that extravagant ≈øcene to which we have ju≈øt now been witne≈øs: who is that madman that ≈øpoke ≈øo much? and why did they all quarrel after he went away?"</p>
               <p>"Come, come," ≈øaid he, "let us retire to my hou≈øe, and I will there explain the whole of it to you, from begining to ending."</p>
               <p>I accordingly accompanied him home, where we found a very gay circle a≈ø≈øembled, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed my a≈øtoni≈øhment; recounting my immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate laughter, till they all laughed very nearly as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately as my≈øelf.

This letter will ≈øerve to ≈øhew you that malver≈øation in office, public delinquency, and all tho≈øe crimes of the great, which with us are cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable by no tribunal but that of the public pre≈øs, are not altogether ≈øo exempt from the la≈øt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øure of the ≈øatiri≈øt in Turkey, as the want of that great palladium of freedom would di≈øpo≈øe us to believe; and that, incredible as it may appear, the magi≈øtrates are held up to ridicule in public exhibition, ≈øatiri≈øed with all the extravagant vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garity of coar≈øe humour and unpoli≈øhed wit, and expo≈øed with all the bitter exaggerations of enven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed genius.</p>
               <p>The French gentleman whom I mentined to you in my la≈øt, as having procured me that plea≈øant repa≈øt at the coffee-hou≈øe, called on me a morning or two after that, and reminded me how highly I ≈øeemed to be entertained: ≈øaid, there were often to be ≈øeen, by walking about and going into public

We proceeded, therefore, to one of the before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned coffee-hou≈øes, where, as my friend ob≈øerved to me, though there were no people of great rank, there was generally ≈øomething to afford contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or amu≈øement; and where, if nothing el≈øe occurred, the motley appearance of the company was ≈øufficient to excite a variety of whim≈øical emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ≈øugge≈øt numberle≈øs ludicrous images to the imagination of an Engli≈øh or French man. As there was no orator at work declaiming, I had time to indulge my≈øelf with a more accurate view than I had before taken of the group that ≈øurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us: and ≈øurely never was ponderous gravity more ludicrou≈øly, or in more various forms depicted by any caricaturi≈øt in the world.‚ÄîHere it was to be ≈øeen, in all its ≈øhadings, from the ≈øelf-important nod of ≈øerious cogitation, down to the ≈øoporific a≈øpect of ≈øtolid ≈øtupidity. Not a mu≈øcle was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in way of mirth, not a face di≈øgraced with a ≈ømile, and I could not help thinking all the time, that if every nation of the earth was to take ≈øome animal for its in≈øignia, as the Briti≈øh a≈ø≈øume the lion, and the Pru≈ø≈øian the eagle, the Turks might be divided in their choice between the appropriate claims of the owl and the a≈øs.</p>

               <p>I was a≈øtoni≈øhed when informed that one man only ≈øpoke for all the per≈øonages of the drama, for ≈øo artfully did he change his tone of voice, that I could have ≈øworn there had been as many people to ≈øpeak, as there were characters in the piece. The images were not actually puppets, commonly ≈øo called, but ≈øhadows done in the manner of A≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's <hi>Ombres Chinoi≈øes.</hi> They were, however, far inferior to his in execution and management, though the dialogue and incident evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even to me, to be executed with a degree of the <hi>vis comica</hi> far ≈øuperior to any I ever ≈øaw in a thing of the kind in Europe; indeed ≈øo perfect was the whole, that though I knew not a word of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I comprehended clearly the plan of the piece, and many of the ≈øtrokes of humour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the dialogues.‚ÄîThe plan was obviou≈øly taken from a ≈øtory which I have read in ≈øome of the Ea≈øtern tales, I believe the Arabian Nights Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and it is founded on the law of the country, that a man may repudiate his wife twice, and take her back again; but in the event of a third divorce, cannot retake her to his marriage-bed, unle≈øs ≈øhe be previou≈øly married and divorced by another man.

               <p>The piece was introduced with a grand nuptial proce≈ø≈øion, in which the ma≈øter di≈øplayed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his voice by uttering a variety of the mo≈øt oppo≈øite tones in the whole gamut of the human voice; ≈øometimes ≈øpeaking, ≈øometimes ≈øqueaking like a hurt child, ≈øometimes hazz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When they come before the cadi, he is ≈øeated in his divan of ju≈øtice; but as ≈øoon as the complaint is opened and an≈øwered, he ri≈øes and comes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward between the contending parties: here he turns to one and demands in a terrific tone what he has to ≈øay, while the other puts ca≈øh in his hand behind, and in proportion as the ca≈øh is counted in, increa≈øes the terror of his voice; he then pockets the money, and again turns to the other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what he has to offer, while in like manner he receives the bribes from his adver≈øary and puts it in an oppo≈øite pocket: this alternate application la≈øts till the pur≈øes of both are exhau≈øted, when, giving a great groan, he retires on one ≈øide to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the money of each from a pocket he has on either ≈øide, one called plaintiff, and the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; when balancing them, he finds plaintiff better by one a≈øper (or three-halfpence) than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and pronounces his judgment accordingly. The defendant appeals to the ba≈øhaw; they go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: KARA-GHUSE (Punch) however, takes the defendant a≈øide, and in a dialogue, which my friend a≈ø≈øured me was pointed, witty, and bitterly ≈øatirical, developes to him the whole ≈øy≈øtem of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtratical inju≈øtice, advi≈øes him to bribe the ba≈øhaw, and declaring his zeal for all young people fond of amorous enjoyment (which he is at ≈øome pains to enlarge upon to the exce≈øs of indelicacy), offers him the aid of his pur≈øe. The advice is followed; the bribe is accepted; the cadi's decree is rever≈øed, and him≈øelf di≈øgraced, and the mob at once hu≈øtle him and bear the Hullah home to his bride with clamours of joy. Here again the ma≈øter ≈øhewed his extraordinary powers, giving not only, as before, di≈øtinct and oppo≈øite tones of voice, but huddling a number of different ≈øounds with ≈øuch ≈økill and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity together, that it was ≈øcarcely po≈ø≈øible to re≈øi≈øt the per≈øua≈øion that they were the i≈ø≈øue of a large and tumultuous crowd of men and animals.

               <p>Returning home we conver≈øed together on the ≈øubje≈øt of the piece, which I confe≈øs I could not get out of my head for ≈øome time. My friend explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, as well as he could recollect, a great part of the dialogue, and a≈ø≈øured me, that the freedom of ≈øpeech of Mon≈øieur KARA-GHUSE had from time to time created a great deal of unea≈øine≈øs, not only to private offending individuals, but to the magi≈øtracy it≈øelf‚Äîthat no offender, however intrenched behind power, or en≈øhrined in rank, could e≈øcape him‚Äîthat ba≈øhaws, cadis, nay the Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

more re≈øtrained in the effu≈øions of ob≈øcenity which he utered, than in his ≈øatire; that he was always well received and applauded, even venerated (as we venerate the liberty of the pre≈øs) as a bold teller of truth, who with little mi≈øchief does a great deal of good, and often rou≈øes the lethargic public mind to a ≈øen≈øe of public dangers and injuries. He added, that in ≈øome ca≈øes the magi≈øtrate had been obliged to interfere; and the ba≈øhaw him≈øelf was ≈øeriou≈øly called upon at times to ≈øtop the licentious tongue of this champion of Freedom, KARA-GHUSE.</p>
               <p>"Well then," ≈øaid I, "it appears upon the whole that Mon≈øieur KARA-GHUSE is a very great black-guard, but a very witty, and a very hone≈øt one."</p>
               <p>"You have ju≈øt hit it," ≈øaid he; "and if Ma≈øter Kara-ghu≈øe was to take ≈øuch liberties in France, Spain, Portugal, or Germany, all his wit and hone≈øty would not ≈øave him from puni≈øhment.

               <p>"And yet," returned I, "we complain ≈øadly of want of liberty!"</p>
               <p>"That is natural," returned my ≈øagacious French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "perfectly natural. Liberty is like money; the more we have of it, the more covetous we grow."</p>
               <p>"Very true, Mon≈øieur," ≈øaid I, plea≈øed with his compliment to our happy con≈øtitution, and to clinch his ob≈øervation, gave a Latin quotation, which when a child I got out of Lilly's Grammar, "Cre≈øcit amor nummi, quantum ip≈øa pecunia cre≈øcit;" and then changging nummus for libertas, "Cre≈øcit amor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis, quantum ip≈øa libertas cre≈øcit."</p>

She was then young, beautiful, full of ≈øen≈øibility, and gifted with ≈øuch natural endowments both of mind and per≈øon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all tho≈øe accompli≈øhments which helped to dre≈øs them to advantage, that ≈øhe might well be acquitted of vanity, even though fancy ≈øugge≈øted to her ≈øhe was fit to grace and confer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs on a younger bed; while reflection on the obvious di≈øparity of the match (which the cool tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ≈øatiety po≈ø≈øibly ≈øugge≈øted to him) might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have alarmed his mind to circum≈øtances of probable danger, that, before wedlock, were all hid behind the deceptive veil of pa≈ø≈øion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the≈øe were the private ≈øentiments that influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced both or either of them, I cannot pre≈øume to determine, though I think it probable: for I was not long in the hou≈øe till I plainly perceived they were on a very bad footing with each other, and

in ≈øhort that di≈øagreement was become habitual to them. At fir≈øt, that is to ≈øay, for a few days after my becoming an inmate of their hou≈øe, decency en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced concealment, and the ebullitions of peevi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs were ≈øtifled by the dictates of prudence; but the animo≈øities of the connubial ≈øtate are tho≈øe which of all others are the mo≈øt impatient under control; and as time, by producing familiarity, relaxed re≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raint, the pent-up pa≈ø≈øions began to force their way, and open bickering took place in my pre≈øence.</p>
               <p>It is but barely doing ju≈øtice to my≈øelf to ≈øay, that I felt the mo≈øt poignant concern at ≈øeeing a couple, each ≈øo perfectly amiable in all other re≈øpects bla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hours that ≈øhould be given to harmony and love, in jarring reproach, and recrimination; and I would have given all I was worth that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had occa≈øion to e≈øteem them ≈øo much, or that I could give them that peace which ≈øeemed to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fain would I ca≈øt a veil over the whole tran≈øaction fain would I bury it even from my≈øelf, in oblivion: but it has been made by my enemies the ≈øubject of triumphant ≈ølan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and to do ju≈øtice to my≈øelf, and di≈øclaim the extent of guilt which they would impute to me, I am reluctantly obliged to avow the ≈øhare I had, and declare how the matter really ≈øtood. I mu≈øt ≈øpeak the truth, and hope you will not conceive that I de≈øignedly lean too heavily upon any one, to ea≈øe my≈øelf of my ≈øhare of the load.</p>
               <p>Whatever dome≈øtic unea≈øine≈øs may ≈øub≈øi≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a married pair, the man, if prudent, will endeavour to conceal it; and the woman, if truly virtuous, will take care to do ≈øo: ≈øhould great di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of age (as in the pre≈øent in≈øtance) be the ca≈øe, the lady is more particularly bound to conceal any unea≈øine≈øs, le≈øt it ≈øhould be attributed to that cau≈øe which people are in ≈øuch ca≈øes too prone to ≈øu≈øpect, di≈ølike to her hu≈øband; and before young men, above all, ≈øhe ≈øhould be mo≈øt exemplary, as
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:033487_0214_0FF72435D40D1650"/>
≈øhe mu≈øt well know that their natural vanity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the leading idea of her aver≈øion and infidelity to her hu≈øband, ≈øugge≈øt ideas to them from whence their warm imaginations draw infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of a nature too plea≈øing to be parted with, and too probable not to be put in practice, or at lea≈øt attempted. Here then a woman at once lays her≈øelf fairly open to the a≈ø≈øaults of illicit love. I think it will not be denied, that the woman who promulgates the di≈øagreements between her and her hu≈øband, particularly if ≈øhe ≈øuffers a young man to be privy to it, is either extremely ignorant, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally vicious, or both.</p>
               <p>That the lady I allude to may in ≈øome re≈øpect be acquitted of this imputation, I mu≈øt tell you, that ≈øhe was only eighteen years of age; her tender, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced mind had not yet arrived to that matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which gives ≈øound judgment; and though of good natural talents, highly cultivated (for ≈øhe ≈øpoke fluently Engli≈øh, French, Italian, Arabic, Per≈øian, and the Greek and Turki≈øh languages), ≈øhe yet was ≈øimple<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> innocent, uninformed in the ways of the world, and incapable of rea≈øoning from cau≈øes up to con≈øequences. But unfortunately that ≈øimplicity is attended with as much mi≈øchief, though not guilt, as the wilful mi≈øconduct of the more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; it has the ≈øame baleful effects with the hearers, in≈øpires the ≈øame confidence, emboldens with the ≈øame hopes, and leads to the ≈øame perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious practices.</p>
               <p>I have already mentioned, and will now remind you, that I was then young. Perhaps it was owing to a congeniality pointed out by our age, perhaps to a compa≈ø≈øionate politene≈øs amounting to tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, which I always di≈øclo≈øed on tho≈øe unhappy occa≈øions, joined perhaps to the ardent look of youth kindled by the imaginations to which this imprudent conduct in≈øen≈øibly gave birth, that the lady thought proper to take the very hazardous ≈øtep

of making a confidant of a young man and a ≈øoldier ‚Äîand revealing to me the whole tale of her griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, with a pathetic eloquence, that would have made an impre≈ø≈øion upon a much le≈øs ≈øu≈øceptible heart than mine. I declare it mo≈øt ≈øolemely, that though this extraordinary mark of confidence and e≈øteem communicated to my heart ≈øtrong ≈øen≈øations of unju≈øtifiable plea≈øure: I ≈øo far got the better of my≈øelf at fir≈øt, as to receive the whole with the ≈øame appearance of tranquility, as if I had been only a confidential female friend. I pitied, it is true;‚ÄîI expre≈ø≈øed my pity:‚ÄîI advi≈øed, not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherou≈øly but faithfully;‚ÄîI ≈øaid ≈øuch things as occured to me to be mo≈øt likely to a≈ø≈øuage and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øh the flame of di≈øcord, and lead to an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adju≈øtment; and I parted for that time with her to go to a ≈øelf-approving pillow, where, while my fancy was inflamed and tickled by the flattering mark of regard ≈øhewn me by ≈øo all-accompli≈øhed a per≈øon. I had the ≈øoothing delightful con≈øciou≈øne≈øs of having, as far as I was able, done my duty, and e≈øcaped the corroding reflection of having violated the rights of ho≈øpitality.</p>
               <p>Not an opportunity however afterwards offered, that the ≈øame unhappy point was not the ≈øubject of di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, and unfortunately tho≈øe opportunities but too frequenlly occurred; till at length we began to feel that they were the ≈øweete≈øt minutes of our lives, and were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though the tran≈øports of youthful pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion hurried us into conver≈øations and reflections on the ≈øubject of her determination to be ≈øeparated from her hu≈øband, yet that pa≈ø≈øion was of too deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a kind to ≈øink into the brutal ≈øordid indulgence of di≈øhonourable ≈øtolen embraces.

               <p>It is thus that, in the down-hill path of vice, we are hurried on ≈øtep by ≈øtep, fondly imagining that each ≈øucce≈ø≈øive object, which bounds our ≈øight, will ≈øtop our headlong career; while alas! every ≈øtep we advance gives additional rapidity to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcent: like the centripetal force of a projectile, our pace increa≈øes with uniformly accelerated motion‚Äî till di≈ødaining all control, and breaking down every impediment that rea≈øon, morality, or honour throw in the way to re≈øcue us or retard our ruin, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate

               <p>Fortunately, however, an incident intervened in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, which arre≈øted our progre≈øs down this hideous de≈øcent, and re≈øerved us both I hope to conviction of our folly, and repentance of our error.

               <p>While we hugged our≈øelves in the ≈øecurity and ≈øecrecy of expre≈ø≈øing our genuine ≈øentiments, her hu≈øband di≈øcovered our wi≈øhes, and all at once took the nece≈ø≈øary mea≈øures for preventing them. So that, overwhelmed with grief and ≈øhame, I directly formed the re≈øolution to leave Aleppo, and proceed in the be≈øt manner I could on my de≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

               <p>THE di≈øcovery to which I alluded in my la≈øt letter, ≈øurpri≈øed and grieved me very much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and indeed it a≈øtoni≈øhed me the more, from the manner in which it was communicated.</p>
               <p>One day I received a polite me≈ø≈øage from the Briti≈øh con≈øul, ≈øaying, he wi≈øhed to ≈øpeak to me as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, upon a bu≈øine≈øs of great con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. I thought at fir≈øt, that it might be ≈øome plan for my proceeding on my journey‚Äîperhaps Company's di≈øpatches that had arrived to go over land; and at intervals, ≈øomething like apprehen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the true motive of his ≈øending for me flew acro≈øs my mind. I however went to him, when, after ≈øome little introductory conver≈øation, he told me, that my ho≈øt Mr. ‚Äî had been with him that morning, laying before him a complaint of a mo≈øt extraordinary and ≈øerious nature, of which, as it immediately concerned me, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf bound to inform me, in order that I might either contradict ≈øo gro≈øs a calumny if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, or find means to avoid the obviou≈øly nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry re≈øult if founded in fact.</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to relate to me, that Mr. ‚Äî had informed him of a con≈øpiracy having been meditated again≈øt his peace and honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his wife and the Engli≈øh gentleman whom he had entertained in his hou≈øe; that their plan was nothing le≈øs than an elopement, and that he did not know how ≈øoon it might be carried into execution, if not timely prevented; and finally, that he had demanded the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the con≈øul and his intere≈øt with the Turki≈øh magi≈øtrate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

it, by granting him an armed force for the protection of his hou≈øe.</p>
               <p>I was much ≈øurpri≈øed to find that conver≈øations ≈øo very guarded as ours were di≈øcovered, and more ≈øo that the aggrieved per≈øon did not think proper to ≈øpeak to my≈øelf, and charge me in per≈øon with the offence; never reflecting the while, that all my ideas were military, and his merely commercial: I was al≈øo much at a lo≈øs to conjecture how he came to make the di≈øcovery‚Äîbut this I found afterwards he owed to a female ≈øervant, who had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently intru≈øted by her mi≈øtre≈øs with the ≈øecret.</p>
               <p>Finding, however, that by whatever means he became acquainted with the affair, it was a certain fact that he was appri≈øed of it, I directly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the whole truth with the utmo≈øt candour to the con≈øul; told him the affair ≈øtep by ≈øtep as it aro≈øe, a≈ø≈øuring him (which I really thought to be the ca≈øe) that pity for the lady's deplorable ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made me li≈øten to ≈øuch a mea≈øure; and that unlawful pa≈ø≈øion had ≈øo little to do with it, that in all our private conferences we had never tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed the limits of purity; and that her per≈øon was, at lea≈øt re≈øpecting me, and I firmly believed all mankind, ≈øpotle≈øs and inviolate. I added, that great allowances were to be made for a young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture barely eighteen years of age, con≈øigned by the wickedne≈øs of avaricious parents to the embraces of a man of ≈øixty-five; who, amiable and worthy though he was, in ≈øocial intercour≈øe with the world (which I knew him to be), was yet in the mo≈øt indi≈øpen≈øable point of connubial felicity ≈øo utterly defective, as nece≈ø≈øarily to create di≈øgu≈øt and abhorrence in a youthful mind. I remarked to him, that, in the forming of laws, it as plainly appeared on their face, who made them among≈øt the Engli≈øh, as it does on the face of the Gentoo laws, that they were made by the Bramins: for,

And I concluded by ≈øaying, that all parties aiding in ≈øuch an unnatural confederacy ≈øhould be puni≈øhed.</p>
               <p>The con≈øul fairly acknowledged there was too much truth in what I had ≈øaid; but remarked withal, that it was rather a hazardous experiment, and he was ≈øure it would be an endle≈øs one, to correct all the abu≈øes to which the fallibility of man, and his incompetency to form any thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nece≈ø≈øarily left ≈øociety and their laws liable‚Äî that the law was written, and it was the duty of every individual to obey it‚Äîand that in ca≈øes of adultery, the offence could be ju≈øtified on no ≈øolid grounds whatever, for, independent of the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the hu≈øband, which perhaps were more poignant in old age than youth, the injury to his family was not to be got over, in probably giving to him an heir no way a-kin to him.

continued at Mr. ‚Äî's hou≈øe, to which I very ≈øolemnly pledged my word.</p>
               <p>Being now con≈øtrained by every con≈øideration, as well of prudence and decency as of inclination, to leave Aleppo immediately; I determined that no common impediments ≈øhould ≈øtop me, and waited with impatience the arrival of the per≈øon on whom the con≈øul re≈øted his hopes of di≈øpatching me.</p>
               <p>He came in the evening, and after a conference with the con≈øul he introduced him to me, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me that he was a Tartar, and one of the va≈øt number of that de≈øcription who are employed by the Turki≈øh ≈øtate in carrying di≈øpatches from court to the various viceroys and ba≈øhaws, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably between them again; that they were men on who≈øe fidelity the utmo≈øt reliance could be had; and that this man, who had an excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, had agreed to take me to Bagdad, provided I would ≈øubmit to the di≈øgui≈øe of a Tartar.</p>
               <p>The agreement between us I entirely ≈øubmitted to the di≈øcretion of the con≈øul, who had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to ≈øettle it thus:‚ÄîThe Tartar was to deliver me ≈øafe at Bagdad; to ≈øupply me and my ≈øervant, who acted as interpreter, with an ample ≈øufficiency of provi≈øions and hor≈øes on the road; to exchange my hor≈øe for me as often as I plea≈øed, and to go at ≈øuch a rate, whether fa≈øter or ≈ølower, as I thought proper: for this he was to receive one hundred pounds; and I further promi≈øed, as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, that if he acted to my ≈øatisfaction, I would, on our arrival at Bagdad, add a douceur of twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>The next day he came, and I had a di≈øtinct view of this my new fellow traveller and ≈øuppo≈øed ma≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for in ≈øeveral places, I was to pa≈øs for his ≈ølave.

               <p>AS I became familiari≈øed to my Tartar guide I found his character di≈øclo≈øe much better traits than his fir≈øt appearance be≈øpoke, and I began in≈øen≈øibility to think him a very entertaining fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: preceiving that I was very low ≈øpirited

and thoughtful, he exhibited manife≈øt marks of compa≈ø≈øion; and taking it into his head that I was actually removed for ever from my friends and my family, he ≈øpoke in a ≈øtyle of regret and feeling, that did great honor to his heart: and to ≈øay the truth, he did every thing in his power to alleviate my feelings, conver≈øing with me either by means of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, or in broken lingua franca; ≈øupplying all my wants cheerfully and abundantly; changing hor≈øes with me as often as I pea≈øed, and going ≈ølow or golloping forward ju≈øt as be≈øt ≈øuited my inclination or humour.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt object he ≈øeemed to have in view on our journey, was to impre≈øs me with a notion of his con≈øequence and authority, as a me≈ø≈øenger belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sultan. As all tho≈øe men are employed by the fir≈øt magi≈øtrates in the country, and are, as it were, the links of communication between them, they think them≈øelves of great importance in the ≈øtate; while the great men who≈øe bu≈øine≈øs they are employed in, make them feel the weight of author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and treat them with the greate≈øt contempt: hence they become habitually ≈øervile to their ≈øuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and by natural con≈øequence in≈øolent and over-bearing to their inferiors, or tho≈øe who being in their power they conceive to be ≈øo. As carriers of di≈øpaches, their power and authority wherever they go is in ≈øome points undi≈øputed; and they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a ≈øupply of provi≈øions, hor≈øes, and attendants, wherever it ≈øuits their occa≈øions; nor dare any man re≈øi≈øt their right to take the hor≈øe from under him to proceed on the Emperor's bu≈øine≈øs, be the owner's occa≈øion ever ≈øo pre≈ø≈øing.</p>
               <p>My feelings, which I can tell you were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the mo≈øt unplea≈øant kind, ≈øerved as a ≈øtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus to my mind, and increa≈øed my anxiety to get forward; I therefore pu≈øhed on as fa≈øt as the hor≈øes, which were in general excellent, could carry me: and as we halted at a number of ≈øtages to get fre≈øh

hor≈øes and provi≈øions, my Tartar guide had frequent opportunities of indulging his ≈øelf-importance, and di≈øplaying his great authority and power. As ≈øoon as he ≈øtopped at a caravan≈øera, he immediately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lu≈øtily about him in the name of the Sultan, demanding with an imperious and menacing tone of voice, fre≈øh hor≈øes, victuals, &amp;c. on the in≈øtant. The terror of this great man operated like magic; nothing could exceed the activity of the men, the bri≈økne≈øs of the women, and the terror of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for the caravan≈øeras are continually attended by numbers of the very lowe≈øt cla≈ø≈øes of the people; but no quickne≈øs of preparation, no effort or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry could ≈øatisfy my gentleman; he would ≈øhew me his power in a ≈øtill more ≈øtriking point of view, and fall belabouring them with his whip, and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with all his might. I mu≈øt confe≈øs I was much hurt at this extravagant abu≈øe of up≈øtart pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and was two or three times on the point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering; but fortunately, recollected that it would neither be in character, nor have any good effect, and that if I pre≈øumed to ≈øpeak, my guide would be obliged in my defence to give me a flogging in order to prevent ≈øu≈øpicion.</p>
               <p>This incon≈øiderate tyranny and cruelty, I had afterwards rea≈øon to believe, was by no means a part of his natural di≈øpo≈øition; but vanity, to which ≈øo many among us in Europe fall victims, urged him to exce≈ø≈øes, which I dare ≈øay his heart private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned.</p>
               <p>It was on the fifth or ≈øixth day (I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øely ≈øay which) after our leaving Aleppo, that we got to the city of Diarbeker, the capital of the province of that name, having pa≈ø≈øed over an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of country of between three and four hundred miles, mo≈øt of it ble≈ø≈øed with the greate≈øt fertility, producing, in the few cultivated parts, grain, fruits of various kinds, and ≈øilk in great variety and abundance, and abounding with as rich pa≈øtures as
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:033487_0229_0FF7245C4D02DF20"/>
I ever beheld, covered with numerous herds and flocks. The air was charmingly temperate in the day-time, but, to my feeling, extremely cold at night.</p>
               <p>Yet notwith≈øtanding the extreme fertility of this country, the bad admini≈øtration of government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiring with the indolence of the inhabitants, leaves it unpopulous and uncultivated. Diarbeker, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, called al≈øo Me≈øopotamia, from its lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two famous rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and by Mo≈øes called PADAN ARAM, that is to ≈øay ‚Äî"The fruitful Syria;" abounds with corn, wine, oil, fruits, and all the nece≈ø≈øaries of life. It is ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to be the ≈øeat of the Earthly Paradi≈øe, and all geographers agree that it was there the de≈øcendants of Noah fir≈øt ≈øettled after the flood.</p>
               <p>In≈øignificant as tho≈øe circum≈øtances may appear to mere calculators of profit and lo≈øs, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that they have a powerful and plea≈øing effect on the refined imagination. To be treading that ground where Abraham trod; where Nahor the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Rebecca lived; and where Laban, to whom Jacob fled to avoid his brother E≈øau's re≈øentment, and whom he ≈øerved fourteen years for the love he bore to Rachel, was to me a circum≈øtance produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of delightful ≈øen≈øations. How finely has that giant of the pen, John≈øon, ju≈øtified tho≈øe ≈øen≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Tour to the Highlands of Scotland and We≈øtern I≈ølands;‚Äîde≈øcribing his emotions on vi≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the famous i≈øland of Iona, or Colombkill, he ≈øays‚Äî"We were now treading that illu≈øtrious i≈øland which was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence ≈øavage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge, and ble≈ø≈øings of religion.

               <p>AS we advanced towards the ≈øouthward and ea≈øtward, in our way from Diarbeker towards Bagdad, I found the air become ≈øen≈øibly warmer, and ob≈øerved that the di≈øpo≈øition of the people grew more and more brutal. My guide's conduct for he knew them well) became proportiontely

artful, and my manners were of cour≈øe to grow ≈øo much the humbler. I ob≈øerved, however, that his authority continued the ≈øame, and that he ≈øeemed to exert it with greater rigour; not in ≈øeverity or cha≈øti≈øement, but in exacting implicit obedience. Yet ≈øtill he evidently acted with great caution and circum≈øpection; for, in ≈øome di≈øtricts, he either avoided the little villages by a circuitous route, or da≈øhed through them at a very quick pace, while the gaping multitude con≈øidered us as on a di≈øpatch of ha≈øte and importance‚Äîin others, he entered the towns without re≈øerve, and left it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide whether we ≈øhould be di≈øcovered or not. At ≈øome caravan≈øeras he treated me with affected neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, at others he made me eat with him and drink wine, of which, in ≈øome places, he him≈øelf drank copiou≈øly, and at others as ≈øcrupulou≈øly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained from. And ≈øometimes we lay at night out in the open air, rather than enter a town; on which occa≈øions I found the weather as piercing cold as it was di≈øtre≈øsfully hot in the day time. Bred, as the man was, a mixture of ≈ølave and, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I can ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øome parts of this conduct to ari≈øe from caprice; but, as he was naturally kind, as many of tho≈øe aberrations from the u≈øual mode of travelling were atttended with hard≈øhip and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to him≈øelf, and as my ≈øervant and the other Tartar were clearly of opinion he was right, I am rather di≈øpo≈øed to believe that he, on the whole, acted from principles of ≈øound ≈øen≈øe and policy.</p>
               <p>He frequently advi≈øed me again≈øt indulging in laughter; ≈øaid it was unmanly, indecorous, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with the gravity becoming a wi≈øe man, and withal dangerous.</p>
               <p>One evening we came to a caravan≈øera much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, the day being extremely hot, and we hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rode very hard‚Äîwhether it was caprice or fatigue, or the ≈øugge≈øtion of policy that moved him,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:033487_0234_0FF7246BCA496470"/>
I cannot ≈øay, but he was certainly more di≈øpo≈øed to play the tyrant than I had ever before ≈øeen him. He flogged the men who took the hor≈øes, kicked every one he met, made the hou≈øe ring with his enormous voice; directed ≈øupper to be got ready, ate growling, and finding fault with every thing; and under pretence of di≈øliking the ingredients of an excellent pillaw, handed it over to me, ≈øaying, "Here, Jimmel (the name he called me), here, take this filth, and cram it down thy coar≈øe throat, it is only fit for a Frank"‚ÄîI took it with be≈øt air of humility I could a≈ø≈øume; and tearing the meat with my fingers, which I al≈øo u≈øed in≈øtead of a ≈øpoon to eat the rice, ≈øwallowed it eagerly; he watching me all the time attentively. When I had fini≈øhed it, I gave him a hint in the Frank lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that I ≈øhould like to wa≈øh it down with ≈øome wine; but he did not, or rather would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand me.</p>
               <p>Supper done, he ordered a ≈øervant to attend him with ≈øome water, and directed him to wa≈øh his feet; while that operation was performing, he continued menacing every one about him. My ≈øervant, who ≈øat next me and behind him, interpreted every thing he ≈øaid. "Yes, ye ≈ølaves," ≈øaid he, as he lolled back upon his cu≈øhion, "yes, I will make the be≈øt of you wa≈øh my feet; for who ≈øhall refu≈øe to wa≈øh the feet of him, who repre≈øents the Sultan of the World, the Son of Mahomet, the Me≈ø≈øenger of the Lord?" The poor fellow proceeded in his humble office, and only interrupted him by ≈øaying, "Ble≈ø≈øed be my Lord the ≈øultan, and glory be to the Lord our God, and Mahomet his prophet." "Yes, yes," continued my Tartar, "ble≈øs God and the prophet, and pray for his ≈øervant our ≈øultan, and all who repre≈øent him like me, that ≈ølaves of your de≈øcription are permitted to live: nay, thou ≈øhalt wa≈øh this Frank's feet:" then turning to me with an air of magi≈øterial tenderne≈øs, "Jimmel,"
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:033487_0235_0FF72470E1BA23D8"/>
≈øaid he, "hold forth thy feet, and let them be wa≈øhed by this di≈øciple of Ali‚ÄîI ≈øay, hold forth thy feet."</p>
               <p>Scarcely able to refrain from laughter at this Bombardinian of the Ea≈øt, and his pompous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of i≈ø≈øuing his orders, I drew up my trow≈øers and took off my boots‚Äîthe man brought fre≈øh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fell to rubbing my feet with great good will and humility; yet evidently felt ≈øo much hurt at the humiliation, that I was ≈øorry for it, and would rather have di≈øpen≈øed with the wa≈øhing, though it was a luxury.</p>
               <p>In the mid≈øt of this operation, the Tartar, who was reclining on his cu≈øhion, ≈ømoking, ro≈øe up, and ≈øtalking two or three times acro≈øs the room, with the mo≈øt ludicrous air of ≈øelf conceit and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, took his tobacco pipe from his mouth, brandi≈øhed it in o≈øtentatious parade, and in the tone and manner rather of one that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The extravagance of this ≈øentiment, the ab≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of its application, and the con≈øequential ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of his action and countenance while he ≈øpoke, altogether ru≈øhed upon me with ≈øuch impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous force, that I could not re≈øi≈øt it, and, in ≈øpite of every effort to re≈øtrain my≈øelf, bur≈øt into an immoderate fit of laughter.</p>
               <p>Had I the pencil of Hogarth, the pen of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeare, or the powers of a Garrick, I might attempt to give ≈øome idea of his countenance, when, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he beheld me convul≈øed with laughter. I might attempt it, I ≈øay, but I could not do it ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Such a combination of ludicrous expre≈ø≈øion I never beheld; it was indeed an epitome of all the lower order of human pa≈ø≈øions. Fury predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, but it was ri≈øible fury‚Äîit was fury that
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:033487_0236_0FF72472A98D9E78"/>
rather grinned than frowned; though under it were to be ≈øeen ≈øhame and mortification, ≈øorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentment, pride and degradation, ≈øilly ba≈øhfulne≈øs and decayed importance. For ≈øome time he ≈øtood transfixed to the ≈øpot, his eyes gli≈øtening like tho≈øe of a rat in a trap; his pointed whi≈økers moving with the contortions of his lips, and his mouth every now and then opening like the beak of a wounded hawk. To utter his ≈øen≈øations he was unable; and he continued in this ≈øtate, not only till my laughter was abated, but till I had time to reflect and be ≈øeriou≈øly concerned.</p>
               <p>At length, without ≈øaying a ≈øentence, he wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, threw off his ≈ølippers, drew on his boots, vociferated till he brought all the people of the caravan≈øera about him, and ordered hor≈øes to be ready in≈øtantly. As orders from ≈øuch a per≈øon were not likely to be di≈øobeyed, the hor≈øes were got ready. I ≈øaw that I mu≈øt either proceed, or come to an open rupture with him; ≈øo recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was my≈øelf in fault, that a di≈øpute might be fatal, and that at all events it was only the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the moment, I drew on my boots too, and was ready to go, though I was much fitter for a twelve hours' nap than for an hour's travelling on hor≈øeback.</p>
               <p>We mounted immediately, and it was my good fortune to have the be≈øt hor≈øe. He ≈øet out upon the gallop, the moon ≈øhining as bright almo≈øt as day; I put forward my hor≈øe, and kept rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which vexed him ≈øo, that he beat the poor animal he rode on mo≈øt unmercifully. At length after about eight or ten miles riding, he called a halt‚Äîdi≈ømounted, and ≈øaid he would re≈øt there all night. I ≈øaw it was I re≈øentment: but knowing that it would be in vain to remon≈øtrate, I di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted too; and, judging that the be≈øt way to mortify him in return, was to comply with affected approbation, turned to my ≈øervant and told him
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:033487_0237_0FF7247440DEA030"/>
(knowing that it would go from him to the Tartar) that I was delighted with the beauty of the night; remarking at the ≈øame time, that lying in the ≈øweet ≈øalu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>th of a caravan≈øera.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as this was communicated to the Tartar, he remarked, that the open air was the fitte≈øt place for the bea≈øts of the fore≈øt, and therefore ≈øuitable to a Frank: but for his part, he had much rather repo≈øe on a cu≈øhion, which he ≈øhould have done, had it not been for my accur≈øed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>≈øible faculties.</p>
               <p>Here the conver≈øation re≈øted, and we fell a≈øleep. In a few hours he awoke us, and we ≈øet forward: after ≈øome pau≈øe, he began in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when was interpreted to me, as he ≈øpoke, by my ≈øervant:</p>
               <p>"Surely God made laughter for the deri≈øion and ≈øhame of mankind, and gave it to the Franks and the monkies; for the one ha, ha, ha's, and the other he, he, he's, and both are malicious, mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and good for nothing but to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>et and tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize all that come acro≈øs them."</p>
               <p>Here he pau≈øed, as waiting for ≈øomething to be ≈øaid: however, I remained ≈øilent. At length, he continued: "Not but that, with all their laughter, they have the wi≈ødom to take ≈øpecial care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; for half a dozen monkies, will he, he, he, and empty a whole orchard of its fruit in the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of a hundred; and a Frank will ha, ha, ha, and eat you up pillaws and poultry like a wolf, and drink up wine with the ≈øame moderation that a camel drinks up water."</p>
               <p>I thought I ≈øhould have choaked with ≈ømothered laughter: I would not however interrupt him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>o contrived to keep it to my≈øelf: he proceded to apothegmati≈øe:</p>
               <p>"But with all their he, he, he's, and ha, ha, ha's, it ≈øometimes turns out that they are caught: the monkey is ≈øeized in a trap and caged or knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in the head, and the Frank is put in jail, and ba≈øtinadoed or hanged; and then the tune is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and it is Oh, ho, ho!" Here he began to mimic crying ≈øo admirably, and at the ≈øame time ≈øo ridiculou≈øly; that I bur≈øt out laughing again.</p>
               <p>"Ob≈øerve, Jimmel," ≈øaid he ha≈øtily, "ob≈øerve! you can't refrain! But by our holy prophet," ≈øaid he ≈øeriou≈øly, "it may end as I ≈øaid: ≈øo look to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and avoid laughter in caravan≈øeras, or we part; for there are places, and that was one of them la≈øt night, where ≈øu≈øpicion would ruin you. And if you lo≈øt your life, what ≈øhould I ≈øay for my≈øelf on my return to Aleppo? Eh, what ≈øhould I ≈øay for my≈øelf? Ha ha, ha! would not do. No, no, they would not believe it, and I ≈øhould lo≈øe my character."</p>
               <p>"Why don't you laugh your≈øelf?" ≈øaid I.</p>
               <p>"Very ≈øeldom, or rather never," returned he; "at lea≈øt I would not in time of danger. No, no, none but Chri≈øtians and monkies makes a practice of laughing‚ÄîTurks and Tartars are wi≈øer." I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed him, that I would in future take more care; and, by way of appea≈øing him with a little ≈ølavery, ≈øaid, that he played his part ≈øo admirably, it was impo≈ø≈øible to re≈øi≈øt the impul≈øe. But he an≈øwered, with a grave face, that his action in that care was of too ≈øerious nature to be made a ≈øubject of merriment ‚Äîand advi≈øed me to believe it ≈øo.</p>

               <p>THE ≈øolicitude of my guide for my ≈øafety was the earne≈øtne≈øs of a man of bu≈øine≈øs zealous to di≈øcharge with the utmo≈øt punctuality the duty he had undertaken; and I mu≈øt ob≈øerve to you, that

the whole of his conduct evinced a preci≈øion and punctually of dealing rarely found in our intercour≈øe with mankind. Previous to leaving Aloppo, he had undertaken to convey me ≈øafe‚Äîhe was, as you may already perceive, indefatigable and unremitting in his endeavours to do ≈øo; he had promi≈øed to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply me with food‚Äî≈øo he did, in the mo≈øt ample manner; he promi≈øed to go as I plea≈øed fa≈øt or ≈ølow ‚Äî≈øo he did; he promi≈øed to change hor≈øes with me, as often as I thought proper to de≈øire‚Äîhe did ≈øo. But beyond this, he ≈øeemed to carry his care of me no farther than to any bale of goods he might have in his charge. He was bound to deliver me ≈øafe, in good order and condition, at Bagdad: ≈øo much he was determined to do, and no more did he think of. I had got letters to the ba≈øhaws of ≈øome of the towns through which we were to pa≈øs: but as the delivery of a letter is, according to the cu≈øtom of that country always accompanied with a pre≈øent, I thought it better to decline delivering them, except when nece≈ø≈øity compelled‚Äîthough the ≈øtate of the country was ≈øo un≈øettled, that we often had occa≈øion for a guard.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as the remembrance of the laughing affair was a little decayed, the Tartar began to relax into good humour, and to talk with his u≈øual vehemence; for he was always, according to the flow of his ≈øpirits, either ≈øullenly ≈øilent or extravagantly l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

my family, and although we were for eighteen days continually conver≈øing on a variety of occa≈øions that might lead to the ≈øubject, he never once talked of women; never, in all his pity for my ≈øituation, glanced even remotely at the po≈ø≈øibility of my get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ≈øub≈øtitute in that way; never hinted that he thought of them him≈øelf. On ≈øeeing women, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the wells, they remined me of ≈øome of the ≈øtories in the Old Te≈øtament. I mentioned it, but it went no farther; for whenever the ≈øubject was ≈øtarted, he threw cold water on it.</p>
               <p>That he conceived me to be in ≈øome re≈øpects a parcel of property, I have good rea≈øon to believe: for I ob≈øerved that at ≈øome caravan≈øeras the people collected round me, and regarded me with ≈øtrong ≈øymptoms of ≈øurpri≈øe and pity; ≈øome viewed me with commi≈øeration, ≈øome with contempt; but not one creature, however wretched or abject, ≈øeemed to envy my ≈øituation.</p>
               <p>I was the more confirmed in this opinion by an incident that happened between Diarbeker and Mo≈øul. One morning I was unu≈øually overcome with the fatigues of the preceding day: the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar called me, ≈øummoned me to hor≈øe; and finding that I gave no an≈øwer, nor ≈øhewed any token of awaking, he lifted me in his arms bodily from my couch (≈øuch was his ≈øtrength that he did it without any difficulty), carried me out without the lea≈øt ceremony, and, before I was ≈øo completely awake as to be ≈øen≈øible of my ≈øituation, had me fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a horie ready to depart.</p>
               <p>A tran≈øaction ≈øo very ≈øingular, you may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ≈øurpri≈øed me at the time, and would not readily be forgotten: ≈øuch a crowd of ≈øtrange, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed, and incongruous thoughts and ≈øen≈øations as occurred to me, I never before experienced: they were painful, they were ≈øurpri≈øing‚Äîbut I was in ≈øuch a ≈øtate that I could not afterwards analy≈øe them. The chief reflection that aro≈øe from it was,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:033487_0241_0FF724814F297070"/>
that human ≈øentiment mu≈øt be in a deplorable ≈øtate of degradation indeed, when ≈øuch a circum≈øtance could occur from the notion that a man was as much an a≈ø≈øet or piece of property, could be tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the ≈øame means, and moved in the ≈øame unfeeling manner, as any portion of inert matter that makes up a bale of merchandize. Of the truth of this po≈øition I had ≈øoon after a melancholy proof, in an incident which, though lamentable, was attended with ≈øuch ludicrous circum≈øtances, that even now I never think of it without ≈ømiling ‚Äî≈ømiling, as I did then, with a heart bleeding with pity.</p>
               <p>One morning I was awakened before day-break with a bu≈øtle in the caravan≈øera where we lodged. I conjectured that the Tartar was preparing to get forward, and ro≈øe in order to lo≈øe no time. I was ≈øo far right in my conjectures: the hor≈øes were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and I came out to mount, and was very much ≈øurpri≈øed to perceive ≈øeveral hor≈øes before me loaded with ≈øomething which ≈øtood erect from their backs, and which I had barely light to di≈øcern were not men. I concluded that they were bales of merchandize packed in a particular form, and a≈øked no que≈øtions till full day-light di≈øclo≈øed to me that they were human creatures tied up in ≈øacks, and fa≈øtened a≈øtride on the hor≈øes' backs. There was a ≈øtrange union of horror and oddity in the conception, that ≈øtruck me at once with a mixed emotion of indignation, pity, and mirth.‚ÄîThe former however got the better, and I a≈øked my ≈øervant with ≈øome warmth what it meant‚ÄîHe ≈øaid that the ≈øacks contained ≈øome young women whom the Tartar had bought.‚Äî<q>Good GOD! ≈øaid I, is it po≈ø≈øible that he can have bought wretched females to treat them with ≈øo little tenderne≈øs?</q>
                  <q>He has bought them, returned my ≈øervant, in the way of traffic, not for plea≈øure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="unknown:033487_0242_0FF7248410D34040"/>"Suppo≈øe he has," ≈øaid I, "≈øuppo≈øe even they were men, not to mention young women, how can he imagine that they will ≈øurvive this? Tied up and ≈øweltered in a ≈øack‚Äîfa≈øtened cro≈øs-legs, on a hor≈øe, and driven at ≈øuch an amazing rate (for by this time we had ≈øet forward, and another Tartar was whipping the hor≈øes up all the time, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them on)‚Äîhow is it po≈ø≈øible they can ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive? They mu≈øt be ≈ømothered‚Äîthey mu≈øt be ≈øhattered to pieces‚Äîthey mu≈øt be ≈øtripped, exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riated, and tortured to death!"</p>
               <p>"If I might pre≈øume to advi≈øe," ≈øaid he, "I would ≈øay that you had better make no remarks upon it: it would only get them perhaps wor≈øe treated, and rai≈øe his anger again≈øt you."</p>
               <p>To conclude, I took his advice, and kept my mind to my≈øelf. The unfortunate women were in this manner carried fifty miles, at the end of which their tender-hearted purcha≈øer di≈øpo≈øed of them in ≈øome way of keeping till his return; when I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe they were to be carried back in ≈øacks a≈øtride upon hor≈øes, all the way to Aleppo, there to be ≈øold to the highe≈øt bidder.</p>
               <p>To us, my FREDERICK, who live in a country where an hour's detention in a hou≈øe again≈øt our will is puni≈øhed as unlawful impri≈øonment, and who feel and value the rich trea≈øure of liberty above all earthly ble≈ø≈øings, the bare idea of ≈ølavery appears horrible; when the mi≈øeries of ≈ølavery are ≈øharpened by cruelty, our indignation burns at the offence: but ≈øuch a complicated piece of enormity as that I have mentioned, almo≈øt tran≈øcends belief, and indignation is lo≈øt in amazement. There are but few men, even in our bracing climate, whom fifty miles riding would not ≈øhake to pieces, and torture almo≈øt to death. No woman would think of it.

               <p>This affair tended to prejudice me ≈øtrongly again≈øt my Tartar guide, and I was for ≈øome time that I could not look upon him without horror: but at length my re≈øentment abated; and rea≈øon, re≈øuming her ≈øeat of cool deci≈øion, told me, that though it was a crime and a grievous one, he was not ≈øo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpon≈øible for it as tho≈øe who, knowing better, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thori≈øed it by their concurrence, gave it the ≈øanction of law, and made it familiarly practi≈øed; he only did that which he had been even from his mother's brea≈øt in≈øtructed to do, and ≈øhould therefore not be judged by tho≈øe rules which a Briton would lay down for the government of ≈øuch ca≈øes.</p>

               <p>FROM the con≈øiderations I have already pretty fully mentioned, my mind was by no means at ca≈øe. The ince≈ø≈øant travelling for ≈øo many days, at the rate of ≈øeventy-five miles a day, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

I knew not how long, increa≈øed my anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety: and the apprehen≈øions of accident, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and above all ≈øickne≈øs, intercepting me on my way, haunted my imagination with all its terrors. I was be≈øides approaching fa≈øt to that region where the winds ≈øtrike all living things that draw them in in≈øtantly dead: and conceiving that the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions I was in getting over the journey, the greater chance I had of e≈øcaping tho≈øe mi≈øchiefs; I pu≈øhed heartily forward, and urged the Tartar till he at la≈øt expre≈ø≈øed his a≈øtoni≈øhment and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; paid me the compliment to ≈øay, that I was almo≈øt equal to him≈øelf for enduring fatigue; and concluded with a very ≈øagacious ≈øurmi≈øe, that in all probability I had been my≈øelf a carrier of di≈øpatches among the Frank governments.</p>
               <p>One day after we had rode about four miles from a caravan≈øera, at which we had changed our cattle, I found that a mo≈øt execrable bad hor≈øe had fallen to my lot: he was ≈øtiff, feeble, and ≈øoundered; in con≈øequence of which he ≈øtumbled very much, and I every minute expected that he would fall and roll over me. I therefore propo≈øed to the guide to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with me; a favour he had hitherto never refu≈øed, and for which I was the more anxious, as the bea≈øt he rode was of the very be≈øt kind. To my utter a≈øtoni≈øhment he peremptorily refu≈øed: and as this had been a day of unu≈øual taciturnity on his part, I attributed his refu≈øal to peevi≈øhne≈øs and ill temper, and was re≈øolved not to let the matter re≈øt there. I therefore de≈øired the interpreter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, that as he had at Aleppo agreed to change hor≈øes with me as often as I plea≈øed, I ≈øhould con≈øider our agreement infringed upon if he did not comply, and would write to the Con≈øul at Aleppo to that effect.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as this was conveyed to him, he ≈øeemed ≈øtrongly agitated by anger; yet endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his emotions under affected contempt and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:033487_0246_0FF7249179076168"/>
which produced from him one of the mo≈øt ≈øingular grins that ever yet marred the human phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiognomy. At length he broke forth:</p>
               <p>"You will write to Aleppo, will you? Fooli≈øh Frank! they will not believe you! By Mahomet, it would be well done to hear the complaint of a wandering Frank again≈øt Ha≈ø≈øan Artaz‚ÄîHa≈ø≈øan the faithful and the ju≈øt, who for ten years and more has been the me≈ø≈øenger of an emperor, and the friend and confidant of cadis, ba≈øhaws, and vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys, and never yet was called ≈øo much as liar! Who, think you, poor mi≈øguided one! who, think you, would belive that I broke my promi≈øe?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you not then," ≈øaid I, interrupting him, "why do you not perform it by changing hor≈øes, when you are convinced in your con≈øcience (if you have any) that it was part of your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?"‚Äî"Once for all I tell you," interrupted he, "I will not give up this hor≈øe. There is not," ≈øaid he ga≈øconadingly, "there is not a Mu≈ø≈øulman that ever wore a beard, not to talk of a wretched Frank, that ≈øhould get this hor≈øe from under me; I would not yield him to the commander of the faithful this minute, were he in your place: I would not, I tell you Frank‚Äîand I have my own rea≈øons for it."</p>
               <p>"I dare ≈øay you have," returned I; "love of your ea≈øe, and fear of your bones."</p>
               <p>At hearing this, he grew quite outrageous‚Äîcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led MAHOMET and ALLA to witne≈øs that he did not know what it was to fear any thing‚Äîdeclared that he was convinced that ≈øome infernal ≈øpirit had that day got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of me‚Äîand indeed ≈øeemed well di≈øpo≈øed to go to logger-heads. At length ob≈øerving that I looked at him with ≈øneering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous defiance, he rode up along ≈øide of me‚Äî I thought it was to ≈øtrike, and prepared to defend my≈øelf. I was however mi≈øtaken; he ≈ønatched the reins out of my hand, and caught hold of them

collected clo≈øe at the hor≈øe's jaw; then fell flogging my hor≈øe and ≈øpurring his own, till he got them both in full ≈øpeed; nor did he ≈øtop there, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to belabour mine with his whip, and to ≈øpur his own, driving headlong over every impediment that came in our way, till I really thought he had run mad, or de≈øigned to kill me. Several times I was on the point of ≈øtriking him with my whip, in order to knock him off his hor≈øe‚Äîbut as often patience providentially came to my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and whi≈øpered to me to forbear and ≈øee it out. Mean time I con≈øidered my≈øelf as being in ≈øome danger; and yet ≈øuch was the power he had over the cattle, that I found it impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øtop him: ≈øo re≈øigning the event to the direction of Providence, I ≈øuffered him without a further effort to proceed; I calling him every opprobrious name I could think of in lingua Franca, and he grinning, and calling me Dumus, Jiha≈øh, Burhl (i. e. hog, a≈øs, mule), in rapid and impetuous vehemence of tone and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>He continued this for a length of I dare ≈øay ≈øome miles<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> over an uncultivated tract, here and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter≈øected with channels formed by rills of water in the periodical rains; thickly ≈øet with low furze, ferns, and other dwarf bu≈øhes, and broken up and down into little hills. His hor≈øe carried him clean over all: and though mine was every minute ≈øtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and nearly down, yet with a dexterity inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øible, and a vigour altogether amazing, he kept him up by the bridle, and I may ≈øay <hi>carried</hi> him gallantly over every thing. I was a≈øtoni≈øhed very much at all this, and towards the end as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed as a≈øtoni≈øhed; which he perceiving, cried out frequently and triumphantly, "O, la Frangi! Heli! Heli! Frangi!" and at la≈øt drawing in the hor≈øes, ≈øtopping ≈øhort, and looking me full in the face, exclaimed in lingua Franca, "Que dice, Frangi‚ÄîQue dice?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="unknown:033487_0248_0FF72495C5014BB8"/>For ≈øome time I was incapable of making him any an≈øwer, but continued ≈øurveying him from head to foot as the mo≈øt extraordinary ≈øavage I had ever beheld; while he ≈øtroked his whi≈økers with great ≈øelf-complacency and compo≈øure, and nodded his head every now and then, as much as to ≈øay, Ay, ay, it is ≈øo! look at me! am not I a very capital fellow?‚Äî"A capital fellow indeed you are," ≈øaid I, "but I wi≈øh I was well out of your confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clutches."</p>
               <p>We alighted on the brow of a ≈ømall hill, whence was to be ≈øeen a full and uninterrupted pro≈øpect of the country all round. The interpreter coming up, he called to him and de≈øired him to explain to me carefully the meaning of what he was about to ≈øay; which I will give you as nearly as I can in his own words, as they were tran≈ølated by the lingui≈øt:</p>
               <p>"You ≈øee tho≈øe mountains yonder," ≈øaid he, pointing to the ea≈øt; "tho≈øe are in the province of <hi>Kurde≈øtan,</hi> inhabited by a vile race of robbers called Je≈øides, who pay homage to a God of their own called Je≈øid (Je≈øus), and wor≈øhip the Devil from fear. They live by plunder, and often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend from tho≈øe mountains, cro≈øs the Tigris which runs between them and us, and plunder and ravage this country in bands of great number and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øtrength, carrying away into ≈ølavery all they can catch, and killing all who re≈øi≈øt them. This country therefore, for ≈øome di≈øtance round us, is very dangerous to travellers, who≈øe only ≈øafety lies in flight. Now it was our misfortune this morning to get a very bad hor≈øe, for which, plea≈øe ALLA (≈øtroking his whi≈økers), ≈øome one ≈øhall receive the ba≈øtinado. Should we meet with a band of tho≈øe Curds, what could we do but fly? And if you, Frangi, rode this hor≈øe, and I that, we could never e≈øcape; for I doubt you could not keep him up from falling under me, as I did under you: I ≈øhould

therefore come down and be taken‚Äîyou would lo≈øe your guide, and mi≈øs your way, and all of us be undone. Be≈øides," continued he, "there are many villages here where people live, who, if they only ≈øu≈øpected you were a Frank, would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ≈øacrifice you if they could to MAHOMET, and where of cour≈øe you mu≈øt run for it."</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as the interpreter had explained this to me, "Well," continued the Tartar, "what does he ≈øay now to it?" Then turning to me, and to≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing up his head‚Äî"Que dice, Frangi?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I ≈øay," returned I, "that you have ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good ≈øen≈øe and found rea≈øon; and I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you."</p>
               <p>This, when interpreted fully, operated mo≈øt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øingly upon him; his features relaxed into a broad look of ≈øatisfaction, and he ≈øaid:‚Äî"I will do every thing I can to make you ea≈øy and contented: and when I am ob≈øtinate, don't re≈øi≈øt‚Äîfor be a≈ø≈øured I have rea≈øon for it; and above all things avoid laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my pre≈øence. But we ≈øhall reach Mo≈øul by and bye, and probably then we may have no more rides." For I expected to get down the river Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris from Mo≈øul to Bagdad, and had told him ≈øo, and he encouraged me with the expectation.</p>
               <p>That night we came to a caravan≈øera which lay at ≈øome di≈øtance from a village. Here the Tartar, plea≈øed with him≈øelf for the conduct of the day, and plea≈øed with me for my approbation of it, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a mo≈øt admirable ≈øupper; and not only, as was very common with him, rejected the be≈øt di≈øh in order to pre≈øent it to me, but al≈øo ≈øelected for me the choice≈øt bits of tho≈øe upon the table. He then ordered wine, ob≈øerving that the fatigue of a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment me≈ø≈øenger demanded indulgence; and u≈øing a ≈øalvo of my ≈øugge≈øtion on a former occa≈øion, viz. that the Prophet would not be offended with travellers more than with the ≈øick for taking it as it were <hi>medicinally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:033487_0250_0FF7249B8AB3E610"/>We accordingly had wine, and admirable it was, though by no means equal to that we drank at the city of Diarbeker. I took little however, and the Tartar was much ≈øurpri≈øed at my ab≈øtemiou≈øne≈øs; remarking, that he never ≈øaw a Frank before that was not a downright hog when he got the cup to his lips. My taking it in ≈ømall portions, while he drank it as we do table beer, particularly a≈øtoni≈øhed him. Before he lay down on his couch, he gave orders for hor≈øes, threatening the people with ≈øevere ca≈øtigition if they gave bad ones; holding up as an example the per≈øon that gave us the ≈øtumbling hor≈øe that day, who he declared ≈øhould be ba≈øtinadoed as ≈øoon as he returned, if there was a cadi within ten leagues of him; and I dare to ≈øay that he kept his word mo≈øt religiou≈øly.</p>
               <p>The next morning we had excellent cattle; fear produced wonders among them, and we ≈øet forward ju≈øt as the ≈øun ro≈øe. As we entered the fir≈øt vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, I was ≈øomewhat alarmed by perceiving my guide draw up his hor≈øe‚Äîdeliberate‚Äîmutter to him≈øelf‚Äîand ≈øeem rather unea≈øy while he viewed a crowd that was up the ≈øtreet before us; ≈øome of whom I perceived to be agitated with ≈øome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motions of the body, while one man ≈øtood in the middle, rolling his body into a variety of ≈øtrange contortions.‚ÄîThe Tartar, for a minute or two, ≈øeemed to be debating within him≈øelf whether he ≈øhould proceed or turn about: at length putting me on his left hand, he ≈øet forward at full ≈øpeed, leaving the crowd on his right, who, ≈øeeing the rapidity of our pace, flew on one ≈øide, and let us pa≈øs. We ≈øoon however heard ≈øhouting behind us, and could hear plainly the words, "Ghiaour! Frangi Cucu!" and looking back, perceived ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ragged men like ≈øavages pur≈øuing us, lifting ≈øtones occa≈øionally, and ca≈øting them after us with all their might. The ≈øpeed of our hor≈øes at la≈øt got us out of both ≈øight and hearing; and I plainly perceived,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:033487_0251_0FF7249FD5732A48"/>
and was for the fir≈øt time convinced, that my guide's conduct was directed by ≈øound ≈øen≈øe, ≈øpirit, good faith, and integrity.</p>

               <p>THE extraordinary occurrence which I mentioned in my la≈øt letter required explanation, and my Tartar friend was not backward in giving it; for he loved exceedingly to hear him≈øelf talk, and, on any ≈øubject within the compa≈øs of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was ≈øhrewd, per≈øpicuous, and even naturally eloquent: he had moreover on that occa≈øion acted the part of a ≈økilful general; and as I applauded his prudence and addre≈øs, he was extremely kind and communicative, and gave me a full account of that affair, his motives, his deliberations, and the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the ca≈øe; and, in ≈økort, every thing that could elucidate the circum≈øtance, or aggrandize his own importance. It would be a pity to take it out of his own words: I ≈øhall therefore relate them to you, as I had them through the medium of our lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øt, for they made an impre≈ø≈øion on my memory not ea≈øily te be era≈øed.</p>
               <p>"You mu≈øt know," ≈øaid he, "that there are ≈øpread over the face of this great and glorious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire a number of dervi≈øes of different kinds‚Äî<hi>holy</hi> men, who renounce the enjoyments and plea≈øures of the world to conver≈øe with Mahomet and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip Alla. Some of tho≈øe are very good men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ≈øaints, and never do any thing bad; preaching and praying, without hurting any thing, even a rat or a ≈ønake; nay, they would not hurt a Chri≈øtian. There are others again, of whom I have heard our ba≈øhaws and effendis, and even the Maazeen, declare
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:033487_0252_0FF724A162CADC40"/>
that they are forbid by the Koran; and yet the common people (the lower ≈øort you know have no ≈øen≈øe) reverence and wor≈øhip them‚Äîthey are called <hi>Santons;</hi> live by them≈øelves, ≈øometimes under ground like rabbits, end ≈øometimes in the thickets and woods. They go where they plea≈øe, take the be≈øt ≈øeat in any man's hou≈øe, cram them≈øelves with meat and drink, and yet none re≈øi≈øt them; for ≈øome will not, and others dare not. Nay, they often pollute women in the open ≈øtreets‚Äîand they never ≈øet their eyes on a Chri≈øtian or a Frank, that they will not kill, if po≈ø≈øible. For my part, I think that they ought to be hanged, every one of them that had a head to be hanged by‚Äîor rather ≈øtaked ‚Äîfor no puni≈øhment is too great for them; but I dare not ≈øay ≈øo in that town‚Äîif I did, I ≈øhould be ≈øtoned to death by the rabble.</p>

               <p>Since I fir≈øt formed the re≈øolution of writing this account of my journey, I have been at ≈øome pains to dip into the be≈øt hi≈øtories of that country, and I find that in every in≈øtance my Tartar guide's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was correct.

fornication and adultery. The man re≈øi≈øted me, and declared it was impo≈ø≈øible, Then I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, ≈øaid I, if a prie≈øt and a woman were locked up in a room together for a year, and the woman in a week after coming forth was brought to bed of a child, you would not believe it to be the prie≈øt's. No, ≈øaid he, I would not. Then how comes the child? I don't know, replied he‚Äîany way but by him. In ≈øhort, he would believe in ≈øelf-impregnation, or preternatural vi≈øitation, rather than allow a prie≈øt to be capable of fornication."</p>
               <p>"But," ≈øaid I, "you ≈øuppo≈øed a ca≈øe‚Äîif the fellow was ≈øhrewd enough to ≈øay, no ≈øuch ca≈øe could at all happen, he would have put you down; that was what he meant, though he knew not how to go about expre≈ø≈øing it.</p>
               <p>The difficulties and hazards of the journey, which ≈øeemed to thicken upon us as we advanced, made me pant for a ≈øpeedy conclu≈øion to it; and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the la≈øt day opened more clearly to my view the dangers we had to encounter, which were ≈øtill likely to increa≈øe as we got to the ea≈øtward and ≈øouthward, where the fury of bigotry raged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remor≈øe; where the greater di≈øtance from the ≈øeat of government made the populace more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, and the magi≈øtrate more corrupt and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; where the total ≈øeclu≈øion from all well ordered ≈øociety rendered the manners barbarous; where ≈øtrangers were ≈øeldom ≈øeen, and when ≈øeen fleeced and per≈øecuted; and where particularly I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to believe, ≈øcarcely any Engli≈øhman had ever ≈øet his foot; and above all, where the very winds that blew were charged with de≈øtruction, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in≈øtant death upon their wings. I therefore earne≈øtly longed to reach Mo≈øul, where the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was, I ≈øhould get at lea≈øt the more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and commodious conveyance of water carriage, and where I might refre≈øh my≈øelf completely, after the fatigues of ≈øo many days journey; and, if there

was occa≈øion, claim a guard and protection, having along with me a letter to the ba≈øhaw, which I might withhold or deliver, ju≈øt as be≈øt ≈øuited my inclination or convenience.</p>
               <p>I could not help viewing with a ≈øad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly eye my pre≈øent ≈øtate; wandering, I may ≈øay alone, unaccommodated and wretched, through an inho≈øpitable region, and more inho≈øpitable people; where danger be≈øet me in a thou≈øand forms, and every ≈øtep I took, I took in hazard of my life; and comparing it with tho≈øe ≈øcenes of opulence and comfort which I had once experienced, where every lawful wi≈øh met with its accompli≈øhment; where every nece≈ø≈øity was ≈øupplied, and every difficulty obviated; where tender love and attachment antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated every de≈øire; and ≈øoothed every care: where the mutual endearments and reciprocal accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of tender relatives, wife, children, faithful friends, and kindly intimates gave a ze≈øt to life, made me feel that my exi≈øtence was of intere≈øt to others as well as to my≈øelf, and communicated a con≈øcious importance which the i≈øolated, ≈øolitary, ≈øelfi≈øh man can never feel: I could not help look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back with grief and mortification, to think that I once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed tho≈øe ble≈ø≈øings, and ≈øhould perhaps po≈ø≈øe≈øs them no more; but, on the contrary, might peri≈øh unknown, unheeded, and unlamented, in an unknown corner of the wilds of an unknown ho≈øtile country, without one friend to ≈øolace or to cheer me, or tell to tho≈øe who loved or took ≈øhare in my concerns, the place where I lay, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my fate.</p>
               <p>Nor in this di≈ømal train of reflections was Aleppo forgotten. It made the great connecting link be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my former happine≈øs and pre≈øent mi≈øery; it was, as it were, the door through which I pa≈ø≈øed when I took my la≈øt farewell of comfort: when it clo≈øed and ≈øhut me out, the pro≈øpect was indeed gloomy; nor did I after feel one happy ≈øen≈øation,

unle≈øs the convul≈øive tran≈øports of a laugh, and the boi≈øterous fleeting mirth ari≈øing from the ≈øingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my guide, which, as the ≈øurge rai≈øed by the tempe≈øt above its proper height lifts up the ≈øhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered bark only to ca≈øt it on the beach and leave it ≈øhip-wrecked, elevated my ≈øpirits for the moment beyond their proper pitch, to retire quickly, and leave them in the horrors of ten times deeper melancholy.</p>
               <p>Perceiving how much ca≈øt down I was, my friendly Tartar began to rally me: "Jimmel," ≈øaid he, "the ≈øantons have frightened you:‚Äîbut don't be afraid‚ÄîHASSAN ARTAZ is no boy: he can bring you through greater difficulties than tho≈øe, ≈øhould they befall us."</p>
               <p>"But how comes it," ≈øaid I, "Ha≈ø≈øan, that you, who have ≈øo much power at the caravan≈øeras, have not power to re≈øi≈øt tho≈øe ra≈øcally ≈øantons, or the mobs of a village?"</p>
               <p>"Why, as to the mob," ≈øaid he, "if I was by my≈øelf, or had only a true Believer with me, I would make them fly before me like the du≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wind. As to the ≈øantons, no one can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt them: the Great, who hate them, are obliged to ≈øhow them re≈øpect: and the ba≈øhaw of Aleppo, nay the Commander of the Faithful him≈øelf, could not ≈øave you, if one of them called on the mob to ≈øtone you, or tear you to pieces. However, be of good cheer; for, plea≈øe ALLA, I will deliver you ≈øafe and ≈øound to the Coja at Bagdad: be≈øides, we ≈øhall very ≈øoon be at Mo≈øul from whence we will go down by water, which will be very plea≈øant: and the chief danger then will be in fair fighting, which is better than being cut off by ≈øantons.‚Äî Should there be occa≈øion," ≈øaid he, looking mo≈øt ferociou≈øly and brandi≈øhing his whip‚Äî"≈øhould we be attacked by Curds or Robbers, you ≈øhall ≈øee‚Äî you ≈øhall ≈øee, Jimme!‚ÄîOh! holy Prophet, how I'll fight!"</p>

               <p>IT was early in the evening when the pointed turrets of the city of Mo≈øul opened on our view, and communicated no very unplea≈øant ≈øen≈øations to my heart. I found my≈øelf on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ground; and could not help feeling ≈øome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pride of the traveller, when I reflected that I was now within ≈øight of Nineveh, renowned in Holy Writ.‚ÄîThe city is ≈øeated in a very barren ≈øandy plain, on the banks of the river Tigris, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli≈øhed with the united gifts of Pomona, Ceres, and Flora. The external view of the town is much in its favour, being encompa≈ø≈øed with ≈øtately walls of ≈øolid ≈øtone, over which the ≈øteeples or minarets of other lofty buildings are ≈øeen with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed effect. Here I fir≈øt ≈øaw a large caravan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, halting on its march from the Gulph of Per≈øia to Armenia; and it certainly made a mo≈øt noble appearance, filling the eye with a multitude of grand objects, all uniting to form one magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent whole.</p>
               <p>But though the out≈øide be ≈øo beautiful, the in≈øide is mo≈øt dete≈øtable: the heat is ≈øo inten≈øe, that in the middle of the day there is no ≈øtirring out; and even at night the walls of the hou≈øes are ≈øo heated by the day's ≈øun, as to produce a di≈øagreeable heat to the body at a foot or even a yard di≈øtance from them. However, I entered it with ≈øpirits, becau≈øe I con≈øidered it as the la≈øt ≈øtage of the wor≈øt part of my pilgrimage. But al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

≈øhrug, and accommodate my mind to a journey on hor≈øeback, which, though not ≈øo long as that I had already made, was likely to be equally dangerous, and which therefore demanded a full exertion of fortitude and re≈øolution.‚ÄîThere are a thou≈øand la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent energies in every man, which only want the powerful voice of nece≈ø≈øity to call them out: and now drawn to the top of my bent, I prepared my mind to ≈øet out in the morning, with as much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs as if the hopes of water carriage to Bagdad had never once occured to my mind.</p>
               <p>It was ≈øtill the hot ≈øea≈øon of the year, and we were to travel through that country, over which the horrid wind I have before mentioned ≈øweeps its con≈øuming bla≈øts: it is called by the Turks ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miel, is mentioned by holy Job under the name of the Ea≈øt Wind, and extends its ravages all the way from the extreme end of the Gulph of Cambaya up to Mo≈øul; it carries along with it fleaks of fire, like threads of ≈øilk; in≈øtantly ≈øtrikes dead tho≈øe that breathe it, and con≈øumes them inwardly to a≈øhes; the fle≈øh ≈øoon becoming black as a coal, and dropping off from the bones. Philo≈øophers con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as a kind of electric fire, proceeding from the ≈øulphureous or nitrous exhalations which are kindled by the agitation of the winds. The only po≈ø≈øible means of e≈øcape from its fatal effects, is to fall flat on the ground, and thereby prevent the drawing it in<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to do this, however, it is nece≈ø≈øary fir≈øt to ≈øee it, which is not always practicable.</p>
               <p>But be≈øides this, the ordinary heat of the climate is extremely dangerous to the blood and lungs, and even to the ≈økin, which it bli≈øters and peels away from the fle≈øh, affecting the eyes ≈øo much that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers are obliged to wear a tran≈øparent covering over them to keep the heat off.</p>
               <p>That night, Ha≈ø≈øan ≈øaid, that as we mu≈øt proceed to Bagdad on hor≈øeback, he would ≈øtay the next at Mo≈øul to refre≈øh us; which I objected to: he then
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:033487_0259_0FF724B54B2A13F8"/>
≈øpoke of the ≈øucceeding part of the journey as a thing of nothing: we had already come near nine hundred miles, and had not above five to go: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, as the weather was warmer, we would travel more in the night, and lie-by in the day-time, in places with which he was well acquainted.</p>
               <p>In ≈øhort, the poor fellow ≈øeemed to take an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in my ≈øafety, and to wi≈øh to alleviate the pains of my mind; and he always concluded with a remon≈øtrance again≈øt laughing, which from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hearing I now under≈øtood even in his own language.‚Äî"Don't laugh<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Jimmel, don't laugh," he would ≈øay with great ≈øolemnity.‚ÄîBy the bye, I ob≈øerved, that when he was well di≈øpo≈øed to me he always called me Jimmel (a name which I pre≈øume he con≈øtructed, with my ≈øervant's a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, from the re≈øemblance of ≈øound between Campbel and Camel, Jimmel being the Turki≈øh for that animal); and when angry, he called me Frangi, with all its gradations of Turki≈øh abu≈øe, Damus, Cucu, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That evening, as we ≈øat in the caravan≈øera<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> a man entered and ≈øpoke to Ha≈ø≈øan, who ≈øeemed to pay great attention to what he was ≈øaying.‚ÄîHe was a well made man‚Äîbelow the middle ≈øize‚Äîand had that kind of countenance which be≈øpeaks ≈øhrewdne≈øs, ingenuity, and mirth. At length he retired; and ≈øoon after Ha≈ø≈øan bade us ri≈øe and follow him: he went into a ≈øort of public room, where a number of people were collected, ≈øitting as is the cu≈øtom in coffee-hou≈øes on low ≈øtools.

                  </gap>≈ø≈øan pointed to me to ≈øit down, which I did: then placing the Interpreter near us, he ≈øat him≈øelf: and ≈øtraight I perceived the little man, who had ju≈øt been ≈øpeaking to him, ≈øtep forth from the crowd and begin to pronounce a ≈øort of prologue, which I neither under≈øtood nor wi≈øhed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand: it appeared from his cadences to be metrical, and ≈øeemed, by the little impre≈ø≈øion it made on his auditors, to have nothing particular to recommend
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:033487_0260_0FF724B829E29090"/>
it. At length, however, he pau≈øed, and, hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ≈øeveral times to clear his pipes, began again to hold forth. "He is going to tell a ≈øtory," ≈øaid the Interpreter. The attention of all was fixed upon him, and he proceeded with a modulation of tones, a variety of action, and an energy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, that I think I have never heard or ≈øeen excelled: his action indeed was ≈øingularly admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and I could perceive that he was occa≈øionally ≈øpeaking in the tones of a man and a woman: in which latter character he gave a picture of whining ludicrous di≈øtre≈øs, that moved the ri≈øible mu≈øcles of all the company. I looked at Ha≈ø≈øan, and he was grinning as merrily as could any monkey or Frank in A≈øia. The Lingui≈øt occa≈øionally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted what the ≈øtory-teller was ≈øaying; and I ≈øoon began to ≈øu≈øpect that it was a ≈øtory I had more than once read in the Arabian Nights, though altered, and in ≈øome mea≈øure dramatized by the ≈øpeaker. I looked ≈øeveral times archly at Ha≈ø≈øan, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned my glance, as much as to ≈øay, You ≈øee I don't laugh at all this. At length, however, the orator came to a part where he was to mimic a poor little hunch back (for I now di≈øcovered it to be the ≈øtory of little Hunch-back) choking with a bone: he threw up his back; ≈øqueezed till all the blood in his body ≈øeemed collected in his face, his eyes rolled in their ≈øockets, his knees knocked, he twi≈øted and folded his body, putting his fore finger, and thumb into his throat, and pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all his might, as if to pull ≈øomething out: at length he grew weaker, ≈øtretched his arms down, and his fingers back, like tho≈øe of a per≈øon ≈øtranggling‚Äîkicked, fell, quivered, and died. It is impo≈ø≈øible for any de≈øcription to do ju≈øtice to the perfection of his acting; and what rendered it the more extraordinary was, that though it was a ≈øcene of death, and well acted death he continued to render it ≈øo ludicrous in circum≈øtances,
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:033487_0261_0FF724BAD333EC90"/>
as to ≈øu≈øpend the audience between a laugh and cry. They did not remain long ≈øo; for he ≈øudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounced up, and began the mo≈øt doleful lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a woman, and exhibited ≈øuch a ≈øcene of burle≈øque di≈øtre≈øs as I never witne≈ø≈øed. All bur≈øt out in torrents of laughter, Ha≈ø≈øan as well as the re≈øt‚ÄîI alone remained purpo≈øely ≈øerious; and the orator, according to cu≈øtom, broke off in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of an intere≈øting ≈øcene.</p>
               <p>When we returned to the caravan≈øera, I rallied the Tartar on the ≈øcore of his laughter: he growled, and ≈øaid, "who could avoid it? Why did not you laugh as you were wont?"‚Äî<q>Becau≈øe, ≈øaid I, he did not act as cornically as you.</q>‚Äî"No," returned he, "but becau≈øe Franks and monkies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laugh for mi≈øchief, and where they ought not. No, Jimmel, you will never ≈øee me laugh at mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief."‚Äî"What," ≈øaid I, "not a a poor man's being choked to death!"‚Äî"Nay," ≈øaid he, "I ≈øeldom laugh, Yet I could not avoid it then." That very hour, however, a puppet-≈øhow was exhibited in the ≈øame room, and my grave guide laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and his voice ≈øunk into a warning treble. <hi>Kara ghu≈øe</hi> was certainly extravagantly comical, though filthy; and frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next day we ≈øet out well mounted, and pu≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with renovated ≈øpirits towards Bagdad.‚Äî Ha≈ø≈øan could no more have the a≈ø≈øurance to cen≈øure laughing and, as I was little di≈øpo≈øed to do it in time of danger, we were likely to agree well.

                  <salute>MY DEAR FREDERICK,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AFTER pa≈ø≈øing through an immen≈øe tract of country, di≈øtingui≈øhed by nothing that could ≈øerve even as a circum≈øtance to mark and remember our daily journeys, but which I ob≈øerved to grow manife≈øtly wor≈øe, both in ≈øoil and climate, as we proceeded Southward, we came in fight of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous city of Bagdad, on the ≈øeventh day from that on which we left Mo≈øul, and on the eighteenth from that of my departure from Aleppo; in which eighteen days we had rode fourteen hundred miles, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>On entering the city, I de≈øired my guide to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me to the hou≈øe of a Merchant, to whom I had got letters of credit and introduction. He took me accordingly through the windings of ≈øeveral ≈øtreets, and at la≈øt ≈øtopped at the do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

made a ≈øuitable apology, and was for retiring to find the hou≈øe of the proper per≈øon, for which purpo≈øe the Armenian offered me a ≈øervant, when, to my great a≈øtoni≈øhment, my Tartar interfered; ≈øaid that it was to this Merchant he brought all his goods, and that I mu≈øt remain where I was; at the ≈øame time ordering the Armenian, in a peremptory tone, to take charge of me, and u≈øe me well. It was in vain that the Armenian endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him the nature of the bu≈øine≈øs, and that I in≈øi≈øted I mu≈øt go to the other Merchant‚ÄîHASSAN was peremptory, and declared that I ≈øhould not. It was ≈øo extremely <hi>outre</hi> and ridiculous, that I could not be angry; and the good Armenian unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voice with that of the Tartar, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to favour him with my company, I acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øced, and indeed remained in his hou≈øe all the time I was at Bagdad. This was proof po≈øitive, if any other than I already had was wanting, that he con≈øidered me merely as a piece of merchandi≈øe, which he was bound (according to the language of Merchants) to deliver in good order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>I had undertaken, before leaving Aleppo, to give the guide, if he acted conformably to my wi≈øhes, and behaved well, twenty pounds over and above the hundred provided by the agreement: I therefore ≈øent for him, to ≈øettle finally, and part. He had heard that I was a per≈øon different from what he had ≈øuppo≈øed me to be: but it did not alter his conduct, as might be expected, or make him ≈øtoop to cringing; he ≈øtill ≈øpoke with the ≈øame hone≈øt, bold familiarity; and when I gave him the promi≈øed twenty pounds, he never hinted, cringed for, or even looked as if he expected more: but when we came to part, the feelings he di≈øclo≈øed, and tho≈øe I my≈øelf felt, convinced me, that Man is not naturally that brute which prejudice has made him; and, when left to his own operations,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:033487_0266_0FF724C922678690"/>
the human heart would be uniformly kindly, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate, and ≈øympathetic: the poor, rough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli≈øhed Turk, betrayed the ≈øtronge≈øt marks of ≈øen≈øibility, and I my≈øelf once more felt the unea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of parting.</p>
               <p>I think this is the proper place to give you my opinion of the Turks, while the recollection of hone≈øt HASSAN is fre≈øh in my mind; and I cannot do it better than by quoting the words of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent French Writer‚Äî</p>
               <p>"The Turks (≈øays M. du LOIR) are naturally a good people, which is not to be a≈øcribed to the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; for the Greeks born in the ≈øame climate have very different di≈øpo≈øitions, and retain only the bad qualities of their ance≈øtors, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Turks, on the contrary, priding them≈øelves on their integrity and mode≈øty, are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed in general by an open, ingenuous ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners; courtiers only excepted, who, in Turkey, as every where el≈øe, are the ≈ølaves of ambition and avarice."</p>
               <p>The name of Bagdad has been ≈øo renowned in Ea≈øtern ≈øtory, and is the ≈øcene of ≈øo many of tho≈øe bewitching tales which we find tran≈ølated, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be tran≈ølated, from the Arabic and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øian, that I felt great plea≈øure in ≈øeeing it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my≈øelf to be at the very fountain-head of marvellous adventure and romance. Fraught with this idea, I was impatient to go forth into the town; and notwith≈øtanding the weather was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conception hot, I paraded a number of ≈øtreets: but never did I, in the cour≈øe of my life, ≈øee a place ≈øo calculated to belie the opinion one would form of it from the ea≈øtern tales. It appeared to me to be among the mo≈øt di≈øagreeable cities of the world, and has no one circum≈øtance that I could di≈øcover to recommend it: the heat is ≈øo great, that in the Summer-time the inhabitants are forced to keep their markets in the night, and to lie

all night in the open air, on the terraces of their hou≈øes.</p>
               <p>The Armenian with whom I re≈øided, did every thing in his power to render the place agreeable to me; and I ≈øhall always retain a lively ≈øen≈øe of his goodne≈øs and ho≈øpitality: he was not only generous and polite, but well informed, and plea≈øing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation. I took occa≈øion to expre≈øs to him the di≈øappointment I felt at finding Bagdad ≈øo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what I expected; and told him that I had, when a youth, learned to think highly of it, or rather romantically, from reading Ea≈øtern tales. This led to a conver≈øation on the Arabian Nights Entertainments, a copy of which he had in the Arabic, and produced it: he then ≈øhewed me, with great triumph, a French tran≈ølation of them, print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Paris, which he had read, and declared that the tran≈ølation was nothing it all in compari≈øon with the original. I believe he was well qualified to judge, for he was a perfect ma≈øter of the French language.</p>
               <p>We talked of the Ea≈øtern tale of the Gla≈øs Man, who, in a reverie, increa≈øes his ≈øtock till he gets ≈øo rich as, in imagination, to marry the Cadi's daughter, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in kicking his wife, kicks all his gla≈ø≈øes about, and de≈øtroys the whole of his vi≈øionary fortune. I prai≈øed the humour of it much ‚Äî"Sir," ≈øaid he, "there is nothing in it that may not be experienced frequently in actual life: tho≈øe waking dreams are the u≈øual concomitants of opium: a man who has accu≈øtomed him≈øelf to the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious practice of eating opium, is con≈øtantly ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them.

A Turk who was pre≈øent, in the fulne≈øs of his zeal, laid a ≈øtick very heavily acro≈øs his ≈øhoulders, and put an end to the vi≈øion: and never did I ≈øee a wretch ≈øo abject, ≈øo forlorn, or ≈øo mi≈øerably de≈øponding; he put his forehead to the ground, which he wet with his tears, crying, Mercy, Mahomet! mercy, holy Prophet! mercy, Alla!‚Äînor could he find relief (≈øuch is the ruin of opium) till he got a fre≈øh ≈øupply of it in his mouth, which ≈øoon gave him a temporary re≈øpite from the horrors of his ≈øituation."</p>
               <p>Unque≈øtionably, Bagdad was once a great city, of flouri≈øhing commerce; but the Sultan AMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATH the Fourth, when he made him≈øelf ma≈øter of it, put the riche≈øt Merchants ≈øettled there to death; and it has ever ≈øince gradually declined. About two days journey from it, lie the ruins of the once famous city of Babylon. I was much di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to go to ≈øee it, and thence drop down the Euphrates to Ba≈ø≈øora: but my Armenian ho≈øt told me there was nothing in it to recompen≈øe a per≈øon for half the trouble; for, of that magnificent city, which was ≈øixty m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

≈øome great edifices. The Tower of Belus, and the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, lie with the re≈øt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øtingui≈øhed ruin. The greate≈øt curio≈øities, then, were, in the fir≈øt place, the ruins of a building ≈øaid to be the famed Tower of Babel, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have been half a league in compa≈øs; and the remains of a va≈øt bridge over the Euphrates, where it is half a league broad.</p>
               <p>I was not more anxious to arrive at the city of Bagdad than I was to leave it; and having written letters, and put them in a way of being forwarded to Europe, I took leave of my friendly ho≈øpitable Armenian, and, with a thou≈øand acknowledgments for his kindne≈øs, ≈øet out on hor≈øeback to a place on the Tigris, where I embarked in a boat, in order to proceed to Ba≈ø≈øora. This river, known ≈øince the fir≈øt records of human exi≈øtence by Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, is remarkable for its rapidity, whence, PLINY ≈øays, it has the name of Tigris, (in the Median language, a dart); and for its extraordinary cour≈øe, which is in many places under ground, ri≈øes in Armenia, ≈øinks into the earth near mount Taurus, and runs under a mountain‚Äîthen ri≈øing at the other ≈øide, follows its cour≈øe through the lake The≈øpites‚Äîagain ≈øinks frequently under ground, and continues hid at one time for a ≈øpace of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five miles; where, once more emerging, it glides along wiih a very rapid ≈øtream, meets the Euphrates at a place called Korna, pa≈ø≈øes through Ba≈ø≈øora, and falls into the Per≈øian Gulph.</p>
               <p>As the boat in which I took my pa≈ø≈øage had no convenience for excluding the violence of the ≈øun, except an awning, I ≈øuffered extremely from the heat. The River it≈øelf was grand; but the banks, and contiguous country, contained nothing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract notice‚Äîno object to diver≈øify the dreary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

va≈øt extent of country, ≈øo uniformly dull and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øting. The only thing that ≈øerved to keep the mind alive, was the apprehen≈øion of robbers, who, in great numbers, hover over this river, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pa≈ø≈øengers. We had taken care, on leaving Bagdad, to be well provided with fire-arms; and they did us yeomen's ≈øervice‚Äîfor we were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attacked by robbers with a view to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but found that a ≈øhot or two di≈øper≈øed and ≈øent them off in con≈øternation. One night, however, in pa≈ø≈øing a creek, we perceived ≈øeveral boats i≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, in great order, and in a manner that evinced method and premeditation: we ≈øilently prepared for their reception, and were completely ready to meet them warmly, while they thought us quite unprepared, and uncon≈øcious of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: they fir≈øt endeavoured to board us by ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe: wi≈øhing rather to frighten than to kill them, we began by firing over their heads; on which they ≈øet up the mo≈øt horrible ≈øhouts, and ru≈øhed on with a tumultuous rapidity, making the mo≈øt terrible noi≈øe in order to intimidate us: they were by this time quite near us; we therefore took aim at them, and let fly, and immediately perceived them in great confu≈øion, ≈øome of the boats lo≈øing their helm, and falling with the ≈øtream on the others: at la≈øt we ≈øaw them ≈øheer off, and they gave us no farther trouble.</p>

≈øun, I arrived at the city of Ba≈ø≈øora, where I was received with the utmo≈øt ho≈øpitality by Mr. LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOUCHE, the Company's Re≈øident from Bombay, who did every thing po≈ø≈øible for my accomodation, and procured me every in≈øtruction re≈øpecting my further progre≈øs.</p>
               <p>This city, as well as Bagdad, is famous in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ≈øtory. The country about it is con≈øidered by the natives as the be≈øt ≈øpot in A≈øia, though the burning winds annoy and frequently de≈øtroy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, overwhelming them with mountains of hot ≈øand, driven like waves of the ≈øea, before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe≈øt out of the neighbouring de≈øerts. It carries on a great trade, and is inhabited by va≈øt numbers of Chri≈øtians and Jews. The Engli≈øh and Dutch have factories here, as well for the purpo≈øe of commerce, as the tran≈øit of di≈øpatches, by way of Dama≈øcus and Aleppo, to Europe. The Riche≈øt merchandi≈øe of India and Europe are brought here in caravans; and its opulence is greatly increa≈øed by the caravans of Pilgrims, who pa≈øs through it on their way to Mecca, and pay great duties, bartering for many rich commodities. The hor≈øes of this place are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated for their ≈øuperior excellence: it is ≈øaid that they will run thirty hours without meat or drink‚ÄîI doubt the fact, and ≈øhould be ≈øorry to ≈øee ≈øo inhuman an experiment tried.</p>
               <p>One comfortable circum≈øtance attending Ba≈ø≈øora is, that at night the ≈øtreets may be walked with perfect ≈øafety at all hours. It is ≈øubject to an Arab Prince, who is tributary to the Turk, and who≈øe revenue is very great, as well from the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned cau≈øes, as becau≈øe he gives full liberty to all Nations to come and trade to his capital.</p>
               <p>From Ba≈ø≈øora I took my pa≈ø≈øage in a date-boat going to Mu≈økat, expecting to get from thence a ≈øpeedy pa≈ø≈øage to Bombay: but the boat ≈øprung a leak at ≈øea, and we were obliged to run into Bu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heer, where I was very ho≈øpitably received and

               <p>There really ≈øeemed to be an unu≈øual fatality at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending me throughout the whole of my journey. You will recollect, in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by the war with France, from going by the direct route which I ≈øhould otherwi≈øe have taken, and obliged to pa≈øs through the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Germany‚ÄîIn the next place, at Venice I was di≈øappointed in obtaining a pa≈ø≈øage to Lata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaea; and, immediately on the heels of that, lo≈øt my ≈øervant at Trie≈øte, by ≈øending him for letters to Venice‚ÄîAfterwards, when I had gone to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria with expectation of travelling through Egypt, and viewing that intere≈øting part of the world, I found my≈øelf prevented by the unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of the country‚Äîthe plague raging in Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, and all the roads being blocked up by an incur≈øion of the Arabs. Thus mortified and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, I turned about, in order to make my way in another direction; and arriving at Cyprus, found, to my infinite ≈øurpri≈øe and regret, that an epidemic di≈øea≈øe, little ≈øhort of the plague, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed there, and ≈øwept off the inhabitants in great numbers: when, after ≈øurmounting all tho≈øe ob≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, I arrived at Aleppo, the fir≈øt information I got was, that the caravan was gone, and that it would be a long time before another would be ready; and my departure from Aleppo was attended with circum≈øtances no le≈øs inau≈øpicious than my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance‚ÄîAt Mo≈øul I experienced another di≈øap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, by the river's being dried up, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered impracticable by boats‚ÄîMy pa≈ø≈øage from Ba≈ø≈øora to Mu≈økat was impeded by the ve≈ø≈øel ≈øpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a leak‚ÄîAnd now, when at la≈øt I hoped to get from Bu≈øheer to Bombay, I was ≈øtopped by the intelligence that the Gulph was blocked up by French privateers, in≈øomuch as no ve≈ø≈øel could hope to e≈øcape, I was therefore obliged to remain at

Bu≈øheer, till a Company's frigate, commanded by Captain HARDY, and ≈øoon expected ≈øhould afford me an opportunity of proceeding to Bombay. Time, however, brought that period about; and I took my pa≈ø≈øage, and arrived ≈øafe at Bombay, where I ≈øoon after embarked on board a Portugue≈øe ve≈ø≈øel, being the only conveyance that offered for me to proceed to Madras: ≈øhe was fir≈øt bound to Goa, and we arrived ≈øafely at that i≈øland, where I was received with great politene≈øs, and treated with the mo≈øt friendly attention, by Mr. HENSHAW, the Engli≈øh Re≈øident.</p>
               <p>Goa belongs to the Portugue≈øe: the Viceroy of the Nation lives there in great pomp.

               <p>I was impatient to get from Goa, and yet I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward to my departure with a ≈øecret unea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, for which I was entirely unable to account‚Äî I wi≈øhed to proceed, and yet ≈øome ≈øecret foreboding whi≈øpered to my heart that I was on the verge of calamity: ≈øo powerful was it, and ≈øo ob≈øtinate, that I could neither rea≈øon away its admonitions, nor re≈øi≈øt its impre≈ø≈øions; and ≈øomething ince≈øtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told me, in as plain language as if a human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øpoke, that I ≈øhould ≈øuffer a dreadful misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. As I had all my life been an enemy to ≈øuper≈øtition, I felt my ≈øpirit in≈øulted, and my under≈øtanding degraded, by the involuntary victory which I allowed to this impre≈ø≈øion‚ÄîI combated it with rea≈øon, with ridicule, with ≈øelf-contempt ‚Äîall in vain: in ≈øpite of me, I became the very ≈ølave of gloomy pre≈øentiment; and in order to get the ≈øuccedaneous aid of a friend's rea≈øon, as well as to be prepared, I communicated the ≈øtate of my

In vain he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to cheer me: all he could do was to give me his coun≈øel; in con≈øequence of which I actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øettled all my affairs up to that day, made my will, left it with Mr. HENSHAW, and, full of dreadful forebodings of ≈øhipwreck, went on board a Portugue≈øe ≈ønow bound to Madras.</p>
               <p>It was now the eighteenth day of May when we ≈øailed from Goa. The hemi≈øphere had been for ≈øome days overca≈øt with clouds: ≈øome light ≈øhowers of rain had fallen; and you may conclude that it did not tend to rai≈øe my ≈øpirits, or free me from ominous apprehen≈øions, to hear that tho≈øe circum≈øtances indicated an approaching gale of wind. I ob≈øerved, moreover, that the ve≈ø≈øel was much too deep in the water, being greatly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded‚Äîthat ≈øhe was in many re≈øpects defective, and, as the ≈øeamen ≈øay, ill-found, and in ≈øhort ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unfit to encounter a gale of wind of any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. I ≈øcorned, however, to yield to tho≈øe united impre≈ø≈øions, and determined to proceed.</p>
               <p>On the nineteenth, the ≈øky was ob≈øcured by immen≈øe fleeces of clouds, ≈øurcharged with inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable matter; and in the evening, the rain fell in torrents, the firmament darkened apace, ≈øudden night came on, and the horrors of extreme dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs were rendered ≈øtill more horrible by the peals of thunder which rent the air, and the frequent fla≈øhes of lightning, which ≈øerved only to ≈øhew us the horror of our ≈øituation, and leave us in increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed darkne≈øs: mean-time the wind became more violent, blowing on the ≈øhore; and a heavy ≈øea, rai≈øed by its force, united with it to make our ≈øtate more formidable.</p>
               <p>By day-light on the morning of the twentieth, the gale had encrea≈øed to a furious tempe≈øt; and the ≈øea, keeping pace with it, ran mountain-high; and as it kept invariably to the ≈øame point, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Officers became ≈øeriou≈øly alarmed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt

               <p>About ≈øeven o'clock on the morning of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fir≈øt, I was alarmed by an un≈øual noi≈øe upon the deck, and running up, perceived that every remaining ≈øail in the ve≈ø≈øel, the fore-≈øail alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, was totally carried away. The ≈øight was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; and the whole ve≈ø≈øel pre≈øented a ≈øpectacle as dreadful to the feelings as mortifying to human pride. Fear had produced, not only all the helple≈ø≈øne≈øs of de≈øpondency, but all the mi≈øchievous freaks of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øanity. In one place ≈øtood the Captain, raving, ≈øtamping, and tearing his hair in handfuls from his head‚Äîhere ≈øome of the crew were ca≈øt upon their knees, clapping their hands, and praying, with all the extravagance of horror painted in their faces ‚Äî there, others were flogging their images with all their might, calling upon them to allay the ≈øtorm. One of our pa≈ø≈øengers, who was Pur≈øer of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh Ea≈øt-Indiaman, had got hold of a ca≈øe-bottle of rum, and, with an air of di≈øtraction and deep de≈øpair imprinted in his face, was ≈øtalking about in his ≈øhirt. I perceived him to be on the point of ≈øerving it about, in large tumblers, to the few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈ømayed people; and well convinced, that, ≈øo far from alleviating, it would ≈øharpen the horrors of

               <p>Having accompli≈øhed this point, I applied my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to the Captain, and endeavoured to bring h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>While I was thus employed, we ≈øhipped a ≈øea on the ≈øtarboard ≈øide, which I really thought would have ≈øent us down.

               <p>Ju≈øt at this cri≈øis, the water, which ru≈øhed with incredible force through all parts of the ve≈ø≈øel, brought out floating, and nearly ≈øuffocated, another Engli≈øh pa≈ø≈øenger, who was endeavouring to take a little repo≈øe in a ≈ømall cabin boarded off from the deck: he was a very ≈øtout young man, and full of true ≈øpirit. Finding that the ve≈ø≈øel was not, as I had thought, going immediately down, he joined me in exhorting the captain to his duty: we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded him to throw the guns overboard, as well as a number of trunks and packages with which the ve≈ø≈øel was much encumbered; and with ≈øome little exertion, we got the pumps ≈øet agoing.</p>

               <head>LETTER XLV.</head>
               <p>THE name of the Engli≈øh pa≈ø≈øenger, whom I mentioned to you in my la≈øt Letter as a≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in getting the Captain and Mariners to do their duty, was HALL. He was a young man of a mo≈øt amiable di≈øpo≈øition, and with it po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed all that manly ≈øpirit that gives pre≈øence of mind in exigences of danger. He and I having, with great difficulty, got ≈øome hands to ≈øtick to the pumps, ≈øtood at the wheel, at once to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the men, and prevent them from quitting it; and, although hopele≈øs, determined that no effort practicable on our parts ≈øhould be wanting to the pre≈øervation of the ve≈ø≈øel. The water, however, gained upon the pumps, notwith≈øtanding every effort; and it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared that we could not keep her long above water.</p>
               <p>At ten o'clock the wind ≈øeemed to increa≈øe, and amounted to a downright hurricane: the ≈øky was ≈øo entirely ob≈øcured with black clouds, and the rain fell ≈øo thick, that objects were not di≈øcernable from the wheel to the ≈øhip's head. Soon the pumps were choaked, and could no longer be worked: then di≈ømay ≈øeized on all‚Äînothing but unutterable de≈øpair, ≈øilent angui≈øh, and horror, wrought up to frenzy, was to be ≈øeen; not a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ≈øoul was capable of an effort to be u≈øeful‚Äîall ≈øeemed more de≈øirous to extingui≈øh their calamities by embracing death, than willing, by a painful exertion, to avoid it.</p>
               <p>At about eleven o'clock we could plainly di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh a dreadful roaring noi≈øe, re≈øembling that of waves rolling again≈øt rocks; but the darkne≈øs of
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:033487_0278_0FF724E63631DEF0"/>
the day, and the accompanying rains, prevented us from ≈øeeing any di≈øtance; and if they were rocks, we might be actually da≈øhed to pieces on them before we could perceive them. At twelve o'clock, however, the weather cleared up a little, and both the wind and the ≈øea ≈øeemed to have aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the very expan≈øion of the pro≈øpect round the ≈øhip was exhilerating; and as the weather grew better, and the ≈øea le≈øs furious, the ≈øen≈øes of the people returned, and the general ≈øtupefaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decrea≈øe.</p>
               <p>The weather continuing to clear up, we in ≈øome time di≈øcovered breakers and large rocks without ≈øide of us; ≈øo that it appeared we mu≈øt have pa≈ø≈øed quite clo≈øe to them, and were now fairly hemmed in between them and the land.</p>
               <p>In this very critical juncture, the Captain, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely contrary to my opinion, adopted the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous re≈øolution of letting go an anchor, to bring her up with her head to the ≈øea: But, though no ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, my common ≈øen≈øe told me that ≈øhe could never ride it out, but mu≈øt directly go down. The event nearly ju≈øtified my judgment; for ≈øhe had ≈øcarcely been at anchor before an enormous ≈øe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On finding her≈øelf free, the ve≈ø≈øel again floated, and made an effort to right her≈øelf; but ≈øhe was almo≈øt completely water-logged, and heeled to lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ≈øo much that the gunnel lay under water. We then endeavoured to ≈øteer as fa≈øt as we could for the land, which we knew could not be at any great di≈øtance, though we were unable to di≈øcover it through the hazy weather: the fore≈øail was loo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; by great efforts in balling, ≈øhe righted a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:033487_0279_0FF724E8C4D1A868"/>
her gunnel was got above water, and we ≈øcud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as well as we could before the wind, which ≈øtill blew hard on ≈øhore; and at about two o'clock the land appeared at a ≈ømall di≈øtance a head.</p>
               <p>The love of life countervails all other con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the mind of man. The uncertainty we were under with regard to the ≈øhore before us, which we had rea≈øon to believe was part of HYDER ALLI'S dominions, where we ≈øhould meet with the mo≈øt rigorous treatment, if not ultimate death, was forgotten in the joyful hope of ≈øaving life; and we ≈øcudded towards the ≈øhore in all the exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tran≈øports of people ju≈øt ≈ønatched from the jaws of death.</p>
               <p>This gleam of happine≈øs continued not long: a tremendous ≈øea rolling after us, broke over our ≈øtern, tore every thing before it, ≈øtove in the ≈øteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, carried away the rudder, ≈øhivered the wheel to pieces, and tore up the very ring-bolts of the deck‚Äîconveyed the men who ≈øtood at the wheel forward, and ≈øwept them overboard. I was ≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the time, near the wheel, and fortunately had hold of the taffarel, which enabled me to re≈øi≈øt in part the weight of the wave. I was, however, ≈øwept off my feet, and da≈øhed again≈øt the main-ma≈øt. The jerk from the taffarel, which I hold very tenaciou≈øly, ≈øeemed as if it would have di≈ølo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated my arms: however, it broke the impetus of my motion, and in all probability ≈øaved me from being da≈øhed to pieces again≈øt the ma≈øt.</p>
               <p>I floundered about in the water at the foot of the ma≈øt, till at length I got on my feet, and ≈øeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rope, which I held in a ≈øtate of great embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra≈ø≈øment, dubious what I ≈øhould do to extricate my≈øelf. At this in≈øtant I perceived that Mr. HALL had got upon the cap≈øtern, and was waving his hand to me to follow his example: this I wi≈øhed to do, though it was an enterpri≈øe of ≈øome ri≈øk and difficulty; for, if I lo≈øt the hold I had, a ≈øingle

motion of the ve≈ø≈øel, or a full wave, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly carry me overboard. I made a bold pu≈øh, however, and fortunately accompli≈øhed it. Having attained this ≈øtation, I could the better ≈øurvey the wreck, and ≈øaw that the water was nearly brea≈øt-high on the quarter-deck, (for the ve≈ø≈øel was deep-wai≈øted); and I perceived the unfortunate Engli≈øh Pur≈øer ≈øtanding where the water was mo≈øt ≈øhallow, as if watching with patient expectation its ri≈øing, and awating death: I called to him to come to us, but he ≈øhook his head in de≈øpair, and ≈øaid, in a lamentable tone, "It is all over with us! GOD have mercy upon us!"‚Äîthen ≈øeated him≈øelf with ≈øeeming compo≈øure on a chair which happened to be rolling about in the wreck of the deck, and in a few minutes afterwards was wa≈øhed into the ≈øea along with it, where he was ≈øpeedily relea≈øed from a ≈øtate ten thou≈øand times wor≈øe than death.</p>
               <p>During this univer≈øal wreck of things, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror I was in could not prevent me from ob≈øerving a very curious circum≈øtance, which at any other time would have excited laughter, though now it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no other emotion than ≈øurpri≈øe‚ÄîWe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in part laden with mangoes, of which the i≈øland of Goa is known to produce the fine≈øt in the world; ≈øome of them lay in ba≈økets on the poop; a little black boy, in the moment of greate≈øt danger, had got ≈øeated by them, devouring them voraciou≈øly, and crying all the time mo≈øt bitterly at the horrors of his ≈øituation!</p>
               <p>The ve≈ø≈øel now got completely water-logged; and Mr. HALL and I were employed in forming conjectural calculations how many minutes ≈øhe could keep above water, and con≈øoling one another on the unfortunate circum≈øtances under which we met‚Äî lamenting that fate had thus brought us acquainted only to make us witne≈ø≈øes of each other's mi≈øery, and then to ≈øee one another no more.</p>

                  <pb n="282" facs="unknown:033487_0281_0FF724ED35C7A3A0"/>As the larboard ≈øide of the ve≈ø≈øel was gradually going down, the deck, and of cour≈øe the cap≈øtern, became too nearly perpendicular for us to continue on it: we therefore fore≈øaw the nece≈ø≈øity of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and got upon the ≈øtarboard ≈øide, holding fa≈øt by the gunnel, and allowing our bodies and legs to yield to the ≈øea as it broke over us. Thus we continued for ≈øome time: at length the ≈øeverity of the labour ≈øo entirely exhau≈øted our ≈øtrength and ≈øpirits, that our be≈øt hope ≈øeemed to be a ≈øpeedy conclu≈øion to our painful death; and we began to have ≈øerious intentions of letting go our hold, and yielding our≈øelves up at once to the fury of the waves.</p>
               <p>The ve≈ø≈øel, which all this time drifted with the ≈øea and wind, gradually approximated the ≈øhore, and at length ≈øtruck the ground, which for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant revived our almo≈øt departed hopes; but we ≈øoon found that it did not in the ≈ømalle≈øt degree better our ≈øituation‚ÄîAgain I began to yield to utter de≈øpair‚Äîagain I thought of letting go my hold, and ≈øinking at once: It is impo≈ø≈øible thought I ever to e≈øcape‚Äîwhy, then, prolong, for a few minutes, a painful exi≈øtence that mu≈øt at la≈øt be given up? Yet, yet, the all-≈øubduing love of life ≈øugge≈øted, that many things apparently impo≈ø≈øible had come to pa≈øs; and I ≈øaid to my≈øelf, If life is to be lo≈øt, why not lo≈øe it in a glorious ≈øtruggle? Should I ≈øurvive it by accident, life will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered doubly ≈øweet to me, and I ≈øtill more worthy of it by per≈øevering fortitude.</p>
               <p>While I was employed in this train of reflection, I perceived ≈øome of the people collecting together, talking, and holding a con≈øultation‚ÄîIt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately occurred to me, that they were devi≈øing ≈øome plan for e≈øcaping from the wreck, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on ≈øhore: and, ≈øo natural is it for man to cling to his fellow-creature for ≈øupport in difficult or dangerous exigences, I propo≈øed to Mr. HALL to

join them, and take a ≈øhare in the execution of the plan‚Äîob≈øerving to him at the ≈øame time, that I was determined at all events to quit the ve≈ø≈øel, and tru≈øt to the protection and guidance of a ≈øuperintending Providence for the re≈øt.</p>

               <p>AS prodigality of life is, in ≈øome ca≈øes, the exce≈øs of virtue and courage‚Äî≈øo there are others in which it is vice, meanne≈øs and cowardice. True courage is, according to the circum≈øtances under which it is to operate, as rigidly tenacious and vigilant of life in one ca≈øe, as it is indifferent and regardle≈øs in another; and I think it is a very ≈øtrange contradiction in the human heart (although it often happens), that a man who has the mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded courage, in ≈øeeking death even in the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's mouth, ≈øhall yet want the nece≈ø≈øary re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make exertions to ≈øave his life in ca≈øes of ordinary danger. The unfortunate Engli≈øh Pur≈øer could not collect courage ≈øufficient to make an effort to ≈øave him≈øelf; and yet I think it probable that he would have faced a battery of artillery, or expo≈øed him≈øelf to a pi≈øtol-≈øhot, if occa≈øion required, as ≈øoon as any other man. Thus it appears at fir≈øt view: but may not this ≈øeeming incongruity be explained by ≈øaying, that per≈øonal courage and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are different qualities of the mind and body, and depend upon the exerci≈øe of entirely different functions?</p>
               <p>Be that as it may, I argued with my≈øelf, in the height of my calamitous ≈øituation, upon the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of fortitude and dejection, courage and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice; and, nothwith≈øtanding the ≈øerious a≈øpect of

affairs, found my≈øelf li≈øtening to the ≈øugge≈øtions of pride: What a paltry thing to yield, while ≈øtrength is left to ≈øtruggle! Vanity her≈øelf had her hint, and whi≈øpered, "Should I e≈øcape by an effort of my own, what a glorious theme of exultation!" There were, I confe≈øs, tran≈øitory images in my mind, which, co-operating with the natural at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to ≈øelf-pre≈øervation, made me per≈øevere, and re≈øolve to do ≈øo, while one ve≈øtige of hope was left for the mind to dwell on.</p>
               <p>Ob≈øerving, as I told you before, the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulting together, and re≈øolving to join them, I made an effort to get to the lee ≈øhrouds, where they were ≈øtanding, or rather clinging; but before I could accompli≈øh it, I lo≈øt my hold, fell down the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (the gratings having been carried away with the long-boat), and was for ≈øome minutes entangled there among≈øt a heap of packages, which the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fluctuations of the water had collected on the lee ≈øide. As the ve≈ø≈øel moved with the ≈øea, and the water flowed in, the packages and I were roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together‚Äî≈øometimes one, ≈øometimes another, uppermo≈øt; ≈øo that I began to be apprehen≈øive I ≈øhould not be able to extricate my≈øelf: by the mere≈øt accident, however, I gra≈øped ≈øomething that lay in my way, made a vigorous ≈øpring, and gained the lee ≈øhrouds. Mr. HALL, who followed me, in ≈øeizing the ≈øhrouds, came thump again≈øt me with ≈øuch violence that I could ≈øcarcely retain my hold of the rigging. Compelled by the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ≈øituation in which I ≈øtood, I called out to him for GOD'S ≈øake to keep off, for that I was rendered quite breathle≈øs and worn out: he generou≈øly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make way for me, and, in doing ≈øo, unfortunately lo≈øt his hold, and went down under the ≈øhip's ≈øide. Never, never ≈øhall I forget my ≈øen≈øations at this melancholy incident‚ÄîI would have given millions of worlds that I could have recalled the words which made him move; my
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:033487_0284_0FF724F74A707C40"/>
mind was wound up to the la≈øt pitch of angui≈øh: I may truly ≈øay, that this was the mo≈øt bitter of all the bitter moments of my life, compared with which the other circum≈øtances of the ≈øhipwreck ≈øeemed le≈ø≈øened‚Äîfor I had in≈øen≈øibly acquired an unu≈øual e≈øteem and warm attachment for him, and was doubtful whether, after being even the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent occa≈øion of his falling, I ought to take fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pains to pre≈øerve my own life. All tho≈øe ≈øen≈øations were pa≈ø≈øing with the rapidity of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through my thoughts, when, as much to my a≈øtoni≈øhment as to my joy, I ≈øaw him borne by a returning wave, and thrown among the very pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages from which I had but ju≈øt before, with ≈øuch labour and difficulty, extricated my≈øelf‚ÄîIn the end he proved equally fortunate, but after a much longer and harder ≈øtruggle, and after ≈øu≈øtaining much more injury.</p>
               <p>I once more changed my ≈øtation, and made my way to the poop, where I found my≈øelf rather more ≈øheltered‚ÄîI earne≈øtly wi≈øhed Mr. HALL to be with me, whatever might be my ultimate fate ‚Äîand beckoned to him to come to me; but he only an≈øwered by ≈øhaking his head, in a feeble, de≈øponding manner‚Äî≈øtaring at the ≈øame time wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about him: even his ≈øpirit was ≈øubdued; and de≈øpair, I perceived, had begun to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his mind.</p>
               <p>Being a little more at ea≈øe in my new ≈øtation than I had been before, I had more time to deliberate, and more power to judge. I recollected, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cour≈øe of time, the day was far gone, and the night quickly approaching: I reflected, that for any enterprize what≈øoever, day was much preferable to night; and above all I con≈øidered, that the ve≈ø≈øel could not hold long together‚ÄîI therefore thought, that the be≈øt mode I could adopt would be, to take to the water with the fir≈øt boyant thing I could ≈øee; and, as the wind and water

both ≈øeemed to run to the ≈øhore, to take my chance in that way of reaching it. In pur≈øuance of this re≈øolution, I tore off my ≈øhirt, having before that thrown off the other parts of my dre≈øs‚ÄîI looked at my ≈øleeve buttons, in which was ≈øet the hair of my departed children‚Äîand, by an involuntary act of the imagination, a≈øked my≈øelf the que≈øtion, "Shall I be happy enough to meet them where I am now about to go?‚Äî≈øhall tho≈øe dear la≈øt remains, too, become a prey to the devouring deep?"‚ÄîIn that in≈øtant, rea≈øon, ≈øu≈øpended by the horrors of the ≈øcene, gave way to in≈øtinct; and I rolled my ≈øhirt up, and very carefully thru≈øt it into a hole between decks, with the wild hopes that the ≈øleeve buttons might yet e≈øcape untouched. Watching my opportunity, I ≈øaw a log of wood floating near the ve≈ø≈øel, and, waving my hand to Mr. HALL as a la≈øt adieu, jumped after it. Here, again, I was doomed to aggravated hard≈øhips‚ÄîI had ≈øcarcely touched the log when a great ≈øea ≈ønatched it from my hold: ≈øtill as it came near me, I gra≈øped at it ineffectually, till at la≈øt it was completely carried away, but not before it had cut and battered and brui≈øed me in ≈øeveral places, and in a manner that at any other time I ≈øhould have thought dreadful.</p>
               <p>Death ≈øeemed inevitable: and all that occured to me now to do, was to acclerate it, and get out of its pangs as ≈øpeedily as po≈ø≈øible; for, though I knew how to ≈øwim, the tremendous ≈øurf rendered ≈øwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming u≈øele≈øs, and all hope from it would have been rediculous. I therefore began to ≈øwallow as much water as po≈ø≈øible; yet, ≈øtill ri≈øing by the the boyant principle of the waves to the ≈øurface, my former thoughts began to recur; and whether it was that, or natural in≈øtinct, which ≈øurvived the temporary impre≈ø≈øions of de≈øpair, I know not‚Äîbut I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ≈øwim, which I had not done long, when I again di≈øcovered the log of wood I had lo≈øt float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near me, and with ≈øome difficulty caught it:

hardly had it been an in≈øtant in my hands, when, by the ≈øame unlucky means, I lo≈øt it again.

               <p>After lying in this manner, committed to the di≈øcretion of the tides, I ≈øoon ≈øaw the ve≈ø≈øel‚Äî≈øaw that it was at a con≈øiderable di≈øtance behind me. Livelie≈øt hope began to play about my heart, and joy fluttered with a thou≈øand gay fancies in my mind: I began to form the favourable conclu≈øion, that the tide was carrying me rapidly to land from the ve≈ø≈øel, and that I ≈øhould ≈øoon once more touch <hi>terra f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This expectation was a cordial that revived my exhau≈øted ≈øpirits: I took courage, and left my≈øelf ≈øtill to the ≈øame all directing Power that had hitherto pre≈øerved me, ≈øcarcely doubting that I ≈øhould ≈øoon reach the land. Nor was I mi≈øtaken; for, in a ≈øhort time more, without effort or exertion, and without once turning from off my back, I found my≈øelf ≈øtrike again≈øt the ≈øandy beach. Overjoyed, as you may well ≈øuppo≈øe, to the highe≈øt pitch of tran≈øport at my providential deliverance. I made a convul≈øive ≈øpring, and ran up a little di≈øtance on the ≈øhore; but was ≈øo weak and worn down by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and ≈øo unable to clear my ≈øtomach of the ≈øalt water with which it was loaded, that I ≈øuddenly grew deadly ≈øick, and apprehended that I had only exchanged one death for another; and in a minute or two fainted away.</p>

               <p>THAT admirable man and ≈øagacious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating philo≈øopher, Dr. FRANKLIN, has left us, among innumerable in≈øtructions for the conduct of human life, and for remedying many of the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of it, directions for going a voyage at ≈øea, and has particularly enforced the folly of quitting ≈øhips ha≈øtily, and yielding one's ≈øelf up to de≈øpair. I am convinced, that nine tenths of the people who peri≈øh by ≈øhipwreck, peri≈øh from the want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of mind, and ≈øufficient fortitude to bear them out. The unhappy pur≈øer, who ≈øat deliberately in a chair, and ≈øuffered him≈øelf, without a ≈øtruggle, to be carried overboard, is an in≈øtance in point. The feeble conduct of the captain and crew is another. Had he, in≈øtead of tearing of his hair, raving, and acting the part of a bedlamite, encouraged his men, and taken vigorous mea≈øures in time; and had they, in≈øtead of whimpering prayers on their knees, and whipping their images, made all clear, and prepared for the wor≈øt; in ≈øhort, had they, according to the moral of the old fable, put their ≈øhoulder to the wheel, in≈øtead of calling on Hercules, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible but the ve≈ø≈øel might have been ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>As for my part, the joy of e≈øcaping immediate death made me blind to the other mi≈øeries of my ≈øituation. Naked, moneyle≈øs and friendle≈øs, upon an unknown, and probably inho≈øpitable coa≈øt, what rea≈øonable cau≈øe had I to rejoice? Perhaps the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe. But that remains to be ≈øeen.</p>
               <p>How long I continued in the ≈øwoon into which I had fallen, it is impo≈ø≈øible for me to tell; but, when I recovered, I found my≈øelf ≈øurrounded by
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:033487_0288_0FF7250438459BF0"/>
a guard of armed ≈øoldiers, ≈øepoys, and pikemen. I knew them immediately to be the troops of HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER ALLI, and almo≈øt wi≈øhed my≈øelf back into the waves again. Looking round, I ≈øaw that the people and effects that had been ≈øaved from the wreck were collected all together along with me.</p>
               <p>In this ≈øtate we remained till it was dark. A La≈øcar<note n="*" place="bottom">Natives of India, employed ≈øometimes as ≈øailors, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for inferior offices in the army, ≈øuch as pitching tents, drawing guns, &amp;c.</note> belonging to the ve≈ø≈øel, perceiving that my nakedne≈øs gave me great concern, tore into two a piece of cloth which he had tied round his wai≈øt, and gave me one part of it, which afforded a ≈øhort apron. This ≈øimple act of a poor, uninformed black man, whom chri≈øtian charity would call an idolator, methought had more of the true and e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øential ≈øpirit of charity in it, than half the o≈øtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, parading new≈øpaper public charities of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don‚Äîthe ≈ølough of pur≈øe-proud vanity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy bloathed wealth. Of all the acts of beneficence that I ever met with, it ≈øtruck me the mo≈øt forcibly: it had kindne≈øs, di≈ø-intere≈øtedne≈øs and delicacy for its ba≈øis; and I have never ≈øince thought of it without wi≈øhing that I could meet the man, to reward him for his beneficence with a ≈øub≈øi≈øtence for life. The lower order of people of a certain country, I know, would think a man in ≈øuch circum≈øtances as I was then in, a fitter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of plea≈øantry than pity.</p>
               <p>The va≈øt quantity of ≈øalt water I had ≈øwallowed, ≈øtill made me deadly ≈øick in the ≈øtomach: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after ≈øome time, I threw it up, and got great relief. I had hardly felt the comfortable effects of this, before I was ordered to march: nine of us, all La≈øcars except my≈øelf, were conveyed to a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage at a few miles di≈øtance on the ≈øea-≈øide, where we were for the night put into a ≈øquare place, walled round, open to the inclemency of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:033487_0289_0FF72505C8997638"/>
above and below, and filled with large logs of wood; it blew mo≈øt violently, and the rain fell in torrents‚Äîwhile not one ≈ømooth plank could be found on which to ≈øtretch our fatigued and wa≈øted bodies. Thus, naked, ≈øick, exhau≈øted with fatigue and fa≈øting, drenched with wet, and unable to lie down, our mi≈øery might be ≈øuppo≈øed to be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of increa≈øe. But, alas! where are the bounds which we can ≈øet to human woe?‚ÄîThir≈øt, that mo≈øt dreadful of pains, occa≈øioned by the drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ≈øalt water, ≈øeized us: we begged, we entreated, we clamoured for water; but the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wretches, deaf to the groans and ≈øcreeches of their fellow-creatures, (for ≈øome grew delirious with the agony of thir≈øt), refu≈øed them even the cheap and mi≈øerable indulgence of a drop of water!</p>
               <p>The influence of the mind upon the body has been much in≈øi≈øted on by philo≈øophers and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicians, and I believe will be admitted by all wi≈øe men. I was my≈øelf in this in≈øtance, a ≈øtriking proof of it; for, though I had ≈øwallowed and thrown up ≈øo much ≈øalt water, though my thir≈øt had exceeded any thing I had ever before felt‚Äîyet, finding that water was not to be had or expected, I compo≈øed my mind to do without it, diverted my thoughts from it by the contemplation of the many other evils which be≈øet me, and pa≈ø≈øed the night without that horrible agony experienced by the others.</p>
               <p>Indeed, a night of more exqui≈øite horror cannot be imagined. The thoughts of being a pri≈øoner to HYDER ALLI, was, of it≈øelf, ≈øufficient to render me completely unhappy: but my utter want of clothes almo≈øt put me be≈øide my≈øelf; and lying expo≈øed to the open air, where I was glad to ≈øit clo≈øe to the La≈øcars to receive a little heat from their bodies, and to hold open my mouth in order to catch a drop of the de≈øcending rain, was a ≈øtate
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:033487_0290_0FF7250755090E38"/>
that might be con≈øidered as the highe≈øt refinement upon mi≈øery.</p>
               <p>About four o'clock in the morning, a little cold rice was brought us to eat, and water was dug out of a hole near the ≈øpot for us; but as all things in this life are good or bad merely relatively, this wretched fare was ≈øome refre≈øhment to us. I was then removed to the ruins of a toddy-hut,<note n="*" place="bottom">A ≈ømall temporary hut, where <hi>toddy</hi> (a liquor extracted from the cocoa-nut tree) is ≈øold.</note> ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the re≈øt, and a guard ≈øet over me. Here I had full room for reflection, and could "medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate e'en to madne≈øs." The whole of my ≈øituation appeared before me with all its aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of horror; and to any one who con≈øiders it, I believe it will appear that it was hardly po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fill the bitter cup of calamity fuller. Oh! what were my thoughts! My family bereft of him on who≈øe efforts they were in a great mea≈øure to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pend for ≈øupport and protection‚Äîyou, then a little innocent cherub, appeared to my di≈øtracted imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation twining round your mother's neck, and, in infant clamour, calling your father‚Äîwhile he, in a dreadful captivity, compared with which even a cruel death were mercy, lay wa≈øting, naked and forlorn, peri≈øhing with the inclemency of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wanting even food fit for his ≈øupport, and expo≈øed to the ≈øcourge of every petty tyrant that barbarous power might employ to guard him!‚Äî Such were my reflections: they were in rea≈øon well founded; for there was no probability of my being ever relea≈øed, as my captivity was unlikely to be known to my country, or by my friends.</p>
               <p>In this ≈øtate I was, when, to my utter a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to my no le≈øs joy, the amiable companion of my ≈øhipwreck, Mr. HALL, appeared before me. I ≈øcarcely knew how to think his appearance reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as I under≈øtood that the La≈øcars then along with
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:033487_0291_0FF7250AD5EC4A18"/>
me were all that were ≈øaved from the wreck; and he was, at the time I parted from him, ≈øo exhau≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in body and mind, that I thought he would be the la≈øt who could e≈øcape. He, however, ≈øhook me by the hand; and, fitting down, told me that he had given me up for lo≈øt, and remained with the ve≈ø≈øel until the tide, having ebbed, left her almo≈øt dry‚Äîthat, immediately on getting a≈øhore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken pri≈øoner, he made inquiries about me, and heard that I had been ≈øaved‚Äîthat, finding this, his joy was ≈øuch as to make him almo≈øt forget his own misfortunes‚Äîand, exerting all his entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to be ≈øeparated from me, they had been ≈øo far indulgent to him, and had brought him to me, that we might be companions in bondage. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ded, that out of eleven Europeans and fifty-≈øix La≈øcars who were on board, only he and I of the former, and fourteen of the latter, were ≈øaved from the wreck, the re≈øt having been drowned in the attempt, excepting ≈øome who, overcome with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, angui≈øh and anxiety, and exhau≈øted with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, had bid a formal adieu to their companions, let go their hold, and calmly and voluntarily given them≈øelves up to the deep.</p>
               <p>I here took occa≈øion to remark to him, what I have already ≈øaid to you, that thou≈øands lo≈øe their lives for want of per≈øeverance, fortitude, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to pre≈øerve them‚ÄîHad the Engli≈øh Pur≈øer collected courage enough to hold fa≈øt till the tide ebbed, he might have been ≈øafe on ≈øhore as we were, as he was ≈øuperior to either of us in bodily ≈øtrength.</p>
               <p>"Ah! my friend!" ≈øaid he, ≈øhaking his head de≈øpondingly‚Äî"is he wor≈øe where he is? I doubt whether death is not far preferable to our pre≈øent pro≈øpects."</p>
               <p>"Come, come," ≈øaid I, perceiving he was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, though I my≈øelf laboured under all the horrors he expre≈ø≈øed‚Äî"come, let us not think; all

will yet be well: I fore≈øee it will; and you mu≈øt known I have ≈øomething of the prophet in my nature‚Äîperhaps the ≈øecond ≈øight." I then told him my pre≈øentiments on leaving Goa, which much a≈øtoni≈øhed him‚Äî≈øtill more when I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the formal acts I had done in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, by Mr. HENSHAW'S advice, and with his privity.</p>
               <p>In fact, our joy at meeting was reciprocally great, and in ≈øome re≈øpect cheered us for the time under all our mi≈øeries in hand, and the dreary pro≈øpect of tho≈øe yet to come.</p>
               <p>Perceiving that he ≈øtood as much in need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as I did when the La≈øcar relieved me by divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cloth, I took mine off, tore it in two, and gave him half of it: you may well conceive our mi≈øery from this, if other circum≈øtances were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ≈øuch a thing as a rag of linen, not worth ≈øix pence, was a very material accommodation to us both.</p>

               <p>YOUR letter, occa≈øioned by the account of my ≈øhipwreck and ≈øub≈øequent di≈øa≈øter, gave me, my amiable boy! as great plea≈øure as tho≈øe di≈øa≈øters gave me pain.

but you found more happine≈øs at my e≈øcape, than mi≈øery at my misfortunes. I hail that circum≈øtance as the ≈øtronge≈øt mark of perfect excellence of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition. A great moral philo≈øopher has laid it down as a maxim, that it is the ≈øurer mark of a good heart to ≈øympathi≈øe with joy than with ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and this in≈øtance only comes in aid of that opinion of you which my fond hopes have always nouri≈øhed.</p>
               <p>At the ≈øame time I mu≈øt declare to you, that my plea≈øure at e≈øcaping ≈øhipwreck was by no means as great as the agony my mind underwent as the pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect now before me was poignant.

cheer the ≈øinking ≈øpirits of that noble youth, who, I perceived was the prey rather of extreme ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility than feeblene≈øs of mind.

               <p>At the end of that time, we, and, along with us, the La≈øcars, were ordered to proceed into the country, and drove on foot to a con≈øiderable di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in order to render up an account of our≈øelves to per≈øons belonging to government, authori≈øed to take it.

                  <pb n="297" facs="unknown:033487_0296_0FF72518DEE25770"/>Such, ≈øorry am I to ≈øay it, is the di≈øpo≈øition of ≈øome parts of the Ea≈øt Indies that I have been in; and although tho≈øe parts under the dominion of Great Britain owe their emancipation from the mo≈øt galling yokes to the Engli≈øh‚Äîand though, under their au≈øpices, they live in a ≈øtate of greater happine≈øs than ever they did, and greater freedom even than Britons them≈øelves‚Äîyet ≈øuch is the wicked ingratitude of many of them, ≈øuch the inflexible animo≈øity ari≈øing from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory religion, that the death or ≈øuffering of an Engli≈øhman, or any misfortune that may befal him, often ≈øerves only as matter of ≈øport or amu≈øement to them. It would be well if it re≈øted there‚Äî but unfortunately they are wor≈øe again; for in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they have the like coldne≈øs and indifference, or indeed, to ≈øpeak more properly, the like aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, to each others good; and the ≈øame diabolical principles of ≈øelfi≈øhne≈øs and treachery pervade the greater number in tho≈øe va≈øt regions, almo≈øt bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs in extent, and almo≈øt matchle≈øs in fertility.</p>
               <p>Two days after this, we were moved again, and marched up the country by a long and circuitious route, in which we underwent every hard≈øhip that cruelty could inflict, or human fortitude endure‚Äî now bli≈øtered with the heat, now drenched with the rain, and now chilled with the night damps ‚Äîde≈øtitute of any place but the bare earth to re≈øt or lay our heads on, with only a ≈øcanty pittance of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rice for our ≈øupport‚Äîoften without water to quench our thir≈øt, and con≈øtantly goaded by the guards, who pricked us with their bayonets every now and then, at once to evince their power, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the ≈øpectators, and mortify us. We arrived at Hydernagur, the metropolis of the province of Biddanore‚Äîa fort of con≈øidereble ≈øtrength, mounting upwards of ≈øeventy guns, containing a large garri≈øon of men, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of immen≈øe wealth.</p>

                  <pb n="298" facs="unknown:033487_0297_0FF7251F15655B20"/>It was about two o'clock in the morning when we arrived at Biddanore: the day was extremely hot, and we were kept out under the full heat of that broiling ≈øun till ≈øix o'clock in the evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were admitted to an audience of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madar, or governor of the place, without having a mouthful of victuals offered to us after the fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing march of the morning.</p>
               <p>While we ≈øtood in this forlorn ≈øtate, a va≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of people collected about, and viewed us with curio≈øity. Looking round through tho≈øe who ≈øtood neare≈øt, I ob≈øerved ≈øome men gazing at me with ≈øtrong marks of emotion, and a mixture of wonder and concern pourtrayed in their countenances. Surpri≈øed to ≈øee ≈øuch ≈øymptoms of humanity in a My≈øorian Indian, I looked at them with more ≈øcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inicing attention, and thought that their faces were familiar to me. Catching my eye, they looked at me ≈øignificantly, as though they would expre≈øs their regard and re≈øpect for me, if they dared; and I then began to recollect that they were formerly privates in my regiment of cavalry, and were then pri≈øoners at large with HYDER.</p>
               <p>I was not le≈øs ≈øurpri≈øed that tho≈øe poor fellows ≈øhould recogni≈øe me in my pre≈øent mi≈øerable fallen ≈øtate, than affected at the ≈øympathetic feeling they di≈øclo≈øed. I returned their look with a private nod of recognition; but, ≈øeeing that they were afraid to ≈øpeak to me, and fearing I might injure them by di≈øclo≈øing our acquaintance, I forbore any thing more. The guilty ≈øouls of de≈øpotic governments are perpetually alive to ≈øu≈øpicion: every look alarms them; and alarm or ≈øu≈øpicion never fails to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with pro≈øcription or death.</p>
               <p>Men, when in the fullne≈øs of power and pride of office, very ≈øeldom give them≈øelves time to reflect upon the in≈øtability of human greatne≈øs, and the uncertainty of earthly contingencies.

Did the tyrant and overbearing in≈øolent chiefs con≈øider this, and govern them≈øelves by its in≈øtructions, they would go into the field with the con≈øoling reflection, that no gun would be levelled at their head except that of the common enemy‚Äîa thing that does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happen.</p>

I had grown daily weaker and weaker, and was now nearly exhau≈øted, and quite faint; while, on the other hand, my amiable companion in affliction was reduced by a dy≈øentery, which attacked him ≈øoon after our ≈øhipwreck, and which the torments of his mind, the want of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and comfortable food, and, above all, the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate violent changes from profu≈øe per≈øpiration in walking to chilling cold at night, had increa≈øed to ≈øuch an alarming degree, that he was obliged to be carried the two la≈øt days journey:‚ÄîIn this ≈øtate, we appeared to each other as two ≈øpectres hanging over the brink of the grave: and in truth, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rapid progre≈øs he was making to his di≈ø≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was affected to a degree, that, while it really exa≈øperated my own worn-down ≈øtate, deprived me of all attention to the rapid decline I was fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, and almo≈øt entirely engro≈ø≈øed my care.

Impelled by the irre≈øi≈øtible claims he had upon my approbation and e≈øteem, I entered with all the warmth of a brother into his ≈øufferings, and can a≈ø≈øert with truth that they con≈øtituted the ≈øevere≈øt trials I underwent during my whole impri≈øonment.</p>
               <p>While we ≈øtood in the court, waiting to be brought before the Jemadar, we pre≈øented a ≈øpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that would have wrung pity, one would think, from the heart of a tiger, if a tiger was endued with reflection. At length we were ≈øummoned to appear before him, and brought into his pre≈øence.

               <p>On entering, we found the Jemadar in full Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar.<note n="*" place="bottom">Court.</note> He was then occupied with the reading of di≈øpatches, and in tran≈øacting other public bu≈øine≈øs.

He de≈øired to know, who I was?‚Äîwhat my profe≈ø≈øion was?‚Äî what was the cau≈øe and manner of my approaching the country of HYDER ALLI?‚ÄîTo all tho≈øe que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I gave an≈øwers that ≈øeemed to ≈øatisfy him.

               <p>Having exhau≈øted his whole ≈øtring of que≈øtions, he turned the di≈øcour≈øe to another ≈øubject‚Äîno le≈øs than his great and pui≈ø≈øant Lord and Ma≈øter, HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, of whom he had endeavoured to impre≈øs me with a great, if not terrible idea‚Äîamplifying his power, his wealth, and the extent and opulence of his dominions‚Äîand de≈øcribing to me, in the mo≈øt exaggerated terms, the number of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

and endeavoured to demon≈øtrate to me the folly and inutility of our attempting to re≈øi≈øt his progre≈øs, which he compared to that of the ≈øea, to a tempe≈øt, to a torrent, to a lion's pace and fury‚Äîto every thing that an Ea≈øtern imagination could ≈øugge≈øt as a figure proper to exemplify grandeur and irre≈øi≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power. He then vaunted of his Sovereign's ≈øucce≈ø≈øes over the Engli≈øh, ≈øome of which I had not heard of before, and did not believe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by a≈ø≈øuring me, that it was HYDER'S deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to drive all Europeans from Indo≈øtan, which he averred he could not fail to do, con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weakne≈øs of the one, and boundle≈øs power of the other.

               <p>After having expended near half an hour in this manner, he called upon me to come over near him, and cau≈øed me to ≈øeat my≈øelf upon a mat with a pillow to lean upon‚Äîencouraged me, by every means he could, by the mo≈øt gentle accents, and the mo≈øt ≈øoothing, mollifying language, to ≈øpeak to him without the lea≈øt re≈øerve‚Äîexhorted me to tell him the truth in every thing we ≈øpoke of‚Äîand hinted to me, that my falling into his hands might turn out the mo≈øt fortunate event of my life.</p>
               <p>I was at a lo≈øs to what motive to attribute all tho≈øe ≈øingular marks of indulgence; but found that he had learned who≈øe ≈øon I was, and knew my father by reputation from the pri≈øoners, our Sepoys, who were now pri≈øoners at large here: and as rank and office are the chief recommendation in the Ea≈øt, as well as el≈øewhere, or rather much more than any where el≈øe, the ≈øagacious HYAT SAHIB found many claims to e≈øteem and humanity in me as the ≈øon of a Colonel CAMPBELL, which he never would have found in me had I been the ≈øon of a plain humble farmer or trade≈øman in England.</p>

               <p>Leaving the Durbar, I was led to the inner fort or citadel: and the officious zeal of tho≈øe about me, unwilling to let me remain ignorant of that which they conceived to be a mo≈øt fortunate turn in my affairs, gave the <hi>coup de grace</hi> to my mi≈øeries as I went along, by congratulating me on the favourable opinion which the Jemadar had formed of me, and intimating at the ≈øame time that I would ≈øoon be honoured with a re≈øpectible command in HYDER'S ≈øervice.</p>

               <p>In addition to this luxury, we were allowed to the value of four pence halfpenny a day for our maintenance; and a guard of Sepoys was put over us and a few more pri≈øoners, one of whom was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to go and purcha≈øe our victuals, and do ≈øuch offices for us.</p>

               <p>ON the evening of that day on which the Jemadar HYAT SAHIB had honoured me with an audience, given me clothes and money, and informed me that a propo≈øal, which he called flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, would be made to me, I was ≈øent for to attend, not at the Durbar, but at the hou≈øe of a man high in office. As I expected to meet HYAT SAHIB him≈øelf, and trembled at the thoughts of his expected propo≈øition, I was ≈øurpri≈øed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed plea≈øed, to find that it was with one of his people only I was to have a conference. This man, who≈øe name I now forget, received me with great kindne≈øs, encouraged me, made me ≈øit down with him, and began to ≈øpeak of HYAT SAHIB, whom he extolled to the ≈økies, as a per≈øon endowed with every great and amiable quality; informing me at the ≈øame time, that he was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip and confidence of his ma≈øter, HYDER ALLI, in a greater degree than any other per≈øon‚ÄîTIPPOO SAHIB, his own ≈øon, not excepted: he then gave me the private hi≈øtory of HYAT‚Äî≈øaying, that he was born a Gentoo prince, of one of the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Malabar coa≈øt, which had fallen beneath the irre≈øi≈øtible arms of HYDER, and had been by him annexed to the va≈øt My≈øorean Empire. HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AT, he ≈øaid, was then only a boy of eleven or twelve years of age, of a mo≈øt promi≈øing genius, and a quickne≈øs of mind unu≈øually met with in
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:033487_0307_0FF7253A9995AAD8"/>
one of tho≈øe tender years. HYDER, who was in all re≈øpects a man of unrivalled penetration, thought he ≈øaw in the boy that which, if properly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, would turn out of va≈øt u≈øe to a ≈øtate; and as, in all Mahomedan governments, unconnected, i≈øolated boys, oft-times ≈ølaves, are bred up in the ≈øeraglio to ≈øucceed to the great offices of the ≈øtate, HYDER adopted the boy, had him made a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and, in fact, treated him as if he had been the i≈ø≈øue of his own loins, and brought him up with all the affection and tenderne≈øs of a fond parent. I am the more particular in ≈øtating this part of HYAT'S hi≈øtory to you, as ≈øome re≈øpectable hi≈øtorians, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by erroneous report, have ≈øaid that he was the illegitimate offspring of HYDER. The ≈øultan, however, was not di≈øappointed in the expectations he had formed; for HYAT SAHIB had, in zeal, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and attachment, as well as in intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and talents for governing, even ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed the warme≈øt hopes of his ma≈øter.</p>
               <p>Having given me this conci≈øe account of the Jemadar, he proceeded to inform me, that the Arcot Sepoys, whom I have before mentioned to you, had di≈øcovered to HYAT SAHIB who I was, given him a full account of my family, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that I had commanded a regiment of cavalry in the ≈øervice of the Nabob of Arcot, together with a corps of infantry and artillery attached to it. In con≈øequence of this report, HYAT SAHIB, he ≈øaid, had intere≈øted him≈øelf very warmly in my favour, and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pe≈ø≈øed an anxious de≈øire to render me a ≈øervice.</p>
               <p>Thus far the di≈øcour≈øe plea≈øed me. Nothing was ≈øaid in it to give me alarm; on the contrary. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged a hope, that, knowing my rank, and the rank of my father, he would no longer entertain a hope of my entering into the ≈øervice of HYDER, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ble indulgence. But I flattered my≈øelf too ≈øoon; or, as the old ≈øaying is, "reckoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my ho≈øt."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="unknown:033487_0308_0FF7253D6D82F0A0"/>When he had fini≈øhed his hi≈øtory of HYAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIB, which he overcharged with ful≈øome panegyric, he told me, with a face full of that triumphant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which one who thinks he is conferring a great favour generally a≈ø≈øumes, that it was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of HYAT SAHIB, for and on behalf of his ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sultan, to give me the command of five thou≈øand men‚Äîan offer which he ≈øuppo≈øed I could not think of declining, and therefore expected no other an≈øwer but a profu≈øion of thanks, and ≈øtrong manife≈øtations of joy on my part.</p>
               <p>It is not po≈ø≈øible for me to de≈øcribe to you my di≈ømay at this formal propo≈øal, or pourtray to you the various emotions that took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of my brea≈øt. Re≈øentment had its ≈øhare‚Äîthe pride of the ≈øoldier, not unaccompanied with the pride of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rank, while it urged me to ≈øpurn from me ≈øuch a ba≈øe accommodation, made me con≈øider the offer as a great in≈øult. I therefore pau≈øed a little, to ≈øuppre≈øs my feelings; and then told him my firm re≈øolution, never to accept of ≈øuch a propo≈øal; and upon his expre≈ø≈øing great a≈øtoni≈øhment of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining a ≈øtation ≈øo fraught with advantage, I laid down, in the be≈øt manner I could, my rea≈øons; and I mu≈øt ≈øay, that he li≈øtened to all the objections I ≈øtarted with great patience; but, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, ≈øaid he had little doubt of finding means to overcome my reluctance.</p>
               <p>He di≈ømi≈ø≈øed me for the pre≈øent, and I returned to my pri≈øon, where I related to my companion, Mr. HALL, every thing that pa≈ø≈øed between us: we canva≈ø≈øed the matter fully, and he agreed with me, that it was likely to turn out a mo≈øt dreadful and cruel per≈øecution. It was on this occa≈øion that I fir≈øt felt the truth of the principle, that per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never fails to be ≈øubver≈øive of its own end, and to promote that which it is intended to de≈øtroy. There is, in the human mind, an innite abhorrence of compul≈øion; and per≈øecution always gives new

≈øtrength and ela≈øticity to the ≈øoul: and at la≈øt, when ≈øtrained to its utmo≈øt extent, makes man ≈øurmount difficulties which at fir≈øt ≈øeem to be beyond the reach of humanity.</p>
               <p>Piqued by the idea of per≈øecution, I began to feel a degree of enthu≈øia≈øm which I was before a ≈øtranger to: I looked forward, with a kind of gloomy plea≈øure, to the mi≈øeries that brutal tyranny might inflict upon me, even to death it≈øelf; and already began to indulge the exultation of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom "No," ≈øaid I, "my dear HALL! never will I tarni≈øh the character of a Briti≈øh ≈øoldier‚Äînever will I di≈øgrace my blood or my profe≈ø≈øion‚Äînever ≈øhall an act of mine fully the pure fame of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered father‚Äînever ≈øhall any ≈øufferings of mine, however poignant, or worldly advantage, however ≈øeductive, tempt me to do that which his noble ≈øpirit would regard with horror or contempt. I may, and I fore≈øee I mu≈øt be mi≈øerable; but I never will be ba≈øe or degenerate!" Indeed, I had wrought my≈øelf up to ≈øuch a pitch of firmne≈øs, that I am per≈øuaded the mo≈øt exqui≈øite and refined cruelties which the ingenuity of an Iroquois Indian could have inflicted on my body, would have been utterly incapable of bending the ≈øtubborn temper of my mind.</p>
               <p>The place in which we were lodged was ≈øituated in a way not very favourable to our feelings. Ju≈øt within ≈øight of it, the commandant of the citadel held a court‚Äîby him yclep'd a court of ju≈øtice‚Äî where the mo≈øt ≈øhocking, barbarious cruelties were hourly exerci≈øed‚Äîmo≈øt of them for the purpo≈øe of extorting money, and compelling the di≈øcovery of hidden, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Indeed, five ≈øixths of tho≈øe who ≈øuffered were of this de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription; and the proce≈øs per≈øued was as artful as barbarious: they fir≈øt began with care≈ø≈øes, then proceeded to examination and cro≈ø≈ø-examination, thence to threats, thence to puni≈øhment, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the mo≈øt cruel tortures.</p>

               <p>Mr. HALL, notwith≈øtanding the various ≈øufferings both of mind and body which he had undergone, began to recruit, and get a little better; and this circum≈øtance, of it≈øelf, diffu≈øed a flow of ≈øpirits over me that contributed to my ≈øupport.

mu≈øt therefore content your≈øelf to be told in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, that I was repeatedly urged on the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by fair per≈øua≈øives: they then had recour≈øe to menace; then they withheld the daily pittance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for my ≈øupport; and at length proceeded to coercion, tying a rope round my neck, and hoi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me up to a tree. All this, however, I bore firmly: if it had any effect, it was to confirm me in my re≈øolution, and call in policy to the aid of honour's dictates. Every man of feeling or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon mu≈øt allow, that it was better to die, than live a life of ≈øubjection to tyranny ≈øo truly diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</p>
               <p>Mr. HALL and I, thus drove to the brink of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, yet con≈øoled our≈øelves with the reflection, that tho≈øe whom mo≈øt we loved were not ≈øharing our unhappy fate, and were fortunately ignorant of our ≈øufferings; and as I enjoyed perfect good health, hope yet lived within me.</p>
               <p>There is a ≈øpring, an ela≈øticity, in every man's mind, of which the owner is rarely, very rarely con≈øcious, becau≈øe fortunately the occa≈øions ≈øeldom occur in which it can be brought to the proof, for, as la≈ø≈øitude is the nece≈ø≈øary forerunner of refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ≈øo is extreme dejection to the mo≈øt vigorous exerei≈øe of our fortitude. So I found it: as the horrors of my ≈øituation thickened round me, I felt my ≈øpirits increa≈øe; my re≈øolution became more firm, my hopes more ≈øanguine‚ÄîI even began to look forward, and form projects for the future: whole hours amu≈øement, every day and every night, aro≈øe from the contemplation of my beloved boy; I in imagination traced his growth, directed his ri≈øing ≈øentiments, formed plans for his future ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs and pro≈øperity, and indulged by anticipation in all the enjoyment which I now tru≈øt I ≈øhall yet have in his ripened manhood.</p>
               <p>Thus we continued for many months, during which no alteration what≈øoever took place in our

treatment or ≈øituation. We heard a thou≈øand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory reports of victories gained over the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh, and again of ≈øome ≈øucce≈ø≈øes on their part: they, however, de≈øi≈øted to pre≈øs me into then ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The only relief from our ≈øufferings lay in the re≈øources of our own minds, and in our mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours to plea≈øe and con≈øole one another: the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances of aggravation were the nece≈ø≈øity of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bearing witne≈øs to the mo≈øt barbarous puni≈øhments he inflicted upon wretched individuals under the ≈øemblance of ju≈øtice, and the occa≈øional depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our food, either by the fraud of the ≈øepoys who attended us, or the caprice or cruelty of their ≈øuperiors. It is but ju≈øtice, however, to ≈øay, that they were not all alike: ≈øome overflowed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, charity, and the milk of human kindne≈øs; while others, again, were almo≈øt as bad men as the ≈øovereigns they ≈øerved. We were not allowed the u≈øe of pen, ink, or paper; and very ≈øeldom could afford our≈øelves the luxury of ≈øhaving, or clean lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: nor were we at all ≈øheltered from the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the weather, till at length a little room was built for us of mud, which being ≈ømall and damp, rendered our ≈øituation wor≈øe than it was before.</p>
               <p>The pri≈øoner whom I have already mentioned, as having, in the time of the former ≈øovereign, held the fir≈øt office in Bidanore, ≈øtill continued op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite to me; and he and I at length began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand each other, and found means, by looks, ≈øigns and ge≈øtures, to exchange thoughts, and hold an intercour≈øe of ≈øentiments together. From the circum≈øtance of his being a native, and better ≈økil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the language than me, he had much better intelligence than I could po≈ø≈øibly have, and he was always eager to convey to me any circum≈øtance or news that he thought might be agreeable: ≈øome me≈ø≈øages al≈øo pa≈ø≈øed between us, by means of the ≈øepoys who had alternately been his guard and mine ‚Äîfor our guards were changed every week.</p>

                  <pb n="323" facs="unknown:033487_0322_0FF72562AEDCD380"/>Projects and hopes of a new kind now began to intrude them≈øelves on my thoughts; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a de≈øign, which I flattered my≈øelf was not entirely impracticable to effect an e≈øcape, and even a revolt in the place. A variety of circum≈øtances concurred to per≈øuade me, that the tyranny of HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, and his ≈øervant HYAT SAHIB, was abhorred, though none dared to give vent to their ≈øentiments. I thought I could ob≈øerve, that the native pri≈øoner oppo≈øite to me was privately beloved, and might, from the recollection of his former dignities, have con≈øiderable influence in the place. Several Arcot ≈øepoys and their officers (≈øome of them belonging to my own regiment) were al≈øo pri≈øoners at large; and withal I recollected, that difficulties apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ≈øtupendous had been overcome by Engli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men‚Äîhaving often heard it a≈ø≈øerted, that there was not a pri≈øon in the known world out of which a Briti≈øh ≈øubject had not made his e≈øcape.</p>
               <p>Fraught with tho≈øe conceptions, I attempted to ≈øound the officers of the Arcot Sepoys, whether it were not po≈ø≈øible for us to effect our e≈øcape? So ardent is the flame of liberty in all men's brea≈øts, ≈øo great is the dete≈øtation of human nature to ≈ølavery, that I perceived a manife≈øt willingne≈øs in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about us to join me in an attempt to procure our liberty, or bring about a revolt in the garri≈øon. My heart beat high with the hope; and I began to flatter my≈øelf, that, the day was not far removed when we ≈øhould not only bid defiance to our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, but even make them repent the day on which we were ca≈øt a≈øhore on their coa≈øt.</p>
               <p>Having thus di≈øtantly ≈øounded all who I thought were likely to concur, upon the practicability of the attempt, and found them, as I conceived, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to take ≈øhare in it, it yet remained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider of the <hi>quomodo</hi>‚Äîand, after having formed the general outlines of a plan, to lick it into ≈øhape. The fir≈øt of the≈øe was a critical con≈øideration: the
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:033487_0323_0FF7256441D56028"/>
≈øecond required addre≈øs and management, and was likely to be impeded by the vigilance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about, who would not fail to remark, and take the alarm, from any unu≈øual intercour≈øe or di≈øcour≈øe between us; and without a mutual communication of thoughts, and full deliberation by all parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as well as knowledge of the fort and its different gates, nothing could, with any pro≈øpect of ≈øucce≈øs, be determined‚Äînothing, without the mo≈øt imminent hazard, be attempted.

               <p>At la≈øt I began to think of ≈øounding the Bida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore pri≈øoner, <hi>ci-devant</hi> governor of the place; and determined, if po≈ø≈øible, to bring him into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øultations, as I had before hoped to make him a party in the execution of the project: but while I was ≈øettling all this much to my own ≈øatisfaction, an event occured which extingui≈øhed all my hopes in that way‚Äîof which you ≈øhall have an account in my next letter.</p>

               <p>Unfortunately, poor Mr. HALL had for ≈øome time been afflicted with a return of his dreadful di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the dy≈øentery; and our being ≈øhackled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether increa≈øed an unconquerable mortification of feelings which we had before undergone, from a delicacy of nature that would have done honour to the mo≈øt mode≈øt virgin, be her ≈øen≈øibility ever ≈øo exqui≈øite, or her delicacy ever ≈øo extreme‚ÄîAnd here, my dear FREDERICK!

Engli≈øh army having made a de≈øcent on the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar coa≈øt: and ≈øo powerful is the influence of mind on the animal ≈øy≈øtem, that Mr. HALL enjoyed from the report a momentary alleviation of his malady; but, having no medical a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, nor even ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ≈øu≈øtenance to further the favourable operations of nature, he relap≈øed again; the di≈øea≈øe fell upon him with redoubled fury: a very ≈øcanty portion of boiled rice, with a more ≈øcanty mor≈øel of ≈øtinking ≈øalt fi≈øh or putrid fle≈øh, was a very inadequate ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for me, who, though emaciated, was in health ‚Äîand very improper medicine for a per≈øon labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a malady ≈øuch as Mr. HALL'S, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired comfort, good medical ≈økill, and delicate nutritious food. The tea which HYAT SAHIB had given me was expended; and we were not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ≈øhaved from the hour we were put in irons, an indulgence of that kind being forbidden by the barbarous rules of the pri≈øon: and, to refine upon our tortures ≈øleep, "the balm of hurt minds," was not allowed us uninterrupted; for, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to another regulation, we were di≈øturbed every half hour by a noi≈øe ≈øomething re≈øembling a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's rattle, and a fellow who, ≈øtriking every part of our irons with a kind of hammer, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them le≈øt they ≈øhould be cut, broke in upon that kind re≈øtorative, and awoke our ≈øouls to fre≈øh horrors.</p>
               <p>As it mu≈øt be much more naturally matter of a≈øtoni≈øhment that any bodily ≈øtrength could ≈øupport it≈øelf under ≈øuch complicated calamities, than that infirmity ≈øhould ≈øink beneath them, you will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grieved than ≈øurpri≈øed to hear that poor Mr. HALL was now app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every application that I made in his favour was refu≈øed, or rather treated with cruel neglect and contemptuous ≈øilence; and I fore≈øaw, with inexpre≈ø≈øible angui≈øh and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the barbarians would not abate him in his

la≈øt minutes one jot of mi≈øery, and that my mo≈øt amiable friend was fated to expire under every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant horror that mere ≈øublunary circum≈øtances could create. But that pity which the mighty, the powerful and enlightened denied, natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence operating upon an uninformed mind, and ≈øcanty means, afforded us. HYAT SAHIB, the powerful, the wealthy, the governor of a great opulent province, refu≈øed to an expiring fellow-creature a little cheap relief‚Äîwhile a poor ≈øepoy taxed his little means to ≈øupply it: one who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, of his own accord, at hazard of imminent puni≈øhment, purched us a lamp and a little oil, which we burned for the la≈øt few nights.</p>
               <p>Philo≈øophers and divines have declaimed upon the advantages of a well-≈øpent life, as felt <hi>in arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo mortis;</hi> and their efforts have had, I hope, ≈øome effect upon the lives of many. To witne≈øs one example ≈øuch as Mr. HALL held forth, would be worth volumes of precepts on this ≈øubject. The unfeigned re≈øignation with which he met his di≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and the maje≈øtic fortitude with which he looked in the face the various circum≈øtances of horror that ≈øurrounded him, rendered him the mo≈øt dignified object I ever beheld or conceived, and the mo≈øt glorious in≈øtance of con≈øcious virtue tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over the terrors of death, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning barbarity of mankind. Were the progre≈øs of virtue attended with pain, and the practice of vice with plea≈øure, the adoption of the former would be amply repaid by its ≈øoothings in the dreadful moment, even if it were to accompany us no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. About a quarter of an hour before he died, Mr. HALL broached a mo≈øt tender ≈øubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation, which he followed up with a ≈øeries of ob≈øervations, ≈øo truly refined, ≈øo exqui≈øitely turned, ≈øo delicate and ≈øo pathetic, that it ≈øeemed almo≈øt the language of in≈øpiration, as if, in proportion to the decay of the body, intellect increa≈øed, and the

dying man had become all mind. Such a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation I never remembered to have heard, or heard of. Its effects upon me were wonderful; for, though the combination of melancholy circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending my now critical ≈øituation had almo≈øt rai≈øed my mind to frenzy, the ≈øalutary influence of his words and example controuled the exce≈ø≈øes of my ≈øen≈øations; and I met the afflicting moment of his departure with a degree of tranquility, which, though not to be compared to his, has on reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared to me a≈øtoni≈øhing. This conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued to the very in≈øtant of his death; during which time he held my hand cla≈øped in his, frequently enforcing his kind expre≈ø≈øions to me with a ≈øqueeze‚Äîwhile my ≈øorrow, taking its mo≈øt ea≈øy channel, bedewed my face with tears.

               <p>FOR ≈øome time I was lo≈øt in grief for the death of Mr. HALL. Though I had long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and might con≈øequently be ≈øuppo≈øed to have wa≈øted great part of my ≈øorrow in anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet, having only con≈øidered and felt the point before his death merely as it re≈øpected him and his misfortunes, a great portion of the calamity yet remained unconceived: and, now that he was dead, I began for the fir≈øt time to con≈øider and feel the ≈øubject as it concerned my≈øelf. Reflection told me, that he was happily relieved from woe, and in a ≈øtate of bli≈øs‚Äî

                  <pb n="330" facs="unknown:033487_0329_0FF725756AA08D48"/>But I ≈øtill remained a prey to perhaps new bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities, without hope of relief from the old. No partner to ≈øhare, no ≈øocial conver≈øe to alleviate, no friend to con≈øole me under my afflictions, I looked at the body of my friend with envy, and lamented that death had not afforded me, too, a ≈øhelter from the cruelties which fate ≈øeemed determined to heap upon me.</p>
               <p>It is impo≈ø≈øible for me to expre≈øs to you the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of mind I underwent during the re≈øt of the night. In the morning a report was made to the commandant, of the death of Mr. HALL; and in about an hour after, he pa≈ø≈øed me by, but kept his face purpo≈øely turned away from me to the other ≈øide. I patiently waited for the removal of the dead body till the evening, when I de≈øired the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poys who guarded me to apply for its being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They returned, and told me that they could get no an≈øwer re≈øpecting it. Night came on, but there was no appearance of an intention to unfetter me from the corp≈øe. The commandant was ≈øitting in his court, admini≈øtering, in the manner I have before de≈øcribed, <hi>ju≈øtice!</hi> I called out to him my≈øelf with all my might, but could get no an≈øwer from him. Nothing could equal my rage and con≈øterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, exclu≈øive of the painful idea of being ≈øhackled to the dead body of a friend I loved, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other circum≈øtance contributed to make it a ≈øerious ≈øubject of horror. In tho≈øe ciimates the weather is ≈øo inten≈øely hot, that putrefaction almo≈øt in≈øtantly ≈øucceeds death, and meat that is killed in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and kept in the ≈øhade, will be unfit for dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing at night. In a ≈øubject, then, on which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction had made advances even before death, and which remained expo≈øed to the open air, the proce≈øs mu≈øt have been much more rapid. So far, however, from compa≈ø≈øionating my ≈øituation, or indulging me by a removal of the body, their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ≈øugge≈øted to them to make it an in≈øtrument of
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:033487_0330_0FF72577FAF6CD88"/>
puni≈øhment; and they pertinaciou≈øly adhered to the mo≈øt mortifying ≈øilence and di≈øregard of my complaints. For ≈øeveral days and nights it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attached to me by the irons. I grew almo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted‚Äîwi≈øhed for the means of putting an end to my mi≈øeries by death, and could not move without witne≈ø≈øing ≈øome new ≈øtage of putre≈øcence it attained, or breathe without inhaling the putrid effluvia that aro≈øe from it‚Äîwhile myriads of flies and loath≈øome in≈øects re≈øted on it, the former of which every now and then vi≈øited me, crawling over my face and hands, and lighting in hundreds on my victuals. I never look back at this cri≈øis without confu≈øion, horror, and even a≈øtoni≈øhment; and, were it not connected with a chain of events preceding and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequent to it, too well known by re≈øpectable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be doubted, and too much interwoven with a part of the hi≈øtory of the la≈øt war in India to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a doubt, I ≈øhould not only be afraid to tell, but ab≈øolutely doubt my≈øelf whether the whole was not the illu≈øion of a dream, rather than credit the po≈ø≈øibility of my enduring ≈øuch unheard of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips without lo≈øs of life or deprivation of ≈øen≈øes.</p>
               <p>At la≈øt, when the body had reached that ≈øhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath≈øome ≈øtate of putrefaction which threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that further delay would render removal abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if not impo≈ø≈øible, the mon≈øters agreed to take it away from me‚Äîand I was ≈øo far relieved: but the mortification and injury I underwent from it, joined to the agitation of the preceding week, made a vi≈øible inroad on my health. I totally lo≈øt my ≈øpirits; my appetite entirely for≈øook me: my long-nouri≈øhed hopes fled; and I looked forward to death as the only de≈øirable event that was within the verge of likelihood or po≈ø≈øibility.</p>
               <p>One day, my oppo≈øite friend (the native pri≈øoner) gave me a look of the mo≈øt intere≈øting and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging kind; and I perceived a more than u≈øual bu≈øtle in the citadel, while the ≈øepoys informed

me that they were ordered on immediate ≈øervice, and that ≈øome events of great importance had taken place. From this feeble gleam, my mind, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally active, though depre≈ø≈øed by circum≈øtances of unu≈øual weight, again took fire, and hope bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with a kind of gloomy light the pro≈øpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me: I revolved a thou≈øand things, and drew from them a thou≈øand ≈øurmi≈øes; but all as yet was only conjecture with me. In a day or two, the bu≈øtle increa≈øed to a high pitch, accompanied with marks of con≈øternation: the whole of the troops in the citadel were ordered to march; and the commandant, and a man with a hammar and in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, came to take off my irons.</p>
               <p>While they were at work taking off my irons, I perceived they were taking off tho≈øe of the native pri≈øoner oppo≈øite to me al≈øo. He went away under a guard: we looked at each other complacently, nodded and ≈ømiled, as who ≈øhould ≈øay, "we hope to ≈øee one another in happier times not far di≈øtant." But, alas! vain are human hopes, and ≈øhort and dark is the extent of our utmo≈øt fore≈øight!

               <p>In order to elucidate the whole of this bu≈øine≈øs, it is nece≈ø≈øary for me to recur to events which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened antecedent to this time, but of which, by rea≈øon of my ≈øituation, I was then entirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and as they involve, not only the grounds of my ≈øub≈øequent e≈øcape and proceedings, but a con≈øiderable portion of hi≈øtorical fact, and ≈øome of the material intere≈øts of the Ea≈øt India Company,

               <p>HYDER ALLI KHAWN, late Nabob of My≈øore, and father to the pre≈øent TIPPO SAHIB SULTAIN, was as extraordinary a man, and perhaps po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed as great natural talents, as any recorded in the page of hi≈øtory. Born and bred up in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ranks of an unenlightened and ignorant people, and to the la≈øt day of his life perfectly illiterate, he not only emerged from his native ob≈øcurity by the vigor of his mind and body, but became an object of terror and admiration to ≈øurrounding potentates. Early initiated in the habits and inured to the toils of a military life, he ro≈øe, by the gradual ≈øteps of promotion, to a rank which afforded an opportunity of di≈øplaying his capacity and prowe≈øs: he ≈øoon obtained the command of that army in which he had once ≈øerved as a common ≈øoldier, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately demon≈øtrated that the ≈øublimity of his mind was formed to keep pace with his extraordinary elevation.</p>
               <p>The Marhattas, the mo≈øt formidable people in Hither India, bordered on the My≈øorean domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and kept their neighbours, by frequent ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, in a continual ≈øtate of awe‚Äîmaking incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions on their territories, and taking po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, by force of arms, of large portions of their country: but no ≈øooner had HYDER got the command of the armies of his country, than he drove back the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hattas
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:033487_0333_0FF725827648B698"/>
from the My≈øorean dominions, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by con≈øiderable acqui≈øitions from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatta frontiers; and followed up his conque≈øts with ≈øuch ≈øucce≈øsful ardour, that he compelled that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nation to re≈øpect his countrymen as their equals, if not ≈øuperiors, in military achievement. Thus, while he ingratiated him≈øelf with his ≈øovereign and fellow-citizens by his wi≈ødom, he acquired the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the ≈øoldiery by his per≈øonal addre≈øs and valour; and at the ≈øame time, by the ≈øeverity of his decipline, and the occa≈øional au≈øterity of his deportmet, maintained an awe over them, which ≈øtrengthened his authority with dimini≈øhing their affection.</p>
               <p>HYDER was therefore now arrived at that point of elevation, beyond which no exertion of mental capacity, if governed by virtue or integrity, could rai≈øe him‚ÄîSo far he owed all to guenius: but his towering ambition looked higher; and, unre≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any principle of religion or morality, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to accompli≈øh, at any rate, that which he knew nothing but crime could accompli≈øh. With wicked deliberation he looked forward into the womb of time, and with unparalleled policy arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the whole ≈øy≈øtem upon which he was to act, when that order of things his penetrating and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive genius enabled him to ≈øee would naturally ari≈øe from each other, ≈øhould afford him a proper opportunity. Although he was utterly ignorant of books, and of cour≈øe could derive little benefit from the examples of the great and ambitious men recorded in hi≈øtory, yet, drawing upon the infinite re≈øources of his own mind for information, he adopted the very ≈øame means of furthering his views; and fore≈øeeing, that, with an immen≈øe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my devoted to his intere≈øts, few things would be unattainable, he applied him≈øelf diligently to model and form that of the KING of MYSORE to the greate≈øt perfection in di≈øcipline, and to render it

attached to his per≈øon, and ≈øub≈øervient to his views, by a ≈økilful mixture of ≈øeverity and relaxation, toil and reward, danger and applau≈øe, which none but a ma≈øter-hand like his was capable of exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding.</p>
               <p>The death of his ≈øovereign the KING of MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORE at length afforded him the opportunity to which he had ≈øo long, and with ≈øo prophetic an eye, looked forward‚Äîand gave him ample room for ≈øelf gratulation on the ≈øcore of his ≈øagacity and prudence.</p>
               <p>The heir in ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to the throne being then an infant, the politic HYDER, ≈øetting a≈øide all claims of the kindred of the young prince, took upon him≈øelf the guardian≈øhip‚Äîunder the title of Regent a≈ø≈øumed the ≈øupreme authority‚Äîand, though too well aware of the inviolable attachment of the people to their lawful monarch to put him directly to death, u≈øurped the throne, and con≈øigned him to impri≈øonment in Seringapatam, the capital of the My≈øorean dominions.</p>
               <p>Having thus, by his talents, acquired the po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the throne, he gave a large range to the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of his views, and ≈øoon di≈øplayed the exhau≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs re≈øources of his mind in the new office of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Legi≈ølator‚Äîforming ≈øuch va≈øt well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered military e≈øtabli≈øhments, and ≈øuch judicious and ≈øalutary civil in≈øtitutions, as made him blaze forth at once the terror of his neighbours, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, in the ≈øequel, the mo≈øt powerful and formidable potentate in the Hither Penin≈øula. In carrying on tho≈øe, his deficiency in letters was ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by his vigilance and ≈øagacity, ≈øharpened by ≈øu≈øpicion: three ≈øecretaries executed all his orders in ≈øeparate apartments: and if, on compari≈øon, they were found to differ, he who committed the error received ≈øentence of death. His natural cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty made him take the execution of their ≈øentence upon him≈øelf not unfrequently: to ≈ølice off a

               <p>The natural ≈øagacity of this great man ≈øugge≈øted, that in order to accompli≈øh the exten≈øive objects which his active and ambitious temper held up to his imagination, the introduction of the mo≈øt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect military di≈øcipline was above all other things nece≈ø≈øary; and his judgment informed him that the European was the be≈øt. He therefore held out the mo≈øt tempting allurements to military adventures, and particularly to tho≈øe, whether black or white, who had been trained in the ≈øervice of the Engli≈øh Ea≈øt India company: he ≈øent emi≈ø≈øaries, for the purpo≈øe, to all parts of India, with in≈øtructions to offer great rewards; and carried this de≈øign ≈øo far, that whenever accident or war threw per≈øons of that de≈øcription into his hands, he never failed to detain them, and, if they refu≈øed to enter into his ≈øervice, treat them with the mo≈øt unpardonable rigour and barbarity; and by the≈øe means brought his army to a ≈øtate of perfection till then unknown to a black power.

               <p>An ambitious and profligate chief of the Marhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Tribes‚Äîhis name RAGANAUT ROW‚Äîhad been depo≈øed by the wi≈øe men of his country, for having murdered his nephew, in order to u≈øurp the throne of Setterah. He fled to Bombay, and, by ≈øpecious promi≈øes and other means, prevailed on that Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to afford him an a≈øylum, and finally to take up arms in his defence again≈øt the united Marhatta States, who at the very time were able to rai≈øe an army of three hundred thou≈øand fighting men. Ho≈øtilities were fir≈øt commenced by the Engli≈øh; and by them peace was fir≈øt propo≈øed. The treaty of Poonah was made, by which it was provided that RAGANAUT ROW would quit Bombay; and by the Engli≈øh the provi≈øions of that treaty were broken‚Äîfor, in direct violation of it RAGANAUT was kept at Bombay. This breach of the treaty led to another; for this crafty and unprincipled chief made u≈øe of it with ≈øuch addre≈øs as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuade that Pre≈øidency to attack the Marhattas again: ‚Äîby magnifying the power of his party among his countrymen, he prevailed upon them once more

to a≈ø≈øert his rights; and the Pre≈øidency of Calcutta, I am afraid, were induced to join that of Bombay in the plan.</p>
               <p>It happened unfortunately, that at this time the Pre≈øidency of Bombay was compo≈øed of per≈øons the mo≈øt unqualified, probably, that could be found in any community for offices of ≈øuch importance. One, particularly, was allowed, by the almo≈øt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous con≈øent of tho≈øe who knew his private or public character, to be ignorant, not only of the fir≈øt principles of government, but of the ordinary knowledge requi≈øite for a gentleman; and for ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of moment he was peculiarly di≈øqualified by a fondne≈øs for minutiae, to which he paid more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention than to matters of greater con≈øequence. A temper and intellect of this kind were rendered ≈øtill more incapable of the enlarged views any Repre≈øentative of a great Nation in a di≈øtant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øhould po≈ø≈øe≈øs, by a mercantile education and habits, which narrowed even his circum≈øcribed mind, and left him not a ≈øentiment, not an idea, that was not merely commercial.

               <p>THE approach of the Briti≈øh troops with RAGANAUT cau≈øed great alarm at Poonah; and the mini≈øters there ≈øent to offer terms, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuou≈øly rejected.

               <p>Every thing ≈øeemed to con≈øpire to cha≈øti≈øe the ra≈øhne≈øs and folly of our Indian councils.

               <p>Thus, by the depraved politics of the councils of a petty ≈øettlement, were the important intere≈øts of Great Britain in India, and the lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of all its ≈øervants in that quarter, at once expo≈øed to the fury of three formidable ho≈øtile powers‚Äîthe Marhattas, HYDER and the French.</p>

               <p>In order to relieve the Carnatic, which was ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under the ravages of a formidable victorious army, who had not only cut off a great part of our forces on that coa≈øt, but affronted our army even at the walls of Fort St. George, de≈øcents upon the coa≈øts of Malabar were planned, in order to make a diver≈øion: and General MATHEWS, in January 1783, landed with a ≈ømall army under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, at a place called Rajamondroog‚Äîtook Onore, and ≈øeveral forts: and being joined by other troops, which, under the command of Colonel HUMBERT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, had done con≈øiderable ≈øervice to the ≈øouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and were now commanded by Colonel MAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEOD, marched from Cundapore, with an army con≈øi≈øting of twelve hundred Europeans and eight battalions of Sepoys, towards Huff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="343" facs="unknown:033487_0342_0FF7259D62D54838"/>
of the extraordinary revolution that ≈øo ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly took place in the fort, which I ≈øtated to you in my la≈øt letter but one‚ÄîYou will therefore look back to the conclu≈øion of that letter, from whence I again take up my narrative.</p>
               <p>I was utterly at a lo≈øs to conjecture what this ≈øo ≈øudden re≈øolution to relea≈øe me and my oppo≈øite fellow-pri≈øoner meant. I endeavoured to get ≈øome explanation of it from the per≈øons about me; but all I could at the time collect was, that the Jema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar had directed me to be taken out of irons, and ordered me to appear before him. I walked out of the citadel with two or three men who had got charge of me: it was a delightful afternoon; and my ≈øen≈øations on once more vi≈øiting the open air‚Äî at again viewing the va≈øt expan≈øe of the firmament above, and the profu≈øion of beauties with which nature embelli≈øhed the earth beneath‚Äîwere too bli≈øsful, too ≈øublime for de≈øcription. My heart beat with involuntary tran≈øports of gratitude to that Being from which all ≈øprung; and I felt that man is, in his nature, even without the intervention of his rea≈øon, a being of devotion. For an hour of ≈øuch delight as I then experienced, a year of impri≈øonment was, I thought, hardly too dear a price. Tho≈øe exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øations in≈øen≈øibly led my heart to the mo≈øt flattering pre≈øages; the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ≈øpirit appeared to have, in corre≈øpondence with the body, ≈øhaken off a load of chains; and as I walked along, I ≈øeemed to tread on air.</p>
               <p>As we proceeded forward, we found, at ≈øome di≈øtance from the fort, an open dooly, into which the guards forcibly crammed me; and I was carried off, ≈øtill attended by the ≈øame men. As we went along, they gave me to under≈øtand that HYAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIB, the Jemadar, was at a place ten or a dozen miles di≈øtant from Bidanore. I thought it within my≈øelf a mo≈øt extraordinary circum≈øtance, and was at a lo≈øs to conjecture for what purpo≈øe he required
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:033487_0343_0FF7259EF10915D8"/>
my pre≈øence there. Perhaps, thought I, it is to deliver me per≈øonally into the hands of TIPPOO‚Äî perhaps to ≈øend me to Seringapatam. Su≈øpence whetted my curio≈øity; and impatience to know my fate, ≈øet my mind afloat upon a wide ≈øea of conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Still, however, my ≈øen≈øes acknowledged a degree of plea≈øure inde≈øcribable‚ÄîI inhaled the fre≈øh air with greedine≈øs, and, as I ≈ønuffed it in, ≈øaid to my≈øelf, "Well, well‚Äîat the wor≈øt, this will enliven my ≈øpirits, and lay up a new ≈øtock of health and vigour, to enable me to endure with manhood whatever other ≈øufferings the barbarians, into who≈øe hands I have fallen, may have in ≈øtore for me."</p>
               <p>When we had got about a mile from the fort, we met a per≈øon attended by three others, all on hor≈øeback. He was a man of con≈øiderable rank in that country, and I recollected to have ≈øeen him at the Jemadar's Durbar, where he had manife≈øted a favourable di≈øpo≈øition towards me, looking always graciou≈øly, and nodding to me, which, con≈øidering my circum≈øtances and his, was not a little extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. The moment he recognized me, he leaped from his hor≈øe, apparently in great agitation: then turning to the guards, ordered them to leave me immediately‚Äî≈øaying at the ≈øame time that he would be an≈øwerable for the con≈øequences. They ≈øeemed at fir≈øt to he≈øitate whether they would obey him or not; but on his ≈øhaking at them his ≈øword, which was all along drawn in his hand, and ≈ømear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood, and repeating his orders a ≈øecond time in a firm and deci≈øive tone of voice and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they all ran off.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as we were alone, he revealed to me, that he had all along known who I was‚Äîhad mo≈øt heartily pitied my ≈øufferings, and privately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the mo≈øt anxious wi≈øhes to ≈øerve me, but could not venture to interfere‚Äîthe lea≈øt jealou≈øy, when once awakened, being there always followed

He then rode away, and I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his advice, and proceeded for ≈øome time through the wood without interruption; for, though I did not implicitly believe the a≈ø≈øertion that HYAT SAHIB meant to have cut me off, I deemed it prudent to avail my≈øelf of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which offered to effect my e≈øcape, apprehending a wor≈øe fate than death, namely, being ≈øent pri≈øoner to Seringapatam.</p>
               <p>Finding my≈øelf fairly extricated, I began to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my ≈øituation, and to reflect on the different conver≈øations which had pa≈ø≈øed between HYAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIB and me, and on his conduct previous to my being put in irons. I recollected the information I had from time to time received, touching the

Jemadar's di≈øpo≈øition, HYDER'S death, TIPPOO SAHIB'S character and avowed hatred of HYAT, and the nature of the inhabitants. I moreover took into con≈øideration, that my ≈øtrength was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and my con≈øtitution undermined; and that my pro≈øpects in India, in point of ≈øame or emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could only be promoted by ≈øome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exertion, or ≈øome hazardous enterpri≈øe. The re≈øult of the whole was a determination on my part to return back to the fort, and venture an attempt to per≈øuade the Jemadar to offer propo≈øals for an accomodation to General MATHEWS, and to make me the in≈øtrument of his negociation.</p>
               <p>In pur≈øuance of this determination, I returned; and about ≈øix o'clock in the evening re-entered the fort, and proceeded to the palace of the Jemadar, where, de≈øi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He received me with a gloomy countenance, in which there was more of thoughtful ≈øadne≈øs than of vindictive fury. After a minute's ≈øilence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ≈øaid to me, "Well, Sir! you have heard, I ≈øuppo≈øe, that the Engli≈øh army are in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Ghauts, and doubtle≈øs know that the cu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this country authori≈øe my proceeding again≈øt you with the utmo≈øt rigor."

               <p>Here I perceived the Jemadar involuntary nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his head in a manner which, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for my ob≈øervation, denoted internal a≈ø≈øent; and was convinced that I had exactly fallen in with the current of his own thoughts. No wonder, indeed, they ≈øhould be his ≈øentiments; for they had long been the ≈øentiments of all per≈øons who had known the circum≈øtances of the Nabob's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>Having, therefore, gone as far on that point as I conceived to be nece≈ø≈øary to awaken the mind of HYAT to the precariou≈øne≈øs, of rather danger of his ≈øituation with TIPPOO, I painted to him, in the ≈øtronge≈øt colours I was ma≈øter of, the humanity, the fidelity, the bravery and genero≈øity of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh, which, I ≈øaid, were ≈øo univer≈øally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that even their wor≈øt enemies bore te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to them: and I a≈ø≈øured him, that if, in≈øtead of making an unavailing oppo≈øition to them, he would throw him≈øelf with confidence upon their protection, and become their friend, he would not only be continued in his ≈øtation, power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ≈øupported as heretofore, but be made a much greater man, with ≈øtill greater ≈øecurity, than ever he had been before.</p>

                  <pb n="350" facs="unknown:033487_0349_0FF725B07558BD00"/>This was the general ≈øcope of my argument with him; but there were many more which ≈øugge≈øted them≈øelves at the time, though I cannot now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them. I enforced them with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I had: they were ≈øupported by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged character for genero≈øity of the Engli≈øh, and ≈øtill more by HYAT'S apprehen≈øions of TIPPOO; and they had their effect. That very night he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thori≈øed me to go to the Briti≈øh General; and, though he would not commit him≈øelf by ≈øending propo≈øals in writing, he con≈øented to receive them from the General, and promi≈øed to wait for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till day-light the next morning‚Äîadding, that if I did not appear by that time, he would go off with his family and trea≈øure to ≈øome other place, and ≈øet the town, powder-magazine and ≈øtore-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes on fire, leaving a per≈øon of di≈øtingui≈øhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to defend the citadel or inner fort, which was ≈øtrong, with a deep ditch, and mounted with many pieces of cannon, and ≈øend immediate intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to an army of ≈øix thou≈øand hor≈øe and ten thou≈øand infantry, who were at that time on their road from Seringapatam, to ha≈øten their progre≈øs, and make them advance with all po≈ø≈øible rapidity; and he further ob≈øerved, that as TIPPOO him≈øelf would come to the immediate protection of his country, and, if once come while the Engli≈øh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my remained in the open field, would give them cau≈øe to repent their temerity, there was no time to be lo≈øt.</p>
               <p>Accompanied by a per≈øon who had officiated as interpreter between the Jemadar and me, and who≈øe good offices and influence with HYAT, which was very great, I had been previou≈øly lucky enough to ≈øecure, I ≈øet off at ten o'clock at night, on hor≈øeback to the Briti≈øh army. My companion was in high ≈øpirits when we fir≈øt ≈øet out from the fort; but as we proceeded, he expre≈ø≈øed great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of being ≈øhot in approaching the camp,

and earne≈øtly entreated me to ≈øleep at a choreltry, which lay in our way, till morning. His terror mu≈øt have been great indeed, to induce him to make ≈øuch a propo≈øal, as he knew very well that we had pledged our≈øelves to be back before dawn next day. I rallied him upon his fears, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to per≈øuade him there was not the ≈ømall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt danger, as I knew how to an≈øwer the outpo≈øts, when they ≈øhould challenge us, in ≈øuch a manner as to prevent their firing. As we advanced to the camp, however, his trepidation increa≈øed; and when we approached the ≈øentries, I was obliged to drag him along by force. Then his fears had very nearly produced the danger he dreaded, (the almo≈øt invariable effect of cowardice); for the ≈øentry next to us, hearing the ru≈øtling noi≈øe, let off his piece, and was retreating when I had the good fortune to make him hear me. My companion, alarmed at the noi≈øe of the mu≈øquet, fell down in a paroxy≈øm of terror, from which it was ≈øome time before he was completely recovered. The ≈øentry who had fired, coming up, conducted us to a place where other ≈øentries were po≈øted, one of whom accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us to a guard, from whence we were brought to the grand guard, and by them conducted to the General.</p>

the bare ground in a choreltry. His duba≈øh, who≈øe name was SNAKE, recollected me immediately, and was almo≈øt as much frightened at my appearance at fir≈øt, as my interpreter companion was at the ≈øhot of the ≈øentry; for it was full five months ≈øince my hair and beard were both ≈øhaved at the ≈øame time, during which period a comb had never touched my head: I had no hat‚Äîno ≈øtockings‚Äîwas clad in a pair of very ragged breeches, a ≈øhirt which was ≈øo full of holes that it re≈øembled rather a net than a web of cloth, and a wai≈øtcoat which had been made for a man twice my ≈øize‚Äîwhile my feet were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the ≈øtones only by a pair of Indian ≈ølippers. SNAKE, as ≈øoon as he was able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his terror, and ≈øtop the loquacious effu≈øions of a≈øtoni≈øhment, brought me to the General, whom I found fa≈øt a≈øleep. We awoke him with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and, on his di≈øcovering me, expre≈ø≈øed great plea≈øure and ≈øurpri≈øe at ≈øo unexpected a meeting; for, though he had heard of my impri≈øonment at Bidanore, he did not expect to have had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of my company ≈øo ≈øoon.</p>
               <p>Having ≈øtated to the General the nature and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my mi≈ø≈øion, and related to him what had happened in the fort, he in≈øtantly ≈øaw the great advantages that mu≈øt accrue from ≈øuch an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment‚Äîentered into a full but ≈øhort di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of the bu≈øine≈øs‚Äî≈øettled with me the plan to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued in either ca≈øe of HYAT SAHIB'S acceding to or di≈ø≈øenting from the terms he propo≈øed to offer; and in le≈øs than an hour after my arrival, I was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched back to the fort in the General's palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, with a cowl from him, ≈øignifying that the Jemadar HYAT SAHIB'S power and influence ≈øhould not be le≈ø≈øened, if he ≈øhould quietly ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up the fort.

of HYAT SAHIB, and the advantages that might be derived from his experience and abilities, coupled with the enfeebled ≈øtate of his army, the benefits of ≈øuch a negociation ≈øcarcely admitted of calculation.</p>
               <p>Notwith≈øtanding the very flattering circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with which my pre≈øent pur≈øuit was attended, I could not help, as I returned to Hydernagur, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome unea≈øy ≈øen≈øations, ari≈øing from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate nature of the bu≈øine≈øs, and from my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the faithle≈øs di≈øpo≈øition of A≈øiatics, and the little difficulty they find in violating any moral principle, if it happens to cla≈øh with their intere≈øt, or if a breach of it promi≈øes any advantage. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered that it was by no means impo≈ø≈øible, that ≈øome re≈øolution adver≈øe to my project might have been adopted in my ab≈øence, and that the Jemadar's policy might lead him to make my de≈øtruction a ≈øort of propitiation for his former offences, and to ≈øend me and the cowl together to TIPPOO, to be ≈øacrificed to his re≈øentment. The≈øe thoughts, I own, made a very deep impre≈ø≈øion on my mind‚Äî but were again effaced by the reflection, that a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mea≈øure, once begun, ought to be per≈øevered in, and that the accompli≈øhing a plan of ≈øuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and incalculable public utility, might operate ≈øtill further by example, and produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences of which it was impo≈ø≈øible at pre≈øent to form a conception.

five days to con≈øider of an an≈øwer, and ≈øeemed to be wavering in his mind, and labouring under the alternate impul≈øes of oppo≈øite motives and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory pa≈ø≈øions. I ≈øaw that it was a cri≈øis of more importance than any other of my life‚Äîa cri≈øis in which delay, irre≈øolution, or yielding to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive expedients of HYAT, might be fatal. To prevent, therefore, the effects of either treachery or repentance, I took advantage of the general confu≈øion and trepidation which prevailed in the fort‚Äîcollected the Arcot Sepoys, who, to the number of four hundred, were pri≈øoners at large‚Äî po≈øted them at the gates, powder-magazines, and other critical ≈øituations; and, having taken the≈øe and other precautions, went out to the General, who, according to the plan concerted between us, had pu≈øhed on with the advanced guard; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him into the fort with hardly an attendant, brought him ≈øtraight to the Jemadar's pre≈øence while he yet remained in a ≈øtate of indeci≈øion and terror. General MATHEWS, in his fir≈øt interview with the Jemadar, did every thing to re-a≈ø≈øure him, and confirmed with the mo≈øt ≈øolemn a≈ø≈øeverations the terms of the cowl; in con≈øequence of which the latter acceded to the propo≈øitions contained in it, and the Briti≈øh colours for the fir≈øt time waved upon the walls of the chief fort of the country of Bidanore.</p>
               <p>Having thus contributed to put this important garri≈øon, with all its trea≈øures, which certainly were immen≈øe, into the hands of the Company, without the lo≈øs of a ≈øingle man, or even the ≈øtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ≈øingle blow, my exultation was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; and, much though I wanted money, I can with truth aver, that avarice had not even for an in≈øtant the lea≈øt ≈øhare in my ≈øen≈øations. 'Tis true, the con≈øciou≈øne≈øs of my ≈øervices a≈ø≈øured me of a reward; but how that reward was to accrue to me, never once was the ≈øubject of my contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation

‚Äîmuch le≈øs did I think of availing my≈øelf of the in≈øtant occa≈øion to obtain it.

The General, it is true, promi≈øed that I ≈øhould remain with him till he made ≈øome arrangements; and HYAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIB offered, on his part, to make me, through the General, a hand≈øome pre≈øent. The General, however, ≈øuddenly became di≈ø≈øatisfied with me; and I neither got HYAT SAHIB'S pre≈øent, nor ever received even a rupee of the va≈øt ≈øpoil found there.</p>
               <p>Here I think it a duty incumbent on me to ≈øay ≈øomething of General MATHEWS, and, while I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the unfortunate turn in his temper, which injured me, and tarni≈øhed in ≈øome mea≈øure his good qualities, to re≈øcue him from that unremitted oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy which the ignorant, the intere≈øted and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious have thrown upon his fame. Light lie the a≈øhes of the dead, and hallowed be the turf that pillows the head of a ≈øoldier! General MATHEWS was indeed a ≈øoldier‚Äîwas calumniated too; and although he did not u≈øe me as I had rea≈øon to hope he would, I will, as far as I can, re≈øcue his fame from gro≈øs mi≈ørepre≈øentation.</p>
               <p>An extravagant love of fame was the ruling pa≈ø≈øion of General MATHEWS: it was the great end of all his pur≈øuits; and while, in his military profe≈ø≈øion, he walked with a firm pace towards it, he lo≈øt his time, di≈øtorted his progre≈øs, and pal≈øied his own efforts, by a jealous vigilance and envious oppo≈øition of tho≈øe whom he found taking the ≈øame road, whether they walked be≈øide him, or panted in feeble effort behind. This was his fault; it was doubtle≈øs a great alloy to his good qualities: but it has been puni≈øhed with rigour di≈øproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

to the offence. Tho≈øe who per≈øonally felt his jealou≈øy, took advantage of his melancholy end to traduce him, and magnify every mole-hill of error into a mountain of crime. It is unmanly in any one‚Äîindeed it is‚Äîto traduce the ≈øoldier who has fallen in the ≈øervice of his country; but it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øy in a ≈øoldier to do ≈øo. No ≈øooner did the buzz of calumny get abroad, than thou≈øands of hornets, who had neither intere≈øt nor concern in the affair, joined in it. The malignant, who wi≈øhed to ≈øting merely to get rid of ≈øo much of their venom‚Äîand the vain, who wi≈øhed to acquire a reputation for knowledge of A≈øiatic affairs at the expence of truth ‚Äîunited together, and rai≈øed a hum which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Europe, where the hornets (I mean authors), under the le≈øs unju≈øtifiable impul≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, took it up, and buzzed through the medium of <hi>quartos</hi> and <hi>octavos</hi> ≈øo loud, that public opinion was poi≈øoned; and the gallant ≈øoldier who, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of England, ≈øtood the harde≈øt tugs of war, and at la≈øt drank the poi≈øoned cup from the tyrant hands of her enemy, was generally under≈øtood to be a peculator, and to have clande≈øtinely and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hone≈øtly obtained three hundred thou≈øand pounds.</p>
               <p>On this attention I put my direct negative. It may be ≈øaid, however, that this is only a≈ø≈øertion again≈øt a≈ø≈øertion‚ÄîTrue! Sorry ≈øhould I be to re≈øt it there: my a≈ø≈øertions are grounded on ≈øuch proofs as are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As ≈øoon as Hydernagur was taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of, HYAT SAHIB immediately i≈ø≈øued orders to the ≈øorts of Mangatore, Deokull, Ananpore, and ≈øome others in that country, to ≈øurrender to the Briti≈øh arms.

Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incautious by ≈øucce≈øs, our army became le≈øs vigilant, and TIPPOO retook Hydernagur; and, in direct breach of the capitulation, made the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon

pri≈øoners, treated them with a degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity which chills the blood even to think of, and forced General MATHEWS to take poi≈øon in pri≈øon!</p>
               <p>Mean-time HYAT SAHIB, with whom the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had got into di≈øputes, arrived at Bombay, and laid a charge again≈øt him, which he, being in the hands of TIPPOO, could not controvert, or even know. And what was the charge? The whole extent of it was his (MATHEWS'S) having got two lacks of rupees, and a pearl necklace, as a pre≈øent ‚Äîa ≈øum, con≈øidering the country and circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, not at all extraordinary, but which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely vindicated by the General's letter to the Court of Directors, dated at Mangalore, the 15th of March, 1783; in which he ≈øtates the pre≈øent, and reque≈øts permi≈ø≈øion to accept it. This, as I ≈øaid before, is on record, and was tran≈ølated by Mr. SYBBALD, who was then Per≈øian interpreter at Bombay. The letter I allude to, you will ≈øee in the APPENDIX.

He was, as I have already mentioned, an old friend of my father's, and an intimate of my own: I had rea≈øon, therefore, to expect from him, according to the u≈øual di≈øpo≈øitions and manners of men, if not partiality, at lea≈øt friend≈øhip; and in ≈øuch a ca≈øe as

I have related, where my ≈øervices gave me a claim to notice, it was not unrea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe that he would have been forward to promote my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt, by ≈øtating my ≈øervices in ≈øuch a manner as to call attention to them. He had, however, ≈øome di≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable di≈øcu≈ø≈øions with his officers; and ≈øeeing I was on a footing with Colonel HUMBERTSON, and ≈øtill more with Major CAMPBELL (he who ≈øo ably and gallantly defended Mangalore again≈øt TIPPOO'S whole army and ≈øix hundred French), and finding me extremely zealous and importunate to have his arrangement with HYAT SAHIB adhered to, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came di≈øplea≈øed, and, though he him≈øelf had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that I ≈øhould remain with him, changed his mind, and ordered me away at an hour's notice‚Äî many days ≈øooner than he had originally intended to ≈øend off any di≈øpatches. He moreover occa≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my lo≈øing a ≈øum of money, and on the whole paid le≈øs attention to my intere≈øt than the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of the ca≈øe demanded.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the day on which he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on my departure, I ≈øet off with his di≈øpatches to the governments of Madra≈øs and Bengal, and reached the mo≈øt di≈øtant of our po≈øts that night. From thence I had thirty miles to Cundapore, a ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port town upon the Malabar coa≈øt, taken by us from the enemy. During this journey, which was through the country of TIPPOO SAHIB, I had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øix Sepoys to conduct me: yet, ≈øuch was the univer≈øal panic that had ≈øeized all cla≈ø≈øes and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of people at the progre≈øs of the Briti≈øh arms in that quarter, I met only a few ≈øcattered Sepoys, who were ≈øo badly wounded I pre≈øume they were unable to travel‚Äîthe villages through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being completely abandoned by all their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>

At length, with great difficulty, I reached Cundapore, where the commanding officer, and all about him did every thing in their power to afford me a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and comfort under my mi≈øeries, which increa≈øed every hour rapidly.

By the time I had got down the coa≈øt as far as Mangalore, my complaints increa≈øed to an alarming height; and I became ≈øpeechle≈øs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ≈øtand. Fortunately there happened to be a Company's ve≈ø≈øel then lying at anchor off that place, the captain of which had the goodne≈øs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite me to remain on board with him, ≈øtrenuou≈øly advi≈øing that I ≈øhould give up the thoughts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding immediately on my voyage to Anjengo, which I could not po≈ø≈øibly ≈øurvive, and to forward my di≈øpatches by another hand.

When I arrived at Tellicherry, and during my ≈øtay there, the great attention ≈øhewn me by Mr. FREEMAN, the chief of that place, and the comforts of his hou≈øe, re≈øtored me to a great ≈øhare of health and ≈øpirits‚ÄîAnd here a very ≈øingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="unknown:033487_0360_0FF725D0229EC330"/>One day a ve≈ø≈øel arrived; and perceiving a boat coming on ≈øhore from her, Mr. FREEMAN and I walked down to the beach, to make the u≈øual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries‚Äî≈øuch as, where ≈øhe came from? what news ≈øhe brought? <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> As ≈øoon as the boat touched the ≈øhore, a gentleman leaped out of it, who≈øe per≈øon ≈øeemed familiar to me: upon his nearer approach, I di≈øcovered that it was Mr. BRODEY, a gentleman who had been kind enough to take upon him the office of my attorney, upon my leaving India ≈øome years before‚Äînot my <hi>attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> in the ordinary acceptation of that word, but a liberal and di≈øintere≈øted friend, who obligingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the management of my affairs in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, without the ≈ømalle≈øt hope of advantage, or rather under circum≈øtances which ≈øerved as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to further obligations. I was certainly plea≈øed and ≈øurpri≈øed to ≈øee him; but his a≈øtoni≈øhment to ≈øee me amounted almo≈øt to a di≈øtru≈øt of his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight: he had received ≈øuch indubitable proofs of my death, that my ≈øudden appearance on his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the fir≈øt ru≈øh of thought, impre≈ø≈øed him with the notion of a <hi>deceptio vi≈øus.</hi> My identity, however, was too po≈øitive for re≈øi≈øtance; and his wonder melted down into cordial ≈øatisfaction, and congratulations on my ≈øafety. He then took out a pocket account-book, in which, for ≈øecurity again≈øt accidents, he kept accounts-current, written in a brief manner‚Äîand ≈øhewed me mine, ≈øettled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt to the very day, upon which was tran≈øcribed a copy of a letter he had received, and which he thought was a te≈øtimony of my death. So, cutting out the account, and pre≈øenting it to me, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, in the mo≈øt cordial and hand≈øome manner, his joy that it was into my own hands he had at la≈øt had an opportunity to deliver it. This gentleman is now in this Kingdom, and too well known for me to de≈øcribe him. Suffice it to ≈øay, that in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as well as in India, he has always enjoyed
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:033487_0361_0FF725D378AA7C28"/>
the e≈øteem and re≈øpect of all his acquaintances, to as great an extent as any other per≈øon I know.</p>
               <p>I again embarked to proceed on my voyage, and had hardly got on board when a ≈øhip dropped an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor along ≈øide of us, in which captain CAMPBELL of Comby, a very near connection of mine, was pa≈ø≈øenger. On hailing one another, he heard that I was on board, and immeditely was with me. Tho≈øe who ≈øincerely love each other, and who≈øe hearts confe≈øs the fond ties of con≈øanguinity, can alone conceive what our mutual plea≈øure was at meeting ≈øo unexpectedly in ≈øo remote a corner of the world. He was then on his way to join the army. This amiable young man, now repo≈øes in the bed of honour at Mangalore! He fell, after having di≈øtingui≈øhed him≈øelf in the very gallant defence made by that place again≈øt the whole force of TIPPOO. With regret we parted: and in due time I arrived at Anjengo without any accident befalling me, which was rather extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Leaving Anjengo, I ≈øet out for Madras, de≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go all the way by land‚Äîa journey of near eight hundred miles. I accordingly ≈øtruck through the Kingdom of Travancore, who≈øe ≈øovereign is in alliance with the Engli≈øh; and had not long entered the territories of the Nabob of Arcot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Major MACNEAL, an old friend of mine, and commandant of a fort in that di≈øtrict, met me preceded by a troop of dancing girls, who encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled my palanquin, dancing around me until I entered the Major's hou≈øe.</p>
               <p>It would be difficult to give you an adequate notion of tho≈øe dancing girls. Trained up from their infancy to the practice of the mo≈øt graceful motions, the mo≈øt artful di≈øplay of per≈øonal ≈øym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, and the mo≈øt wanton allurements, they dance in ≈øuch a ≈øtyle, and twine their limbs and bodies into ≈øuch po≈øtures, as bewitch the ≈øen≈øes, and extort applau≈øe and admiration where in ≈øtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:033487_0362_0FF725D7079329C8"/>
di≈øapprobation is due: nor is their agility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the grace of their movements‚Äîthough they do not exert it in the ≈øame ≈økipping way that our ≈øtage dancers do, but make it ≈øub≈øervient to the elegance, and, I may ≈øay, grandeur, of their air. They are generally found in troops of ≈øix or eight, attended by mu≈øicians, who≈øe a≈øpect and dre≈øs are as uncouth and ≈øqualid, as the ≈øounds they produce under the name of mu≈øic, are inelegant, har≈øh and di≈ø≈øonant. To this mu≈øic, from which mea≈øure as much as harmony is excluded, they dance, mo≈øt wonderfully adapting their ≈øtep to the perpetual change of the time, accompanying it with amorous ≈øongs, while the corre≈øpondent action of their body and limbs, the wanton palpitation and heaving of their exqui≈øitely formed bo≈øoms, and the amorous, or rather la≈øcivious expre≈ø≈øion of their countenance, excite in the ≈øpectators emotions not very favourable to cha≈øtity. Thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to act, till, by the warmth of exerci≈øe and imagination, they become ≈øeemingly frantic with ec≈øtacy, and, ≈øinking down motionle≈øs with fatigue, throw them≈øelves into the mo≈øt alluring attitudes that ingenious vice and voluptuou≈øne≈øs can po≈ø≈øibly devi≈øe.</p>
               <p>That ≈øuch incitements to vice ≈øhould make a part of the ≈øy≈øtem of any ≈øociety, is to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet, at all ceremonies and great occa≈øions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of religious wor≈øhip or dome≈øtic enjoyment, they make a part of the entertainment; and the altar of their gods, and the purity of the marriage rites, are alike polluted by the introduction of the dancing girls. The impurity of this cu≈øtom, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, vani≈øhes in India, when compared with the hideous practice of introducing dancing <hi>boys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major, after having entertained me in the mo≈øt ho≈øpitable manner, accompanied me to Palam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotah, to the hou≈øe of Doctor DOTT, who lived in a generous and ho≈øpitable ≈øtyle. I had once had
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:033487_0363_0FF725D9A9299CE8"/>
an opportunity of evincing my good di≈øpo≈øition to this gentleman, when he was mo≈øt critically ≈øitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and the reception he gave me demon≈øtrated, that he than retained a lively ≈øen≈øe of my conduct to him.</p>
               <p>Leaving Palamcotah, I continued my route thro' Madura. This country is rendered remarkable by the revolt of the famous ISIF CAWN, who made a bold and well-conducted attempt to erect him≈øelf into the ≈øovereignty of that province, independent of the Nabob of the Carnatic, in who≈øe ≈øervice he was: and as the affair occurs to my thoughts, I will, for your information, notwith≈øtanding its being unconnected with my ≈øtory, digre≈øs into an account of it. As ≈øoon as the revolt of ISIF CAWN was known, General MONSON, an officer of great military ≈økill and per≈øonal merit, went again≈øt him at the head of the King's and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's troops, and inve≈øted the ≈øort of Madura, in which that rebellious chief was po≈øted. The general made a practicable breach, and, in ≈øtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was beat back with great ≈ølaughter by ISIF; and the ≈øetting in of the mon≈øoons immediately after, retarded the further operations of our army again≈øt the place; and in the interim, peace hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been concluded between the courts of St. James's and Ver≈øailles, the King's troops were withdrawn.</p>
               <p>On the recall of the King's troops, an army of company's troops was formed, to proceed again≈øt Madura, in order to reduce this gallant turbulent rebel to ≈øubjection; and the renowned general LAWRENCE being rendered incapable of actual ≈øervice, and obliged to remain at the pre≈øidency by extreme age and infirmity, the chief command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon my father by ≈øeniority: he headed the expedition; and, after overcoming innumerable difficulties thrown in his way by the inventive genius and enterpri≈øing ≈øpirit of ISIF CAWN, again

made a breach, which was deemed practicable by the chief engineer, now Sir JOHN CALL.

               <p>The peculiar ≈øtyle of this letter made ≈øuch an impre≈ø≈øion on my memory, that I am able to give the exact words.

               <p>PASSING through Madura, I arrived at Trichinopoly, where I met Mr. SULLIVAN, the re≈øident of Tanjore, who very politely furni≈øhed me with a letter to Mr. HIPPESLEY, his deputy at Tanjore, from whom I received many marks of civility. At that place I had the plea≈øure of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gentleman with whom I had been at college, and for whom I had always entertained a great e≈øteem: this was Colonel FULLARTON. It is an old maxim, that we ≈øhould ≈øay nothing but good of the dead‚Äî"De mortuis nil ni≈øi bonum." It is not a new maxim, I believe, to avoid prai≈øing the living: I am aware of the indelicacy of it; and therefore purpo≈øely avoid in this, as I ≈øhall in other in≈øtances, ≈øpeaking the full opinion I entertain<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> To the general e≈øteem in which he was held by all ranks of people in India, I refer you to Colonel FULLARTON'S character: it is of ≈øuch a ≈øort, that I wi≈øh to hold it up for your imitation. At a time of life when others have arrived to ≈øome perfection in their profe≈ø≈øion, he made choice of his, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for the fir≈øt time into the arduous military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, with a command for which the training of many years is no more than ≈øufficient to prepare other men. The Mini≈øter of that day gave him this important charge, underwent the clamours of

Oppo≈øition for it, and was ju≈øtified in the event. When the Colonel came to act, ≈øo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deficient, his whole conduct was di≈øtingui≈øhed, not le≈øs for military talent than courage‚Äîwhile the mo≈øt fortunate command and temper and captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting addre≈øs ≈øubdued the ≈øpirit of prejudice, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled the mo≈øt di≈øcordant, and gained him, though a King's Officer, the e≈øteem as much of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's as King's troops.

To promote that in my FEDERICK, will be attended with little difficulty: on the contrary, my only doubt is, that the placability and mildne≈øs of his di≈øpo≈øition will too often ≈øubject him to impo≈øition. JOHN is, however, of a different temper; there is ≈øomething in it which requires both admonition and good example to repre≈øs within proper bounds: to ≈øhew him the beauty as well as u≈øe of a mild, cool temper, ≈øuch in≈øtances as Colonel FULLAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON may be of weight, and I wi≈øh him to reflect upon it. And here I am reminded of a per≈øon and a circum≈øtance ≈øo exactly in point, that I cannot refrain from noticing them: they convey no inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate idea of the happine≈øs re≈øulting from a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of nature, and dominion over the mind; and as the per≈øon I allude to is dead, I may ≈øpeak of him with the greater freedom in that full ≈øtrain of prai≈øe of which his ≈øhining virtues de≈øerve.</p>
               <p>Of all the men I have ever had the good fortune to know, Sir ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, in the highe≈øt degree, that heavenly turn of mind, which not only is at peace with it≈øelf, but diffu≈øes harmony and cheerfulne≈øs around it.

time, or embarra≈ø≈øed with difficulty‚Äîno accident, however unexpected, or event, however ≈øini≈øter‚Äî none of tho≈øe innumerable minutiae which fret and chafe the tempers of other men, ever ≈øu≈øpended the cool tenor of his thought even for a moment: noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øhook the ≈øerenity of his temper‚Äînothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged the pre≈øence of his mind: uniform and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, he in all ≈øituations had the full dominion of him≈øelf, and in the field it gave him a decided ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority; nor was this felicity of nature confined to his public conduct; it attended him at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øtic enjoyments of the fire-≈øide‚Äîat the ≈øocial board‚Äîin the private rece≈ø≈øes of his clo≈øet; and the very ≈øame habit of ≈øoul which, in his great pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic duties, rendered him valuable to his Country, and formidable to her enemies, gained him the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and e≈øteem of his friends, the unbounded affection of his family, and the ble≈ø≈øing of all his dependants.</p>
               <p>An incident that occured in my pre≈øence may ≈øerve in ≈øome mea≈øure to decipher the mind of this admirable man‚ÄîI ≈øhall never forget it. Previou≈øly to his going to India, he had exerted his intere≈øt to obtain from the Ea≈øt India Company ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my ≈øervices; and, a few days before his departure, promi≈øed to ≈øpeak again to Mr. DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAYNES, Chairman of the Ea≈øt India Company. I waited on him on the day he was ≈øetting off: he was ju≈øt about to depart, and ≈øurrounded by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous circle. In the mid≈øt of this bu≈øtle, and the confu≈øion, one would ≈øuppo≈øe, in≈øeparable from ≈øuch a cri≈øis, he recollected his promi≈øe‚Äîtold me Mr. DEVAYNES had that minute taken leave of him, and he had forgot to mention me, but ≈øaid that he would write to him on the ≈øubject: and, though he was at the in≈øtant on the point of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the carriage that was to carry him off, ≈øat down, and with that amiable ≈øweetne≈øs of manners and happily collected mind ≈øo peculiarly his own,

There ≈øeemed to be ≈øome little ≈øquabble about the di≈øtribution of her jewels, which ≈øhe ≈øettled with great preci≈øion; and then, falling gently backwards, polled a fold of the yellow cloth over her face, turned her brea≈øt towards her hu≈øbands ≈øide, and laid her right arm over his brea≈øt; and in this po≈øture ≈øhe remained without moving.</p>

                           <p>"A Bramin then took a handful of ≈øtraw, which he ≈øet on fire at the little heap of burning cakes of cow-dung; and, ≈øtanding to windward of the pile, he let the wind drive the flame from the ≈øtraw till it catched the pile. Fortunately, at this in≈øtant, the wind ro≈øe much higher than it had been any part of the day; and in an in≈øtant the flames per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the whole pile, and it burnt with great fury. I li≈øtened a few ≈øeconds, but could not di≈øtingui≈øh any ≈øhricks, which might perhaps be owing to my being then to windward. In a very few minutes, the pile became a heap of a≈øhes.</p>

               <p>HITHERTO every ≈øtep of my journey has been marked by occurrences ≈øo unexpected, and accidents ≈øo extraordinary, that I ≈øhould feel ≈øome repugnance to relate them, le≈øt my veracity ≈øhould be called in que≈øtion, were they not atte≈øted by ≈øo many living per≈øons of re≈øpectability, and by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten documents of authority on record. Were one to con≈øider them merely as the offspring of fiction, they would perhaps have intere≈øt enough to catch the attention; but, viewing them as facts, they borrow, from their number and rapid ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, as well as from their ≈øingularity, ≈øo much of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of imaginary adventure, that the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot, I think, fail to intere≈øt your mind as well as your feelings.</p>
               <p>Arrived at Negapatnam, within a ≈øhort run of Madras, it is natural for you to ≈øuppo≈øe that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was at an end, and that fortune, fatigued by the ince≈ø≈øant exertion of her caprice, might have left me to proceed the ≈øhort re≈øidue of my way without further mole≈øtation. It fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe: ≈øhe had marked me as her game, and re≈øolved to worry me to the la≈øt moment; for, as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Madras, we were cha≈øed by a French fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and taken near Fort St. George.</p>
               <p>This appeared to me the greate≈øt misfortune I had yet met with, and likely to be the mo≈øt fatal
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:033487_0378_0FF725FE02B2F2D0"/>
in its con≈øequences. In order to explain this, I mu≈øt recur to certain circum≈øtances, which though I was informed of them ≈øince my relea≈øe from Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernagur, I did not relate to you, becau≈øe they were no way connected with my narrative till now.</p>
               <p>Mon≈øieur SUFFREIN, the French Admiral, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a number of Briti≈øh pri≈øoners in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, whom he found it extremely inconvenient to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, made a propo≈øal for an exchange‚Äîwhich, from ≈øome failure in the conveyance, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in the terms of the corre≈øpondence, was neglected.</p>
               <p>The motives or accidents which gave ri≈øe to this neglect have never been completely developed; and perhaps the Admiral him≈øelf, Sir EDWARD HUGHES, and Lord MACARTNEY, were the only per≈øons who knew the bottom of that tran≈øaction. In ≈øuch ca≈øes, however, the ignorance of fact is generally ≈øupplied by conjecture; and men have pre≈øumed to cen≈øure unequivocally on the mere hypothetical ≈øugge≈øtions of their own imaginations. Candour, however, in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, where it could not ≈øpeak with certainty, would ≈øpeak with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An Hi≈øtorian, particularly, ≈øhould ≈øteer clear of party rancour, and not ≈øuffer the prejudice or malignity which mi≈øled him≈øelf, to go down to and mi≈ølead po≈øterity. Where po≈øitive proof is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we are obliged to decide, we mu≈øt judge by analogy and inference; and in the ca≈øe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we have little but the characters of the per≈øons concerned to guide us in our deci≈øion.</p>
               <p>Of the horrid cata≈øtrophe which ≈øucceeded the neglect of exchanging pri≈øoners, it is hardly po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any one but Mon≈øieur SUFFREIN him≈øelf could have had a conception. To ≈øuppo≈øe, that, under ≈øuch an impre≈ø≈øion, our leading men would have he≈øitated to prevent it, would be to ≈øuppo≈øe their intellects weak, and their hearts corrupt and inhuman. I fancy it will be difficult to fa≈øten on

Lord MACARTNEY either the one or the other; for he was wi≈øe and humane: tho≈øe whom the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of unrea≈øonable expectations, or the malevolence of party, have induced to ≈øu≈øpect his Lord≈øhip's heart, have been forced by his conduct to revere his talents; and the breath of calumny has never touched the humanity of Sir EDWARD HUGHES. Whatever their motives, therefore, may have been‚Äîrea≈øon, con≈øcience, and candour, mu≈øt acquit them of the con≈øequences. It ≈øhould be recollected, too, that Mon≈øi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur SUFFREIN'S cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was a very probable ≈øecurity, in the mind of men of ≈øen≈øe and honour, again≈øt any act of horrid inhumanity: his conduct as an officer had made a new aera in the Naval Hi≈øtory of France: his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and courage might be compared, without di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, to tho≈øe of the be≈øt of our Briti≈øh Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals; and he had exhibited marks of uncommon genero≈øity to tho≈øe whom the chance of war had thrown into his hands. It would therefore have been ≈øomething more than pre≈øcience to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuppo≈øed what actually happened; and I declare mo≈øt ≈øolemnly, that the inference I draw from the whole information I have had on the ≈øubject is, that, calamitous though the event was, it attaches no po≈øitive guilt on any of the parties concerned. The fact is plainly this: The French Admiral ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no place on the coa≈øt where he could ≈øecure his pri≈øoners, and grieving, as he him≈øelf ≈øub≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wrote to Mr. HASTINGS, to ≈øee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy men, who had been ≈øix or ≈øeven months at ≈øea, dying of the ≈øcurvy, delivered over the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, to the number of above three hundred, to HYDER.

               <p>Take the whole of the circum≈øtances into one glance, and ≈øee what my feelings mu≈øt have been on finding my≈øelf once more a pri≈øoner. HYDER ALLI, who was, when compared with the wor≈øt de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots

of the European world, a mon≈øter, mu≈øt yet be con≈øidered, when put in compari≈øon, with his ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øor TIPPOO, mild and merciful. HYDER, from policy and hypocri≈øy, ≈øhewed ≈øome lenity to the pri≈øoners who fell into his hands. In≈øtances are known where Briti≈øh captives have broke through the crowd that ≈øurrounded him into his pre≈øence for protection‚Äîwhen he has hypocritically feigned anger, threatened the per≈øons who had treated them ill, reprobated ≈øeverity, and ≈øent them off ≈øatisfied for the pre≈øent. TIPPOO, on the contrary, was ≈øo perfectly ≈øavage, that cruelty ≈øeemed to be, not only the internal habit of his ≈øoul, but the guide of all his actions, the moving principle of his policy, the rule of his public conduct, and the ≈øource of his private gratification. Like the tyger which, BUFFON tells us, kills the whole flock before he begins to feed, every appetite of his yielded to the more urgent calls of barbarity; and while one drop blood of remained un≈øpilled, one agony uninflicted, one tear un≈øhed, the natural appetites of TIPPOO ≈øtood ≈øu≈øpended, and the luxuries of life courted his enjoyment in vain. Like the hyena which THOMPSON calls the felle≈øt of the fell, the fury of his nature was neither to be controuled by re≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor a≈ø≈øuaged by blandi≈øhments. Aloof from the general order of the workings of Providence, he ≈øtands a ≈øingle in≈øtance, in which the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent has pre≈øented a glowing living picture, ALL SHADE: not one ray breaks in, to relieve the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a≈øpect of the piece; but, di≈øtinct from the whole human race, of him alone it may be ≈øaid, that he never yet di≈øolo≈øed, even for a moment, one ≈øpark of virtue.</p>
               <p>From barbarity ≈øo inflexible to tho≈øe taken in the ordinary chance of war, what could I expect if I fell again into his hands‚ÄîI who had been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument of one of his chief Governor's defection ‚Äîwho had, by my negociations, contributed to
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:033487_0381_0FF726041DA58DC8"/>
deprive him of a Province, and, what perhaps might have had greater weight with him, robbed him of the gratification of a long harboured revenge, by putting his enemy HYAT SAHIB under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Company? Diabolical vengeance never perhaps met with a ≈øubject of ≈øuch ≈øublime enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the torturing of me would have been to this mon≈øter. Couple this then, my FREDERICK, with the fears of SUFFREIN'S doing by me as he had already done by the other Engli≈øh pri≈øoners‚Äî and gue≈øs what my terror and con≈øternation mu≈øt have been at falling into the hands of the French!</p>
               <p>Having ≈øtruck our colours to the French frigate, the Captain ordered us to follow her, and ≈øteered to the northward. We obeyed him for ≈øome time: at length night fell; and, a fre≈øh and favourable breeze fortunately aiding the attempt, we put about, ran for Madras, and luckily dropt anchor ≈øafely in the roads. In the e≈øcapes I had hitherto had, there was always ≈øome di≈øagreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance to alloy the plea≈øure ari≈øing from them‚ÄîIn this in≈øtance, my joy was pure and unqualified; and I looked forward with a rea≈øonable hope that the wor≈øt was all over.</p>
               <p>Here I found Lord MACARTNEY governor, ≈øtruggling to ≈øupport the credit of the Company, and directing their affairs through ≈øuch embarra≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and difficulties as made the mo≈øt wi≈øe and temperate de≈øpair of ≈øucce≈øs.

He wrote a ≈øhort account of the fir≈øt to the Pre≈øidency of Fort St. George; and gave me a public letter to the Commander in Chief of the Military E≈øtabli≈øhment of that Pre≈øidency to which I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly belong, in atte≈øtation of the ≈øervices I rendered in the negociation between him and the Governor of Bidanore, for the ≈øurrender of that capital and province.

                     <p>As I was charged with a particular commi≈ø≈øion from HYAT SAHIB, the manager of the Bidanore province, to the Governor-General and council, as appears by his letter, which I had the honour of pre≈øenting to you, General MATHEWS gave me, in verbal in≈øtructions, and memorandums written in his own hand, the particulars of what he wi≈øhed me to repre≈øent to your Government:

he gave me, be≈øides, ≈øhort notes of introduction to two of the members of Government, whom he knew per≈øonally‚Äîreferring them to me for an account of his ≈øituation, and allowing me, I believe, more credit than I de≈øerve, for the ≈øhare I had in contributing to his final acqui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bidanore without drawing a ≈øword.</p>
                     <p>It would be tedious, and more fit for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of conver≈øation than of a public addre≈øs, to inform you of the various ≈øteps that led to the ≈øurrender of the capital and province of Bida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore. I had had ≈øeveral conferences with HYAT SAHIB before HYDER'S death, and endeavoured to ≈øugge≈øt to him the advantage which would ari≈øe to him from a revolt in favour of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. My efforts in the≈øe conver≈øations ended ultimately in the mo≈øt rigorous di≈øtre≈øs to my≈øelf: I was put in irons, and remained ≈øo for four months, in a ≈øituation only of exi≈øtence without any hopes of ever e≈øcaping. When General MATHEWS had ≈øtormed the Ghauts, HYAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIB ≈øent for me, and, after various ≈øtruggles, and much indeci≈øion, agreed to my proceeding to the Engli≈øh camp; and I conducted General MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEWS, almo≈øt unattended, into Bidanore. HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AT SAHIB at length agreed to ≈øubmit: but as, in his various conver≈øations with me before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that event, he made a very particular di≈øtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the government of Bombay and the chief government of the Engli≈øh in Indo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ≈øo he propo≈øed that I ≈øhould immediately depart, after he had given up the place and all the forts of the Province, with a letter to you, to obtain your ≈øanction to me to his arrangements with the Engli≈øh General.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe arrangements were not even clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined before my departure; and ≈øo anxious was he for my ≈øpeedy arrival at Calcutta, that he only
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:033487_0385_0FF7260E6D72B078"/>
gave me the general propo≈øitions that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his letter.</p>
                     <p>Permit me here to ob≈øerve, that it is by the treatment which HYAT SAHIB meets with, that the other chiefs of HYDER'S country will e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the advantage of abandoning the intere≈øts of TIPPOO SAHIB, or will confirm their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him. TIPPOO was prevented by his father from all intercour≈øe with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of his provinces, or any interference in country affairs; ≈øo that tho≈øe left in charge at his father's death are ≈øtranger's to him, and are men to whom he has little attachment. He is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, con≈øidered to be of a cruel di≈øpo≈øition. His father was cruel upon a political principle: he is thought to be ≈øo from nature.</p>
                     <p>The unfortunate differences about money which aro≈øe in General MATHEWS'S camp, and of which you will probably hear from the Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Bombay, took up much of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's time, and may have retarded his operations: however, his ≈øucce≈øs in the reduction of Manga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The particular ≈øituation of the capital merits attention. It is placed in a valley of con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent in circumference: according to the be≈øt ob≈øervation I could make, there is an a≈øcent to it, from all ≈øides, of near ≈øeven miles: it can only be approached by four roads, which are cut among the hills, and which were judiciou≈øly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with great pains by HYDER: woods, to the depth of many miles, are a frontier round its ≈økirts; and where the≈øe admitted a pa≈ø≈øage, HYDER took the precaution to plant bamboos and thorns‚Äî≈øo that I have little fear but that General MATHEWS will be able to defend the≈øe pa≈ø≈øes; and as for provi≈øions, and military ≈øtores
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:033487_0386_0FF72613CD69C2F8"/>
of all kinds, that were found in Bidanore, of the latter particularly, what, according to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral MATHEWS'S own declaration, would equip nine ≈øuch armies as his.</p>
                     <p>Cundapore is the next ≈øea-port to Bidanore, and is di≈øtant about fifty miles: Mangalore is di≈øtant about a hundred miles. The road lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Mangalore joins with that from Cunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, where the a≈øcent of the hills commence: another road from Bidanore leads to Seringapatam, and a fourth into the Marhatta country.</p>
                     <p>It was from the lower country, along the ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa≈øt, between Onore and Mangalore, which is watered by many rivers, and is the be≈øt cultivated country I ever ≈øaw, that HYDER got the greate≈øt part of his provi≈øions for his army in the Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; and, independent of the advantages which the Company have gained by the acqui≈øition of the≈øe countries, the con≈øequent lo≈ø≈øes of the My≈øoreans are immen≈øe, and ≈øuch as will di≈øable them from a≈ø≈øi≈øting the French in the Carnatic.</p>
                     <p>It becomes not an officer of my rank to make any ob≈øervations that relate to the conduct of the different governments of my employers; but I am obliged to ob≈øerve, in ju≈øtice to HYAT SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIB'S declaration to me, that he will not rely upon any arrangement made in his favour by the Governor and council of Bombay, unle≈øs he has a ≈øpeedy an≈øwer to his letter from this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He has reque≈øted me to return with that an≈øwer, and with the ≈øanction of the Governor-General to the cowl given to him by General MATHEWS.

                     <p>I have directed the affairs of the Soobeh of Hydernagur for ≈øome years pa≈øt, on the part of the NAVVAUB HYDER. When lately attacked by the victorious forces of the Engli≈øh under the command of General MATHEWS, I oppo≈øed him, and fulfilled my duty in every re≈øpect: but ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øuperior fortune and force of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh, and receiving propo≈øals for peace from General MATHEWS, by the≈øe circum≈øtances, but more e≈øpecially by the per≈øua≈øions of Captain CAMPBELL, the ≈øon of Colonel CAMPBELL, who was formerly at Chinaputtan, I was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to come to terms, and delivered up to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral MATHEWS the trea≈øury, property, ≈øtores and keys of the ≈øorts of this country. If I had been di≈øpo≈øed, I had it in my power to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated this collected wealth to other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes; but, from a regard to the high fortune of the KING of ENGLAND, and the uprightne≈øs and integrity of the Engli≈øh people, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded my≈øelf in the number of your ≈øervants, and have determined, with the utmo≈øt ≈øincerity and purity of heart, to ≈øerve you well and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.

               <p>It would be unpardonable in me to let this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion pa≈øs, without expre≈ø≈øing the high ≈øen≈øe I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of Mr. HASTINGS'S politene≈øs, and Sir JOHN MACPHERSON'S kindne≈øs and ho≈øpitality, during my ≈øtay at, Calcutta. As to Mr. HASTINGS, in his public capacity, it would be pre≈øumptuous and injudicious to ≈øay much, as he now ≈øtands for the judgment of the highe≈øt tribunal in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. My own ob≈øervation leads me to con≈øider him as a man of ≈øound, acute and brilliant talents, and of a va≈øt and comprehen≈øive mind‚Äîof manners ≈øociable, amiable, meek and unaffected‚Äîand of a di≈øpo≈øition truly benevolent. His ≈øuperior know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the political intere≈øts of Indo≈øtan, and particularly of the affairs of the Ea≈øt India compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, has never been que≈øtioned; and, if the ≈øuffrage of the people of India may be allowed to decide, his conduct as Governor-General, though, like every thing human, intermixed with error, was, on the whole, great and laudable‚Äîfor I declare I ≈øcarcely ever heard a man in India, Native or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean, cen≈øure him, although he was often the ≈øubject of conver≈øation with all per≈øons and in all companies in the Ea≈øt.</p>
               <p>The ≈øocial virtues of Sir JOHN MACPHERSON are ≈øo well known, that it would be ≈øuperfluous to notice them. The ≈øame friend≈øhip and ho≈øpitality I experienced in his hou≈øe, has been ≈øhared by many, who are not backward in doing him ample ju≈øtice on that head. But his conduct during his
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:033487_0393_0FF7262719D9D410"/>
≈øhort admini≈øtration can be known only by tho≈øe who make the political concerns of India a ≈øubject of ≈øtudious attention: To enter into a detail of his various wi≈øe regulations for the re≈øtoration of the company's affairs, would be de≈øtructive of the end I propo≈øe, which is, by a conci≈øe and ≈øimple ≈øummary of the whole, to render a fair picture of his admini≈øtration ≈øo clear as to be under≈øtood by any per≈øon, however ignorant he may be of the politics of that country, and ≈øo brief as not to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the reading of it.</p>
               <p>Sir JOHN MACPHERSON took the reins of government into his hands on the fir≈øt of February, 1785. He found the company's revenues dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed, and their expenditure increa≈øed, by the continual claims of Proprietors, Directors, and Mini≈øters, to a ≈øhare in the patronage of Mr. HASTINGS‚Äîand a public debt accumulating to an enormous amount. He therefore ≈øaw the nece≈ø≈øity of putting in practice every expedient po≈ø≈øible, and trying every experiment that the ≈øtate of the country ≈øugge≈øted, as likely to promote an increa≈øe of the revenue, a diminution of the public expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture, and a liquidation of the debt.

In fine, he introduced and carried into effect a ≈øy≈øtem of reform which had a mo≈øt ≈øudden and ≈øalutary effect on the Briti≈øh affairs in India; and in an admini≈øtration of only eighteen months, he had the felicity to perceive the fruits of his wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and indu≈øtry maturing‚Äîto receive that be≈øt of earthly rewards, the e≈øteem and applau≈øe of his fellow-citizens‚Äîand to be honoured by the be≈øt of Sovereigns with the dignity of a Baronet.</p>
               <p>While I was at Sir JOHN MACPHERSON'S hou≈øe, I happened, in conver≈øation one day with Mr. MACAULY, Sir JOHN'S Secretary, to be talking over ≈øome part of my adventures; and found to my a≈øtoni≈øhment, that he had, in his route to India, accidentally hired the very ≈øervant whom I had lo≈øt at Trie≈øte by ≈øending him for letters to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice; and Mr. MACAULY a≈ø≈øured me, that he found him po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of all the good qualities I had expected to meet in him: but the poor fellow had died before my arrival at Calcutta, to my great mortification and di≈øappointment.</p>
               <p>As the ≈øea≈øon in which I was to leave Calcutta was very unfavourable for a voyage by ≈øea, and the coa≈øt thereabouts is one of the mo≈øt inho≈øpitable in the world, I ≈øet off by land for Madras, and in my way had an opportunity of ≈øurveying that curious and grote≈øque monument of ≈øuper≈øtitious folly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the Jagranaut Pagoda. It is an immen≈øe, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ≈øtructure, of a kind of pyramidal form, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli≈øhed with devices cut in ≈øtone-work, not more ≈øingular than di≈øgu≈øting. Chri≈øtian idolators, in forming types and figures of divine beings, always endeavour to repre≈øent them with per≈øonal beauty, as proportionate to their divine nature as human ≈økill can make it. Tho≈øe Pagans, on the contrary, in forming their idols, ca≈øt out every ve≈øtige of beauty‚Äîevery thing that, by the con≈øent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is ≈øuppo≈øed to convey plea≈øing ≈øen≈øations; and, in their place, ≈øub≈øtitute the mo≈øt extravagant, unnatural deformity, the mo≈øt loath≈øome na≈øtine≈øs, the mo≈øt di≈øgu≈øting ob≈øcenity. It is not in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to convey an adequate idea of their temples and idols; and if it was, no purpo≈øe could be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered by it, only the excitement of painful and abominable ≈øen≈øations. To keep pace with the figures of their idols, a chief Bramin, by ≈øome accur≈øed artificial means, (by herbs, I believe), has brought to a mo≈øt unnatural form, and enormous dimen≈øions, that which decency forbids me to mention; and the pure and ≈øpotle≈øs women, who from infancy have been ≈øhut up from the ≈øight of men, even of their brothers, are brought to ki≈øs this di≈øgu≈øting and mis≈øhapen mon≈øter, under the prepo≈øterous belief that it promotes fecundity.</p>
               <p>In this Pagoda ≈øtands the figure of Jagranaut, (their god under Brama); and a ≈øightly figure it is truly!‚Äînothing more than a black ≈øtone, in an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular pyramidal form, having two rich diamonds in the top by way of eyes, and a no≈øe and mouth painted red. For this god, five hundred prie≈øts are daily employed in boiling food, which, as he ≈øeldom eats it, they doubtle≈øs convert to their own u≈øe in the evening.</p>
               <p>I ≈øtopped at Vizagapatnam for a few days with Mr. RUSSEL, who was chief of that place. His ≈øtyle of living was ≈øo exactly ≈øimilar to that of an

This gentleman and I had, when mere boys, been ≈øhipmates on our fir≈øt going out to India: a warm friend≈øhip took place between us, which has met with no interruption, but rather increa≈øed from lap≈øe of time, and greater habits of intimacy.

               <p>LEAVING Vizagapatam, I took my route along the coa≈øt, and arrived at Ma≈øulipatam, where I heard rumours of the unfortunate fate of General MATHEWS. This threw ≈øuch a damp upon my ≈øpirits, that all the ho≈øpitality and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Mr. DANIEL, the chief, could ≈øcarcely rai≈øe me from de≈øpondence; and on my arrival at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras, I found the whole amply confirmed.</p>

in ≈øuch mea≈øures as might yet remain to us for promoting the public good. I left Madras, therefore, and pro≈øecuted my journey without any material interruption until I reached Palamcotah, where the chagrin ari≈øing from my various di≈øap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, co-operating with fatigue and climate, threw me into a fit of ≈øickne≈øs, which confined me to my bed for five or ≈øix weeks. Upon recovering a little, I crawled on to Anjengo, where, at the hou≈øe of Mr. HUTCHINSON, the Re≈øident, (who treated me with cordial kindne≈øs), I waited for an opportunity of getting to Bombay, and during that time laid in a ≈øtock of ≈øtrength and ≈øpirits: at length a Europe ≈øhip touched at Anjengo on her way to Bombay, I obtained a pa≈ø≈øage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>At Bombay I found HYAT SAHIB, it having been deemed expedient to ≈øend him away from Bidanore on the approach of TIPPOO with his army, where I received from him a confirmation of what I have ≈øtated re≈øpecting General MATHEWS receiving only two lacks of rupees and a necklace. And now, as peace was negociating between us and TIPPOO, and my remaining on the Malabar coa≈øt could be of little u≈øe, I determined to return to the Carnatic. And here I have an incident to add to the many di≈øagreeable occurrences of my life, in which, with intentions the mo≈øt innocent, I was made the ≈øubject of obloquy and unmerited ≈øcandal.</p>
               <p>Ju≈øt at the time I was leaving Bombay, a young lady, the daughter of a per≈øon formerly of high rank in India, and now a member of Parliament, but who≈øe name it would be u≈øele≈øs to mention, wi≈øhed to return to the Carnatic; and I, at the reque≈øt of her≈øelf, and another lady with whom ≈øhe lived, unguardedly took charge of her during the journey. Before our departure, I reflected upon the difficulties and impropriety of this ≈øtep,
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:033487_0398_0FF72636EB4EAB80"/>
and communicated my ideas to the ladies, who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of li≈øtening to the objections I ≈øtarted, pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed me to fulfil my promi≈øe: I con≈øented, purely from principles of politene≈øs and good-nature. During the cour≈øe of our journey, ≈øhe unfolded to me, of her own accord, certain acts of cruelty and inju≈øtice ≈øhe had ≈øuffered from her father, at the in≈øtigation of her <hi>mother-in-law,</hi> with a ≈øtory of her innocence having fallen, and her reputation hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been de≈øtroyed, by a connection of the lady under who≈øe charge ≈øhe was, and who for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon had pre≈ø≈øed her departure with me; and added, ≈øhe was ≈øo di≈øgu≈øted with India, that ≈øhe determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit it; and entreated me to a≈ø≈øi≈øt her in the accompli≈øhment of her wi≈øhes. I di≈øapproved, in the mo≈øt unqualified terms, of her project‚Äîgave her the be≈øt and mo≈øt di≈øintere≈øted advice‚Äîand, through the whole di≈øagreeable bu≈øine≈øs which was impo≈øed upon me, acted merely with a view to her honour and happine≈øs; and ≈øeveral of the mo≈øt re≈øpectable people in Palamcotah, where ≈øhe pa≈ø≈øed ≈øome time, and at Madras, where ≈øhe afterwards re≈øided, could atte≈øt the delicacy of my conduct towards her, as well as the concern and intere≈øt I took in every thing that was likely to be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to her.</p>
               <p>This is a fair ≈øtatement of the matter; and yet, on account of it, I was mo≈øt infamou≈øly ≈øcandaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the ≈øcandal reached even the ears of my father, whom, however, I ≈øoon ≈øatisfied on that head. But that which ≈øtung me to the quick was the conduct of ≈øome of my own relations, (who, if they even could not ju≈øtify or approve, ought at lea≈øt to have been ≈øilent), in becoming the mo≈øt virulent of my detractors‚Äîthough, when the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of tho≈øe very relations had on former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions been reflected upon, I ≈øtood up and defended them at the imminent hazard of my life. Such conduct appeared to me mo≈øt atrocious; for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:033487_0399_0FF7263878CA96E8"/>
from affection, ≈øelfi≈øhne≈øs, or pride, I always ≈øtrenuou≈øly ≈øupported my relations, if I heard them traduced in their ab≈øence‚Äîand, when I was not able to ju≈øtify their proceedings, at lea≈øt ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed the conver≈øation. To a man who had uniformly acted ≈øo. were there even no reciprocation of family affection, mutual ju≈øtice demanded different treatment from that I experienced, which could have ≈øprung only from depravity of heart, poverty of intellect, and the mo≈øt abject meanne≈øs of ≈øpirit. And what is remarkable on this, as well as on other occa≈øions, tho≈øe who had been under the greate≈øt obligation to my father and my≈øelf, were the mo≈øt inveterate.</p>
               <p>On the death of my father, looking over his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the pre≈øence of the Deputy Sheriff of Argyll, and three other gentlemen, we met with a letter on the ≈øubject from the young lady's father to mine, reflecting in a gro≈øs manner on my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. I directly wrote to that gentleman, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole affair, and demanding ju≈øtice to be done to my reputation. Upon an ecclaireci≈ø≈øement of the matter, he wrote to me a complete apology, acknowledging that he had acted on that occa≈øion through mi≈ørepre≈øentation, and had too ea≈øily given credit to ill-founded reports; and ≈øaying, that as the letter in que≈øtion had, by the peru≈øal of the Deputy Sheriff and other gentlemen, in ≈øome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure become a matter of public notoriety, he thought it incumbent on him to make that apology, and to expre≈øs his ≈øincere regret for any detriment I might have ≈øu≈øtained, by his yielding unguardedly to a ≈øudden impul≈øe of pa≈ø≈øion, cau≈øed, as he was then perfectly convinced, by mi≈øinformation.</p>
               <p>Thus was my character at once cleared of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny which the indu≈øtrious villany of a few had contrived to propagate through every ≈øpot of the earth where I was known.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Before quitting entirely the Malabar coa≈øt, I took a trip to Surat, which amply repaid me for my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p>Here I was received in a very friendly manner by Mr. SETON.

PIGOU, I was treated with great politene≈øs; and Mr. FREEMAN being obliged to leave Canton, and go to Macao, for the recovery of his health, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to accompany him there. I availed my≈øelf of the opportunity: and, as we went all along through the rivers, had an opportunity of ≈øeeing more of the country than many of the Europeans who vi≈øit that country. With the ob≈øervations which I made in the cour≈øe of this excur≈øion and my re≈øidence at Canton, I would furni≈øh you, but that Lord MACARTNEY'S emba≈ø≈øy is ju≈øt returned from that country; and there is every rea≈øon to hope that he, or ≈øome of the gentlemen who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and who po≈ø≈øe≈øs ≈øuperior abilities and more ample materials, will favour the public with a much more perfect account than mine could po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly be.</p>
               <p>While I remained at Canton, a very di≈øagreeable rupture took place between the Factory and the Chine≈øe.

A few days after, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corgo of the ≈øhip was forcibly ≈øeized, and carried into the city: the Council met, and determined to ≈øend for the ≈øailors from the ≈øhips; and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after dark, fifteen or ≈øixteen, boats, with four or five hundred men attempted, in an irregular manner, to come up to Canton‚Äîwere fired upon by the Chine≈øe boats and forts in pa≈ø≈øing, and, with a few men wounded, were compelled to retreat. Nothing could ≈øurpa≈øs the con≈øternation and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion of the Council; and after the mo≈øt humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting language, they were obliged to appea≈øe the Chine≈øe, and ≈øettle the affair by giving up the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ≈øhip to their re≈øentment.</p>

When I was under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain, afterwards General MATHEWS, in his regiment of cavalry, being cantoned at a place called Tuckolam, in the neighbourhood of exten≈øive woods, information was brought us that wild bulls infe≈øted the neighbouring villages, and had killed ≈øome people: we prepared to enter the wood, and de≈øtroy, if po≈ø≈øible, the≈øe ferocious ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which had become the terror and de≈øtruction of the contiguous country. The origin of tho≈øe wild herds was this‚ÄîFrom time immemorial, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious cu≈øtom had prevailed among the Pagan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, of offering a calf to the wood upon the accompli≈øhment of any favourite purpo≈øe, ≈øuch as the ≈øafe delivery of his wife, or the obtaining an employment, &amp;c. In proce≈øs of time, tho≈øe calves bred, and became numerous and incredibly fierce. Independent of protecting the defencele≈øs natives, it was in it≈øelf a mo≈øt intere≈øting kind of hunting. The mode of doing it was this‚ÄîA large party, well mounted, galloping in a body up to a great flock, and marking out the fierce≈øt champion of the whole, attacked him with ≈øwords and pi≈øtols. One day, a bull which was wounded, and thereby rendered more fierce, though not le≈øs vigorous, got po≈øted in ≈øome thick bu≈øhes, in ≈øuch a manner as to be approached only in front: a whim of the mo≈øt extravagant kind came into my head, ≈øugge≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vain-glory and youthful fire‚ÄîI thought it ungenerous for ≈øo many to attack him at once; and, wi≈øhing to have the credit of ≈øubduing him, I di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:033487_0405_0FF7264A30798BC0"/>
from my hor≈øe, and attacked him with a pike: I ≈øoon, however, had cau≈øe to repent this ra≈øh and unwarrantable ≈øtep; it had nearly been fatal to me‚Äîfor the bull ≈øoon threw the pike into the air, and, had it not been for the very gallant exertions of my brother officers, who rode in upon him, and re≈øcued me at the moment that the brute's horns had touched my coat, I mu≈øt have been kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. An Indian officer, who was in my troop, particularly di≈øtingui≈øhed him≈øelf, at the imminent hazard of his life, the bull having to≈ø≈øed his hor≈øe and him≈øelf to a di≈øtance from his horns. At this time I was but eighteen years of age, and had not the judgment to reflect, that if I had been killed, my fate would be attended with only pity or ≈øcorn for my folly; whereas, had I ≈øucceeded, the whole reward of my danger would have been the u≈øele≈øs applau≈øe of ≈øome young≈øters, idle and incen≈øiderate as my≈øelf‚Äîwhile my ra≈øhne≈øs would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated by every man who≈øe good opinion was worth enjoying. One or two people who were pre≈øent at the time, are now living in great repute in England. We ≈øucceeded, however, in driving tho≈øe wild cattle into the interior rece≈ø≈øes of the wood, dividing the fle≈øh of tho≈øe we killed among ≈øuch of the poor S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <salute>HONOURABLE SIRS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE the honour of informing you of the ≈øucce≈øs of your arms on the Malabar coa≈øt. You will have received advices of the out≈øet of the expedition from Bombay, and the general pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it. On the 12th of December, I ≈øailed with a ≈ømall party; and thought proper, of my own accord, to land at Rajamundroog, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any other place‚Äîbecau≈øe, on this part of the coa≈øt. I had the double advantage of being able to ≈øecure my≈øelf until reinforced, and to procure provi≈øions, which I could not have done at Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapore, or any place to the ≈øouthward, by rea≈øon of the numerous garri≈øons, and the vicinity of them to the capital. The mea≈øures and di≈øpo≈øitions of the gentlemen at Bombay were ≈øuch, that I could not place any dependence upon being timely reinforced from thence, or of having any ≈øupply of provi≈øions. Rajamundroog is on the top of a
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:033487_0409_0FF72655CAFE25E0"/>
high hill, and commands the entrance of the be≈øt river on the coa≈øt. We took it by ≈øtorm. The moment we landed, a ≈øhort time was taken up in preparing to move towards Onore; for we had not a cooly, carriage, or bullock, to convey any ≈øtores. The battering cannon, ammunition, provi≈øions, &amp;c. were ≈øent by ≈øea; and the great additions that HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER had made to the fortifications of Onore and fortified I≈øland, prevented my entering the river with the ≈ømall craft, and obliged me to land every thing through a heavy ≈øurf on the beach, and then to cro≈øs the river to the northward of the fort. The≈øe impediments were got over; and a practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach being effected, the a≈ø≈øault was made‚Äî and the garri≈øon, con≈øi≈øting of two thou≈øand five hundred men, were either killed, drowned, or made pri≈øoners.‚ÄîShortly after this event, the troops from the ≈øouthward, under Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel MACLEOD, were landed at Rajamundroog. To wait for a junction, would take up much time: ≈øo, that not a moment ≈øhould be lo≈øt, I embarked, and landed near Cundapore, under the fire of the Bombay Grab and the Intrepid, and immediately ≈øeized a ≈ømall fort that ≈øerved to ≈øecure our ≈øtores. The enemy were in ≈øight, and ≈øeemed numerous: ≈øome pri≈øoners that we took, reckoned them at twelve hundred hor≈øe, one thou≈øand Sepoys, and five hundred Peons. My party was compo≈øed of three hundred and fifty Europeans, ≈øix hundred Sepoys, and four ≈ømall field-pieces‚Äîwith which I marched, fir≈øt towards the enemy, who drew back, and then I proceeded to Cundapore. They incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded my rear very much; but being determined to attack the fort, I only acted on the defen≈øive, and at ≈øeven in the evening got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the fort, and the ≈øeveral redoubts that commanded the river. The grand object of the expedition, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon Bidanore, remained to be undertaken; and much ≈øerious reflection it required before the
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:033487_0410_0FF726586239B030"/>
hazardous enterprize ≈øhould be determined on.‚Äî Your Honours will now take a view of the ≈øtate of my army: No carriage-bullock, and the few draft not able to draw eight light field-pieces‚Äînot a cooly to carry mu≈øquet, ammunition or provi≈øions ‚Äînot a tent‚Äîand many officers, HIS MAJESTY'S in particular, had not a ≈øingle ≈øervent‚Äîneither bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock or ≈øheep to be had, the enemy having drove them off. The army, at this time, con≈øi≈øted of about eleven hundred effective Europeans, and three thou≈øand Sepoys. The di≈øtance from Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapore to the foot of the Ghaut is thirty miles, through a woody country: the enemy's army had been reinforced, and lay in the way. The reports of the ≈øtrength of the various works that defended the pa≈øs up the mountains, was ≈øuch as gave me but very faint hope of ≈øucce≈øs; and the difficulty of ≈øupplying my troops with rice, was almo≈øt of it≈øelf ≈øufficient to deter a per≈øon from the attempt. However, having po≈øitive orders to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Bidanore, I re≈øolved to make a trial, and i≈ø≈øued directions for the march. We had not gone ≈øix miles, before the enemy oppo≈øed us in force. We pu≈øhed forwards; and, by the effect of well ≈øerved artillery, and the ≈øteadine≈øs of the men, the enemy retired as we advanced. The ≈økirmi≈øh continued about three hours‚Äîafter which we were left to pur≈øue our route unmole≈øted; nor did the enemy make any ≈øtand till we were on the fourth day's march, within three miles of the pa≈øs‚Äîwhere, the ground being favourable, they attempted oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were roughly treated, lo≈øing, by the bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet and ≈øhot, above three hundred men. They were pur≈øued to a ≈ømall fort, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately abandoned; and then fled to the fir≈øt barrier or entrance of the pa≈øs. This was a line of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonry that covered all the open ground, and was clo≈øed by woods to the right and left. Upon ≈øix ba≈øtions were mounted fifteen pieces of cannon;
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:033487_0411_0FF7265B57F193E0"/>
and on the left was a work on a ≈øteep mountain, with two twelve pounders. This altogether had too formidable an appearance to attack in front; but having reconnoitred the right, I imagined that the flank might be turned by a≈øcending the hill through the wood. Early in the morning, two parties were formed‚Äîone to attempt the flank, the other to e≈øcalade the wall; but the enemy ≈øaved us that trouble by evacuating the place. This was a happy moment to try the pa≈øs; for the enemy, by felling trees, &amp;c. would have thrown ≈øo many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacles in the way, that the want of provi≈øion would have compelled me to relinqui≈øh the de≈øign. A party was in≈øtantly ordered to follow the enemy up the hill, which, with little lo≈øs, gained the ≈øecond barrier, on which were mounted eleven guns. Fifty of the enemy were killed or taken at this work. Having this ≈øucce≈øs, I relieved the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hau≈øted by fre≈øh detachments, which excited emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and encouraged the ardour of the Sepoys; for, to the unremitting exertions of this branch of your troops is due the honour of this day. Battery after battery was taken; and the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the ≈øort on the top of the Ghaut, about five in the afternoon, called Hyderghur, crowned the whole. At this fort we found mounted thirty pieces of cannon, from twenty-four to four pounders; and at the different works in the pa≈øs, forty others, from four to twelve.</p>
            <p>When we contemplated the numerous redoubts and the height of the Ghaut, and were told by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners that we had drove off ≈øeventeen thou≈øand men, including di≈ømounted cavalry, regular Sepoys, and match-lock Peons, we could not con≈øider the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory we had gained as due to us‚Äîour weak efforts would have been in vain. The progre≈øs of your arms is to be a≈øcribed to the Divine will. In the cour≈øe of this war, Providence has been peculiarly bountiful‚ÄîWhen we were in want of rice, we
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:033487_0412_0FF7265DDFA4E038"/>
were ≈øure to find a ≈øupply left for our u≈øe by the enemy‚Äîwhen our mu≈øquet-ammunition was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, the enemy's magazines furni≈øhed us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly‚Äîcannon we found in every fort, and ≈øuch quantities of warlike ≈øtores, that we are apt to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that HYDER ≈øupplied all his garri≈øons from this coa≈øt and from Bidanore. Hyderghur is about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles from Hydernagur, <hi>alias</hi> Bidanore, the capital of the Province.</p>
            <p>In the night of the day that we gained the Ghaut, I was vi≈øited by Captain DONALD CAMPBELL, the ≈øon of Colonel CHARLES CAMPBELL. He had been wrecked off the coa≈øt, was ≈øeized, and kept in irons, until the approach of this army cau≈øed the Jemadar to relea≈øe him, to employ him as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador. His me≈ø≈øage was, that the Jemadar hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lo≈øt his Ma≈øter (HYDER), and being upon bad terms with TIPPOO SAHIB, would willingly put him≈øelf under the protection of the Company, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the management of the country was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to him. The idea of getting po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the capital and the forts of the kingdom towards Seringapatam, as well as the very great advantage I might expect from his experience, abilities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, with the weak ≈øtate of my army, induced me to clo≈øe with the propo≈øal; and I ≈øent him a cowl, ≈øignifying that his power and influence ≈øhould not be le≈ø≈øened. This, tho' not drawn with a pen of a lawyer, was equal in value to the capital of Bidanore. Captain CAMPBELL returned with it, and was to tell the Jemadar that I ≈øhould march in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>he morning.</p>
            <p>Not expecting the great ≈øucce≈øs that we had met with by forcing the pa≈øs on the main road, I had detached Lieutenant-Colonel MACLEOD to the left to a≈øcend the Ghaut through a narrow path, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attack Hyderghur in the tear. The ab≈øence of this detachment, and the fatigue of the former day, reduced my party to about four hundred Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:033487_0413_0FF726606B3B8CF8"/>
and ≈øeven hundred Sepoys; and all my guns were at the bottom of the Ghaut. With this detachment I moved towards Bidanore, and was within a mile of the walls before any me≈ø≈øage came from Captain CAMPBELL or the Jemadar: but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to apprehend in the field from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic-≈øtruck enemy, we continued our march until the welcome approach of Captain CAMPBELL a≈ø≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me the place was our own. On entering it, I was plea≈øed to ≈øee about four hundred of your Sepoys that had been taken in the Carnatic, who offered me their ≈øervice. Upon vi≈øiting the Jemadar, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated my a≈ø≈øurances, that while he behaved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the Company, the management of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ≈øhould be continued to him; and, although the ≈øword mu≈øt be in your hands, that he ≈øhould have as much power and influence as his ≈øtation required and that you would not refu≈øe ≈øettling upon him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ample allowances. The enemy being in force, and my army much weakened, with other di≈øagreeable matters that occured, prevented my further advance than to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of two forts to the Ea≈øtward; for, being apprehen≈øive that the Killidar of Manga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore would not deliver up that place to the order of HYAT SAHIB, and con≈øidering that famous ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of more con≈øequence to your affairs than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring territory beyond the mountains, I held my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in readine≈øs to march that way, and was forced to lay ≈øiege to it. A practicable breach being made, the Killidar thought proper to ≈øurrender it. Upon this happy event give me leave to congratulate you; for it partly ≈øecures our conque≈øts from Carwar to Cananore. There are two or three places that I have not been able to ≈øummons; but as the≈øe garri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot expect any ≈øuccour, they will fall of cour≈øe.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given your honours a ≈øhort recital, from the fir≈øt landing of your arms on the 12th of December, to the reduction of Mangalore on the 9th
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:033487_0414_0FF72661F6F68E80"/>
of March; in which ≈øhort time a ≈øeries of ≈øucce≈øs has attended us that can hardly be paralleled. All the enemy's marine has fallen in our hands, among which are eight ≈øhips of the line, either built or on the ≈øtocks; and five of them might be ≈øent to ≈øea in a ≈øhort time. After informing you of the happy and glorious ≈øucce≈øs of your arms, it is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to tell you, that di≈ø≈øention in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on account of plunder and booty, has ari≈øen to ≈øuch a height as to threaten open mutiny. I have informed your Honours of the terms that the Jemadar required, and that I in your name granted; and you know in how peacable a manner this capital was re≈øigned to you. I am ≈øorry to ≈øay, that HIS MAJESTY'S officers have been foremo≈øt in the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and that the agents appointed by them have occa≈øioned me much trouble and anxiety, and a great deal of di≈øcontent throughout the army. I ≈øhall ≈øend you copies of the ≈øeveral letters that have pa≈ø≈øed, for your determination. They may ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that I have appropriated trea≈øure to my own u≈øe, or bargained to re≈øtore the private property of the Jemadar to him; or that I ≈øhould agree that he ≈øhould call all trea≈øure and jewels his private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to the exclu≈øion of what of right ≈øhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Honourable Company or the captors. I have only to a≈ø≈øure your Honours, that I have made no bargain whatever, either public or private, but what was expre≈ø≈øed in the cowl ≈øent from Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derghur, to which Captain CAMPBELL was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs: and as I have frequently mentioned to my friends, that I would not receive a pre≈øent of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence without the con≈øent of the Honourable Company, I ≈øhall inform you, that on my fir≈øt vi≈øit the Jemadar in≈øi≈øted on making me a pre≈øent of a lack of rupees; and when he plea≈øed to give a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the army of two lacks and thirty thou≈øand of rupees, which ≈øum waits your plea≈øure, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øted I would accept of another lack of rupees.
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:033487_0415_0FF72667C9AF2FE0"/>
To both of the≈øe reque≈øts re≈øpecting my≈øelf, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that provided your Honours would give me leave, I ≈øhould certainly embrace that fortunate moment to gain an independence, and ≈øhall wait your orders as to the di≈øpo≈øal of two lacks of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pees. How far my former and the pre≈øent ≈øervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may entitle me to your good opinion, and to your acquie≈øcence in thus rewarding me, is left to the genero≈øity of your Honours: but I beg that you will believe, that during the cour≈øe of my ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, every thing of a ≈øimiliar nature ≈øhall be laid before you.</p>
            <p>If it were po≈ø≈øible to ≈øatisfy the avidity of a body of men, this little army would have a ≈øuffiency of honour and profit to fill the mo≈øt greedy; but the infirmities of nature are not to be controuled by rea≈øon. Avarice of the mo≈øt pernicious tendency has pervaded the limits of ≈øen≈øe, and ≈øtepped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of duty. The army, not content with acquiring, at the different places, that has been taken on the coa≈øt in ≈øhips of war, naval ≈øtores, merchandize, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in goods of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds at Bidanore, which altogether the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madar ≈øays may be valued at thirty lacks of pago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das; they ≈øeek to deprive the Jemadar of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property, under pretence of the lawful rights of war; and a≈ø≈øume a ≈øtyle and manner in their clamours and united addre≈ø≈øes, that appears inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to force from me what I think ought to be pre≈øerved for the public ≈øervice, and for the benefit of the Honourable Company. The manner that the fort and city was delivered to the company, does not authori≈øe me to touch private property; and the cowl implies a perfect ≈øecurtiy for all ≈øuch. Would your honours be plea≈øed, that by any rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious action of your Commander in Chief, that he or the troops ≈øhould forfeit the good opinion that may be entertained of them from their rapid ≈øucce≈øs, or that the public ≈øervice ≈øhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered

as a ≈øecondary object? Our name has fallen almo≈øt to contempt, but, as far as lays in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it ≈øhall be recovered, if not rai≈øed to its former eminence.</p>
