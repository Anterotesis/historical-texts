            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AMBITIOUS to avoid both the ſtyle and the ſentiment of common dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more frequently the incenſe of adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, than the reſult of truth, I only aſk the illuſtrious Waſhington to permit a lady of his acquaintance, to introduce to the public, under his patronage, a ſmall volume, written as the amuſement of ſolitude, at a period when every active member of ſociety was engaged, either in the field, or the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inet, to reſiſt the ſtrong hand of foreign domination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023035_0003_0FBAE103E27303F8"/>THE approbation of one who has united all hearts in the field of conqueſt, in the lap of peace, and at the head of the government of the United States, muſt, for a time, give countenance to a writer, who, claiming the honour of private friendſhip, hopes for this indulgence: But it muſt be a bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in the paths of literature, who dreams of fame, in any degree commenſurate with the duration of laurels reaped by an hero, who has led the armies of America to glory, victory and independence.</p>
            <p>THIS may, perhaps, be an improper place to make many obſervations on a revolution, that may eventually ſhake the proud ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of European deſpotiſm; yet you, ſir, (who have borne ſuch a diſtinguiſhed and honourable part in the great conflict, till
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023035_0004_0FBAE105AC225AE8"/>
the nations, wearied with ſlaughter, gave truce to the miſeries of man) will permit me to obſerve, that, connected by conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, or friendſhip, with many of the principal characters who aſſerted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the rights of an injured country, the mind has been naturally led to contemplate the magnitude, both of the cauſes and the conſequences, of a convulſion that has been felt from the eaſtern borders of the Atlantic, to the weſtern wilds.</p>
            <p>FEELING much for the diſtreſſes of America, in the dark days of her affliction, a faithful record has been kept, of the moſt material tranſactions, through a period that has engaged the attention, both of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and the politician; and, if life is ſpared, a juſt trait of the moſt diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023035_0005_0FBAE106E883D380"/>
characters, either for valour, virtue, or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm; for perfidy, intrigue, inconſiſtency, or ingratitude, ſhall be faithfully tranſmitted to poſterity, by one, who unites in the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral wiſh, that you, ſir, may continue to preſide in the midſt of your brethren, until nature aſks the aid of retirement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to tranquilize the laſt ſtages of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life.</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>ALMOST every page of the ſtory of Rome, exhibits a tragedy, without the exaggeration of poetic fiction; yet there are few of its intereſting ſcenes, that have not furniſhed the machinery for ſome dramatic work. But, amidſt the innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able writers, that almoſt every age has produced, the author of a piece, now offered the public, does not recollect to have ſeen the weakneſs and cruelty of <hi>Valentinian</hi>—the character of <hi>Petronius Maximus</hi>—the reſentment, indiſcretion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of <hi>Edoxia</hi>—(the more immediate cauſes of the inva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the imperial city, by the Vandals)—choſen for the ſubject of theatrical inſtruction.</p>
            <p>The ſubverſion of the weſtern empire, and the Sack of the city of Rome, by <hi>Genſeric,</hi> form an era in the revolution of human affairs, that ſtrikes the mind with peculiar ſolemnity: Perhaps, at that period, the character of man was ſunk to the loweſt ſtage of depravity. Debilitated by the habits of every ſpecies of luxury, a long ſeries of tragical events, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual apprehenſions of proſcription, or death; the powers of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023035_0009_0FBAE11169AD8E40"/>
the mind were, at the ſame time, obſcured by the ſuperſtitions of weak, uninformed chriſtians, blended with the barbariſic and ignorance of the darker ages.</p>
            <p>Thus an impenetrable cloſed was thrown over the religious and political inſtitutions, both of the Roman and the Gothic world; which haſtened on the deſtruction of the former, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exhibiting any thing more honourable to the genius and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of mankind, in the eſtabliſhment of the latter; nor have more enlightened and poliſhed ages been taught, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to ſhun the luxurious vices, or the abſurd ſyſtems of policy, which have frequently corrupted, diſtracted, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the beſt conſtituted republics; as well as divided and overturned the ſtrong fabric of monarchic government.</p>
            <p>In tracing the riſe, the character, the revolutions, and the full of the moſt politic and brave, the moſt inſolent and ſelfiſh people, the world ever exhibited, the hero and the moraliſt may find the moſt ſublime examples of valour and virtue; and the philoſopher the moſt humiliating leſſons to the pride of man, in the turpitude of ſome of their capital characters: While the extenſive dominions of that once celebrated nation, their haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023035_0010_0FBAE1130E415678"/>
uſurpations and ſplendid crimes, have for ages furniſhed the hiſtorian and the poet with a field of ſpeculation, adapted to his own peculiar talents. But if the writer of the <hi>Sack of Rome</hi> has miſtaken her's, ſhe will, doubtleſs, be forgiven, as there have been inſtances of men of the beſt abilities who have fallen into the ſame error.</p>
            <p>There is but little mixture of fable in the narration, and, I hope, a juſt purity of ſtile has been obſerved, while the writer has aimed at moral improvement, by an exhibition of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and miſery into which mankind are often plunged by an unwarrantable indulgence of the diſcordant paſſions of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind.</p>
            <p>Theatrical amuſements may, ſometimes, have been proſtituted to the purpoſes of vice; yet, in an age of taſte and refinement, leſſons of morality, and the conſequences of deviation, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be as ſucceſsfully enforced from the ſtage, as by modes of inſtruction, leſs cenſured by the ſevere; while, at the ſame time, the exhibition of great hiſtorical events, opens a field of contemplation to the reflecting and philoſophic mind.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have often requeſted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſtile of the drama, from the hand of one ever fond of gratifying her friends; though not certain whether this requeſt aroſe from a love of literary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; from a curioſity that has affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its baſis; or the ſtrong attachment of friendſhip; yet I have no doubt you will be pleaſed with the compliance.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible the writing an unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Tragedy, requires judgement, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and taſte; and have felt ſuch a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the attempt, as nothing would have overcome but the repeated requeſt of a very dear friend.</p>
            <p>THOUGH the piece now put into your hand may not afford equal entertainment with the compoſitions of a Corneille, a Racine, or a Crebillon, yet I dare ſay, from your partiality, you will find pleaſure in your cloſet, though it ſhould not be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored</hi> on the ſtage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:023035_0098_0FBAE03EB5563490"/>YOU have never named me a ſubject, though you prohibited an American, and ſeemed to have no predilection in favour of Britiſh incident; therefore, notwithſtanding events in the weſtern world have outran imagination; notwithſtanding the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of proſpect a riſing empire diſplays, and the many tragical ſcenes exhibited on an iſland whence it derived its origin, I have recurred to an ancient ſtory in the annals of Spain, in her laſt ſtruggles for liberty, previous to the complete eſtabliſhment of deſpotiſm by the family of Ferdinand.</p>

            <p>WHAT a field for genius! What a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of capacity, both in ſcience, in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in politics, does this revolution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit! Certainly, enough to fire the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and light up every noble ſpark in the boſom of thoſe who are in the morning of life.</p>

            <p>PERHAPS the ſubject I have choſen for the machinery of a tragedy, may be more proper for an epic, than a dramatic poem; yet I hope it will be acceptable in its preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent garb, and that the candor of the public will be exerciſed, not ſo much for the ſake of the ſex, as the deſign of the writer, who wiſhes only to cultivate the ſentiments of public and private virtue in whatſoever falls from her pen.</p>

               <head>To the Hon. J. WINTHROP, Eſq.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Who, on the American Determination, in <hi>1774,</hi> to ſuſpend all Commerce with Britain, (except for the real Neceſſaries of life) requeſted a poetical Liſt of the Articles the Ladies might compriſe under that Head.</p>
               </argument>
               <lg>
                  <l>FREEDOM may weep, and tyranny prevail,</l>
                  <l>And ſtubborn patriots either frown, or rail;</l>
                  <l>Let them of grave economy talk loud,</l>
                  <l>Prate prudent meaſures to the liſt'ning crowd;</l>
                  <l>With all the rhetoric of ancient ſchools,</l>
                  <l>Deſpiſe the mode, and faſhion's modiſh fools;</l>
                  <l>Or ſhew fair liberty, who us'd to ſmile,</l>
                  <l>The guardian goddeſs of Britannia's iſle,</l>
                  <l>In ſable weeds, anticipate the blow,</l>
                  <l>Aim'd at Columbia by her royal foe;</l>
                  <l>And mark the period when inglorious kings</l>
                  <l>Deal round the curſes that a Churchill ſings.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But what's the anguiſh of whole towns in tears,</l>
                  <l>Or trembling cities groaning out their fears?</l>
                  <l>The ſtate may totter on proud ruin's brink,</l>
                  <l>The ſword be brandiſh'd, or the bark may ſink;</l>
                  <l>Yet ſhall Clariſſa check her wanton pride,</l>
                  <l>And lay her female ornaments aſide?</l>
                  <l>Quit all the ſhining pomp, the gay parade,</l>
                  <l>The coſtly trappings that adorn the maid?</l>
                  <l>What! all the aid of foreign looms refuſe!</l>
                  <l>(As beds of tulips ſtrip'd of richeſt hues,</l>
                  <l>Or the ſweet bloom that's nip'd by ſudden froſt,</l>
                  <l>Clariſſa reigns no more a favorite toaſt.</l>
                  <l>For what is virtue, or the winning grace,</l>
                  <l>Of ſoft good humour, playing round the face;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="209" facs="unknown:023035_0206_0FBADFE3E3EAC748"/>Or what thoſe modeſt antiquated charms,</l>
                  <l>That lur'd a Brutus to a Portia's arms;</l>
                  <l>Or all the hidden beauties of the mind,</l>
                  <l>Compar'd with gauze, and taſſels well combin'd?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This mighty theme produc'd a long debate,</l>
                  <l>On the beſt plan to ſave a ſinking ſtate;</l>
                  <l>The oratorial fair, as they inclin'd,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Lamira wiſh'd that freedom might ſucceed,</l>
                  <l>But to ſuch terms what female ere agreed?</l>
                  <l>To Britiſh marts forbidden to repair,</l>
                  <l>(Where ev'ry lux'ry tempts the blooming fair,)</l>
                  <l>Equals the rigour of thoſe ancient times</l>
                  <l>When Pharaoh, harden'd as a G— in crimes,</l>
                  <l>Plagu'd Iſrael's race, and tax'd them by a law,</l>
                  <l>Demanding brick, when deſtitute of ſtraw;</l>
                  <l>Miraculouſly led from Egypt's port,</l>
                  <l>They lov'd the faſhions of the tyrant's court;</l>
                  <l>Sigh'd for the leeks, and waters of the Nile,</l>
                  <l>As we for gewgaws from Britannia's iſle;</l>
                  <l>That haughty iſle, whoſe mercenary hand,</l>
                  <l>Spreads wide confuſion round this fertile land,</l>
                  <l>Deſtroys the concord, and breaks down the ſhrine,</l>
                  <l>By virtue rear'd, to harmony divine.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>

                  <l>Whoſe hoſtile mandates, ſent from venal courts,</l>
                  <l>Rob the fair vintage, and blockade our ports;</l>

                  <l>Let us reſolve on a ſmall ſacrifice,</l>

                  <l>Good as Cornelia, or a Pompey's wife,</l>
                  <l>We'll quit the uſeleſs vanities of life.</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A ſharp debate enſu'd on wrong and right,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But does Helvidius, vigilant and wiſe,</l>
