            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS <hi>France</hi> has hitherto, by the Means of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> chiefly, been prevented from enſlaving the World and Mankind, they are become of Courſe our implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt inveterate Enemies, and of late every where our Competitors in Trade, and, as one of the Links of their grand Syſtem, Encroachers upon our Territories; regardleſs of all Faith, Oaths, or Treaties, their national Polity being one continued Train of Chicane and Deceit; witneſs, the late au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious Inſult of an abandoned Crew of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's own Subjects, inſtigated and ſupported by that grand Monarch, upon the Liberties of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>THEIR late Encroachments upon his Majeſty's Rights and Territories, in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and in <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s-<hi>Bay,</hi> with the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Circumſtances, are ſo well known, that I believe I need not mention them. And now they ſeem avowedly, and with much Aſſurance, to open the ſame ſhameful Scene upon this Continent, which they have indeed been long practiſing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. Thus by Syſtem they are become the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of the Peace of Mankind, and worſe than a Peſt, for there is no End of it to every conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Society; we are not the only Objects of their Reſentment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007223_0003_102B3FF4AB33C8B0"/>
THAT vaſt Sums have been expended upon their royal Geographers, and Hydrographers, in order that their Maps and Sea Charts may quadrate with their political Syſtem of Encroachments upon the Territories of other Nations, is apparent to the whole World; and thus by eſtabliſhing their imaginary Rights by Pen and Ink, they are determined to confirm their Accuracy by a forcible Poſſeſſion. Another Piece of Fineſſe, or <hi>French</hi> Policy, is that of burying Leaden Plates up and down this Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, with certain Inſcriptions, in order to form new Pretenſions; but in this, I am told, they were diſcovered by ſome of our <hi>Indians,</hi> who, tho' not pleaſed, were diverted with the Whim, as I am confident the World muſt be with their other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, being equally ridiculous. What Figure we are like to make in this Diſpute; we, I ſay, who are ſo nearly concerned in the Event, and who muſt become, in all Probability, the firſt Sacrifice; we, to whom, in a great Meaſure, all this Impertinence is owing, who by an ill-judged Frugality meanly neglected the Preventing their firſt Intruſions at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and that important Paſs at <hi>Niagara,</hi> and ſome more of the like Kind, together with a total Neglect of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, I ſhall not take upon me to determine; nor ſhall I enter into a Diſcuſſion of the Reaſons of that Neglect, or to whom owing, at this Time; this is not the Time to retroſpect, we muſt now look forward. Our Caſe at preſent is neither more nor leſs than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>French</hi> are now drawing a Line along the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Settlements in every Province, from the Mouth of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> to the Mouth of <hi>Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi,</hi> and building Forts to ſecure the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Paſſes on the Lakes, that form the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; by which they will effectually cut off all Intercourſe and Traffick, between us and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007223_0004_102B3FF65FC12E50"/>inhabiting the inland Countries; and likewiſe compel thoſe who are Neighbours and Allies, by reaſon of the abſolute Dependance they muſt have on the <hi>French</hi> for every thing they want, as well as for their Liberty of Hunting and Fiſhing, to fall under their Subjection, or ſtarve. It therefore, I think, behoveth us at this Time to exert our utmoſt Endeavours, by all the Means in our Power, to prevent ſo bad a Neighbourhood. It is a Maxim in <hi>England,</hi> to avoid, if poſſible, the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of a great Lord; by the ſame Parity of Reaſon, what ought we then not to do, to avoid that of an ambitious, all-graſping Monarch, whoſe Will, often the Caprice of a Miſs, or a Favourite, is the Law; <hi>For ſuch is our Pleaſure,</hi> is their whole <hi>Corpus Juris.</hi> One great Step, if not the greateſt, to this grand Monarch's univerſal Syſtem, is that of being poſſeſs'd of this Northern Continent of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> a Territory boundleſs as is his Ambition, in which he has made not a little Progreſs.</p>
            <p>THE vaſt Anxiety the Court and Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> were under on the Loſs of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> eſteemed the Key and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> of <hi>North America,</hi> and which I doubt will be equally baneful to us as ever the other was to <hi>Britain,</hi> together with other numerous Circumſtances, and indeed from every Step taken, may convince us, that the Plan for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating the Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> out of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> has been long in Agitation; the <hi>French</hi> lay their Plans of this Kind at a Diſtance, but ſeldom loſe the Point in view.</p>
            <p>THEY have for many Years been indefatigable in their Endeavours to ſeduce our <hi>Indians;</hi> we on the other Side, have been as indolent as they could wiſh; and if ever they ſucceed in this Point effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, they will have little elſe to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007223_0005_102B3FF833485390"/>
REGULAR Troops are of little Uſe here, further than to fight from behind Walls; it is by Means of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and by them only, that any Stop can be put to thoſe wicked Encroachments. And this is as yet very far from being either impoſſible or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, if all Hands ſet heartily about it; the very <hi>French</hi> themſelves openly upbraid us with our Indolence, and Diviſions, which they acknowledge to be their greateſt Security. It is evident therefore I think to a Demonſtration, that if we continue to neglect our <hi>Indians</hi> much longer, or, if this Plan of a Congreſs for a Confederacy ſhould prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive through the Caprice of any Man, or Number of Men, or by any ill-judged Frugality, that we may from thence date the Commencement of the the Diſſolution and Deſtruction of theſe Colonies: As for my own Part I ſincerely believe the <hi>Indians</hi> will go off in a Body, and in that Caſe we ſhall moſt certainly be the firſt undone, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will ſuffer, and all <hi>Europe</hi> will ſooner or later feel the Effects of it. Thoſe therefore, who are more immediately concerned, and with whom we have entruſted the Security of our Lives and Fortunes, have not a little to anſwer for to the preſent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as well as to thoſe who are to come after us, for their Conduct upon this critical Occaſion.</p>
            <p>LET us for once ſuppoſe the <hi>French,</hi> by their Fortifications and Lines of Communication, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Maſters, either by Force, or Friendſhip of the <hi>Indians;</hi> how eaſy a Matter would it be for them with a ſmall naval Force to put us between two Fires? A ſmall Force of regular Troops to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <hi>Albany,</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> at the ſame Time, while their Blood-hounds are burning and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacring our Out-Settlements, is, in my humble Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Plan laid, and which they will put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution ſooner or later, according as they become
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007223_0006_102B3FF9D56F4248"/>Maſters of the <hi>Indians;</hi> and what a Cataſtrophe will this create!</p>
            <p>WHERE is now that Champion of our Liberties, who ſo worthily exerted himſelf in the Caſes of <hi>Rotten Row,</hi> and <hi>rotten black Gowns?</hi> Let him now ſtand forth, our All being at Stake, and diſplay his Eloquence; a <hi>Philippic</hi> or two; for never were Caſes more parallel than that of <hi>Greece</hi> and ours, when <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> by his powerful Eloquence, raiſed ſuch a Spirit of Liberty in his Countrymen the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> ready to ſink, and upon the Brink of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as ſaved his Country; a few <hi>Philippics,</hi> I ſay, in that Gentleman's perſwaſive Manner, I am ſerious, might have wonderful Effects, and eternize his Memory. And the Caſes being ſo much alike, the ſame Reaſoning, with a very few <hi>mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis,</hi> will hold; we moſt certainly want the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our beſt Heads and Hands, to infuſe ſome publick Spirit amongſt us, and to raiſe us out of our preſent Lethargy.</p>
            <p>LET us not, however, deſpair, we are not yet paſt Redemption; we have Hands, and I hope Hearts enough, if properly employed, to recover all our paſt Lapſes and Miſteps. But, as a worthy Patriot upon the like Occaſion obſerves, this muſt indeed be very burdenſome; for if the greateſt State in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> animated by the Proſpect of univerſal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, enabled by the abſolute Power of its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw every <hi>Shilling</hi> out of private Purſes into the publick Purſe; and aſſiſted by the perſonal Service of all its People, through the national Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and martial Habit of the Country; if ſuch a State will preſs the Ruin of its Neighbours with an obſtinate Expence of all its Blood, and all its Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, no Man can think it is an eaſy Taſk to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or reſiſt a Power which ſhall act this Part: But you are to conſider, ſays he, not ſo much the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007223_0007_102B3FFCCD4EB530"/>Difficulties you muſt now encounter to defend your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in this Conjuncture, as the certain Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of your ever being able to do it again in any other, if you loſe the preſent Opportunity. I ſhall only therefore beg Leave to ſay as to the State of our Affairs, the Fact is this, that ſuch is the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſuch the Ambition, ſuch the deſtructive Plan laid down by <hi>France;</hi> a plan to divide and enſlave the World; a Plan purſued with the utmoſt Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy through every Difficulty for above a Century paſt; ſo far my Author; how juſtly applicable to the preſent Situation of our Affairs, judge O Reader!</p>
            <p>BUT as pointing out thoſe impending Evils, without offering, or attempting to offer at a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a Practice too common, and is only doing Things by Halves, I ſhall beg Leave, with much Submiſſion, to offer ſuch Hints as have occurred to me from long Obſervation, which I hope ſome abler Hand will take up and improve with Candour (avaunt Criticiſm) I invite them, nay I challenge it, as they will anſwer the Contrary to their God, their King, their Country, and Poſterity.</p>
            <p>THAT we have loſt, in a great Meaſure, all that ſincere Friendſhip and Attachment which did once ſubſiſt between us and our <hi>Indians,</hi> upon which, from the Malevolence of a wicked Neighbourhood, our Being, in this Part of the World, chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, is notorious to the World; by what, or by whoſe Means, as before, I ſhall not take upon me to diſcuſs, the Taſk is invidious; I ſhall only beg Leave to obſerve, that the injurious and villainous Treatment they have met with for theſe many Years, in their Way of Trade, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Redreſs, together with the proper Uſe our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies have made of it, who, by all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, however they may treat their <hi>Indians</hi> in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007223_0008_102B3FFED9EFB1B8"/>other Matters, in that of Traffick they are always honeſtly and juſtly dealt by, are the Sources of our Misfortunes. Now in order to regain their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friendſhip effectually, it will be neceſſary, in my humble Opinion, in the firſt Place to eſtabliſh ſome good and ſufficient Laws for the Regulation of their Trade, and for ſummary and ſevere Juſtice in caſe of Abuſes: Under the Government of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> they have ſeveral, which appear to me very reaſonable, and may be improved; one I ſhall here beg Leave to inſert, it is but ſhort.</p>
            <p>BY an Act of the 12th of GEO, it is enacted, <hi>That Proviſions, Cloathing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſuitable for carrying on a Trade with the</hi> Indians, <hi>not exceeding the Value of</hi> Nine Thouſand Pounds, <hi>be procured at the Coſt of the Province, and the Produce applied for ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Indians, <hi>by ſuch Perſons as ſhall be annually choſen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who ſhall annually produce fair Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of their Proceedings; which Supplies ſhall be lodged at,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That a ſuitable Perſon ſhall be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen annually at each of the Places where any of the Goods are lodged; which Truck-maſters ſhall be under Oath, and give ſufficient Security for the faithful Execution of that Truſt, and ſuch Inſtructions as they ſhall receive from Time to Time; and ſhall keep fair Accounts of their Trade and Dealings with the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, <hi>and ſhall return the ſame, with the Produce, to the Perſon or Perſons who ſhall be appointed to ſupply them with Goods; and they ſhall not trade with the</hi> Indians, <hi>on their own Account. That the Truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters ſell to the</hi> Indians <hi>at the Prices ſet in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voices ſent them from Time to Time, without any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thereon; and ſhall allow the</hi> Indians <hi>for their Furs, and other Goods, as the Market ſhall be at</hi> Boſton, <hi>according to the laſt Advices from the Perſon or Perſons that ſhall ſupply them with the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of equal Goodneſs: Rum to be given to the</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:007223_0009_102B400066F05688"/>Indians <hi>in moderate Quantities, by the Truck-maſters only: No Perſon whatſoever, other than the Truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, and they only as ſuch, ſhall or may preſume, by themſelves, or any other for them, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, to ſell, truck, barter, or exchange to any</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>or</hi> Indians, <hi>any Wares, Merchandize, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, within ſix Miles of any Truck-houſe, on Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of forfeiting</hi> Fifty Pounds, <hi>or ſix Months Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SOME good Laws of this Kind would go a great Way to anſwer all our Purpoſes, if duly executed. The <hi>French</hi> treat <hi>Indians</hi> much <hi>à la Cavalier,</hi> and often threaten to cut them off, if they do not join with them in their Excurſions, and will be as good as their Words, ſo ſoon as they have compleated their Schemes; and of this the <hi>Indians</hi> are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Apprehenſions, and therefore have ſtill a Hankering or Leaning towards our Intereſt, which, if properly managed, will ſoon reconcile them; they are far from being inſenſible that it is their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to be on our Side, or that they can at any Time, or any where, be ſo well ſupplied. They are at this Time upon the Ballance, between Hopes and Fears, and if we do not now fix them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we may bid them fairly adieu! What leſs can we expect from them? we, who have been cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abuſing them for ſo many Years, without Redreſs, in a moſt abominable Manner, of which take the following Specimen: Without affording them the leaſt Aſſiſtance in any Shape, beſides that of a few Preſents from Time to Time, which in Reality are of no Manner of Uſe to them, being divided at <hi>Albany,</hi> the far greater Part remains with thoſe conſcientious Handlers there, for Rum, ſo that the Caſtles know little more of the Matter than that there was a Preſent made. Theſe however are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007223_0010_102B40021C300C98"/>but Palliatives, there muſt be ſomething more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial in the Caſe:</p>
            <p>HAVING, as above, made proper Regulations for the Trade, and that they may be no longer ſo unmercifully impoſed upon, both in Weight and Meaſure, as well as in Quality and Prices, which has almoſt alienated their Hearts from us; the next Step that I would adviſe ſhould be taken, is, that of erecting proper Fortifications in or near every one of the <hi>Indian</hi> Caſtles, with a Garriſon of about 15 or 20 Men in each, with an approved Sergeant, two or three of which may be Smiths, in double Pay, with a few Field Pieces, Spare Arms, Snow-Shoes (with which the <hi>French</hi> are always provided) ſmall Hatchets, and ſome Dogs of a proper Kind, to prevent Surprizes in the Night.</p>
            <p>THIS, I doubt not, the <hi>Indians</hi> would readily come into, as it would greatly incourage their Hunting, as well as their War Parties, and as it would be a Security for their old Men, Women, and Children, and a ſafe Retreat for themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions; without ſuch Security, they are impatient when Abroad, and ſeldom care to go far; beſides the Loſs of Numbers to the Service, upon any Emergency, who are detained at home for that Purpoſe. Theſe Forts might at the ſame time anſwer all the Purpoſes of Truck or Trading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, to be divided by Lot amongſt the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Colonies as far as they will go; and which, if properly ſtored with <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, and regulated according to the Method in <hi>New-England,</hi> would very ſoon create ſuch an Intercourſe and Connection between the remote <hi>Indian</hi> Nations and ours. as would turn out greatly to our Advantage. And one ſingle independent Company would garriſon the whole; and what a Trifle of a Charge would this be, in Compariſon to the Advantages we might
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007223_0011_102B400531E88128"/>hope for, and expect from it; and indeed it is my humble Opinion, that nothing leſs will effectually ſecure our Intereſt and Friendſhip with the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is agreed on all Hands, that a good ſtrong Fort ought to be erected at or near the <hi>Wood Creek,</hi> in order to counter-ballance that of <hi>Crown Point,</hi> I ſhall make no Doubt but that thoſe who are entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Care of our Security, will ſoon ſee that Part (as well as every other) of their Duty put in Execution, and I make as little Doubt but that his Majeſty, upon a proper Application, would, out of his wonted Goodneſs, favour us with an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Company of <hi>Highlanders;</hi> there ſeems to be ſo much Affinity both in their Diſpoſition and Dreſs, (which I would have compleat <hi>Highland</hi>) with that of our <hi>Indians,</hi> that I am confident they would be highly pleaſed with them, and I doubt not, have a very good Effect. In caſe of enliſting for this Service, Care ought to be taken to avoid all <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> we have, I doubt, too many of that Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney already from <hi>Ireland</hi> in theſe four Companies.</p>
            <p>ONE Objection to this Scheme may be, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Trouble attending the Victualling and Relieving: To which I beg Leave to ſay, that if the <hi>Indians</hi> approve of it, they will undertake to carry and eſcort Goods or Proviſions, at an eaſy Rate: Or why may not thoſe very Garriſons in a little Time, with proper Care, be induced to raiſe their own Proviſions? Suppoſe the Victualling of twenty Men to coſt the Government <hi>Two Hundred Pounds</hi> yearly, let thoſe Men be encouraged, and ſet to Work to provide themſelves, and let them have the <hi>Two Hundred Pounds</hi> beſides their Pay, and a Title to all the Lands they do or can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and their Diſcharge when demanded; this would ſave the Trouble, the Riſque, the Relieving and the Expence of carrying Proviſions, and be the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007223_0012_102B4007E20A62D0"/>Means of better ſettling our Frontiers; there are thoſe to be found, I doubt not, who would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, if properly encouraged. That of relieving Garriſons here, is in my humble Opinion but bad Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; I would have none ſent but ſome Tradeſmen, all the reſt ſhould be only ſuch as have been uſed to Huſbandry and Labour: Had this Method been taken fifty Years ago, we ſhould very probably have had many Thouſand Families in the <hi>Seneca's</hi> Country at this Day.</p>
            <p>THE Uſe of Garriſons here, are either to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and protect Settlements, or to ſecure import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Paſſes; the <hi>French</hi> have ſucceeded in the latter, we, I ſhall not ſay for what Reaſon, in neither.</p>
            <p>THIS however is not all, if we intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that we are really in earneſt, and that they ſhould fight for us, we muſt fight along with them, and always to have ſome of our People to head their Parties; the <hi>French</hi> ſeldom fail of this Method: I ſhould therefore adviſe the Eſtabliſhing an independent Company or two, in time of War, of an Hundred good Men each, with an Addition of five <hi>Indians</hi> from each Nation, to be in conſtant Pay, Peace or War, as Rangers; one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies from <hi>Connecticut</hi> would add Strength to the County of <hi>Albany;</hi> the Officers to be Men of ſome Diſtinction and Knowledge, and fully impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to receive Complaints, and redreſs Grievances amongſt the <hi>Indians;</hi> to be a Sort of a flying Camp, frequently moving from Nation to Nation, to head all Parties, and to command out as many <hi>Indians</hi> upon any Emergency as they may think proper; one Company of Rangers properly diſpoſed, will be of more Uſe than three in Garriſon. And here I ſhall beg Leave once for all to obſerve, that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon employed in this Service be allowed to trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> on the ſevereſt Penalties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007223_0013_102B40099B03EC90"/>
THUS our <hi>Indians</hi> being ſecured in an honeſt and fair Trade, their Caſtles ſecured, either for the Safety of their Families, or as a Retreat for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and being well aſſured of our being in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to ſupport them upon all Occaſions, as we have in former Days done, it is not to be doubted but that we ſhall very ſoon get into their good Graces and Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>THE King, the Parliament, and indeed every <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subject, being deeply concerned in the Event of this Congreſs at <hi>Albany,</hi> will doubtleſs ſcan the Conduct of our Colony Aſſemblies upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; a hearty and generous Concurrence will have wonderful Effects, and I make no Doubt but that we ſhall be able in a little Time, by proper Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to turn the Tables upon that faithleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have been long underhand endeavouring our Deſtruction, and who ſeem now, by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious Inſults upon our Traders and Plantations, openly to avow it.</p>
            <p>LET us not therefore, Gentlemen of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, by an ill-tim'd Frugality loſe our All; would any of you, pray Gentlemen, loſe a Sheep for a <hi>Halfpenny</hi>'s worth of Tar? Surely not. Let us act like <hi>Britons,</hi> and with Unanimity; and here give me Leave to put you in Mind of the Fable</p>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007223_0014_102B400B23CFFFD0"/>a Diſtance: At laſt perceiving no Attempt was to be made upon them as long as this Combination held, he took Occaſion by Whiſpers and Hints to form Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and raiſe Diviſions amongſt them: This Stratagem ſucceeded ſo well, that the Bulls grew cold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to one another, which ſoon after ripened into a downright Hatred and Averſion, and at laſt ended in a total Separation. The Lyon had now obtained his Ends; and, as impoſſible it was for him to hurt them while united, he found no Difficulty, now they were parted, to ſeize and devour every Bull of them, one after another.</hi>

            <p>SIR <hi>W. Temple</hi> obſerves, that in the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt entered, it was divided into ſeveral Diſtricts, each governed by its own Prince, or Governor, different in their Views and Councils, by which Means they became an eaſy Conqueſt: <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnabunt, univerſi vinceban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> while they fought ſingly, the whole Iſland was ſubdued. The <hi>French</hi> have little to fight for but the Glory of their Monarch; we have the Glory of <hi>Britain,</hi> our Religion, our Liberties and our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and upwards of a Hundred Years Labour in theſe wild Deſarts, for the Sake of our Poſterity; in ſhort, it is <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> that we are to ſtruggle; and I doubt it is now or never. Should this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs break up without anſwering the intended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, I ſhall very readily adviſe my Children to look out in time for a ſafer Retreat.</p>
            <p>LET us ſeriouſly conſider what Deſolation and Deſtruction our innocent Neighbours and Fellow Subjects have undergone from thoſe barbarous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeans,</hi> who are eſteemed, even in <hi>France,</hi> a Race of Men loſt to all thoſe Principles of Honour upon which that Nation pique themſelves; who, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Cannibals, take Pleaſure in wantonly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007223_0015_102B400DE9C43AF0"/>burning Cottages, and in the inhuman Murder, and excruciating harmleſs old Women and helpleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; let us, I ſay, ſeriouſly conſider what we have undergone, when the <hi>French</hi> were but a Handful, and our <hi>Indians</hi> our Friends: What muſt be our Fate when they are become more numerous, and they are daily increaſing, and our <hi>Indians</hi> on their Side? I ſhudder to think of it.</p>
            <p>LET us conſider what Anxiety thoſe poor People undergo, with what Uncaſineſs they go to their Beds, what Alarms and Heart beatings they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the leaſt Barking of a Dog, expecting every Moment to have their Scalps carried off, and their Bodies mangled; while we enjoy a profound Reſt, without Care or Thought: Is this Truth, and will it not move you, Gentlemen?</p>
            <p>LET us exert our beſt Endeavours to ſhew our Gratitude to our Mother Country, who has hitherto nurſed and ſupported us at an infinite Expence, by preſerving to them, and to them only, the Fruits of our Labour.</p>
            <p>THE Time was when we had only to ſend to our <hi>Indians</hi> to diſcharge the <hi>French</hi> from building Forts, or making Encroachments; but we have loſt it by a fatal Neglect of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs. It is well known with how much Submiſſion they begg'd Leave to erect but a ſmall Hut, as a Reſting-place only, at <hi>Niagara:</hi> How different the Times! The Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Scheme, or, indeed, any other, and ſome one or other there muſt be, will, no doubt, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a very conſiderable Expence; but when the other Colonies, who are not leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Event, come in for their Proportion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with what Aſſiſtance his Majeſty may be ſo good as to favour us with, it is to be hoped the Charge will become tolerably eaſy: Be that as it will we muſt launch out. And is there ever a <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:007223_0016_102B40100EC87838"/>Subject amongſt us, who alone know the true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Liberty and Property, that will, upon this Occaſion, grudge a few <hi>Pence</hi> upon every Hundred Acres, or a few <hi>Shillings</hi> for every Slave, to ſecure to him and his Poſterity, all that is valuable in Life, or for which Life is valuable. Or why may not the Gentry pay for their Saſh-windows upon ſuch preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Occaſions, and — <hi>Shillings</hi> upon every Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-wheel of Pleaſure? This is all ready Money. And as the Gentlemen paid lately for their Wigs, why may not the Ladies, in their Turn, pay for their Hoops? After all, a gentle Land Tax, being the moſt equitable upon thoſe Occaſions, muſt be our dernier Refort. Trade is at preſent an Object of Compaſſion, and muſt be gently treated, as well as the poorer Sort of the People without Property: They muſt fight our Battles; which puts me in mind of the Fable,</p>
            <p>The SENSIBLE ASS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AN old Fellow was feeding an Aſs in a fine green Meadow; and being alarmed with the ſudden Approach of the Enemy, was impatient with the Aſs to put himſelf forward, and fly with all the Speed he was able. The Aſs aſk'd him, Whether or no he thought the Enemy would clap two Pair of Panniers upon his Back? The Man ſaid, No, there was no fear of that. Why then, ſays the Aſs; I'll not ſtir an Inch; for what is it to me who my Maſter is, ſince I ſhall but carry my Panniers as uſual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT parſimonious Diſpoſition, in our Colony Aſſemblies, have had, and we now feel it, and ever will have fatal Effects.</p>
            <p>OUR Fellow Subjects in <hi>Virginia</hi> have ſhewn us a noble Example, which has already put ſome Life into our <hi>Indians:</hi> Witneſs the Half King's Speech to the <hi>French</hi> Officer. And as the like Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as I underſtand, have been lately made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but that they will exert themſelves with the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007223_0017_102B40119F8B6C98"/>ſame Spirit and Bravery they did at <hi>Cape-Breton.</hi> And ſhall we, like a Parcel of Poltroons, ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghaſt, with our Hands on our Pockets; we, I ſay, who have coſt the People of <hi>England,</hi> in nurſing and protecting us, more, perhaps, than all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colonies upon the Continent together; or grudge our Proportion of the Expence, adequate to the Importance it may be of to us? <hi>Let it not be told in</hi> Gath, <hi>or publiſhed in the Streets of</hi> Aſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</p>
            <p>IT has been obſerved, that Prieſts have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally well received amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> whether upon Account of their religious Principles, or that the <hi>Indians</hi> being eternally ſurrounded by a Parcel of Handlers or Pickpockets, and finding the Parſon to avoid the Circle and the whole Sphere of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of this Kind, that they conclude him an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man, I ſhall not take upon me to determine: I believe, however, the latter is the Caſe, as they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often take his Advice in Matters of Moment, while at the ſame time they have a very deſpicable Opinion of the others. It is by Means of the Prieſts, in a great Meaſure, that the <hi>French</hi> have ſucceeded ſo well in ſeducing our <hi>Indians,</hi> and confirming their own. I ſhould therefore adviſe, that there ſhould be a Parſon appointed for each Caſtle, no matter of what Church, with a handſome Allowance: And why might he not act as a Commiſſary as well as a Miſſionary, and deal out the Goods of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as thoſe of the Goſpel? The Offices are not at all incompatible; Biſhops have frequently been Lord Treaſurers. I can by no Means agree in Sentiment with thoſe Gentlemen who are for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing that, in my humble Opinion, pernicious Trade, carried on for ſo many Years, between <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> if there were no other Reaſon than that they ſeem really to want it, and that more than is generally imagined. I would fain know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, upon any Conſideration, would allow us
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007223_0018_102B4013AC5361B0"/>the ſame Liberties at <hi>Montreal</hi> or <hi>Quebeck?</hi> To ſee ſome Hundreds of <hi>French Indians,</hi> as Factors from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> trading for <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, who carry off not only Goods, but a large Share of our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; nothing of late will go down with them but <hi>Spaniſh Dollars;</hi> while a poor Trader of ours, if he has the Misfortune to meet with any of the <hi>French,</hi> within what they are now pleaſed to call their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, is immediately hurried away Priſoner to <hi>Quebeck;</hi> This is a Contraſt that I ſhould be glad the Advocates for this Trade would account for.</p>
            <p>IT is true, they take off of our Manufactures; but it is as true, that thoſe Commodities would be taken off our Hands directly by the <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they found they could not have them among the <hi>French.</hi> It is likewiſe ſaid, if they had them not from us, they would find them elſewhere. To which I beg Leave to ſay, That the <hi>French</hi> know their Intereſt too well to truſt an Affair of that Conſequence ſo long to ſo precarious a Method of procuring them, as it is in our Power every Day to put a Stop to it: I therefore conclude, if they could have fallen upon any other Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing thoſe Commodities, they would have done it long ago, and have kept their Furs to themſelves.</p>
            <p>OUR ſelling our <hi>Indian</hi> Goods to the <hi>French,</hi> to trade for us with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and having in Return their coarſeſt Furs, is, in my humble Opinion, not leſs ridiculous than that of our formerly ſending our Wheat to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and having our Returns in Bran and ſome Flour. Beſides, what is of the utmoſt Conſequence to us, is, that the <hi>Cachawagas,</hi> our old Friends, and their beſt <hi>Indians,</hi> whom, <hi>coute qui'l coute,</hi> coſt what it will, we ought to recover, are the ſole Carriers and Managers in this Affair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> which has created ſuch a Connection between them and the <hi>French,</hi> that till this Trade is aboliſhed, it will be impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:007223_0019_102B401668FD02F0"/>
NOR can I conceive the Remedy very difficult, as it may very naturally be brought within the very Letter of the Twelfth of CHARLES II. which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>That no Perſon, not born within the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance of our Sovereign Lord the King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall trade in any of the Plantations, upon Pain of forfeiting all his Goods and Chattels,</hi> &amp;c. A Law, however, here, perhaps, might anſwer better. I have but one Thing more to add, and that with great Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being a Point that has not been as yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed, and that is, That a general Combination of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſar and near, be formed, to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh every Spot of fortified Ground in the <hi>Indian</hi> Countries on this Side <hi>Montreal,</hi> and the other Side of <hi>Schenectady,</hi> at leaſt that they be brought to one determinate Number, never to be exceeded: By this Means the Trade will ever be kept open; nor need we apprehend further Encroachments. The <hi>French,</hi> I doubt, are too well fixed to come into any ſuch Propoſal; but it will have one good Effect at leaſt, and that is, that it will convince the <hi>Indians,</hi> that we have no other Views but their Intereſt; while the <hi>French</hi> are endeavouring their Deſtruction, by cutting them off from all Communication with us, to be Maſters of their Hunting-grounds, and of Courſe they muſt either become their Slaves, or ſtarve.</p>
            <p>How ſoon this may happen, God, and that great Monarch, can only tell: I am not, however, without Apprehenſions, you may, if you pleaſe, call them Dreams, that the <hi>French</hi> are upon a Plan different, and a Criſis much nearer, I doubt, than what we imagine. I can by no Means think that they, who are noted for their Frugality, would at this Time put themſelves to the Charge of raiſing an Army of 4 or 5000 Men, for the Sake of a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Block-houſe or two upon a Branch of <hi>Ohio,</hi> or any where elſe, which they might have done as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

I am further confirmed in my Opinion, that thoſe Block-houſes are not the ſole Point which the <hi>French</hi> have in View, from the Sentiments of our Aſſembly in a late Repreſentation to our Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Governor, in theſe Words, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>have built a Fort at a Place called the</hi> French Creek, <hi>at a conſiderable Diſtance from the River</hi> Ohio; <hi>which may, but does not, by any Evidence or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for mation, appear to us to be an Invaſion of any of his Majeſty's Colonies:</hi> This is roundly aſſerted, but as it in ſome Meaſure confirms my Opinion, I ſhall leave it to whom it more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns to diſcuſs, hoping at the ſame time that our Enemies may not make an improper Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>THOSE Block-houſes therefore, I ſay, are not, in my humble Opinion, their ſole Deſigns at preſent, they are rather imitating, as I conceive, thoſe ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious little Animals, who, in order to divert your Attention from the proper Object, their little Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, gently lead you to a proper Diſtance, till they think themſelves ſecure; and may not this be all Grimace, and a Feint, to draw our Attention and Troops from their proper Object, our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers? <hi>to wit,</hi> What could be meant by a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Troops paſſing <hi>Oſwego</hi> in one Day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the Night, and the next Day paſſing again by the Fort? This is a very uncommon Piece of Conduct, and can mean nothing leſs than to draw our Attention and Troops after them into a Wild-gooſe Chaſe, with the View to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſomewhere elſe.</p>
            <p>WHAT can they mean by declaring that they do not want the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Indians,</hi> but to lull them into a Neutrality till they ſtrike the Blow? If one may be allowed to form any Judgment at this Diſtance, of the Situation of our Publick Affairs at Home, a Rupture does not ſeem to be at ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe a Diſtance, but that a Monſieur <hi>Danville,</hi> or
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007223_0021_102B401A61596E08"/>even that little Squadron, deſtined to chaſtiſe the <hi>Algerines,</hi> may bring us the firſt Account of it. And how ſoon are thoſe Thouſands upon the back of us, now under Arms, collected at <hi>Albany,</hi> with their <hi>Indians?</hi> Judge now, candid Reader, what a Situation we are in for ſuch an Event: And whom have we to thank for it? Without an <hi>Indian,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Fort, that can with any Propriety be called ſo; without Ammunition, without Arms, without Money, and I doubt (from the indifferent Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thoſe Creditors of the Government have hitherto met with) without Credit. And ſhould we want the Aſſiſtance of our Neighbours, we have but juſt ſhewn a very bad Example. Such is our Situation: And if ſuch an Event ſhould happen, I ſee nothing left, but to pray to the Lord to have Mercy upon us.</p>
            <p>WHAT a Fatality ſeems to attend the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Neighbour Colony, who at this very cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Point of Time treat the Decrees of Heaven, and the King, with great Contempt! They have the ſame Directions as the other Colonies have, to furniſh their Quota's, and attend the Congreſs at <hi>Albany,</hi> for the Preſervation of the Whole; but becauſe Providence has been pleaſed to lay its Hand upon that good Gentleman the Governor, ſo as to diſable him from attending the Aſſembly at <hi>Amboy,</hi> they are pleaſed to tell him, <hi>When he is well enough to attend them there, they will then conſider what is to be done;</hi> in the mean time their Quota's and the Congreſs is evaded: What, for God's Sake, muſt be the Conſequence of ſuch Proceedings, when our All is at Stake? Will that trite Tale of, <hi>We your Majeſty's moſt loyal Subjects,</hi> &amp;c. protect them from his Majeſty's Diſpleaſure? Or do they truſt to the Rioters to protect them, either from that or the Enemy? Muſt a whole People ſuffer for the Caprice of a few Aſſembly-men?. Caprice I call it, and have too much Reaſon to call it ſo,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007223_0022_102B401C6F6FBCE0"/>and ſhall ever think it ſuch, till they are pleaſed to let us (in the moſt publick Manner) into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Conduct; this we have a Right to demand; but more properly they ought to give it us without demanding, as they are accountable to the People for every Step they take, and, in Matters of Moment, ought not to proceed without firſt conſulting their Conſtituents. Here, Mr. <hi>Reflector,</hi> is an ample Field to expatiate in, and I would fain hope, from your pathetick Manner of Reaſoning, the Eyes of the Obſtinate, and Ignorant, may be opened, for their own Safety, as well as that of the Whole. I am ſtill in the <hi>Jerſeys:</hi> We have had a long Experience of his Majeſty's Lenity, how far it may extend I know not; but this I will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that we have more to apprehend from a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Scrutiny, than has as yet entered into the Heart of any of us to conceive; can any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy imagine that this Trifling with his Majeſty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, in an Affair of ſo much Conſequence to the Trade and Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and to every <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subject, will, according to the uſual Cant, ſave the Country's Money? Will not the Commiſſioners from the ſeveral Colonies, and it is to be hoped a Majority will attend, in the firſt Place conſider the Danger we are in at this Point of Time? 2dly, How to prevent it now, and for the future? 3dly, Will they not make a Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Expence? 4thly, Wild not thoſe very Commiſſioners proportion that Expence; giving to each Colony its Quota? Does the <hi>Jerſeys</hi> think to eſcape? This, of Courſe, will be laid before his Majeſty, which, from the Fate his Inſtructions have hitherto met with from that Aſſembly, as well as from ſome others, he will naturally order it to be laid before the Parliament, with whom there is no contending; and who knows, when their Hands are in, but they may take it into their Heads to lay the Foundation of a regular Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007223_0023_102B401E73CAF4F8"/>us, and taking it out of the Hands of the Aſſemblies, by fixing a Support for the Governor, and the other Officers of the Crown, independent of an Aſſembly? Nor can I ſee any great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Execution of it; it is only reviving our own Revenue Acts, to continue as long as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and his Parliament, thinks proper; there is nothing new in this, it is what we have been uſed to; thoſe Funds have been thought proper, both by the King, and Subject, and the only Difference is, as to the Point of Time. That a Governor for himſelf, and the Support of the Dignity of the Government, or the other Officers in the executive Part of the Laws, and Government, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Breath of a few capricious Country Gentlemen in an Aſſembly for their daily or yearly Subſiſtence and Support, or whether indeed they ſhall have any at all, is a Soleciſm in Politicks.</p>
            <p>AND here I ſhall beg Leave to conclude with another Fable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ABOAR ſtood whetting his Tuſks againſt an old Tree; the Fox, who happened to come by at the ſame Time, aſked him why he made thoſe Preparations of whetting his Teeth, ſince there was no Enemy near that he could perceive? That may be, Maſter</hi> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, <hi>ſays the Boar; but we ſhould ſcour up our Arms while we have Leiſure, you know; for in Time of Danger we ſhall have ſomething elſe to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A WISE General has not his Men to diſcipline, or his Ammunition to provide, when the Trumpet ſounds TO ARMS; but ſets apart his Times of Exerciſe for one, and his Magazines for t'other, in the calm Seaſon of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Pace, ut Sapiens, aptabit idonea Bello.</hi>
