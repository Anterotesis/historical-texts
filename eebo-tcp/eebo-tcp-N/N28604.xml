            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>PSALM XXXIX, 5th.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Verily every man at his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words in glowing colours deſcribe the debility of man. Man who was made in the image of his Maker, lord of the lower creation, and formed to future exiſtence, is vain as the vapour, nay, in his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity. This truth is forcible in application to man in the higheſt degree of human glory. Diverſity of circumſtance, though in other reſpects it may precede diverſity of conſequence, yet here, makes no difference between the judge on the bench, and the culprit at the bar, the victor in triumph, and the vanquiſhed in deſpair, the king on his throne and the beggar at the gate. The text is conceived in the moſt expreſſive language. <hi>Verily,</hi> is a term fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed by the beſt inſtructor, and moſt accurate judge of human language. It is employed to ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the truth beyond contradiction. When our Lord uſhers in a declaration with "verily, verily I ſay unto you" all ground of doubt is inſtantly removed. Such an introduction more than invites prevailing opinion, it lays ſpecial claim to unbounded confidence: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the aſſent of judgment in ſuch a manner, as to exclude the deſire of other evidence. Thus, with the inſpired penman of the pſalm from which our text is choſen. This ſingle word from him is more deciſive than a thouſand arguments from reaſon without the guidance of inſpiration. The former is cloathed with divine authority, while the latter, like the ſource whence they proceed are often deluſive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038117_0005_100FCDD91492C4F8"/>HAVING furniſhed ſuch ground of confidence, the pſalmiſt proceeds to a deſcription, which applies to the human race without exception: The firſt and the laſt, the greateſt and the leaſt are equally implicated. However the different gradations of human life may exhibit men in different attitudes of purſuit, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and enjoyment; yet a perfect coincidence is formed by the deep inſcription of vanity on all. And leſt we entertain the apprehenſion, that great men may be vain, in ſuch inſtances only, wherein, even <hi>they</hi> are ſometimes unwiſe, the text circumſcribes our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation by the narrow limits of this moſt happy and proſperous condition. The beſt and moſt happy ſtate of man, in excluſion of every conſideration leſs deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, invites our meditation. And even here, a veil is drawn over all his greatneſs. Here, he is not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vain; but vanity in the abſtract.</p>
            <p>IF the ſtrong expreſſions of our text, were indulged by the licenſe of poets, and if for that reaſon, the plain and literal meaning of the terms may not be admitted; yet, the paſſage is full of inſtruction, and demands our moſt ſerious conſideration; and ſeldom, if ever, more than the preſent ſolemn, and ſorrowful occaſion, an occaſion, originating from an event in which the citiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens of America are deeply intereſted: For Waſhington the great is not able to continue by reaſon of death. Waſhington, the father of his country, the defender of her rights, the protector of millions, is no more! He, who frowned on tyrants, and bade boundleſs ambition ſubmit to the mild mandates of liberty and law, has fallen, greatly fallen, in unequal combat with the king of terrors. He, who bore no diſtant reſemblance to the wiſe king of Iſrael, in circumſtances of eaſe, and affluence at home, at his country's call, forſook domeſtic endearments, and in jeopardy of life, entering the high places of the field, engaged in a conteſt, which, though righteous in itſelf, was however dubious in event, and pregnant with danger, and death, in all the dreadful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038117_0006_100FCDDA9695C8B8"/>
forms of retribution to reputed rebels. That man, who by the ſacrifice of his property and gratuitous devotedneſs of his time and talents, to the cauſe of his country, who, by the wiſdom of his counſels, and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of his arms, gathered lawrels of renown, which ſhall continue with unfading luſtre to the lateſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, who commanded the proud kings of the eaſt "to be ſtill, and they obeyed him." Waſhington, the boaſt of America, the dread of tyrants, and the envy of the world, has, in the courſe of divine providence, furniſhed a ſtriking illuſtration of our text, "verily, every man at his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity."</p>
            <p>Two queſtions are ſuggeſted by this text for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is the beſt ſtate of man?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Why is mere vanity predicated of man in ſuch a ſtate?</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHAT is the beſt ſtate of man? Different ſtates are preferred according to the different taſte or reliſh of ſuch as make the preference: But the real goodneſs of a ſtate depends not on opinion. It is founded on the original rule of right, and like that remains unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable. The beſt ſtate of man, is that wherein he can enjoy the higheſt and moſt permanent felicity. A rational mind without enjoyment is unavoidably miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Intire deſtitution of pleaſure, and pain when unbiaſſed reaſon excites reflection is abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Heaven and hell cannot be realized with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The ſubject is too ſerious to admit of trifling. Eternal joy and endleſs woe, by the neceſſity of our nature, afford happineſs or miſery in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But miſery is not an object to be choſen. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted malevolence has no exiſtence. Enjoyment is therefore inſeparable from the beſt ſtate of man. And by how much the more refined and permanent the enjoyment is, by ſo much the more deſirable the ſtate of the happy ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038117_0007_100FCDDE19550BE0"/>BUT the concurrence of ſeveral things, is eſſential to ſuch enjoyment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A clear and lively apprehenſion of truth. The propriety of this remark, depends not on the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of your creed. Whether chriſtian or pagan, the obſervation ſtill remains. Nothing within the limits of pure revelation, and abſolute atheiſm can furniſh an exception. Diverſity of opinion, cannot produce ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial joy, from unfounded ſyſtems. Ignorance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, may flatter a deluded conſcience to the joyful ſubverſion of right and wrong, but all that ſeeming happineſs, which reſults from ignorance, will inſtantly vaniſh in the light of truth. Hay and ſtubble, may better endure devouring flame, than falſe joys abide the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, who is truth itſelf. Idle dreams may delude the hungry, but wakeful reflection will ſubſtantiate his miſery. Many will be repulſed with the argument in their mouth "have we not propheſied in thy name and in thy name done many wonderful works." Clear conviction will detect the guilt of apprehending, that we may do God ſervice by the ſlaughter of his friends. St. Paul is not the only illuſtration of this truth. The hope of thouſands has been ſlain by the light of law, and thouſands yet unborn will happily experience the ſame death. "This is life eternal to know Thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent. Except ye believe that I am he ye ſhall die in your ſins."</p>
            <p>But 2d. Such enjoyment requires communion in happineſs. The higheſt and moſt permanent felicity, is not ſelfiſh and mercenary. It reſults not from partial proſperity in oppoſition to general enjoyment. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which is the ſource of the moſt high, refined, and permanent gratification, is without partiality. It is utterly a ſtranger to private or ſiniſter views. It knows no confinement within the extenſive limits of the greateſt poſſible felicity. Soaring above the higheſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038117_0008_100FCDE14AA49430"/>
exertion of partial affection the ſubject of benevolence is loſt in the boundleſs ocean of infinite delight. To contemplate the ſolid and ſubſtantial pleaſure of others, will cauſe the good man to ſing for joy. Dictated by the temper of his own heart he knows to weep with thoſe who weep, and to rejoice with ſuch as do rejoice. The pleaſure which ſuch enjoy in communicating happineſs where it is within their power, and rejoicing in that bleſſedneſs which is infinitely above them, is the ſpring of every benevolent exertion. But for this, what motive to action which the enlightened conſcience can approve? What virtue in drudging like an ox, in hard and laborious exertion, in reprobation of general felicity? For approbation or reprobation of this great object is eſſential to every moral exerciſe. Here a ſtate of neutrality is utterly unknown. "He that is not with me is againſt me," is the declaration of him who taught as never man did.</p>
            <p>"GLORY to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will to man," is the genuine expreſſion of true benevolence, and not confined to ſuch, as were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in heaven. The ardent flame is caught in the breaſt of ſome below; its fervour is felt, and ſeen in effuſions of a ſimilar nature. Job, in his own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, replies to the reproachful language of his friends.</p>
            <p>If I have withholden the poor from his deſire, or have cauſed the eyes of the widow to fail, or have eaten my morſel by myſelf alone, and the fatherleſs have not eaten thereof.</p>
            <p>If I have ſeen any periſh for want of cloathing, or have ſeen the poor without covering.</p>
            <p>If his loins have not bleſſed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my ſheep.</p>
            <p>If I have lift my hand againſt the fatherleſs.</p>
            <p>Then let my arm fall from my ſhoulderblade and let my arm be broken from the bone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038117_0009_100FCDE46A71E7E0"/>BUT the pſalmiſt has deſcribed the ſame temper in language if poſſible ſtill more expreſſive. "If I forget thee O Jeruſalem; let my right hand forget her cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief joy."</p>
            <p>THIS affection, like a bond of union, cementing every inhabitant of the beſt ſtate of man, opens a ſource of joy which is unſpeakable and full of glory. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete gratification of all ſuch deſires is the natural, and neceſſary conſequence. They enſtamp on the ſubject the moral image of the great Creator, and God will fulfil the deſires of ſuch as fear him. Nor is it poſſible for Omnipotence to do otherwiſe unleſs the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able put on mutability.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE higheſt and moſt permanent enjoyment is progreſſive.</p>
            <p>IF the powers of the human mind are capable of progreſſion, in knowledge, benevolence, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſtate muſt be preferable to all others, where ſuch progreſſion is enſured. But that the mind is thus capable, has never been denied. Here, an opponent is not apprehended. Everlaſting forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, the laſt reſort of boaſted, but blinded reaſon, ſhould the dream be realized, can furniſh no objection to advances in felicity, while conſciouſneſs may endure. The deciſion of the reſt, falls not within the preſent field. It will be clearly ſeen in the light of the general judgment. The appeal lies, to that awful tribunal. To the real chriſtian, progreſſive information, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing enjoyment, are moſt animating conſiderations. His views extend beyond the narrow limits of human life, and contemplate ages, in unnumbered millions, rolling on from high to higher gradations of perfect enjoyment; attended in each progreſſive ſtep, with retrogade motion in deep abaſement. The objects
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038117_0010_100FCDE7B5A6C978"/>
which give him pleaſure ſhall remain forever, and in his apprehenſion, like the riſing light, ſhine brighter and brighter, in endleſs day. "Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God." To ſuch a mind, enjoyment will ever keep pace with increaſing inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the heart will no longer maintain warfare with the underſtanding. The will, and affections will from a perfect coincidence with the enlightened dictates of conſcience, and the ſoul, like the mote which plays in the ſunbeams, be loſt in the immenſity of divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency. Every increaſing deſire, will be ſatisfied in drinking of the rivers of God's pleaſure. Every bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent mind, will be filled with the fullneſs of God.</p>
            <p>BUT has ſuch a ſtate ever fallen to the lot of man? Where is the chart of the happy country? What the terms of naturalization, and how ſhall admittance to the new Jeruſalem be procured?</p>
            <p>WE cheerfully reply, that the exiſtence of ſuch a ſtate, is clearly deſcribed by the infallible pen of divine inſpiration. Nor, is it a work of difficulty to aſcertain the terms of admittance. The right of citizenſhip is offered "without money and without price." "The ſpirit and the bride ſay come, and let him who heareth ſay come, and whoſoever will let him come and take of the waters of life freely." Hungering for the bread, and thirſting for the waters of life, are the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſites to entering the gates into the holy city.</p>
            <p>ADMITTANCE however will not be granted, to ſuch as deſire to purloin their maſter's goods, or embezzle his property. Here, "the thief breaks not through to ſteal:" But one of two reaſons can induce the wiſh to go to heaven, the one to ſerve God, and the other to be ſerved of him. But whether ſhall I be God's ſervant, or ſhall he be mine, are queſtions not leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote than heaven and hell, nor is there a greater reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in the tempers whence they proceed. He only
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038117_0011_100FCDEADBA6CFC8"/>
who "hateth his life for Chriſt's ſake ſhall find it:" When the eye becomes ſingle, then, and not till then, in that proportion, and no other, can the body be full of light. We "cannot ſerve two maſters." A reliſh of heart for that enjoyment which reſults from unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved devotedneſs to God, prepares the ſoul to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in the joy of its Lord, and that to a degree which eye hath not ſeen, ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive. Happy are they, who are in ſuch a caſe, yea happy, is that man whoſe God is the Lord. But "man in his beſt ſtate is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity."</p>
            <p n="2">II. Why is vanity predicated of man in ſuch a ſtate?</p>
            <p n="1">1. BECAUSE he is a creature. Creatures in their higheſt exaltation poſſeſs a derived exiſtence, and have no claim either to its mode or continuance. The power which made is able to deſtroy. The moſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified of Adam's race, if reduced to the moſt abject ſtate, would ſuffer no injury at the hand of his maker. But, vanity is deeply inſcribed on that man who is kept not by any thing in the nature of his exiſtence, but by mighty power, from conſtant viciſitude.</p>
            <p>But 2. EVERY man in his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity, becauſe wholly dependent. Dependence is the neceſſary conſequence of creation. A creator, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on his creatures, is not a greater ſoleciſm, than creatures, independent of the creator. Created exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt have a beginning, and for that reaſon muſt be dependent. The dependence of creatures, extends through every part and period of their exiſtence. The laws of nature which regulate the whole, are no other, than eſtabliſhed modes of conſtant, divine operation, whereby the God of nature, upholds and governs all.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"By his own power were all things made,</l>
               <l>By him ſupported all things ſtand,</l>
               <l>He is the whole creation's head,</l>
               <l>And angels fly at his command."</l>

Have ye not heard, hath it not been told you from the beginning, have ye not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the foundation of the earth? It is he that ſitteth on the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as graſshoppers, that ſtretcheth out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as a curtain and ſpreadeth them, as a tent to dwell in—that bringeth the princes to nothing, yea that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the judges of the earth as vanity." The depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of man for intelligence, and other powers of moral action, has ſeldom, if ever been denied. "Who hath made thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou which thou haſt not received?" are queſtions, which on other ground, will admit of no reply. But becauſe in the exerciſe of mental powers, men are ſubjects of praiſe or blame, many ſuppoſe the independent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſelf-determining power, to be abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. To wave the difficulty of aſcertaining preciſely, what is meant by ſelf-determining power, we are led to ſuppoſe that ſuch power never did, and never will exiſt in heaven or on earth. Nor can we conceive that any advantage could be derived, from its exiſtence. For the exertion of ſuch power muſt either be, or not be, under the direction of the will. If it <hi>be</hi> under the direction of the will, then the will governs the power, and not the power the will. In this caſe, the exertion of the power would be the effect, and not the cauſe, of previous volition. One act of the will has therefore already taken place without the aid of ſelf-determining power. It remains for others to ſhow why ſucceeding actions may not exiſt in the ſame manner. But if on the other hand, the power of ſelf-determination, be not under the direction of the will, it can add nothing to the freedom of human volition.</p>
            <p>FOR the effect, is neceſſarily under the control of the cauſe, and not the cauſe of the effect. And is ſuch control conſiſtent with free volition? Where then is the objection againſt the doctrine of neceſſity? In the former caſe, what is the reſpect in which, the exiſtence
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038117_0013_100FCDEF61853128"/>
of ſuch a power, would be advantageous? And what, in the latter, not miſchievous? Is control by a power, diſtinct from intelligence, and will, and conſcience, preferable, to the government of infinite benevolence? As this will not be pretended man is a free, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled agent, acting when acted upon, and therefore, required to work out his own ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who worketh in him to will and to do of his own good pleaſure. Every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity. He is the clay. God is the potter. For the king's heart is in God's hand, and he turneth it whitherſoever he will, as the rivers of water are turned. All nations are before him as nothing, and they are counted by him leſs than nothing, and vanity. But the text has been miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
            <p>THE inſpired writer had no reference to the moral character, and future ſtate of man. The riches and vain pleaſures of time are vain, and for this reaſon every man in his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity. Be it ſo.</p>
            <p>THIS objection, if admitted, will ſuggeſt the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE beſt ſtate of man is ſtill that wherein he may enjoy the higheſt, and moſt permanent felicity. The reaſon already aſſigned, will apply to this conſtruction, with equal propriety. A lower ſtate of enjoyment can no more claim the preference to an higher, than a ſtate of miſery to them both.</p>
            <p n="2">2, SUCH enjoyments vary, according to the infinite variety of human paſſions and appetites. The ſame objects will afford both pleaſure and pain, to minds of different complexions, and even to the ſame mind, under different circumſtances.

The ſublime pleaſure of liberal donation, to cauſe the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow's heart to ſing for joy, and pour the balm of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation on the wounded breaſt, puts the ſordid miſer on the rack. The groanings of the priſoner, are muſic to the tyrant; but plant a dagger in the boſom of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. Ambition lugs a heavy load, where ſober rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finds his element. Mordecai mourns while Haman triumphs. Avarice ſtarves in rich abundance, while prodigality riots in lawleſs profuſion. Jarring paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in endleſs variety, exclude all rule of univerſal preſcription. The beſt ſtate of man however, on this conſtruction will, probably, depend much on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing circumſtances. A ſtrong and penetrating mind, furniſhed with extenſive information, a firm conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enlivened with the vigour of youth, affluent fortune under the direction of a generous heart, courteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, in exalted ſtation, undaunted courage, and a ſtupid conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the united influence of theſe, may raiſe the mind above the higheſt degree of animal gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.

            <p>ASIDE from objects of faith, a very few facts fall within his acquaintance, and even theſe ſo involved in myſtery, as to baffle all attempts at explanation.

            <p>WITHOUT aid of revelation, probable conjecture is the only clue to future ſcenes; and revelation itſelf leaves many things unrevealed. Predictions are beſt expounded in the event.

The adminiſtration of a new, and untried form of government, produced complaints which many had apprehended. A decided majority, in ſome of the States, had rejected, while a large minority in others, had obſtructed the adoption of the federal conſtitution. The vibration of ſome, from liberty to licentiouſneſs, had diffuſed the ſpirit of diſorganization, and licenſed reſiſtance to government. The ſame meaſures, and that too from the ſame bodies, became the object both of petition and remonſtrance.</p>
               <p>PRESSING ſolicitations of an oppoſite nature, and from different directions, proclaimed certain deſtruction to his country if each were not gratified—gratification of all was impoſſible. Unavoidable diſappointment found the utterance of reproach. And all this, on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that government, had been adminiſtered with abſolute perfection, which can hardly be admitted, while, every man in his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity. But in ſuch an important criſis of public affairs, is not the man yet to be born, who could weather the ſtorm of contending paſſions, with more dignity to himſelf, or ſafety to the public? George Waſhington was made for moſt important ſervice, has accompliſhed like an hireling his day, and paſſed from the theatre of life, to a permanent ſtate of exiſtence beyond the grave. The obſcurity of the ſpeaker has ſecluded him, from ſuch means of information as others poſſeſs, relative to the moral or religious character of this great man. He is authoriſed however, from authentic documents, to ſay, that General Waſhington was a believer in the chriſtian Religion, in a ſenſe which many profeſſing chriſtians do reject. In a circular letter to the governor of each ſtate, at the cloſe of the war, we find the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable words. "The free cultivation of letters, the unbounded extent of commerce, the progreſſive refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manners, the growing liberality of ſentiment, and above all, the pure and divine light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on mankind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed

the bleſſings of ſociety."—And in the cloſe of the ſame letter he adds. "I now make it my earneſt prayer, that God would have you, and the ſtate over which you preſide, in his holy protection, that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a ſpirit of ſubordination to government, to entertain a brotherly love and affection for one another, for their fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren, who have ſerved in the field; and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us all to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to demean ourſelves with that charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteriſtics of the divine author of our bleſſed religion, without an humble imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of whoſe example, we can never be an happy nation."</p>
               <p>THE example here held forth for imitation is that of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom many others repreſent as a mere creature; but General Waſhington be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves him to be the independent and eternal God. He is the "divine Author of our bleſſed religion." The ardent prayers that God would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed, to diſpoſe us all to do juſtice, love mercy and to demean ourſelves with that charity, humility, &amp;c.— and incline our hearts to ſubordination to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brotherly love," &amp;c. clearly implies, that we are previouſly diſinclined to ſuch duties, that divine exertion is neceſſary to produce the diſpoſition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, and that ſuch exertion is not a debt which we may demand; but the gift of grace which might juſtly be withholden. By grace are ye ſaved through faith and that not of yourſelves it is the gift of God. But the ſcriptural creed, pure moral and extenſive uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Author of this prayer, can furniſh no ground of ultimate reliance.</p>
               <p>HIS breath was in his noſtrils, and he has returned to duſt from whence he came. Put not your truſt in

princes, nor in the ſon of man, his breath goeth forth, he returneth to the earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh.</p>

The Lord reigns let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the iſles be glad thereof. Let the vanity of man excite to unbounded confidence in the Lord Jehovah, who is immutably the ſame from and to eternity, whoſe name is a ſtrong tower into which the righteous do run and are ſafe.</p>
