            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I AM frail, and the world is fading; but my ſoul is immortal, and God is eternal. If I pitch, upon the creature, either, they may take wings like an eagle that flieth towards heaven, or my ſoul may take its way with the rich fool, and go to hell; but if I chuſe God for my portion, then mercy and goodneſs ſhall follow me whilſt I live, and glory and eternity ſhall crown me when I die.

               <head>Spiritual Joy and Sorrow.</head>
               <p>AS there is a ſad mirth, ſo there is a joyful mourning: look upon the voluptuous man, however laughter may appear in his face, yet ſadneſs ever centers in the heart; his carnal delights are not only in vain, but vexing; like muſic, they play him into a melancholy fit: whilſt the banquet laſts, the ſenſualiſt ſings: but when the reckoning comes, his ſpirit ſinks, his burning candle preſently goes out in a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſnuff, his ſhining ſun inſtantly ſets in the watry cloud. Solomon gives us the ſum of it thus: Even in laughter the heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs. But now come to the penitential perſon, as his tears are the joy of angels, ſo they are the joy of his heart, and the ſolace of his ſoul; the falter his tears, the ſweeter his comforts; the deeper his ſighs, the fuller his joy; the beams of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation always ſhine into this houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that his ſoulis in his travail with a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, and his labours bring forth the fruits of peace; inſomuch, that I may truly ſay, to mourn for ſin, is to weep for joy. Theſe pure and pleaſant ſtreams of conſolation (which is the worldlings wonder) that flow and run in thoſe cryſtal rivers of eternal pleaſure, at God's, right hand, they come from a weeping ſpring. Why then is the mouth of wickedneſs opened againſt the way of holineſs? As if grace were the calvary to intomb joys; and impiety the very womb to bring forth felicity; but if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

may be heard, my ſoul hath felt both, and I find ſuch damps of ſpirit in the worldly pleaſures, and ſuch refreſhing of ſoul in the depth of godly ſorrow, that I ſhall eſteem one drop of ſuch ſpiritual joy, better than an ocean of their mirth.</p>

'tis well if their crackling trunks eſcape an overthrow.—But I expect a more awful appearance on the ocean.—Surpriſing! more ſo than any ſcene that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtruck my alarmed eye. See how the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges riſe! what mountainous billows ſwell and roll! What hideous caverns gape? Sheets of water are ſeparated and carried to a diſtance! How do the waves laſh yonder rocks? how widely do they ſpread upon the more level. ſtrand!—What will become of thoſe veſſels which I ſaw a little while ago failing ſo ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that ſea of glaſs? amazing if they can live amidſt ſo vaſt a confuſion! How will they climb thoſe precipices? how will thy emerge, when buried in thoſe watry graves? See one poor bark, as it were hangs upon the broken wave.</p>
               <p>O how much is to be learned by a ſtorm? It is God that raiſeth the ſtormy wind, which lifteth up the waves of the ſea; they mount up to heaven, they go down to the depths.

If thou canſt not preſerve thy body from dropping into the grave, and render it immortal, how caſt thou keep the ſoul from ſinking into hell? Does many a hardy mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who before ſeemed neither to fear God or regard Man, tremble like a leaf when ſhaken with the wind, and is he even at his wits end in this tumult of the ocean? what then will the ſinner do, when God ſhall call forth all his wrath? and how will the now obdurate Miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant be able to ſtand when the whole ſtorm of vengeance ſhall be ſent againſt him, and beat upon him with a fury and power which eye never ſaw, and heart never felt?

                  <l>Where all my cheerful airs are fled:</l>
                  <l>Why will ye make me talk my torments o'er?</l>
                  <l>My life, my joy, my comfort's dead.</l>
                  <l>Deep from my ſoul, mark how the ſobs ariſe,</l>
                  <l>Hear the long groans that waſte my breath,</l>
                  <l>And read the mighty ſorrow in my eyes,</l>
                  <l>Lovely Sophronia ſleeps in death.</l>
                  <l>Unkind diſeaſe, to vail that roſy face</l>
                  <l>With tumours of a mortal pale;</l>
                  <l>While mortal purples, with their diſmal grace,</l>
                  <l>And double horror ſpot the vail.</l>
                  <l>Uncomely vail, and moſt unkind diſeaſe!</l>
                  <l>Is this Sophronia, once the fair?</l>
                  <l>Are theſe the features that were born to pleaſe?</l>
                  <l>And beauty ſpread her enſigns there?</l>
                  <l>I was all love, and ſhe was all delight.</l>
                  <l>Let me run back to ſeaſons paſt;</l>
                  <l>Ah! flow'ry days, when firſt ſhe charm'd my ſight!</l>
                  <l>But roſes will not always laſt.</l>
                  <l>Yet ſtill Sophronia pleas'd. Nor time, nor care</l>
                  <l>Could take her youthful bloom away:</l>
                  <l>Virtue has charms which nothing can impair;</l>
                  <l>Beauty like her's could ne'er decay,</l>
                  <l>Grace is a ſacred plant of heavenly birth:</l>
                  <l>The ſeed, deſcending from above,</l>

Roots in a ſoil refin'd grows high on earth,</l>
                  <l>And blooms with life, and joy, and love.</l>
                  <l>Such was Sophronia's ſoul. Celeſtial dew,</l>
                  <l>And angel's food, were her repaſt:</l>

                  <l>Not the gay ſplendors of a flatt'ring court</l>
                  <l>Could tempt her to appear and ſhine:</l>
                  <l>Her ſolemn airs forbid the world's reſort:</l>
                  <l>But I was bleſt, and ſhe was mine.</l>
                  <l>Safe on her welfare all my pleaſures hung,</l>
                  <l>Her ſmiles could all my pains control;</l>
                  <l>Her ſoul was made of ſoftneſs, and her tongue</l>
                  <l>Was ſoft and gentle as her ſoul.</l>
                  <l>She was my guide, my friend, my earthly all;</l>
                  <l>Love grew with every waning moon:</l>
                  <l>Had heav'n a length of years delay'd its call,</l>
                  <l>Still I had thought it call'd too ſoon.</l>
                  <l>But peace, my ſorrows, nor with murmuring voice</l>
                  <l>Dare to accuſe heaven's high decree:</l>
                  <l>She was firſt ripe for everlaſting joys;</l>

               <head>A Common Occurence moralized.</head>
               <p>AS Theophron, one evening, was ſitting ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary by the fire, which was ſunk low, and glimmering in aſhes, he muſed on the ſorrows that ſurrounded human nature, and beſet the ſpirits that dwell in fleſh. By chance he caſt his eye on a worm which was lodged on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer end of a ſhort fire-brand: It ſeemed very
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032741_0051_0FF50A21CE3CE9A8"/>
uneaſy at its warmſtation, writhing and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf every way for relief. He watched the creeping creature in all its motions. "I ſaw it," ſaid he, when he told this incident to Phiemus, "I ſaw it reach forward, and there it met the living coal; backward, and on each ſide, and then it touched the burning embers: Still ſtarting from the preſent torment, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and ſhrunk away from every place where it had juſt before ſought a refuge, and ſtill met with new diſquietude and pain.</p>
               <p>"At laſt I obſerved," ſaid he, "that having turned on all ſides in vain, it lifted its head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and raiſed its length as high as poſſible in the air, where it found nothing to annoy it; but the chief part of the body ſtill lay prone on the wood; its lower or worſer half hung heavy on the aſpiring animal, and forbid its aſcent. How happy, would the worm have been, could it then have put on wings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a flying inſect!</p>
               <p>"Such," ſaid he, "is the caſe of every holy ſoul on earth; it is out of its proper element, like the worm lodged among hot embers. The uneaſy ſpirit is ſometimes ready to ſtretch its powers, its deſires and wiſhes on every ſide, to find reſt and happineſs among ſenſible goods; but theſe things inſtead of ſatisfying its nobler appetites, rather give ſome new pain, variety of vexation, and everlaſting diſappointment. The ſoul finding every experiment vain, retires and ſhrinks backward from all mortal objects,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032741_0052_0FF50A325A695658"/>
and being touched with divine influence, it raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es itſelf up towards heaven to ſeek its God; but the fleſh, the body, the meaner and worſer half of the man, hangs heavy, and drags it down again, that it cannot aſcend thither, where reſt and eaſe are only to be found.</p>
               <p>"What ſhould ſuch a ſoul do now, but pant and long hourly for a flight to the upper world, and breathe after the moment of its releaſe? What would be more joyful to ſuch a ſpirit, than the divine and almighty ſummons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from fleſh? O bleſſed voice from heaven that ſhall ſay to it, <hi>Come up hither;</hi> and in the ſame inſtant ſhall break off all its fetters, give it the wings of an angel, and inſpire it with double zeal to aſcend!"</p>

               <head>THE VISION OF MIRZA.</head>
               <p>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of my forefathers, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep holy, after having waſhed myſelf, and offered up my morning devotions, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032741_0057_0FF4D43AB5AD4988"/>
the high hills of Bagdat, in order to paſs the reſt of the day in meditation and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. As I was here airing myſelf on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation on the vanity of human life; and paſſing from one thought to another, ſurely, ſaid I, man is but a ſhadow, and life a dream. Whilſt I was thus amuſing, I caſt my eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I diſcovered one in the habit of a ſhepherd, with a little muſical inſtrument in his hand. As I looked upon him, he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The ſound of it was exceeding ſweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpreſſibly melodious, and altogether different from any thing I had ever heard: they put me in mind of thoſe heavenly airs that are played to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſouls of good men upon their firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in Paradiſe, to wear out the impreſſions of the laſt agonies, and qualify them for the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of that happy place. My heart melted away in ſecret raptures.</p>
               <p>I had often been told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius; and that ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al had been entertained with that muſic, who had paſſed by it, but never heard that the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician had before made himſelf viſible. When he had raiſed my thoughts by thoſe tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing airs which he played, to taſte the pleaſures of his converſation, as I looked upon him, like one aſtoniſhed, he beckoned to me and by the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032741_0058_0FF50A9288766990"/>
waving of his hand directed me to approach the place where he ſat. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a ſuperior natures, and as my heart was entirely ſubdued by the captivating ſtrains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius ſmiled upon me with a look of compaſſion and affability that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once diſpelled all the fears and apprehenſions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, "Mirza," ſaid he, "I have heard thee in thy ſoliloques: follow me:"</p>
               <p>He then led me to the higheſt pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, "Caſt thy eyes eaſtward," ſaid he, "and tell me what thou feeſt." "I ſee," ſaid I, "a huge valley, and prodigious tide of water rolling through it." The valley thou ſeeſt, ſaid he, is the vale of miſery, and the tide of water that thou ſeeſt is part of the great tide of eternity. What is the reaſon, ſaid I, that the tide I ſee riſes out of a thick miſt at one end, and again loſes itſelf in a thick miſt at the other? What thou ſeeſt, ſaid he, is that portion of eternity which is called time meaſured out by the ſun, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the begining of the world to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation. Examine now, ſaid he, this ſea that is bounded with darkneſs at both ends, and tell me what thou diſcovereſt in it? I ſee a bridge, ſaid I, ſtanding in the midſt of the tide. The bridge thou ſeeſt, ſaid he, is human life;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032741_0059_0FF50AA2A9CB3030"/>
conſider it attentively. Upon a more leiſurely ſurvey of it, I found that it conſiſted of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten entire arches, with ſeveral bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken arches, which, added to thoſe that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that the bridge conſiſted at firſt of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand arches; but that a great flood ſwept away the reſt, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now behold it; but tell me further, ſaid he, what thou diſcovereſt on it? I ſee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people paſſing over it, ſaid I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it. As I looked more attentively, I ſaw ſeveral of the paſſengers dropping through the bridge, into the great tide that flowed underneath it; and I ſaw innumerable trap-doors that lay conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bridge, which the paſſengers no ſooner trod upon but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately diſappeared. Theſe hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en pit-falls were ſet very thick at the entrance of the bridge, ſo that throngs of people no ſooner broke through the cloud than many of them fell into them. They grew thinner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle, but multiplied and lay cloſer together towards the end of the arches that were entire.</p>
               <p>There were indeed ſome perſons, but their number was very ſmall, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſpent with ſo long a walk.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:032741_0060_0FF50AB5B2121998"/>
I paſſed ſome time in the contemplation of this wonderful ſtructure, and the great variety of objects which it preſented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy to ſee ſeveral dropping unexpectedly in the midſt of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that ſtood by them to ſave themſelves. Some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful poſture, and in the midſt of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſtumbled and fell out of ſight. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were very buſy in the purſuit of bubbles that glittered in their eyes and danced before them; but often when they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they ſunk. In this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of objects, I obſerved ſome with ſcimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thruſting ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral perſons on trap-doors which did not ſeem to lie in their way, and which they might have eſcaped, had they not been thus forced upon them.</p>
               <p>The genius ſeeing me indulge myſelf in this melancholy proſpect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it; Take thine eyes off the bridge, ſaid he, and tell me if thou ſeeſt any thing thou doſt not comprehend. Upon looking up, What mean, ſaid I, thoſe great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and ſettling upon it from time to time? I ſee vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures ſeveral
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032741_0061_0FF50AC3263470F8"/>
little winged boys, that pearch in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon the middle arches. Theſe, ſaid the genius, are envy, avarice, ſuperſtition deſpair, love, with the like cares and paſſions that infeſt human life.</p>
               <p>I here fetched a deep ſigh; Alas! ſaid I, man was made in vain! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow is he given away to miſery and mortality! tortured in life, and ſwallowed up in death! The genius being moved with compaſſion towards me, bid me quit ſo uncomfortable a proſpect. Look no more, ſaid he, on man in the firſt ſtage of his exiſtence, in his ſetting out for eternity? but caſt thine eye on that thick miſt into which the tide bears the ſeveral generations of mortals that fall into it. I directed my ſight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius ſtrengthened it with any ſupernatural force, or diſſipated part of the miſt that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I ſaw the valley opening at the farther end, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into an immenſe ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midſt of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds ſtill reſted on one half thereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that I could diſcover nothing in it: but the other appeared to me a vaſt ocean planted with innumerable iſlands, that were covered with fruits and flowers, and interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a thouſand little ſhining ſeas that ran among them. I could ſee perſons dreſſed in glorious habits with garlands upon their heads,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032741_0062_0FF50AD3B083A5B0"/>
paſſing among the trees, lying down by the ſides of fountains, or reſting on beds of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and could hear a confuſed harmony of ſinging birds, falling waters, human voices and muſical inſtruments. Gladneſs grew in me upon the diſcovery of ſo delightful a ſcene. I wiſhed for the wings of an eagle that I might fly away to thoſe happy ſeats; but the genius told me there was no paſſage to them, except through the gates of death that I ſaw opening every moment upon the bridge. The iſlands, ſaid he, that lie ſo freſh and green before thee, and with which the whole of the ocean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſpotted as far as thou canſt ſee, are more in number than the ſand on the ſea-ſhore; there are myriads of iſlands behind thoſe which thou here diſcovereſt, reaching further than thine eye, or even thine imagination can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend itſelf. Theſe are the manſions of good men after death, who according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are diſtributed among theſe ſeveral iſlands, which abound with pleaſure of different kinds and degrees, ſuitable to the reliſhes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of thoſe who are ſettled in them; ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery iſland is a paradiſe accommodated to its reſpective inhabitants. Are not theſe, O Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, habitations worth contending for; Does life appear miſerable, that gives thee opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of earning ſuch a reward? Is death to be feared that will convey thee to ſo happy an exiſtence? Think not man made in vain, who
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032741_0063_0FF4D43C4A330DB0"/>
has ſuch an eternity reſerved for him. I gazed with inexpreſſible pleaſure on theſe happy iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands. At length, ſaid I, ſhew me now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, the ſecrets that lie hid under thoſe dark clouds, which cover the ocean on the other ſide of the rock of adamant. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius making me no anſwer, I turned about to addreſs myſelf to him a ſecond time, but I found he had left me; I then turned again to the viſion which I had been ſo long contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating; but inſtead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy iſlands, I ſaw nothing but the long hollow vally of Bagdat, with oxen, ſheep, and camels grazing upon the ſides of it.</p>

               <head>The VISION of AMANDA.</head>
               <p>METHOUGHT I was walking through a delightful field from whence on a riſing hill I beheld a ſtately edifice. My curioſity led me to make up towards it. I found it ſurrounded with gardens and orchards, richly decked by nature and art. A moſt agreeable lady was ſtanding at the door who very courteouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me in to ſit down and reſt me: being tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hill, I accepted her kind offer.—Entering the houſe, I ſurveyed the magnificent apartments, and my eyes were dazzled with the rich furniture that adorned every room. The lady led me into a ſpacious parlour, where was a very comely gentleman, with ſeveral little beauties around him, the living pictures in miniature of the father and mother. I was
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032741_0064_0FF50AF8DF125498"/>
entertained there with a liberality ſuitable to the appearance they made and with that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous affability, which is the genuine effect of true gentility and good breeding. Whilſt with pleaſure I ſurveyed their happy circumſtance, which appeared to have no want of any thing to complete their felicity, I ſaid within myſelf; Sure theſe are extraordinary perſons, and this flow of proſperity muſt be the bountiful reward of Providence, for ſome eminent inſtance of virtue and piety. But when I had taken my leave, and was returning back, I met one, of whom I enquired the gentleman's character who was the owner of yonder ſeat; which, to my no ſmall ſurpriſe, I found to be very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. His plentiful eſtate was gotten by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and fraud, his beautiful children were the living monuments of his ſhame, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who made ſo ſplendid an appearance, and to whom he diſcovered ſo much ſeeming ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs was ſo far from being miſtreſs of the feat, that ſhe was only kept there as under a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to be a ſlave to his baſe luſts, he conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſatisfaction no farther than as the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in her countenance heightens her charms, and thereby renders her the more agreeable to him in the gratification of his brutiſh appetites and paſſions; and ſhe, continued my informer, puts a conſtant force upon herſelf to appear gay and cheerful, leſt her keeper ſhould turn her out, abandoned to ſhame and miſery. To preſerve her from the latter of which (after
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032741_0065_0FF50B087233C2C8"/>
the loſs of a good fortune) was ſhe prevailed on to comply with the lot ſhe ſhares. As ſoon as I parted from my company, I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no longer, but burſt out into this excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Wherefore, O Proſperity, wherefore is it that thou thus daily loadeſt the vicious with thy benefits, and giveſt them all that heart can wiſh? Whence comes it to paſs, that ſuch a wretch as this ſhall ſpend his days in caſe, and his nights in pleaſure, whilſt thou turneſt away with diſdain from the pious man, leaving him to groan under all the hardſhips of the moſt adverſe ſtate! O ſay! whence is it that thou art thus partial to the wicked? I had no ſooner ceaſed exclaiming in this manner, than looking forward, I ſaw Proſperity ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me arrayed, in her moſt gorgeous attire. The gay and glittering appearance muſt have raiſed delight in my breaſt, had it not been damped by the anger that appeared on her brow, when ſhe thus addreſſed me; Forbear taxing me with partiality in my proceedings; for were it in my inclination, it is not in my power, being only the ſervant of Providence, whoſe orders I never, in one ſingle inſtance, run counter to. Art thou, ſaid I, in a heat, the ſervant of Providence? a juſt, holy, wiſe, and powerful Providence! And will it ſuffer thee thus to careſs the impious, and ſlight and contemn the good! How can theſe things be? Proſperity diſappeared without making any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but immediately a reſplendant light ſhone
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032741_0066_0FF50B170F6E2648"/>
around me, and I heard a majeſtic voice call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to me from above, O thou blind mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, doſt thou dare to call in queſtion my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, becauſe thou canſt not ſee the wiſdom and equity of them? It would be juſt in me to puniſh thee ſeverely for thy raſhneſs, but for once I will overlook thy ignorance, and ſo far condeſcend to thy weakneſs as to give thee ſome view of the reaſons of my conduct.—Wherefore lift up thine eyes, and behold what ſhall now be diſcovered to thee. I did ſo, and found my ſight ſtrengthened to penetrate thro' the thick clouds, beyond which I ſaw Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeated on a lofty throne, and by him ſtood Proſperity and Adverſity with their various attendants waiting his orders. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a very amiable countenance ſtood at my right hand, who told me he was commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſolve my doubts, and reveal ſomewhat of the myſteries of Providence to me. I ſtraight obſerved Adverſity ordered with her attendant Pain to ſuch a place. I looked after them, and ſaw them enter the houſe of a perſon very remarkable for piety, and attack him in a moſt violent manner. Alas! ſaid I to my inſtructor, whence comes it to paſs that ſo good a man as this ſhould be ſo ſeverely handled? He is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, a very eminent Chriſtian, a man greatly beloved of his God. But how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoever this may ſeem to your carnal reaſon, it is therefore that he is thus afflicted; he has (as the beſt here have) much ſin ſtill remaining
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032741_0067_0FF50B2410871828"/>
in him, and much wanting to complete his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in grace and holineſs; and God, who is alone the proper judge of the moſt likely means to bring about his own wiſe and kind deſigns, ſees this the fitteſt method to root out ſin, and ſtrengthen and invigorate his graces. This affliction ſhall be to him a furnace, not to conſume him, but his luſts, and to refine and brighten his graces, that they may ſhine with greater luſtre. I then looked up again, and ſaw Adverſity with two of her attendants, Poverty and Sickneſs, ſent to another place. They ſoon attacked a perſon, who from an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent fortune was reduced to penury and want, and from a ſtrong and vigorous ſtate of health, was thrown upon a ſick bed. Pray, ſaid I, what is the character of this perſon, that is thus doubly attacked, and with ſuch violence? He is, replied my inſtructor, one that devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God in days of his youth, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very zealous and active in the ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, at his firſt ſetting out. But a long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of proſperity, with which he has been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, has had the but too common effect of enſnaring and captivating his thoughts and affections to the things of time and ſenſe. As riches en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Poverty is therefore ſent to waſte his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the idol being removed, he may be no longer tempted to adore it, and that he may, by his own experience, be convinced of the uncertainty of all ſublunary good. A long continued ſtate of health has abated his ſenſe of value of the mercy, and he has ſeemed to ſlight it as a common ſaver. Sickneſs is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent to teach him the worth of health, by the want of it; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Reproach is now ſent to humble him, to hide pride from his eyes, to make him fully ſenſible that the intereſt any have in man's eſteem is a bleſſing which deſcends from the ſame hand that diſpenſes thoſe qualifications that have a tendency to raiſe it. Soon after I lifted up my eyes again, and ſaw Adverſity with her attendants, Sickneſs and Death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their orders to ſeize the child of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon. Now, ſays my inſtructor, this is a ſincere Chriſtian, and the ſtroke to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted is perhaps the foreſt of a temporal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that could befal him. He is to be ſtript of an only child, and, a very promiſing one, in whom the fond parent might juſtly pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the proſpect of much comfort and ſatisfaction? and like good Jacob, <hi>His life ſeems to be bound up in the lad's life.</hi> But Providence, in much wiſdom and great goodneſs too, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his removal; in kindneſs both to parent and child; the lad being by the grace of God prepared for a better ſtate, is in great love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all the ſnares and temptations that attend the youthful ſtage, and thoſe oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſnares and trials that ſurround the man in his riper age: a more than common ſhare of which muſt have fallen to his lot had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this world. The parent will hereby

be convinced of, and humbled for the evil he has been guilty of in ſetting his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections too much on this ſo deſirable a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyment, which he ſees now to be but a fading, dying flower. And the ſupports and comforts he ſhall receive unden this heavy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al will ſtop the mouth of complaints, and force him to confeſs that God is the alone proper object of our warmeſt affection, ſince there is enough in him to make the Chriſtian happy in the loſs of the deareſt earthly comforts. Theſe (continued my teacher) are ſome of the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paradoxes in Providence, which thou, blind mortal, couldſt not diſcover by the dim light of reaſon; there are others which I am not permitted to reveal to thee; ſome of which thou wilt never ſee unravelled whilſt thou art cloathed with mortality. Let what thou haſt ſeen and heard ſuffice to aſſure thee, that God's thoughts are not like to thine but as far above them in wiſdom, as the heavens are above the earth. Hence it is, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo oft abound with this world's good, who have all their heaven here: whilſt the pious man is, by the ſharp attacks of Adverſity, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhort term of his exiſtence here, train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up for a ſtate of endleſs unallayed happineſs.</p>
               <p>I thanked my inſtructor, begged pardon for my raſhneſs, and promiſed, that I would no more arraign Divine Providence at the bar of my weak and ſhallow reaſon; and abaſhed and confounded at my ignorance and preſumption, awoke from my dream.</p>

Chriſt. Moſes did but talk with God, and how did his face ſhine with a beam of God! You may quickly know a ſoul that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and is familiar with Jeſus Chriſt; you ſhall ſee it ſhining forth with the glories of Chriſt: as wiſdom makes the face to ſhine, ſo Jeſus Chriſt makes the ſoul to ſhine; ſo that he that judiciouſly looks upon him can divine that that ſoul hath met with, and ſeen the Lord. I ſee by the reflection of the beams of righteouſneſs, he has been long viewing the ſon of righteouſneſs; he carries the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Chriſt upon him, and the very beauties of Chriſt about him; he looks like Chriſt and ſpeaks like Chriſt, he walks and lives like Chriſt, he reſembles, and knows he comes from Chriſt. That ſoul which is always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory of the Lord ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into his image from glory to glory. If that ſoul be ſo glorious that beholds God darkly, reflectively, as in a glaſs, and enjoys God at a diſtance, how glorious ſhall that ſoul be, that ſhall ſee him clearly and diſtinctly, face to face, and enjoy his immediate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jeſus Chriſt? We ſhall then be like him indeed, when we ſhall ſee him as he is; our bodies ſhall be like his; our glory ſhall be like his; our eternity ſhall be like his; who is the God of beauty, excellency, and ſweetneſs, concord, happineſs and eternity. O Lord, let me have ſuch clear viſions; ſuch ſweet fruitions of thee, that I may not only hereafter be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but may likewiſe now be holy.</p>

                  <l>I'm in a world where all is new;</l>
                  <l>Myſelf, my God; O bleſt amaze!</l>
                  <l>Not my beſt hopes or wiſhes knew</l>
                  <l>To form a ſhadow of this grace.</l>
                  <l>Fix'd on my God, my heart, adore;</l>
                  <l>My reſtleſs thoughts, forbear to rove,</l>
                  <l>Ye meaner paſſions, ſtir no more,</l>
                  <l>But all my powers be joy and love.</l>
