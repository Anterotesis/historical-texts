            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I will not ſay, That it is come to be with <hi>Ours,</hi> as it was in that Land, when it was La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, <hi>There was no open Viſion.</hi> There is at leaſt <hi>One Viſion</hi> that is <hi>Open</hi> to a General View, and is generally <hi>ſeen</hi> by all that have the <hi>ſight</hi> of any thing at all: A <hi>Viſion</hi> ſo <hi>plain,</hi> that he may <hi>Run who Readeth it.</hi> The <hi>Viſion</hi> which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry One ſees is this; <hi>A Day of Trouble, and of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding down, and of Perplexity by the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> upon this <hi>Valley of Viſion,</hi> and of <hi>Crying to the Mountains.</hi> Every body ſees and ſays, We are a <hi>Miſerable People,</hi> if there be not ſomething done to help us.</p>

            <p>A Wiſe Man under the Inſpiration of GOD, has told us, what is like to become of a People, that have <hi>no Viſion</hi> among them; None to <hi>ſee</hi> what their <hi>Dangers</hi> are, and <hi>ſee</hi> what <hi>Methods</hi> are to be taken for a Reſcue from them.</p>

            <p>VERILY, If this Courſe were followed, here would be a <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>; There would be a <hi>Viſion of Peace</hi> among us. Yea, How much of the <hi>Holy City,</hi> would <hi>Come down from GOD out of Heaven</hi> unto us! The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, are by their Office, the <hi>Watchmen</hi> of the People. Theſe <hi>Watchers,</hi> if they are, and, <hi>Lord, wilt thou not make them ſuch! — Holy Ones,</hi> they will be always on the <hi>Look-out,</hi> that they may <hi>ſee</hi> what occurs to Expoſe our People unto the Anger of GOD, by which <hi>we are Troubled</hi>; and that they may <hi>ſee</hi> what is to be done that the People may be brought back into the <hi>Favour</hi> of GOD, which our very <hi>Life</hi> does turn upon. Go on, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, O Men of GOD; and <hi>Men that have Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Viſions of GOD.</hi> And, O ye <hi>Stars,</hi> Do you <hi>Fight in your Courſes,</hi> againſt every Thing that brings Confuſion upon us. Never, Never, Let it be ſaid, as in Lam. II. 9. <hi>Her Prophets find no Viſion from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then, the <hi>Second Thing</hi> to be <hi>ſeen</hi> &amp; <hi>ſaid,</hi> and the <hi>Viſion</hi> whereof does with ſome Haſte croud in upon us, is This; There are ASSOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATIONS neceſſary.

For a Senſible Man, to <hi>Sit alone and keep Silence,</hi> or only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto a Neighbour as <hi>Unactive</hi> as himſelf, This may do for <hi>Lamentations.</hi> But if there be no more, the Caſe muſt be very <hi>Lamentable.</hi> Sirs, You muſt <hi>Get up and be doing</hi>; But know, that without <hi>United Endeavours,</hi> there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done to any purpoſe for our Deliverance. <hi>Aſſociations</hi> of well-diſpoſed Men, have had Mighty Succeſſes, and have <hi>done wondrouſly.</hi> SOCIETIES for the <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi> did Good and Great Things in our Nation, while they continued in their Vigour.

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002036_0011_0fba8395464a9c68"/>
is, That ſome Numbers of Capable Men, would form themſelves into <hi>Societies,</hi> to purſue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Enquiry, <hi>What may be done, to reſcue our Land out of the Diſtreſſes coming upon it, and render us an Happy People?</hi> It were well, if this were made more a point of <hi>Daily Converſation,</hi> in our Occaſional Interviews with one another. Certainly it were a more <hi>Noble Theam</hi> than thoſe Inſipid Impertinencies, which our <hi>Daily Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> is too commonly <hi>made Empty</hi> withal. But I preſs for a more <hi>Stated Converſation</hi> upon it, in <hi>Societies,</hi> which if they cannot themſelves put their own <hi>Projections</hi> in Execution, may yet make their <hi>Offers</hi> of <hi>Excellent Things,</hi> to thoſe by whom they can be Executed; and be <hi>Indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable!</hi> My Friends, Allow me to addreſs you after this Manner. <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, O ye People, that ye may not be broken in pieces; Take counſel together, that it may not come to nought.</hi> If <hi>GOD be with us,</hi> you will do ſo!</p>
            <p>WERE this Point once gained, Methinks, it might Superſede the reſt that I may have to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon. And indeed all the reſt, I would have to be Look'd upon, as Things chiefly tendered unto the Enquiry of ſuch <hi>Societies for the Belief of the Publick Diſtreſſes,</hi> when they ſhall be <hi>Aſſociated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will, in the next Place paſs to the <hi>Viſion,</hi> and mention of a <hi>Third Thing,</hi> which I muſt call, <hi>The Grand Expedient,</hi> for the preventing of the dreadful <hi>Perplexities,</hi> which this poor
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002036_0012_0fba839747ba0700"/>
Country finds growing upon it. That which I will again and again call, The GRAND EXPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIENT, is, <hi>Frugality,</hi> I ſay, <hi>Frugality</hi>; A Diſcrete, a Righteous, a Needful FRUGALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, in our Domeſtick Expences: More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, A <hi>Frugality</hi> in our TABLES, and a <hi>Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in our HABITS. That Man has no <hi>Viſion</hi> of the Country, or of its Intereſt, who does not ſee that our <hi>People muſt Periſh,</hi> if a wiſe <hi>Frugality</hi> be not more commonly practiſed. We are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with anxious Thoughts, How we ſhall anon get our <hi>Bread,</hi> and maintain our ſelves and our Families. But I may now ſay unto you, as in Prov. XX. 13. <hi>Open thine Eyes, and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with Bread.</hi> If you will but ſo far <hi>Open your Eyes,</hi> as to ſee, what <hi>Retrenchments</hi> of <hi>Expences</hi> are abſolutely Neceſſary; ſo Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that we ſhall now <hi>Sin grievouſly,</hi> if they be not complied withal; you will ſoon be in a way to <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU may not Challenge me for treſpaſſing on the Province of a <hi>Divine,</hi> or on the Buſineſs of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> if I inſiſt upon a Prudent and proper <hi>Frugality,</hi> as a Thing of the laſt Conſequence for the welfare of our People. Our Great SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, who is the very <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Frugality</hi> to His Diſciples, Even when He Miraculouſly Multiplied their <hi>Bread</hi> &amp; their <hi>Fiſh</hi> unto them. And without <hi>Frugality,</hi> WE cannot avoid that <hi>Iniquity,</hi> which will carry us into the <hi>Pathes of the Deſtroyer,</hi> and bring a <hi>Swift
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002036_0013_0fba8398e61bd818"/>
Deſtruction</hi> upon us. It has been one of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Invectives uſed by ſome Frowards againſt your Miniſters, That while we Preach <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> unto our People, <hi>Moral Honeſty</hi> is forgotten among them. Heaven and Earth will afford a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> That <hi>Moral Honeſty,</hi> is with the greateſt Fervency imaginable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you. But a <hi>Frugality,</hi> is now to be particularly Preached, as that without which all <hi>Moral Honeſty</hi> muſt quickly fail among you. You will Mark what I ſay unto you! Ingenious Men may and will project many <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> to retrieve the Difficulties that are growing upon us. But all their Projections will Signify nothing, and we can ſee none but a <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liative Cure,</hi> until we ſo Regulate our <hi>Expences,</hi> that we don't every Year continually run into <hi>Debt</hi> unto <hi>Other Countrys.</hi> How ſhall we avoid running into <hi>Debt</hi> unto <hi>Other Countrys,</hi> if we don't Moderate our <hi>Expences</hi> of ſuch Things as we fetch from thence, and are not able to Pay for? Nothing but a <hi>Frugality</hi> can help us; We <hi>Bleed unto Death,</hi> until that <hi>Sovereign Stiptick</hi> be applied unto us. Unleſs this One Thing be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Practice, all our <hi>Projectors</hi> will be <hi>Phyſicians of no value,</hi> and our Fate will be that; Jer. XLVI. 11. <hi>In vain ſhalt thou uſe many Medicines, for thou ſhalt not be cured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to our <hi>Tables,</hi> it is noted, that a great part of Mankind, are got into a more <hi>Plentiful way of Living</hi> than was uſed in the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a little <hi>Cake</hi> of Floure mingled with Oyl and baked in the Embers, was a Meal for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and Five ſuch Countrys as the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> 'tis thought would ſcarce yield the Fleſh that is now devoured in One City of <hi>Europe.</hi> Doubtleſs, we may have our ſhare in that <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,</hi> which this <hi>Plentiful way of Living</hi> has got into. Be ſure, if there were ſome Abatement of this, the <hi>Health</hi> of many, as well as their <hi>Purſe,</hi> would feel the advantage of it. As to our <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that there are ſeveral Places in the World, beſides <hi>Geneva,</hi> which ſet moſt imitable <hi>Patterns</hi> unto us, and it were to be wiſhed, that we were more Acquainted with them, and more conformed unto them. This you may be ſure of; If they that are worth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing, will <hi>Cloathe</hi> themſelves at the rate of Five Hundred a Year: and if every One will count it an <hi>Intollerable Diſgrace</hi> unto them, that they ſhould let any One appear more Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in their <hi>Cloathing</hi> than Themſelves; This <hi>Pride,</hi> cannot but <hi>bring us low.</hi> A Sin of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that will ſoon bring down upon us, the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of GOD!</p>
            <p>MY Friends, I am an importunate Suitor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, That you will allow this MAXIM to obtain among you. 'Tis ordinarily ſo, <hi>that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot lawfully Graſp at what they cannot Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Pay for.</hi> Yea, It were well, That People in their Expences to Subſiſt themſelves, would uſe to <hi>Pay</hi> as they <hi>Fetch,</hi> and not run into <hi>Long
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002036_0015_0fba839ef2bba008"/>
Scores,</hi> that anon won't be eaſy to be anſwered. By this Caution, they will be the better Able to know what they are Able to do, and ſeaſonably keep their Stops, and not indiſcreetly go beyond themſelves. 'Tis moſt certain, If People will not be ſatisfied except they <hi>Eat,</hi> or <hi>Drink,</hi> or <hi>Dreſs,</hi> beyond their Abilities, they do but <hi>ſerve diverſe Luſts</hi> in doing ſo; GOD will not <hi>Accept their works</hi>; A Righteous GOD will be offended at what they do. For People to Run into <hi>Debt,</hi> without a Proſpect of certainly &amp; ſpeedily get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of it, is no ſmall <hi>Iniquity.</hi> But when People ſhall do ſo, to gratify their <hi>Luxury</hi> or their <hi>Ambition,</hi> 'tis an Aggravation of the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Thoſe Vertues of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> Oh! could I ſee them, I would Speak unto them; and I would ſay, By you, <hi>O Noble Vertues,</hi> we ſhould <hi>Enjoy great Quietneſs,</hi> and <hi>very worthy Deeds</hi> would be done unto <hi>this Nation, by your Providence.</hi> But I turn to my Hearers; And let me not complain with the Prophet, <hi>I ſaid, I will get me unto the Great Men, and will ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; But they have altogether broken the Yoke, and burſt the Bonds.</hi> No, I will hopefully preſs for this; The <hi>Richer Sort</hi> of People, will do well to ſet a Convenient <hi>Example</hi> unto the <hi>Poorer Sort.</hi> We muſt contrive to make all Goodneſs a <hi>Faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Thing. <hi>Example,</hi>
               </hi> I ſay, <hi>Example,</hi> will go a great way to bring a Laudable <hi>Frugality,</hi> as well as all other Good Things into <hi>Faſhion.</hi> But then, that the <hi>Rich in this World,</hi> may not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002036_0016_0fba83a099dfd338"/>
be taxed for a Sordid Avarice, the <hi>Charge of GOD</hi> is to be laid upon them, that they be <hi>Rich in Good works.</hi> If they <hi>Frugally Save</hi> any thing, let them <hi>Liberally Spend</hi> the more on Pious and Publick Uſes: and this will bravely Vindicate them from diſhonourable Imputations. At the ſame time, It is to be demanded of the <hi>Poor,</hi> That they do not indulge an Affectation of making themſelves in all things appear equal with the <hi>Rich</hi>: But Patiently Submit unto the <hi>Difference,</hi> which GOD the <hi>Maker of you Both,</hi> has put between you. My Brethren, <hi>Be content with ſuch Things as you have</hi>: And be convinced of This, That you <hi>may not have,</hi> what you <hi>cannot have.</hi> If you will not Hearken to this Advice, I muſt ſay, <hi>The Poor, They are fooliſh; they know not the way of the Lord, nor the Judgment of their GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT I ſhall next proceed unto, may be an agreeable <hi>Appendix,</hi> unto what has been thus urged for. But I will make a <hi>Diſtinct Article</hi> of it; It ſhall be the <hi>Fourth Thing,</hi> which every one that has the leaſt <hi>Viſion</hi> of any thing at all, muſt needs be Apprehenſive of.</p>
            <p>INDUSTRY, I ſay, INDUSTRY, which is indeed but a piece of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> is what a <hi>People</hi> that would not <hi>Periſh,</hi> muſt keep alive among them. It is the <hi>Sluggard</hi> unto whom it is foretold, Prov. VI. 11. <hi>Thy Poverty ſhall come in as a Traveller</hi>; that is to ſay, Suddenly, and Unlook'd for, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of; <hi>And thy want as an Armed Man</hi>; that is to ſay, Irreſiſtibly, and ſo as to make thee
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002036_0017_0fba83a1eaaaa738"/>
fall before it. Let our People be an <hi>Induſtrious</hi> People, and we ſhall be in a fair way to be a <hi>Flouriſhing</hi> People. <hi>The Diligent Hand,</hi> I can tell you, it will do <hi>Marvellous</hi> Things; Things, which will appear little ſhort of <hi>Magical</hi>: [You know the Story of it!]— And the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of GOD will attend it, with an <hi>Enriching</hi> Efficacy. Truely, None that are Able to <hi>Work,</hi> ſhould have the <hi>Bread of Idleneſs</hi> allow'd unto them. Our <hi>Long Winters</hi> afford more of Lieſure to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Husbandman, than he wiſheth for. But were not a greater Variety of well contrived <hi>Winter-Employments</hi> for him, then to be wiſhed for? If the Poor will but <hi>Work,</hi> they would make a better hand of it in this Country, than in almoſt any under the Cope of Heaven. What Pity 'tis, that ſuch an <hi>Hive</hi> ſhould have any <hi>Drones</hi> in it! The Notable Behaviour of ſome <hi>Induſtrious Women</hi> in this Town, <hi>Induſtrious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> perhaps Deſolate and Forſaken <hi>Widows,</hi> who ſo credibly Support themſelves that they alſo Do Good unto thoſe about them; Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſpeaks unto all our People, who are not ſo abſurd and ſilly, as to think, That <hi>Buſineſs</hi> is more of a ſhame than <hi>Idleneſs.</hi> There are Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Hands in this Country, who are capable of being ſet about many <hi>Profitable works</hi>; of all their <hi>Labour</hi> there would be a <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002036_0018_0fba83a38b146148"/>THE <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that would <hi>find out witty Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to Employ theſe Hands, would be juſtly Eſteemed, <hi>The Wiſdom that is from Above</hi>: The <hi>Good Fruits</hi> of it would be wonderful! <hi>Induſtry</hi> in a fit <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> verily, T'would not only keep off <hi>Poverty,</hi> but alſo contribute, unto all <hi>Good Manners,</hi> and preſerve the <hi>Morals,</hi> and preſerve the <hi>Comforts,</hi> of People to admiration.

               </gap>ngenuity, would bring it about, That People may more generally have <hi>Something to Do,</hi> and be more Effectually Put upon the doing of it; They would certainly do a Better Thing, than if they ſhould <hi>beſtow all their Goods to feed the Poor</hi>; T'would be the Charity of more obliging Benefactors.</p>
            <p>BUT, Oh! <hi>Suffer me a little, that I may ſhew you what I yet have, to ſpeak, on the behalf of GOD,</hi> and of a People, who have as yet many of His Children among them.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, Do not ſay, I am a vain <hi>Viſionary,</hi> if I tell you now, in the <hi>Fifth</hi> Place, That there is to be <hi>ſeen</hi> ſome Hazard, of ſuch <hi>Characters</hi> growing upon us, as will be very Diſagreeable, very Diſreputable, to a People of our High Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Sirs, <hi>Who ſees it not</hi>? We are taught; Prov. XIV. 34. <hi>Sin is a Reproach to any People.</hi> It is very ſure. We are a People ſo Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo <hi>Lifted up to Heaven</hi> in the <hi>Glorious Goſpel,</hi> and the Means of Inſtruction and Salvation diſpens'd unto us, that if we be not the Beſt People under Heaven,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002036_0019_0fba83aa680ea768"/>
we are of all People the moſt inexcuſable. I pray, Let us Beware of thoſe things which will be a <hi>Reproach to any People</hi>; but more Indelibly and infinitely ſo to Us, than to any People; and which being found among us, will render us a People more likely and more worthy to <hi>Periſh,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Families of the Earth,</hi> which have not been ſo <hi>known</hi> as we have been.</p>
            <p>AND now, in the <hi>Viſions of GOD, I Lift up my Eyes, and Look, and behold, A Flying Roll!</hi> 'Tis, A <hi>Catalogue</hi> of Things Greatly to be Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended among the People of <hi>New-England</hi>; Things greatly to be Deprecated. I will tell you what I Read in the <hi>Catalogue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE Thing to be Read, is this; It will have no good Aſpect upon our People, if it ſhould be ſo, that a <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> ſhould be a Loſt, and a Rare Thing among us; — that he who would make a Speech to the Men of a <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> muſt go into the Burying Places, and Speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Sepulchres.</hi> A ſad Thing, if in all Conſultations for the <hi>Publick,</hi> every Man take all his Meaſures from his own <hi>Self,</hi> and nothing muſt be done Except this dear <hi>Self</hi> may be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it! A ſad Thing, if when Things are Calculated for the <hi>Good of the whole,</hi> every Man will obſtruct them, if he don't perceive his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Intereſt</hi> ſerved in them! And much more A ſad Thing, if Men to ſerve a <hi>Perſonal Intereſt</hi> will Do Things that ſhall be plainly for the <hi>Hurt of the whole</hi>! GOD <hi>Avert the Omens!</hi> —
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002036_0020_0fba83abaa95eaa0"/>
I muſt confeſs, I have often heard <hi>Strangers,</hi> with abundance of <hi>Ill Nature,</hi> and <hi>Ill Breeding</hi> to make Reflections on the Country, in which they have been Hoſpitably treated. But, it would be a ſad Thing, if it ſhould be True, what I have heard ſpoken by ſome Eminent and more Impartial Strangers; <hi>That the Old and Vile Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,</hi> Every Man for himſelf, and GOD for us all, <hi>Seems to have been made for this Poor Country, as much as for moſt in the World!</hi> Indeed Men of a truly <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> uſually meet with ſuch U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, as were enough to diſcourage any thing that ſhall not be very <hi>Gracious,</hi> very <hi>Generous.</hi> But ſtill, Revive, <hi>O Publick Spirit</hi>; Hold on, Hold out; <hi>Thy Reward is with thy GOD</hi>: If Thou fail, we <hi>Periſh</hi> unavoidably.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Thing to be Read, is this. It will have no good Aſpect upon us, if it ſhould be ſo, that a <hi>Levelling Spirit</hi> get ſo much Head among us, that no Man ſhall be in any thing <hi>Superiour</hi> to his Neighbours, but his very <hi>Superiority</hi> ſhall make him Obnoxious to Envious Indignities, Obnoxious to all poſſible Deplumations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations. How contrary this, to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, that ſays, <hi>In Honour prefer one another</hi>!</p>
            <p>A Third Thing to be Read, is this. It will have no good Aſpect upon us, if an <hi>Unloving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> be ſo prevailing, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Piques,</hi> and Prejudices, and Emulations and Animoſities, are kept in a continual Operation; and it ſhall be noted, That
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002036_0021_0fba83adbb947cb8"/>
even where they have ſo much Wit as to make little Noiſe of their <hi>Feuds,</hi> yet you ſhall often find the Families not ſo well-diſpoſed unto one another, as were to be deſired? How contrary this, to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, that ſays, <hi>Be kindly affection'd one to another with Brotherly Love</hi>!</p>
            <p>A Fourth Thing to be Read, is This.

of the People, for theſe unhappy Creatures. But, if the <hi>Pity</hi> ſhould, which you may be ſure, <hi>It won't</hi>! — proceed ſo far as to Abet and Shelter them, the whole Country becomes Obnoxious to the dreadful Reſentments of the Crown, and of the Nation which we depend upon. And if, as the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> after a mad Crue among them, had committed a curſed Outrage, ſent the moſt eminent Miniſter they had among them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede at the Court of the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> for them, we ſhould ſend never ſo Many and Mournful Interceſſors, t'will be well if we come off ſo well as the poor People of <hi>Antioch.</hi> O our dear People, Hearken, Hearken, to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of GOD.

            <p>ANY Man may, without much of a <hi>Second Sight,</hi> eaſily Foreſee ſuch a Thing as this; That <hi>This</hi> is not a Country where <hi>Great Eſtates</hi> are in our Days are to be Looked for. 'Tis indeed a Geographical Obſervation, and the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is much to be Obſerved and Admired

and Adored in it, That Countrys which are much accommodated with <hi>Good Harbours,</hi> are ſuch as GOD has moſt furniſhed with the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Wealth</hi> muſt by conſequence flow in upon them.
