            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE find recorded in the ſacred Scripture, that he who had but one talent, <hi>went and hid it in the earth.</hi> But I, though I have but half a talent, am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to uſe it to the beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Much of your time and money has been already ſpent in hearing LECTURES.—Lectures on philoſophy—Lectures on grammar—Lectures on languages, both dead and living, have been delivered. Lectures on heads, and hearts, have been heard with great applauſe. Lectures on politics, from New-Hampſhire to Georgia—yea, from beyond Babylon, from China to Chippawa, have ſounded in our ears. Long lectures on law are daily delivered, to the great perplexity of all jurymen. Lectures on phyſic, or, more learnedly, upon <hi>materia medica,</hi> ſome of you may have heard; and our churches echo and re-echo with lectures on divinity.—But no lecture, to my knowledge, has been delivered to ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHANICS worthy to engage their attention:—I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who had the good fortune to be born the ſon of a mechanic, have taken on me the important taſk of lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to that reſpectable part of the community.</p>
            <p>Taking it for granted, gentlemen MECHANICS, that you poſſeſs thoſe ſentiments of candor, and generoſity, which are more ready to excuſe faults than to impute them, even where they really are, I do the more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028154_0004_0FD83FD1E6F52118"/>
I ſhall attempt to treat of your different profeſſions ſeparately; though it cannot be expected that every profeſſion will be fully treated of. <hi>My abilities are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, abilities ſuperior to mine would be unequal, to ſuch a taſk.</hi>—I ſhall therefore dwell, only on thoſe branches which appear moſt important, and neceſſary to the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Were I addreſſing an audience of country gentlemen, on the pleaſing ſubject of agriculture, I ſhould probably begin with our firſt parents, Adam and Eve, in their primogenial ſtate:—But, when I have the honor of addreſſing MECHANICS, and treating of ARCHITECTURE, the ſublime ſubject requires that I begin long before the days of Adam:—for who but an all-wiſe and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ARCHITECT, could plan the heavens, and bring into exiſtence an univerſe of worlds! In the language of the poet,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>All nature is but</hi> ART <hi>unknown to thee,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>All</hi> chance, DIRECTION! <hi>which thou canſt not ſee.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Caſt your thoughts back into eternity! There, before creation began, the philoſophic eye diſcovers an infinite maze, which the wiſdom of man is unable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. All then was one continued ocean of <hi>chaes, without a bottom, and without a ſhare; the centre of which was every where, and the circumference no where.</hi> God, the great Architect of worlds was the centre: He, by infinite wiſdom, called that glorious luminary the ſun into exiſtence; then, with his almighty compaſſes, ſwept the circling path of every world. He was the firſt MECHANIC. He laid the foundation of the earth, that it ſhould never be removed; and it was HE who ſpread the beautiful curtains of heaven, beſpangled with brilliant ſtars.—"When we conſider the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the work of his fingers, the ſun and the ſtars, which he hath ordained," we are filled with the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028154_0005_0FD83FD3182A3FB0"/>
ſentiments of adoration which impelled good old David to cry cut—<hi>Lord! what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him!</hi> By one all ſublime ARCHITECT, the heavens were framed—worlds, mountains, rivers, beaſts, and birds, were made; and by the ſame Almighty MECHANIC man was formed—and to crown the whole, woman being taken from man, came forth double refined, the moſt perfect work of all creation. Here we obſerve, that, the Almighty did, not only plan his own work, but did execute it Himſelf. This may ſerve to us as a perpetual example of induſtry:—for if the Deity Himſelf, did not think it degrading his character to labour, how deſpicable muſt that man appear who deſpiſes labour, or a labourer!</p>
            <p>I now proceed to conſider mortal man as a MECHAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IC. The firſt man and woman were at the beginning gardeners; for we read, that <hi>they were put into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden, to keep it and to dreſs it.</hi> But when the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of Eve, prompted by the devil, had ruined for ever her peace of mind; honeſt Adam, like every fond huſband, grieved at the penſive tears of his beloved rib, could not endure to ſee her unhappy alone; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that miſery loves company, he alſo taſted the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious morſel. Then, and not till then, they diſcovered their want of clothes. Neceſſity, the mother of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ARTS, ſoon put it into their heads to few fig-leaves together, by which they furniſhed themſelves with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prons. Thus we ſee that the firſt man was a MECHAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IC. And what was his trade?—A TAYLOR!—and his wiſe a tayloreſs; for they both ſewed.—I know it has been a common ſaying, that it takes nine taylors to make one man; but we find the truth is, that one taylor was the father of all men. Kings and queens, princes and princeſſes, emperors and nabobs, lords and beggars, are all the deſcendants of one TAYLOR!!—If we could
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028154_0006_0FD83FD4984184B8"/>
be brought to realiſe this truth, with what reverence ſhould we bow to that ancient and venerable order of the <hi>needle and thread!</hi> I know it will be argued by <hi>needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi> that before Adam could ſew he muſt have had a needle. But we may ſuppoſe that a <hi>thorn,</hi> with a piece of tough bark anſwered for the firſt needle and thread.</p>
            <p>I ſhall attempt to draw ſome good inſtruction from each trade as I paſs along. The fig-leaves, you know could have anſwered but little purpoſe alone; but a number of them joined together, did anſwer a <hi>very good purpoſe.</hi> This teaches us, that man can be of little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the world while alone, but being united, nothing is too hard for him to accompliſh. Even one man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly united was capable of peopling the whole world!</p>
            <p>As it is the buſineſs of a taylor to ſew many pieces together, in order to make one garment; ſo in ſociety, let them endeavor to ſew every member together in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to promote the general good—to unite neighbors together, with the baſting threads of love, and ſew them faſt with the cords of virtue: But, cut off all the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and tatters of ſociety, with the ſhears of denial; ſtab the wicked with the ſharp bodkins of conſcience, and preſs down tyranny with an iron gooſe.</p>
            <p>That which was moſt neceſſary was firſt attended to, namely, an apron: and after our firſt parents had given themſelves a tolerable ſuit of fig-leaves, 'tis probable the next thing that claimed their attention, was a houſe, to ſcreen them from the inclement ſtorms. A hollow tree might have anſwered for a ſhort time, but as that could not have been convenient, a houſe muſt have been built. Now in building a houſe, gentlemen, which mechanic is firſt employed?—Certainly the</p>
            <div type="profession">
               <head>MASON.</head>
               <p>The maſon lays the foundation, and without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation you know the building could not ſtand.—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028154_0007_0FD83FD6192DFBE0"/>
There is a ſociety ſcattered abroad over the earth, which call themſelves <hi>free maſons</hi>—yet ſome of them are the greateſt ſlaves in the world; and ſlaves to the worſt of maſters, paſſion and vice. Can ſuch be called Free Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? No: but every MASON in Pennſylvania, who is twenty-one years old, is truly a <hi>free maſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The art of maſonry we find to be very ancient; for, to ſay nothing of the foundations of the earth, laid by the firſt grand maſter maſon, we ſhall begin with the mighty tower of Babel.</p>
               <p>Men fearing that a flood of waters would again deluge the earth, for their mutual ſafety, aſſembled together, and formed one grand congreſs of the world: at which they agreed to build a tower, <hi>whoſe top ſhould reach hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> that when the waters ſhould come again, they might fly thereto and be ſafe. And what but the ſolid work of MASONS could be deemed ſufficient to lay the foundation of ſuch a work!—Stones formed by the hand of Nature, being the moſt permanent of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, were probably made uſe of to lay the foundation of this mighty fabric. But here the ambitious views of man were blaſted.—The Almighty King of heaven and earth, who knows beſt what is good for man, would not ſuffer him in his mortal ſtate, thus to ſcale the walls of heaven. HE, being perfect maſter of all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as well as arts and ſciences, deſcended from his lofty throne and confounded the language of man; and introduced new languages which the ſons of men could not underſtand. This alone was ſufficient to fruſtrate their deſign; for when the maſons called for mortar, the attendants brought ſtone; and when they called for ſtone, the attendants brought mortar. Their words founded as uncouth to one another, as dead languages found now-a-days to living ears. Mad and perplexed at their own confuſed jargon, "they left off to build,"
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028154_0008_0FD83FDB3957EE80"/>
and ſeparating from each other, ſpread themſelves over the face of the earth, and laid the foundations of cities.</p>
               <p>The pyramids of Egypt, thoſe amazing piles, which has been the aſtoniſhment of many ages, and which ſeem to bid defiance, even to time itſelf, none but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could build. That ſtupenduous wall which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates China from Tartary, fifteen hundred miles in length, very thick and very high, was built by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of China, to prevent the incurſions of the Tartarian robbers. It has already borne the ſtorms, of more than eighteen hundred years, and will probably remain the admiration of many ages yet unborn.</p>
               <p>The magnificent walls of Babylon, have been much celebrated by hiſtorians; but the wild ambition of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant warrior, levelled them to the ground. Though the plan of this famous city of Philadelphia, ſo juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for its regularity, was drawn from ancient Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ylon; yet it was you, gentlemen Maſons, and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who laid its foundations.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="profession">
               <head>CARPENTERS.</head>
               <p>Much is due to Maſons for laying foundations and raiſing walls; but without CARPENTERS, their work would be incomplete; for a houſe, without a roof, would be but a poor ſhelter, and without the inſide work would be but a ſhell. Though you might build a houſe, yet it would ſmoke without a chimney; and a ſmoky houſe always makes a ſcolding wife; and two ſuch evils would be intolerable: Therefore you cannot build a houſe complete, without the aſſiſtance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but a ſtable perhaps you may. And a ſtable, we are informed, was the birth-place of the Prince of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters; that divine Mechanic, who taught men that profeſſion alone, was not ſufficient to ſupport them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, or the world to come. HE broke off the ſhackles of ſuperſtition, which had long been rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028154_0009_0FD83FDC0C4403C0"/>
on the minds of men; and taught, that true religion conſiſted in <hi>doing to others thoſe things which we would that others ſhould do unto us.</hi> HE, by divine precepts, by his moral life, and virtuous examples, is juſtly eſteemed the Saviour of men. This was the CARPENTER, the ſon of Joſeph. His abilities were too great, and his genius too extenſive, to be confined to wood: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid by periſhable things, and, with divine wiſdom, framed a building, wide as the world, deep as its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and more durable than pillars of braſs. <hi>The ſtars ſhall fade away, the ſun himſelf grow dim with age, and nature find in years,</hi> but this building, founded on truth, ſhall ſtand ſecure <hi>amidſt the war of elements, the wreck of matter, and the cruſh of worlds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What profeſſion of mechanics can boaſt of a building capable to outride the tempeſt of an univerſal deluge? None but carpenters can ſhare this glory; and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carpenters only. Noah the great ſhip-wright of the old world, was the man highly favored of God.

my father was a BLACKSMITH. And though I am not able to trace back his pedigree, through the dark ages of monkiſh ignorance; yet I have no doubt but he was a deſcendant from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that philoſoper of philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophers, that great Blackſmith, who to his immortal hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by ſmiting on his anvil, firſt diſcovered the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſounds. He diſcovered that ſounds were grave or acute, in proportion to the weight of his anvil: by which muſic, that moſt divine and pleaſing of all ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, has been greatly improved. He was probably the ſon of Tubal Cain, the firſt man who was cunning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to work in braſs and iron: And Tubal Cain muſt have been a near relation of Jubal, the grandſon of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who was the firſt, according to Moſes, that ever played on the harp and organ. Thus, gentlemen, you ſee that I am deſcended from a family as ancient as that of the kings of England, and a race as much more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as their virtues were ſuperior.</p>
               <p>But to return to you, gentlemen Smiths, I have before obſerved, that the advantages ariſing to all mechanics from the labour of your hands are very great:—without you, they could do nothing. You furniſh the lords of the ſoil with plowſhares, by which they are enabled to feed the world with bread. You furniſh the ſoldier with weapons to defend his country, and he, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires, ſtands ready to beat down the foe.

                     <hi>Some years ago, when a Britiſh regiment of Scotſmen were ſtationed in this city a fray happened between ſome of them and a number of blackſmiths. The ſmiths armed themſelves with red hot nail rods, and, notwithſtanding the mickle broad ſwords, drove the highland laddies off the field to their barracks.</hi>

It is ſaid in the heathen theology, that you are the deſcendents of Vulcan, god of ſubterranean fires, and that he came from heaven, and ſet up a ſmith's ſhop in the iſland of Lemnos, where he forged thunder bolts for his father Jupiter. Whether this ſtory be true or not, it matters not;—but certain it is, that you have power to heap live coals of fire on the heads of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies; and you can ſoften ſteel, which is harder than a lady's heart. You have the advantage of all other profeſſions; for ſhould the <hi>iron</hi> hand of poverty bear hard upon you, you can ſell even your <hi>viſes</hi> for bread!

               <p>I have been at a loſs whether to conſider Barbers in the line of Mechanics, or to claſs them with the nobility;—but when I ſee a head come from under their hands, I can no longer doubt of their proceeding by mechanical operations.

I am not well enough acquainted with the hiſtory of Barbers to trace out their pedigree, or to enumerate many of their heroic deeds; one alone is ſufficient to hand them down in the liſt of high ſame, to the lateſt poſterity;—for when the united power of the Philiſtines was not ſufficient to ſubdue the intrepid Sampſon, one Barber could ſhave his head, and render him weak like another man.

That is, <hi>all</hi> that he ought to be. When a great lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men dies, we often ſee a long ſtring of epitaph, enumerating a thouſand virtues which he never had; and which no body will believe he had.

Yet in this inſtance I think it ought to be tranſlated Tanner; becauſe, had they agreed to fortify the town with leather, it need not have been curried; and beſides, the leather muſt have firſt come from the Tanner.

               <p>Like the Poet, muſt have the moving principles of their arts planted in them by the hand of nature: for there was never a good ſculptor, painter, or poet, to whom nature has not been liberal of her favors. In this reſpect the painter and ſculptor take the right hand of all arts.</p>
               <p>The Sculptor may carve an image, and the Painter give it a colour which may externally vie, even with the works of the Deity. But come to examine it, we find a lifeleſs form; a ſhape without ſenſe. This cannot fail to impreſs the mind of the workman with the moſt exalted ideas of that all-wiſe Sculptor, who not only made man a perfect image, but had power to animate that image, and endow it with rational faculties.</p>
               <p>Dryden tells the ſtory of Pygmalion the Carver, an old batchelor and pretended woman hater; who in the fifty-ninth year of his age, being out-ſtanded in the field of love, was determined to have no farther connection with the ſex. But he could not be at peace when he had loſt ſight of them; yet, poſſeſt of more fortitude than <hi>Galvon,</hi> would not blow out his brains neither.—He determined to have one of his own make; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſet himſelf to work, and carved the image of a lady—ſo beautiful, that he fell deſperately in love with the work of his own hands. But ſhe, unmoved at his wooing tales, treated him with colder indifference than any one he had before paid his addreſſes to. He therefore humbly prayed to the gods (who were very numerous in thoſe days) to give life to his beloved idol. The gods, out of pity, granted his requeſt. She open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her eyes; <hi>Life wondered up and down through all her frame, and lighted every charm.</hi>

               <p>Chariot making is more ancient than the earth itſelf; for, according to the opinion of Milton (which ſeems to be the prevailing opinion of modern divines) the trade was carried on in heaven, long before the earth was made.—"Now ſtorming ſury roſe, and clamor, ſuch as heard in heaven till now was never; arms on armor, claſh'd horrible diſcord; and the madding wheels of brazen <hi>chariots</hi> raged: dire was the noiſe of conflict; all heaven refounded, and had earth been <hi>then,</hi> all earth had to her centre ſhook."</p>

hundred choſen <hi>chariots;</hi> and all the <hi>chariots</hi> of Egypt." And when they had got into the dry Red ſea, "the Lord looked through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the hoſt of the Egyptians, and took off their <hi>chariot</hi> wheels, that they drave them heavily."</p>
               <p>Elijah the prophet was carried up to heaven in a <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iot</hi> of fire; and 'tis probable that Enoch the ſon of Jared and father of Methuſelah, was likewiſe taken up in a chariot: for we read, that after he had lived three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty-five years, "he was not, for God took him." And why ſhould not Enoch ride to heaven in a chariot as well as Elijah?</p>
               <p>In many places of the Bible we read of chariots; but I do not recollect any mention made of <hi>coaches:</hi> which leads us to conclude, that coaches are not ſo ancient as chariots. But the <hi>art</hi> of making coaches and chariots ſeem now-a-days to be all one.</p>
               <p>All pleaſureable carriages are conſidered as articles of luxury, and entirely unneceſſary in a country like ours: but as this city manufactures many of them for other countries, and thereby brings us money, it muſt be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a very advantageous buſineſs both to individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, and to the community at large.</p>
               <p>Both in the times of the Old Teſtament and the New, chariots ſeem to have been the favorite carriages; for we read, in the eighth chapter of Acts, that when the great African eunuch belonging to Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, came to Jeruſalem to worſhip, he rode in his <hi>chariot,</hi> and read Eſaias the prophet. "Then the Spirit ſaid unto Philip, Go near and join thyſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>chariot.</hi> And the eunuch deſired Philip to come up and fit with him.—Then Philip opened his mouth, and preached to him JESUS;" By which the eunuch was converted to Chriſtianity as he rode in his <hi>chariot.</hi> And when they came to a water, "he commanded the
