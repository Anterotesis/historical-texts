            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>OCTOBER <hi>1</hi>≈øt.</head>
               <p>THE Pre≈øident, Members, and Judge Advocate being duly ≈øworn, the Court proceed to the trial of Major General Schuyler, who appears, and the following charge (contained in a report of a Committee of Congre≈øs, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and ≈øtate charges, again≈øt the General Officers, who were in the Northern Department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated) is exhibited again≈øt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neglect of Duty,</hi> in not being pre≈øent at Ticonderoga to di≈øcharge the functions of his command, from the middle of June, 1777, until it was no longer po≈ø≈øible to maintain Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øafety of the troops and ≈øtores, when he ≈øhould have cau≈øed a retreat to be made for the pre≈øervation of both,‚Äîunder the 5th article of the 18th ≈øection of the Rules and Articles of War.</p>
               <p>Major General Schuyler, being de≈øired to plead, ≈øays, I admit that I was ab≈øent from Ticonderoga from the 24th of June to the conclu≈øion of the ≈øiege, but I beg leave to in≈øi≈øt, and doubt not ≈øhall be able to prove, that I was guilty of no neglect of duty in not being there.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate ob≈øerves, That Major General Schuyler having been appointed to command the Northern Department (including Albany, Ticonderoga, Fort Stanwix, and their dependencies) he was, by Congre≈øs, on the 22d of May, 1777, relea≈øed from all re≈øtraint re≈øpecting the e≈øtabli≈øhment of his Head-Quarters.</p>
               <p>That, by letters to him from General St. Clair, Commanding Officer at Ticonderoga, dated the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1≈øt of July, 1777, he was informed of the de≈øigns, ≈øtrength and advance of the enemy again≈øt Ticonderoga, and of the great danger in which that po≈øt and Mount Independence would be, in ca≈øe of an attack.</p>
               <p>That it appears, in con≈øequence of the letters of the 13th and 18th of June, he went to Ticonderoga; for on the 20th he there held a Council of War. That, although in this Council of War it was determined that the effective rank and file were greatly inadequate to the defence of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, but that neverthele≈øs both po≈øts ought to be maintained as long as po≈ø≈øible, con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øafety of the troops and ≈øtores, and that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient, and that the repairs and additions to them ought to claim immediate attention, yet General Schuyler made no ≈øtay at Ticonderoga, to expedite the works on Mount Independence, and to cau≈øe a retreat to be made, when it became no longer po≈ø≈øible to maintain the po≈øts, con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øafety of the troops and ≈øtores; for his ab≈øence appears from General St. Clair's letter to him on the 24th of June, and tho≈øe that followed.</p>
               <p>That, Ticonderoga and Mount Independence being the po≈øts of greate≈øt defence to the United States again≈øt the advance of the Briti≈øh forces from Canada, and the main army of the Northern Department being ≈øtationed at tho≈øe po≈øts, it was General Schuyler's duty to have been at the head of that army, and to have remained there, when he knew the enemy were actually advanced again≈øt it. That his forces were greatly inadequate to the defence of the po≈øts, and that they were to be abandoned in the moment when it ≈øhould become no longer po≈ø≈øible to maintain them, con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øafety of the troops and ≈øtores, a moment, of which it was nece≈ø≈øary the fir≈øt-officer in the department ≈øhould judge.</p>
               <p>That, in the ab≈øence of General Schuyler, this critical and important moment pa≈ø≈øed unob≈øerved or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved; for on the 6th day of July the po≈øts were abandoned, with the lo≈øs of the ≈øick, ammunition, cannon, provi≈øion and cloathing of the army, and the lo≈øs of many lives in the retreat.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate produces a copy of a re≈øolution of Congre≈øs, dated March 6, 1776; a copy of a re≈øolution of Congre≈øs, dated May <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>That General Burgoyne is arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the Briti≈øh army is a≈ø≈øembling as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is ≈øaid to con≈øi≈øt of about ten thou≈øand men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John John≈øon, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River, whil≈øt the re≈øt of the army under General Burgoyne cro≈ø≈øes the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the inclo≈øed letter to General Sullivan) is all on the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at farthe≈øt.</p>
                           <p>From the nature and circum≈øtance of the pa≈øs granted to one of the two, which I here inclo≈øe, and his own account of the manner in which he was ≈øent from Montreal, viz. to ≈øearch plans of the country which he pretended to know were hid at Metcalf's, and his being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a con≈øiderable ≈øum of continental money, and ≈øome gold and ≈øilver, I have the ≈øtronge≈øt ≈øu≈øpicion of his being a ≈øpy, and have ≈øecured him as ≈øuch, and ≈øent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him your≈øelf, and that, if you ≈øhould think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, ≈øhould he be found guilty, the ≈øentence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer who lately ≈øuffered a ≈øpy he had in charge to e≈øcape, through the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt mi≈øconduct, has been honourably acquitted by a Court Martial.</p>
                           <p>You will likewi≈øe find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen ≈øent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circum≈øtance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if the≈øe fellows have really been ≈øent by him to ≈øee what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an ea≈øy reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwith≈øtanding be genuine, and Am≈øbury ≈øays it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a ≈øeparate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he ≈øeemed unwilling to part with, and which I ≈øuppo≈øe to have been a private ≈øignal by which he was to be known upon his return.</p>
                           <p>If the enemy intend to attack us, I a≈ø≈øure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of the continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, exclu≈øive of Baldwin's artificers 140, and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Be≈øides the≈øe there are three regiment of Hamp≈øhire militia, engaged for no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time, and who go off whenever they plea≈øe, 150 are gone ≈øince la≈øt return; two regiments of Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øachu≈øetts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with ≈øome of them is already expired. Among≈øt the number returned ≈øick there is no doubt but many would be u≈øeful in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this di≈øagreeable detail, but I have ≈øomething wor≈øe to add to it.‚ÄîWe cannot increa≈øe our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commi≈ø≈øary's return, and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for ≈øeven weeks only on the ground, and he has no pro≈øpect of any ≈øupply of ≈øalt-meat, but from ≈øome place near Still-Water, nor of fre≈øh, but by ≈øending to New-England for it.‚ÄîThis I have de≈øired him to do, but mu≈øt own I have little pro≈øpect of advantage from it; for be a≈ø≈øured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very ea≈øily be cut off.‚ÄîI have heard of ≈øome cattle below Crown-Point, which I ≈øhall ≈øend for to-morrow.</p>
                           <p>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy trouble≈øome job.‚ÄîThe ca≈ø≈øoons, Colonel Baldwin ≈øays, will be ≈øunk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower ≈øide of them, which will ≈øerve as a kind of ≈øecond boom, and retard at lea≈øt, if not prevent, the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels from pa≈ø≈øing, ≈øhould they attempt it.</p>
                           <p>A magazine of wood ≈øhould be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a ≈øtick upon the Mount.‚ÄîAll the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwi≈øe be nece≈ø≈øary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purpo≈øes.‚ÄîWhat can the Quarter-Ma≈øter mean by leaving this place, where ≈øo many works are to be carried on, without ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary an article as draught cattle?</p>
                           <p>The tents here are in general very bad. I mu≈øt beg you, my dear General, to ha≈øten up the new tents, for I ≈øhall get no good of the troops here in any way, whil≈øt they remain in barracks.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="5" facs="unknown:016142_0004_0F9B8E5D69B36A40"/>Our powder magazines are in ≈øo wretched a ≈øtate, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In ≈øhort, every thing is ≈øo much out of order, that I will add no more to this li≈øt of grievances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</p>
                           <p>When I write again, I hope to have ≈øomething more agreeable to entertain you with, and am, with much e≈øteem.</p>

                           <p>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and ≈øtores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is ≈øo drained I thought it needle≈øs to a≈øk for any from him, as he has almo≈øt literally nothing.</p>
                           <p>Since my la≈øt I have had con≈øtant ≈øcouts out, but have made no di≈øcovery of the enemy, ≈øave that four of their ve≈ø≈øels are lying about a mile on the hither ≈øide of the Split Rock; they con≈øi≈øt of two ≈øhips, and two gondolas; and on Friday la≈øt a ≈øchooner beat up within four miles of Crown Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</p>
                           <p>Ye≈øterday about noon we had two men, who had ≈øtrolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of ≈øavages, who had ≈øtole down to the road ≈øide betwixt M'Into≈øh's and the bridge, and concealed them≈øelves in the bu≈øhes; they were immediately pur≈øued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be overtaken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, however, they fell in with a ≈øcouting party I had ≈øent down to di≈øcover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and ≈øcalped, and one mi≈ø≈øing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</p>
                           <p>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned la≈øt night on di≈øcovering a large party of Indians on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the lake about four miles above Crown Point. I think of ≈øending to feel their pul≈øe to-night, as I am ≈øure it would be of con≈øequence to give the≈øe fellows a drubbing.</p>
                           <p>I am at a lo≈øs to form a judgment of the de≈øigns of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indi≈øcreet to put us on our guard by ≈øuch a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the ≈øavages to come on, unle≈øs they had an army not far off to ≈øupport them. Be that as it will, I ≈øhall u≈øe every precaution po≈ø≈øible again≈øt ≈øurprize, and will endeavour to penetrate their de≈øigns. The ≈øame rea≈øon, notwith≈øtanding our weakne≈øs, ≈øtill prevails again≈øt calling for the militia as when I wrote la≈øt, having as yet received no ≈øupply of meat either fre≈øh or ≈øalt.</p>
                           <p>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was rai≈øed. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promi≈øed his people that they ≈øhould have the ≈øame bounty as the troops of the State in which they were rai≈øed, notwith≈øtanding they were not part of their quota. This promi≈øe has not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I am making ≈øome improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga ≈øide have ≈øuch dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our pre≈øent numbers hold both. I de≈øign, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and, after defending Ticonderoga as long as po≈ø≈øible, retreat to Mount Independence.</p>
                           <p>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have ordered them to Albany. <hi>I am, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their de≈øign is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harra≈øs us, and give confidence to their ≈øavages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by ≈øome regular troops.

                           <p>I INFORMED you ye≈øterday that an encampment of the enemy had been di≈øcovered at Gilliland's Creek. La≈øt night two of their ve≈ø≈øels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are ≈øeven lying at that place; the re≈øt of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns di≈øtinctly at different places. They have al≈øo debarked ≈øome troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at Crown Point my ≈øcout-boat did not di≈øcover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpo≈øe, on account of their ≈øhipping; but I have ≈øent a party on this ≈øide the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a ju≈øt account of their ≈øituation.</p>
                           <p>I cannot help repeating to you the di≈øagreeable ≈øituation we are in, nor can I ≈øee the lea≈øt pro≈øpect of our being able to defend the po≈øts, unle≈øs the militia come in; and ≈øhould the enemy protract their operations, or inve≈øt us, and content them≈øelves with a ≈øimple blockade, we are infallibly ruined.

This, however, is clear to me, that we ≈øhall be obliged to abandon this ≈øide, and then they will ≈øoon force the other from us; nor do I ≈øee a retreat will in any ≈øhape be practicable. Every thing, however, ≈øhall be done, that is po≈ø≈øible, to fru≈øtrate the de≈øigns of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred. I ≈øhall write you again as ≈øoon as the ≈øcout returns,</p>

                              <salute>SIR,</salute>

                           <p>THIS moment I have received information from Hoite, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, ≈øuppo≈øed to be five hundred, and are de≈øigned to cut off the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Skeen≈øborough. They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before ye≈øterday, and killed and dre≈ø≈øed the cattle; and it is ≈øuppo≈øed that to-night they will be at the new road near Ca≈øtle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeen≈øborough. They reported that a very large party had gone on the we≈øt ≈øide of the Lake, to fall upon Fort George. That is ≈øaid to con≈øi≈øt of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</p>
                           <p>We have al≈øo had ju≈øt now another attack at the Mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The ≈øcene thickens fa≈øt, and Sunday next, it ≈øeems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We mu≈øt make the be≈øt we can of it, and I hope at lea≈øt to cripple them ≈øo as they may not be able to pur≈øue their fortune, ≈øhould it declare in their favour.</p>
                           <p>I ≈øent a party down la≈øt night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me ≈øome unea≈øine≈øs. I hope, however, they are ≈øafe, and will bring me ≈øome intelligence of con≈øequence. I have ≈øome thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the wor≈øt, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many left to become pri≈øoners.</p>
                           <p>I have ≈øent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to de≈øire that all they can po≈ø≈øibly ≈øpare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</p>

                           <p>MY ≈øcout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It con≈øi≈øted of three men only, the be≈øt of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for that purpo≈øe. The woods are ≈øo full of Indians, that it is difficult for parties to get through. I ≈øhall ≈øend off Whitcomb him≈øelf

pre≈øently, for intelligence I mu≈øt have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, le≈øt he ≈øhould fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no ≈ømall de≈øire to have him in their power.</p>
                           <p>I ≈øent Colonel Warner to the Grants ye≈øterday, to rai≈øe a body of men to oppo≈øe the incur≈øions of the ≈øavages that are gone by Otter Creek, and have ordered him to attack and rout them, and join me again as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible. I am very happy to find the country were apprized of the march of that party before Col. Warner got to Skeen≈øborough, as it will probably prevent their ≈øucce≈øs, and may end in their ruin.</p>
                           <p>We are going on with the nece≈ø≈øary works on the Mount as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible, and have removed the mo≈øt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable of the ≈øtores and provi≈øion to that ≈øide. The bridge is in very little more forwardne≈øs, to appearance, than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will fini≈øh the getting timber for it. The boom is likewi≈øe placed, but very feebly ≈øecured for want of cables.</p>
                           <p>A party of Bradford's arrived ye≈øterday in very good ≈øea≈øon, and has had a plea≈øing effect upon our people, who, never the mo≈øt lively or gallant, began to ≈øhow ≈øigns of dejection already. How they may hold out, God knows, but this has rai≈øed their ≈øpirits a little.</p>
                           <p>I could wi≈øh the batteaus were all over ≈øoon, or that you would not ≈øend them. I am extremely apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive that the enemy will po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I cannot find a ≈øingle per≈øon, on whom I can depend, to venture among≈øt them for intelligence; but from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclude that they are either in full force, or very weak, and hope by letting loo≈øe the Indian, to intimidate us.

                           <p>THIS morning ≈øome of the enemy's gun-boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could ≈øee them di≈øembark a number of men, and the boats increa≈øed to eighteen, which are now lying abrea≈øt from the hither ≈øide of the point to about half way acro≈øs the Lake. The batteaus in which they tran≈øported their troops are not come in ≈øight, lying on the far ≈øide of the point, under cover of it.</p>
                           <p>Soon after their landing, a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, pu≈øhed towards our lines. As we had a ≈øcout down the Lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately ≈øent out two parties to ≈øupport and bring them off. The ≈øcout fell in with the enemy, and after a few ≈øhot, in which they ≈øay ≈øome of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, di≈øper≈øed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greate≈øt part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that ≈øome of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but they were occa≈øioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</p>
                           <p>My people are in the be≈øt di≈øpo≈øition po≈ø≈øible, and I have no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, ≈øhould they think proper to attack us; and if the per≈øon I mentioned to you in my la≈øt pur≈øues the opportunity that now pre≈øents it≈øelf, they will go back fa≈øter than they came on.

On the ≈øubject of Captain Whitcomb's corps of rangers, the Council recommend that they be informed, that General Schuyler will immediately lay a ≈øtate of the ca≈øe before the Honourable Continental Congre≈øs, and take their direction; that if Congre≈øs ≈øhould not allow them the bounty given by the Ea≈øtern States, they will be di≈øcharged, agreeable to their contract.</p>

               <p>Major General Schuyler proceeds in his Defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Pre≈øident, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS Courts Martial may, with propriety, be con≈øidered not only as Courts of Ju≈øtice, but al≈øo as Courts of Honour, I am happy that my conduct is to be examined, and its merits a≈øcertained by this. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever con≈øolation con≈øcious rectitude may afford me and others, who have rea≈øon to complain of calumny and detraction, I am ≈øtill too ≈øen≈øible of the value of reputation to my≈øelf and family, not to wi≈øh for the e≈øteem of tho≈øe who merit commendation, and, particularly, to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the good opinion of tho≈øe great and good men, to who≈øe virtuous exertions, in the Council and the Field, America will be indebted for Liberty, Independence and Security.</p>
               <p>The charge again≈øt me is ≈øimple, and confined to one point, and the evidence adduced to ≈øupport it is comprized in very little compa≈øs. I wi≈øh the nature of my defence would admit of equal conci≈øene≈øs. But, gentlemen, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to remind you, that, to invalidate a charge of neglect, in≈øtances of attention and care mu≈øt be produced, and, of con≈øequence, that may defence will principally con≈øi≈øt of a detail of facts, and nece≈ø≈øarily be prolix. Permit me therefore to entreat your patience, and to a≈ø≈øure you that I will ≈øtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly avoid calling your attention to any matters, either of evidence or argument, but ≈øuch as ≈øhall appear to me e≈ø≈øential to the elucidation of the important que≈øtion you are now to determine.</p>
               <p>On the 19th day of June, 1775, Congre≈øs did me the honour of appointing me a Major General in the American army, and ≈øoon after to the command of the Northern Department, in which I was ≈øuper≈øeded in the month of February or beginning of March, 1777, and re≈øtored to it on the 22d day of May following, and again ≈øuper≈øeded in it on the 20th day of Augu≈øt, in the ≈øame year. Within the la≈øt mentioned period Major General St. Clair was, by Congre≈øs, appointed to take charge of the ≈øorts at Ticonderoga. Tho≈øe ≈øorts were inve≈øted on or about the fir≈øt day of July, and evacuated on the ≈øixth day of July, 1777. During the whole time of the ≈øiege, I am charged with having been ab≈øent, and therein of having neglected my duty. To this charge I am now to an≈øwer. But as the readine≈øs or reluctance, of per≈øons accu≈øed, to come to trial, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally creates pre≈øumptions for or again≈øt them, which become, with great propriety, part of the evidence on which their acquittal or condemnation will re≈øt, I beg leave previou≈øly to lay before you certain facts and papers, from which not only my willingne≈øs, but ≈øolicitude, for a trial will evidently appear.</p>
               <p>As the lo≈øs of Ticonderoga was ≈øen≈øibly felt by all America, and had occa≈øioned much re≈øentment as well as ≈øurprize, I pre≈øumed that this enquiry would have been made as ≈øoon as the nece≈ø≈øary information and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be obtained, and therefore the re≈øpect due to Congre≈øs re≈øtrained me from pre≈ø≈øing it until near two months after the date of their order had elap≈øed. After this I took the liberty of writing to Congre≈øs ≈øundry letters on the ≈øubject, of which the following are extracts. The receipts of all which, except that of the 4th of November and 26th of January, were either acknowledged by the Honourable Pre≈øident of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, or by re≈øolutions founded on the ≈øubject matter of the letters, from whence the extracts, were drawn.</p>

The conviction of a good and a clear con≈øcience leaves not a doubt in my mind, that the re≈øult of the enquiry into my conduct will have that effect, and re≈øtore me to the full confidence of ≈øuch of my hone≈øt countrymen as have been led away by popular clamour, and that I ≈øhall ≈øtand confe≈ø≈øed the ≈øincere and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate friend of my country. Congre≈øs will therefore pardon me, if I am importunate on this ≈øubject. I have ≈øuffered ≈øo much in public life, that it cannot create ≈øurprize if I anxiou≈øly wi≈øh to retire, and pay that attention to my private affairs, which the lo≈ø≈øes I have ≈øu≈øtained by the enemy, and the derangement occa≈øioned by devoting all my time to the duties of my offices, have occa≈øioned; and yet the impropriety of re≈øigning them, before the enquiry has taken place, or the Committee reported my innocence, is too ≈øtriking to need dwelling upon.</p>

                     <p>THE propriety of his Excellency General Wa≈øhington's intimation, that charges ought to be ≈øtated, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me in a ≈øtriking light.

I do not, however, wi≈øh to have it under≈øtood that the delay was intentional. Indeed, I ≈øtill retain the ≈øame opinion, which I have expre≈ø≈øed in one of the letters I have quoted, that I was confident it was not the intention of Congre≈øs, or of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to let me remain in the di≈øgraceable ≈øituation I was in longer than ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity required; but I impute that delay to the va≈øt variety of important objects, which claimed the attention of the Repre≈øentative Body of the United States towards the clo≈øe of la≈øt campaign, during the winter, and ≈øub≈øequent ≈øpring, and which might ju≈øtify them in ≈øacrificing the feelings of an individual to the more weighty concerns of the United States.</p>

                     <p>IT is with the utmo≈øt ≈øatisfaction, that the Congre≈øs received your information of the ≈øurrender of Montreal, and the general ≈øucce≈øs which has attended the American arms in the province of Canada.</p>
                     <p>They are ≈øen≈øible of the various ob≈øtacles you had to encounter, and have unanimou≈øly re≈øolved, that your conduct, attention and per≈øeverance, merit the thanks of the United Colonies, which I have now the plea≈øure of pre≈øenting to you.</p>
                     <p>The Congre≈øs hear, with concern, your reque≈øt of leave to retire. They regret the injuries your health has ≈øu≈øtained in the ≈øervice, and beg you will not in≈øi≈øt on a mea≈øure, which would, at once, deprive America of the future benefits ≈øhe expects from your zeal and abilities, and rob you of the honour of compleating the glorious work you have ≈øo happily and ≈øucce≈øsfully begun.</p>
                     <p>You have hitherto ri≈øen ≈øuperior to a thou≈øand difficulties, in giving freedom to a great and oppre≈ø≈øed people. You have already reaped many laurels, but a plentiful harve≈øt ≈øtill invites you. Proceed therefore, and let the foot≈øteps of victory open a way for ble≈ø≈øings of liberty, and the happine≈øs of well ordered govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to vi≈øit that exten≈øive dominion.</p>
                     <p>Con≈øider! that the road to glory is ≈øeldom ≈øtrewed with flowers, and that, when the black and bloody ≈øtandard of tyranny is erected in a land po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by freemen, patriots cea≈øe to remain inactive ≈øpectators of their country's fate.</p>
                     <p>Reflect, Sir, that the happine≈øs or mi≈øery of millions yet unborn is now to be determined, and remember that you will receive an honourable compen≈øation for all your fatigues, in being able to leave the memory of illu≈øtrious actions, attended by the gratitude of a great and free people, as a fair, a ≈øplendid, and a valuable inheritance to your po≈øterity.

               <p>But as the winter previous to the ≈øiege of Ticonderoga, included in this period, was the ≈øea≈øon of preparing for the en≈øuing campaign, and as the commencement of that campaign proved unfortunate, and many have from thence inferred that due preparations were not made for it, I think it of importance that my conduct relative to it ≈øhould be made known to you.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper to remark, that the campaign, on our part, was to be merely defen≈øive.

                     <p>AGREEABLE to your reque≈øt, I do my≈øelf the honour to communicate to you my opinion of what preparations I conceive nece≈ø≈øary to be made the en≈øuing winter, and what mea≈øures to be adopted, effectually to prevent the enemy from penetrating into this country by the Northern or We≈øtern communications. If the enemy are not able to di≈ølodge our troops from Ticonderoga, or penetrate to the Mohawk River this fall,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016142_0011_0F9B8E62ABFD5A40"/>
they will probably attempt an expedition in the winter, Canada being able to furni≈øh them with ≈øuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ≈øleds as will ≈øuffice to tran≈øport all their artillery and provi≈øion, if their number ≈øhould be 10,000; nor will our garri≈øons of Ticonderoga or Fort George be any ob≈øtacles, as they can ea≈øily pa≈øs by the former in ≈øleds, at ≈øuch a di≈øtance as to be out of the reach of our cannon, and the latter is too in≈øignificant to make any re≈øi≈øtance, ≈øo as much to retard their progre≈øs. It is therefore of the la≈øt importance, that as much of the army as can be kept together ≈øhould be cantoned in the vicinity of this place, of which the enemy will be informed, and it will probably deter them from the attempt. But, ≈øhould they remain quiet in Canada until next ≈øpring, it is rea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe that they will then make the mo≈øt vigorous exertions to penetrate either by Ticonderoga, or, what is much more likely, by Fort Stanwix. Both communications, therefore, claim our attention.</p>
                     <p>The fortifications at Ticonderoga ≈øhould, in my opinion, be as much contracted as po≈ø≈øible, and a fort built on Mount Independence, to cover batteries near the Lake ≈øide, and the redoubt on the Ticonderoga ≈øide, ≈øo as that the pa≈øs may be defended with a few men. The navigation ≈øhould be effectually ≈øtopped by ≈øinking ca≈ø≈øoons at ≈ømall di≈øtances, and joined together by ≈øtring pieces, ≈øo as, at the ≈øame time, to ≈øerve for a bridge between the fortifications on the ea≈øt and we≈øt ≈øides. This work ≈øhould be executed in the winter. But as the≈øe fortifications would not prevent the enemy from drawing their ≈ømall craft over land, from beyond the Three Mile Point, into Lake George, the pa≈ø≈øage of that lake ≈øhould al≈øo be ob≈øtructed, either by ca≈ø≈øoons from i≈øland to i≈øland in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries.</p>
                     <p>Whil≈øt a part of the army is employed in this ≈øervice, another body of troops ≈øhould be ≈øent to Fort Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wix, to ≈øtrengthen that fortification, and to make ≈øome others, at ≈øuch places near the Mohawk river as may be deemed be≈øt for the purpo≈øe of retarding the enemy, ≈øhould they make them≈øelves ma≈øters of Fort Stanwix. And that we may be well prepared, and every department put in order, I conceive it nece≈ø≈øary that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of artillery ≈øhould be directed to procure every nece≈ø≈øary in his department, that we may not have to ≈øeek it when the campaign opens.</p>
                     <p>That the chief Engineer be directed to do the like.</p>
                     <p>That the Quarter Ma≈øter General do the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>That the like order be given to the Commi≈ø≈øary General.</p>
                     <p>That all the battraus now on Lake Champlain and Lake George ≈øhould be put into the be≈øt repair as early as po≈ø≈øible, in the months of February or March at farthe≈øt.</p>
                     <p>That one hundred batteaus be built in tho≈øe months at Schenectady.</p>
                     <p>That a quantity of boards and plank ≈øhould be collected at Fort George.</p>
                     <p>That a ≈øufficiency of pitch, oakum, and whatever may be nece≈ø≈øary for building and repairing ve≈ø≈øels, floating-batteries or batteaus, be collected, and carried to Fort George, Fort Ann, Skeen≈øborough and Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectady, in the cour≈øe of the winter.</p>
                     <p>That provi≈øion for 5000 men, for eight months, be immediately brought to Albany, and carried in the winter to Fort Ann; a like quantity to remain in ≈øtore at Albany, to be ≈øent to the we≈øtward, if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion. This is a matter that ought immediately to be attended to, and therefore a ≈øufficient quantity of ≈øalt ≈øhould directly be ≈øent to Albany.</p>
                     <p>That a large train of artillery, both heavy and light, ≈øhould be ≈øent, in the cour≈øe of the winter; part to remain at Albany, and as much as may be nece≈ø≈øary for Ticonderoga and Fort George to be ≈øent there. This mu≈øt be done in winter, at once to ≈øave a va≈øt expence, and that we may not be embarra≈ø≈øed in the ≈øpring with the tran≈øportation of articles ≈øo extremely difficult to move.</p>
                     <p>That a Laboratory ≈øhould be e≈øtabli≈øhed at Albany, to fix all the ammunition nece≈ø≈øary for the campaign.</p>
                     <p>That fifteen companies, to con≈øi≈øt of a Captain, or Over≈øeer, and thirty men, be engaged for the batteau ≈øervice, and to be employed on the highways, and other nece≈ø≈øary works in the Quarter-Ma≈øter General's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. It not only ruins ≈øoldiers to employ them in ≈øuch bu≈øine≈øs, and is more expen≈øive, but al≈øo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the army too much.</p>
                     <p>That four companies of carpenters, to con≈øi≈øt of an Over≈øeer and 25 each, be engaged to attend the army. If more are occa≈øionally wanted, they can be procured in Albany or its vicinity. I have taken the liberty to enclo≈øe a li≈øt of ≈øome articles, that may be ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>The duty of the Pay-Ma≈øters ≈øhould be clearly pointed out to them. Who is to appoint Pay-Ma≈øters to tho≈øe regiments who yet have none?</p>
                     <p>What is to be done with the remainder of Living≈øton's, Hazen's and Duggen's Canadian corps, and with the Canadian refugees now in Albany?</p>
                     <p>Are Nichol≈øon's and Elmore's regiments to be compleated? If ≈øo, who is to grant warrants for recruiting them?</p>
                     <p>The bedding for the troops ≈øhould be ≈øent as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                     <p>Be ≈øo good as to ≈øend me a draft of Schuylkill ferry ≈øcows, with their dimen≈øions. I wi≈øh to have this as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                     <p>If ≈øilled woollen caps could be procured at Philadelphia, a quantity-≈øhould be ≈øent up to the army.</p>
                     <p>Gla≈øs for the barracks is much wanted.</p>
                     <p>Altho' the enemy's fleet on Lake Champlain is formidable, would it not be well to con≈øtruct very large and ≈øtrong ve≈ø≈øels this winter? If Congre≈øs ≈øhould re≈øolve on doing it, a very large number of carpenters ≈øhould be ≈øent up immediately, and guns and carriages provided.</p>

Fort George and Fort Ann in the cour≈øe of the winter.

                           <p>THE duties of your office, by much the mo≈øt difficult to fulfil of any in the army, are ≈øo many, and depend ≈øo much on circum≈øtances, which no one can po≈ø≈øibly fore≈øee, that only general rules can be laid down for your conduct in the execution of it. Great diligence, activity, prudence and fore≈øight, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpen≈øably nece≈ø≈øary, as you will ≈øoon experience. A clo≈øe attention to your duty is the only means of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfect knowledge of it. I ≈øhall, however, ≈øketch out a few directions.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øupplying the army with provi≈øions, when they are delivered to you by the Commi≈ø≈øary General, is a capital part of your bu≈øine≈øs; and as it mu≈øt be done partly by water, and partly by land, it demands a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye to keep a proper number of boats and carriages at each ≈øtation. The provi≈øion goes from hence in batteaus to Half-Moon, from whence it is conveyed in carriages to Stillwater. There it is again embarked in batteaus, and tran≈øported to the Saratoga Falls. Thence by land acro≈øs a ≈ømall portage. Thence by water to Fort Miller Falls. Then acro≈øs a ≈ømall carrying-place by land, and again by water to Fort Edward. Then by land to Fort George or Fort Ann. From the former by water to the north end of Lake George, and by land to the Saw Mills, whence it is conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. If it goes by the way of Fort Ann, it is there put in batteaus, and conveyed down Wood Creek to Skeen's Falls, and rolled acro≈øs a ≈ømall portage to the ≈øouth end of Lake Champlain, and conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. Between this and Half Moon eleven batteaus are now employed, carrying from 160 to 170 barrels. As the days are now ≈øhort, the batteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will not be able to make a trip a day, unle≈øs they are di≈øpatched by ≈øun-ri≈øe every morning. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incumbent on you to ≈øee that done, and that it may not be detained at Half Moon, 34 waggons, at lea≈øt, ≈øhould be daily employed between that and Stillwater. Seventeen batteaus are now employed in carrying it from Stillwater to Saratoga Falls. The≈øe mu≈øt make two trips in three days. Two waggons are employed at that place and four batteaus, to convey it to Fort Miller, each making three trips.</p>
                           <p>At Fort Miller two waggons are employed, and from thence twelve batteaus convey it to Fort Edward, where 70 waggons mu≈øt be con≈øtantly employed in tran≈øporting it either to Fort Ann or Fort George, from whence the troops are to carry it on, which you mu≈øt take care to ≈øee done. The lea≈øt reflection will point out, that if at any one ≈øtation the provi≈øion is detained, all above it are idle. To keep all going together is therefore indi≈øpen≈øably nece≈ø≈øary, and will frequently require your per≈øonal in≈øpection.</p>
                           <p>Providing quarters for the troops is another part of your duty, and furni≈øhing tho≈øe quarters with every nece≈ø≈øary mu≈øt be done without delay.‚Äî2500 men will remain at Ticonderoga,‚Äîabout 400 at Fort George,‚Äî 400 at Fort Edward,‚Äî1000 at Saratoga,‚Äî500 at Albany,‚Äî100 at Skeen≈øborough,‚Äî100 at Fort Ann,‚Äî500 at Schenectady,‚Äî200 at John's-Town,‚Äî100 at the German Flats,‚Äîand 400 at Fort Schuyler,‚Äîmaking in the whole 6200. For all the≈øe bedding, or ≈øtraw at lea≈øt, is to be furni≈øhed, fire-wood and barrack uten≈øils, ≈øuch as pails, tongs, ≈øhovels, trammels, axe, and kettles. The≈øe are to be delivered to the Barrack-Ma≈øter, who is to be accountable for them.</p>
                           <p>When troops march, all carriages are to be furni≈øhed by you. Indeed, you are to furni≈øh carriages and ve≈ø≈øels for whatever belongs to the army, except the carriages for conveying the cannon, although you mu≈øt find the cattle to draw them.</p>
                           <p>A ≈øtock of fire-wood mu≈øt be immediately laid in here, for the u≈øe of the troops, and the barracks put into the be≈øt repair. Directions are given by me for erecting the barracks at the other places.</p>

                           <p>Provi≈øions are forwarding to you in very con≈øiderable quantities, and I have ordered ≈øuch a ≈øtock to be laid in before the navigation ≈øtops, as will maintain your garri≈øon for three months, and long before that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended a fre≈øh ≈øupply will be ≈øent on.

Three thou≈øand felling-axes mu≈øt al≈øo be procured, and care taken that none are received but ≈øuch as are really good. Al≈øo two hundred ≈øtone hammers, two hundred ma≈øons trowels, fifty crow bars. Be≈øides the bar iron I have ordered, ten tons more mu≈øt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and three tons of nails ≈øorted.</p>
                           <p>The batteaus in Lake George and Lake Champlain, and tho≈øe employed in Hud≈øon's and the Mohawk river, mu≈øt al≈øo be repaired in the month of February, or March at farthe≈øt. Fifty batteaus mu≈øt be built here, as many at Schenectady, and a like number at Saratoga, to be carried into Lake George. Timber, plank, boards, nails, pitch, oakum and cordage, mu≈øt be provided in time, and ≈øuch a number of oars, ≈øetting-poles, paddles and ≈øcoops, as you ≈øhall find, upon enquiry, are wanted.</p>
                           <p>Timber mu≈øt be drawn this winter to the mills at Ticonderoga, Skeen≈øborough, and that near Che≈øhire's, in ≈øufficient quantities, at the two latter places, to keep the mills at work all next ≈øea≈øon. Not a moment's time mu≈øt be lo≈øt in procuring this timber.</p>
                           <p>All the boards that can be procured at any of the mills in the vicinity of Fort Edward mu≈øt be ≈øent to Fort George or Che≈øhire's. Tho≈øe from Wyng's or Park's mill to the former. All the others to the latter.</p>
                           <p>I wi≈øh you continually to reflect on the difficulties attending a long land tran≈øportation, e≈øpecially in the ≈øpring of the year, when the roads are almo≈øt impa≈ø≈øable, working cattle weak, and forage extremely ≈øcarce. Whatever therefore can be tran≈øported whil≈øt the earth is covered with ≈ønow, mu≈øt not by any means be neglected. All the provi≈øions which the Commi≈ø≈øary can furni≈øh mu≈øt be ≈øent on in the cour≈øe of the winter to Fort George and Che≈øhire's, except what may be wanted for the garri≈øon of Ticonderoga, which you are to take care to <hi>have well</hi> ≈øupplied.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered ≈øleds to be con≈øtructed at Saratoga, for tran≈øporting what cannon may be procured this winter. You will immediately ≈øend two black≈ømiths, with bellows and every other nece≈ø≈øary, to that place, to do the iron-work, and ≈øuch other as may be wanted.</p>
                           <p>The carriages for the carrying-place between Lake George and the ≈øaw-mills mu≈øt be put into the be≈øt order for tran≈øporting the provi≈øions and batteaus in the ≈øpring, and ≈øixty of the be≈øt working cattle, in high working order, mu≈øt be got ready, ≈øo as to be at Lake George about the time that Lake George becomes pa≈ø≈øable in batteaus. Hay for five weeks mu≈øt be provided, and lodged at the north end of Lake George, and ≈øome at the ≈øouth end, with a ≈øufficient quantity of corn to keep them in good order.</p>
                           <p>Steel mu≈øt be immediately ≈øent to Ticonderoga, to repair the broken axes, al≈øo ten ≈øetts of hor≈øe harne≈øs compleat. Iron pots, bra≈øs kettles, or ≈øheet-iron kettles, mu≈øt be provided in number ≈øufficient for an army of ten thou≈øand men. About two thou≈øand five hundred may do.</p>
                           <p>Thirty ≈øett of drag ropes, and twenty ≈øett of mens harne≈øs, with two good gins, with blocks and falls, mu≈øt be immediately got.</p>
                           <p>Purcha≈øe five hundred dre≈ø≈øed ≈øheep-≈økins, the wool on.</p>
                           <p>All the artillery ≈øtores, of what kind ≈øoever, that can be procured, mu≈øt be ≈øent up this winter; ≈øo mu≈øt the ≈øeveral articles above mentioned.</p>
                           <p>The grape ≈øhot that is in town mu≈øt be put into boxes without delay.</p>
                           <p>A number of grind≈øtones mu≈øt be procured and ≈øent up.</p>
                           <p>All intrenching tools, and other articles, that can be put in boxes, ≈øhould be ≈øo, marked and numbered.</p>
                           <p>Fifty log chains, and as many draught chains, will be wanted.</p>
                           <p>Six ≈øaws for Engli≈øh Mills, and four dozen for Dutch Mills. The latter may po≈ø≈øibly be procured at E≈øopus, Catts-Kill or Kinderhook.</p>
                           <p>I fore≈øee that the barracks and ho≈øpital will very ≈øoon be de≈øtitute of fire-wood. You will therefore take timely care to procure a ≈øupply, not only for daily u≈øe, but for the ≈øpring, as then it is not to be had, unle≈øs at an immoderate price, and with great difficulty. <hi>I am, &amp;c.</hi>

                           </opener>
                           <p>AS I have not been honoured with a line from Congre≈øs, on the ≈øubject of the preparations nece≈ø≈øary for the next campaign in the Northern Quarter, altho' I tran≈ømitted my opinion on the ≈øubject in the beginning of November, I conclude that the enemy's manoeuvres in Jer≈øey have ≈øo entirely engro≈ø≈øed their attention, that they have not been able to attend to what I ≈øugge≈øted. I have therefore re≈øolved, without waiting any longer for their directions, as the winter is ≈ølipping away, to carry into execution whatever I deem e≈ø≈øential to the ≈øervice, and which does not admit of further delay, of which, among≈øt other things, that of procuring a ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of cannon for the defence of Ticonderega, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a capital article. I ≈øhould therefore be glad to know what cannon you can furni≈øh me with, and where I may ≈øend for them, as I wi≈øh that an article, ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to move in the ≈øpring of the year, ≈øhould be carried to the places for which they are de≈øigned whil≈øt we are favoured with good ≈øledding. A very con≈øiderable quantity of ≈øhot is al≈øo wanted; and as Mr. Living≈øton's furnace is out of bla≈øt, I cannot procure them there. Can the≈øe be got at Sali≈øbury, and when? Be≈øides the cannon for the forts, a number will be wanted for five or ≈øix ≈øtout gallies which I propo≈øe to build in Lake George, to prevent the enemy's penetrating by that Lake, if they ≈øhould be able to di≈ølodge us from the Ticonderoga ≈øide of Lake Champlain, and draw their boats by land into Lake George, which it would be po≈ø≈øible for them to do, altho' we keep po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Mount Independence. By the way of Skeen≈øborough, I am morally ≈øure they will not be able to penetrate; as I hope, in the cour≈øe of the winter, ≈øo effectually to ob≈øtruct the Lake, between Ticonderoga and the Mount, as that no kind of ve≈ø≈øels will be able to pa≈øs, unle≈øs they fir≈øt make them≈øelves ma≈øters of Mount Independence, which I think will be impo≈ø≈øible, if we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men, cannon and ammunition. A ≈øtock of provi≈øion I ≈øhall take care to lay in this winter.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Simmonds, with part of his regiment, from the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay, is on his way from hence to Ticonderoga. I ≈øhall be extremely happy to ≈øee a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of troops coming on, for I very much fear that the garri≈øon will not be detained after the term of their enli≈øtment expires.</p>
                           <p>I ≈øhall want two companies of carpenters, to con≈øtruct the ve≈ø≈øels intended for Lake George. Captain Le≈øter and Captain Win≈ølow gave good ≈øatisfaction la≈øt campaign, and I wi≈øh them to be employed in that bu≈øine≈øs. Permit me to beg the favour of you to enquire of them, if they will each rai≈øe a company, ≈øo as to leave Connecticut about the fir≈øt day of April. As Fort George is an extremely healthy place, they will, in all probability, not ≈øuffer ≈øo much by ≈øickne≈øs as they did at Skeen≈øborough.</p>
                           <p>I have the plea≈øure to inform you that I have received friendly me≈ø≈øages from the Indians, who ≈øeem deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ob≈øerve a ≈øtrict neutrality.</p>

                           <p>SHOULD the enemy leave us unmole≈øted this winter, I ≈øhall hope that they will not be able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate from the northward in ≈øpring or ≈øummer, provided troops, cannon and ammunition, are furni≈øhed me.</p>
                           <p>By a letter from the Honourable General Ward, of the 16th in≈øtant, which I al≈øo received la≈øt night, I find that I am to expect no cannon from your State. There are none in this, nor can I procure any from Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania or Jer≈øey. I am not yet advi≈øed what Connecticut can afford me, but I am confident it will be greatly ≈øhort of our wants. I therefore wi≈øh the Legi≈ølature of your State would recon≈øider the matter, and ≈øupply me with all the cannon you po≈ø≈øibly can. I mu≈øt al≈øo entreat that as much powder, lead and cartridge paper may be ≈øent, as can be collected in your State; and as the≈øe articles are much ea≈øier and cheaper moved in winter than they can be at any other time, I ≈øhall hope that they will be forwarded without delay.</p>
                           <p>The cannon, if any are furni≈øhed, might be carried directly to Ticonderoga, where the A≈ø≈øi≈øtant Deputy Quarter-Ma≈øter General will pay the expence of tran≈øportation. The powder, lead and cartridge paper to this place.</p>

                              <p>I have been di≈øappointed in procuring two tons of ≈øteel from New-Jer≈øey, and it is an article ≈øo e≈ø≈øentially nece≈ø≈øary that it cannot be di≈øpen≈øed with. Pray be ≈øo good as to ≈øend me that quantity, or rather three tons, if it is to be had.</p>

                           <p>THAT I have not been honoured with the commands of Congre≈øs, on the various matters mentioned in my former letters, and in a paper which I delivered Me≈ø≈ørs. Stockton and Clymer on the 11th ult. is mo≈øt probably to be imputed to the nece≈ø≈øity it has been under, of giving the clo≈øe≈øt attention to the manoeuvres of the enemy in Jer≈øey. This con≈øideration, and that of the winter's being con≈øiderably advanced, has induced me to proceed in making ≈øuch preparations for the next campaign as I deem e≈ø≈øentially nece≈ø≈øary, without waiting the determination of Congre≈øs, tru≈øting that Congre≈øs will readily pardon any <hi>≈øaux pas</hi> I may commit from erring in judgment.</p>
                           <p>On the 3d in≈øtant I addre≈ø≈øed my≈øelf to General Ward, on the ≈øubject of cannon and military ≈øtores. From the copy of his letter, which is inclo≈øed, Congre≈øs will perceive that I am not likely to receive any aid from the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay. I have, however, ≈øince the receipt of his letter, which was received on the 29th in≈øt. written by expre≈øs to the Honourable Thomas Cu≈øhing, entreating that the Legi≈ølature of that State would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øider the matter, and furni≈øh what cannon, &amp;c. they can, and urged the nece≈ø≈øity of their being ≈øent whil≈øt the earth is covered with ≈ønow, as a great expence in the tran≈øportation will be ≈øaved by the≈øe articles being carried to Ticonderoga in winter. I have made ≈øimilar applications to Governor Trumbull, and the Pre≈øident of New-Hamp≈øhire, and I propo≈øe in a few days to vi≈øit the Convention of this State on the ≈øame ≈øubject; for indeed, unle≈øs a ≈øufficient number of cannon and ammunition can be procured, we mu≈øt inevitably lo≈øe Ticonderoga, and what the con≈øequences of ≈øuch a di≈øa≈øter will be are too evident to dwell upon.</p>
                           <p>I have cau≈øed ten black≈ømiths ≈øhops to be erected in this city, and have engaged workmen to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making intrenching tools, axes, nails, &amp;c. and hope, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the ≈ømiths in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to get a ≈øufficient ≈øtock of tho≈øe nece≈ø≈øary articles, provided I can any how procure a quantity of ≈øteel, for which I have applied to the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay; but left none ≈øhould be ≈øent from thence, I mu≈øt again entreat Congre≈øs to order three tons from Penn≈øylvania or Jer≈øey, with all the di≈øpatch po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered all the provi≈øions that can be procured to be ≈øent to Fort George, Che≈øhire's and Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga. I fear a deficiency of ≈øalted meat, of which a ≈øufficient ≈øtock ≈øhould be laid in, as it would be ri≈øk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much to depend on the precarious ≈øupply of fre≈øh beef, at a time when the fortre≈ø≈øes may be inve≈øted by the enemy.</p>
                           <p>Forage is laying in for the cattle, which it will be nece≈ø≈øary to employ in the ≈øpring, both at Ticonderoga and on the communication to it.</p>
                           <p>Directions are given for repairing the batteaus on Lake Champlain and Lake George, and for building one hundred and fifty, adapted to the navigation of Hud≈øon's and the Mohawk rivers and Wood creek. Should the enemy be able to force us from Ticonderoga, it will be po≈ø≈øible for them, although we keep po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Mount Independence, to get into Lake George, by drawing their batteaus over land from below Ticonderoga; for although the ta≈øk would be arduous, yet it is fea≈øable, and ought to be guarded again≈øt. I therefore propo≈øe to build five or ≈øix flat bottomed ve≈ø≈øels, of con≈øiderable force, on Lake George, and ≈øhall begin to prepare the nece≈ø≈øary articles in the beginning of February, unle≈øs Congre≈øs ≈øhould plea≈øe to direct other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe; and about the ≈øame time I propo≈øe to begin the nece≈ø≈øary work of ob≈øtructing the navigation of Lake Champlain, between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, which I hope to execute ≈øo effectually, as not to leave a po≈ø≈øibility for any kind of craft to pa≈øs whil≈øt we keep po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the latter place, and which <hi>I think we can do again≈øt any force whatever, provided we have a ≈øufficient garri≈øon, properly ≈øupplied with cannon, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and provi≈øion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A con≈øiderable quantity of cordage and oakum is wanted. If it cannot be ≈øupplied in this State, I ≈øhall ≈øend to Ea≈øtern ones, and ≈øo indeed I mu≈øt for many articles that will be wanted. I wi≈øh therefore a re≈øolution of Congre≈øs, directing every State to comply with my applications in whatever they can.</p>
                           <p>The Indians have ≈øent me a friendly me≈ø≈øage, and I have great hopes that they will abide by the neutrality they have promi≈øed to ob≈øerve. A report prevails that the enemy have reque≈øted the Mohawks to remove into the country, beyond our ≈øettlements, but I have rea≈øon to believe that it is void of foundation. I ≈øoon expect a vi≈øit from a con≈øiderable number of Chiefs and Warriors. They are in great di≈øtre≈øs for blankets. Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately we have none here. I have applied for ≈øome to the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay and New-Hamp≈øhire, and may probably receive ≈øome from thence.</p>
                           <p>The Legi≈ølature of the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay have ordered one-fourth of the militia of the country of Berk≈øhire, and one-eighth of that of Hamp≈øhire, to Ticonderoga, to continue three months in ≈øervice. Part of one regiment is marched from the former. What the whole number will be, from both, I cannot make a gue≈øs at. No troops are yet arrived here from Connecticut, nor can I learn that any are got to Ticonderoga from Hamp≈øhire, neither was any part of Colonel Warner's regiment there on the 26th; and Colonel Wayne advi≈øes me that he has no hopes of any troops remaining after the term of their enli≈øtment expires, unle≈øs it be the Penn≈øylvanians, who, he believes, will not quit the po≈øt until regularly relieved. For three weeks, or perhaps a month to come, we have little to fear from an enemy, but as after that Lake Champlain will be pa≈ø≈øable, it is probable they will make an attempt, as I am well informed that they have two regiments at St. John's, three at I≈øle-aux-Noix, and a ≈ømall body, as an advanced po≈øt, at I≈øle-la-Motte; and I conjecture that they would hardly keep ≈øo many troops at tho≈øe places, if they did not meditate a winter expedition. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of importance that the garri≈øon ≈øhould be ≈øtrengthened, and have therefore repeated my former applications for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to the Ea≈øtern States Tho≈øe of Van Schaick's and Gan≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The non-commi≈ø≈øioned officers and privates of Colonel Nichol≈øon's regiment are all engaged in other corps, to ≈øerve during the war, or for three years, and the officers mentioned in the inclo≈øed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <p>Mo≈øt of the men in Colonel Elmore's regiment would re-engage for the war, ≈øome have already done it; but I have inhibited the recruiting officers of other corps to enli≈øt any more of the men, as they are ≈øtill to

                           <p>I wi≈øh to know the plea≈øure of Congre≈øs on the ≈øubject the ≈øoone≈øt po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                           <p>We are greatly at a lo≈øs for iron rods, to make nails out of. If I knew where to procure them, I ≈øhould not trouble Congre≈øs.</p>
                           <p>If any cannon are to come from Penn≈øylvania, as I believe there mu≈øt, for I have very little pro≈øpect of getting a ≈øupply el≈øewhere, I wi≈øh them to be ≈øent whil≈øt the ≈ønow continues on the ground.</p>
                           <p>The Pay Ma≈øter General informs me that he has very little ca≈øh left. A ≈øpeedy ≈øupply will be nece≈ø≈øary, as ≈øuch a variety of articles are to be purcha≈øed, and ≈øo much tran≈øportation to be paid for.</p>
                           <p>The Regimental Pay Ma≈øters will ≈øtand in need of very explicit in≈øtructions for the rule of their conduct. I take the liberty again to mention the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øending them very ≈øoon, le≈øt the accounts of the new army ≈øhould get involved into that variety of confu≈øion which has attended the old. If they do not arrive ≈øoon, I ≈øhall take the liberty to do it for tho≈øe in this department.</p>
                           <p>Much as I wi≈øh to do my≈øelf the honour to pay my re≈øpects to Congre≈øs, yet ≈øo much is to be done here, and no other general officer in the department, that it would not be prudent for me to quit it at this conjuncture.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Pallefier was ≈øo bent on going to Congre≈øs, and importuned me ≈øo much on the occa≈øion, that I con≈øented, on his promi≈øe to return before the expiration of January. I hope he will not be permitted to tarry beyond that time.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered the director of the ho≈øpital to lay in a ≈øufficient quantity of medicine and nece≈ø≈øary ≈øtores for the ho≈øpital. He will find it extremely difficult to procure them; I therefore wi≈øh, if po≈ø≈øible, that ≈øome may be ≈øent from Philadelphia.</p>

                           <p>I AM under the nece≈ø≈øity of detaining at Albany the continental troops rai≈øed in this State, for want of cloathing and blankets, although they are ≈øo greatly wanted at Ticonderoga. Your father informed me that you are employed by Congre≈øs, together with another gentleman, who≈øe name had ≈ølipped his memory, to purcha≈øe cloathing, &amp;c. and advi≈øed me to di≈øpatch an expre≈øs to you, reque≈øting an immediate ≈øupply. You and your colleague will therefore plea≈øe to forward to Albany 1500 ≈øuits of cloathing, and, if po≈ø≈øible, double that number of blankets, as a very con≈øiderable quantity of the latter are wanted for our Indian allies. Should any Indian goods come to your hands, or you be able to purcha≈øe them, you will al≈øo plea≈øe to ≈øend to Albany 5000 l. worth.</p>
                           <p>The difficulties we labour under for want of all the≈øe articles is inconceivable, and greatly injures the ≈øervice. You will therefore plea≈øe to make u≈øe of your be≈øt exertions to expedite a ≈øupply.</p>

                           <p>I AM honoured with your di≈øpatches of the 30th ult. which were delivered me ye≈øterday, on my arrival at this place. Congre≈øs will plea≈øe to re≈øt a≈ø≈øured, that my be≈øt endeavours ≈øhall be exerted to carry into execution their intentions, conveyed in the ≈øeveral re≈øolutions tran≈ømitted me, part of which I have already anticipated, as you will ob≈øerve in a letter which I had the honour to addre≈øs you on the la≈øt ult. or fir≈øt of this month, and forwarded by Captain Bloomfield.</p>
                           <p>It is with great pain that I ≈øee no pro≈øpect of procuring the nece≈ø≈øary artillery for the defence of Ticonderoga, and for arming the ve≈ø≈øels to be con≈øtructed on Lake George. By the inclo≈øed copy of a letter from Governor Trumbull, you will perceive that I cannot flatter my≈øelf with the hopes of receiving all the cannon Congre≈øs has ordered in the re≈øolution of the 28th ult. but, ≈øhould they even be ≈øent, we ≈øhall ≈øtill want a very con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number in addition; nor ≈øhould we be de≈øtitute of a competent number of field pieces, left the enemy ≈øhould change their route, and attempt an inva≈øion by the way of O≈øwego.</p>
                           <p>Apprehen≈øive that applications to the different States, for the many articles which are wanted, would be attended with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>o much delay, I ≈øome days ≈øince di≈øpatched Mr. M'Carty to the Ea≈øtern States, to procure a number of articles which I enumerated, and among≈øt which were cordage and oakum. He gave me great hopes that he ≈øhould be able ≈øpeedily to accompli≈øh his commi≈ø≈øion. Colonel Baldwin and Major Stevens, who left me early in December, had orders to procure whatever they could in their re≈øpective departments.</p>
                           <p>The re≈øolution, inve≈øting General Wa≈øhington with ≈øuch ample powers, will certainly be attended with very ≈øalutary effects to our common cau≈øe, and ≈øeemed indi≈øpen≈øibly nece≈ø≈øary at this critical conjuncture. It will therefore doubtle≈øs meet with the approbation of every good American.</p>
                           <p>The Continental money is ≈øinking with an alarming rapidity in this State; but as I doubt not but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof will enter ≈øpiritedly into mea≈øures conducive to prevent ≈øo alarming an evil, I hope ≈øoon to find its credit re-e≈øtabli≈øhed.</p>
                           <p>As it is of great importance to be well informed of the enemy's intentions, I have made ≈øeparate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to two per≈øons in Canada, in who≈øe friendly ≈øentiments to the cau≈øe of America I have the fulle≈øt confidence, and have promi≈øed them a generous recompence, to furni≈øh me from time to time with the be≈øt intelligence. I have al≈øo directed Colonel Bedel, who≈øe influence with the Caghnawaga and St. Francois In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians is very con≈øiderable, to attempt to gain information by their means. By receiving of it in three different channels, we ≈øhall be better enabled to judge of the truth or fallacy of what is given us by any of them.</p>

                           <p>The ≈øalt ≈øprings, mentioned in Mr. Kirkland's letter, No. 1, I conceive might be improved to advantage, if per≈øons acquainted with the proce≈øs of making ≈øalt were ≈øent up, and furni≈øhed with proper boilers. It is an article ≈øo extremely ≈øcarce here, that I fear a deficiency of ≈øalt provi≈øion for the army in this Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ≈øpecimen which Mr. Kirkland mentioned to have ≈øent me is not come to hand.</p>
                           <p>The information contained in No. 2 is alarming, but by a clo≈øe attention to it, and pur≈øuing proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, the intention of the enemy, I perceive, may be fru≈øtrated. I ≈øhall immediately ≈øend up what Mr. Kirkland recommends, as nece≈ø≈øary to rekindle the council fire at Onondago.</p>
                           <p>I have Indians, more or le≈øs, every day with me, complaining of the want of cloathing, blankets e≈øpecially, of which we have not one.

To tran≈øact bu≈øine≈øs with Indians at any time is a mo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable ta≈øk, to do it with empty hands greatly encrea≈øes the difficulty.</p>

                           <p>YOUR Excellency's favour of the 18th in≈øtant I had the honour to receive on the 28th. I cannot plead that bu≈øine≈øs, altho' I am clo≈øely employed, has been the only motive that I have not latterly done my≈øelf the plea≈øure to write you. I well know that every moment of your time mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily be engro≈ø≈øed in tho≈øe affairs, which, from your immediate ≈øituation, mu≈øt claim the earlie≈øt attention. I therefore contented my≈øelf with writing to Mr. Harri≈øon; but I fear either his or mine have mi≈øcarried, as I have not been favoured with an an≈øwer to mine of the 3d and 21≈øt ult. I hope your Excellency has received mine of the 15th and 25th, each inclo≈øing one to Congre≈øs.</p>
                           <p>Your ≈øucce≈øs in the Jer≈øeys has greatly in≈øpirited the people in this quarter, and the ≈øituation to which you have driven the enemy, affords us the plea≈øing hope that we ≈øhall ≈øoon hear you have reaped fre≈øh laurels.</p>
                           <p>I have not the lea≈øt doubt, ≈øhould General Carleton leave us unmole≈øted this winter, which I really do not believe he will, that he will pu≈øh very early in the ≈øpring, and he may come in the latter end of April. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, therefore, the army ought to be at Ticonderoga. <hi>I do not think it ≈øhould con≈øi≈øt of le≈øs than</hi>
10,000 <hi>men, be≈øides</hi> 1000 <hi>for the ≈øeveral pa≈øts on the communication, and as many for Fort Schuyler and the other po≈øts on the Mohawk river.</hi> With the≈øe I think we ≈øhall have nothing to fear, provided we are ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ≈øupplied with cannon, ammunition and provi≈øion.</p>

forty or fifty tons of tin is in the continental ≈øtores at Bo≈øton, together with a number of blankets, cloathing, &amp;c. but that the ≈øtore-keepers advi≈øed him that none could be i≈ø≈øued without the immediate order of Congre≈øs. I wi≈øh therefore to have ≈øuch order expedited.

                           <p>I have borrowed fifty thou≈øand dollars from this State, and con≈øiderable ≈øums from individuals, for the public ≈øervice, all of which is already expended, and ≈øtill every department is deeply indebted. I wi≈øh, therefore, that mea≈øures may be taken to ha≈øten a ≈øupply to the military che≈øt here.</p>

                           <p>As the garri≈øon of Ticonderoga is daily weakening, and that I have no pro≈øpect of a ≈øpeedy reinforcement, I ≈øhall not dare to ≈øend the cannon to that place, which are expected from Sali≈øbury with the fir≈øt ≈øledding, but order them to be left at Fort George and Che≈øhire's.</p>
                           <p>No ammunition of any kind is yet arrived here, nor do I know where to procure it. His Excellency General Wa≈øhington cannot furni≈øh me with any from Jer≈øey.

                           <p>THE bearers of this carry a belt from the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Indian Affairs, which is to go by them to the Caghnawagas of Canada. I have written to Colonel Elmore to furni≈øh you with-≈ønow ≈øhoes, provi≈øions and ≈øuch other articles as you may need, to equip the party for Canada.</p>
                           <p>I have al≈øo ordered Colonel Elmore to furni≈øh Mr. Spencer with one ration and a half of provi≈øions until his wife comes up, and thence forward with three. Plea≈øe to advi≈øe Mr. Spencer of this.</p>

If a treaty with the Six Nations is to be held, and when and where. At what place the Briti≈øh troops are quartered. Whether an attack by the way of the Mohawk river is intended. Whether great quantities of provi≈øions are ≈øent to Ot≈øwegatchie. If Quebec, or any other places in Canada, are fortifying. If any troops left Canada la≈øt fall, and how many, and at what time. Whether any forage is collecting at St. John's, or any batteaus building there or el≈øewhere. What price flour is now ≈øold at in Canada. You will al≈øo reque≈øt the Indians to try to prevail on ≈øome of the Caghnawagas to give intelligence of the movements of the enemy, and to a≈ø≈øure them that every important piece of intelligence which they convey to me will be rewarded.</p>

They then took a fort of ours, ≈øituate upon York I≈øland, where we could not come to its relief, becau≈øe their ≈øhips of war prevented us. As ≈øoon as they had taken this fort they marched into New-Jer≈øey, and as mo≈øt of General Wa≈øhington's army was gone home, the ≈øoldiers term of enli≈øtment being expired, he was obliged to retreat before them to Trenton; but, having collected ≈øome troops there, he fought them on the 26th of December, as is already related. On the 3d of January he pur≈øued them, and fought them at Princeton, twelve miles on this ≈øide of Trenton. There he killed near three hundred, and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two hundred pri≈øoners. He has ≈øince that taken ninety-five loaded waggons, and five empty ones, al≈øo eighty-four war hor≈øes, and upwards of two hundred pri≈øoners. The enemy are now at Brun≈øwick, and they cannot get away, except by flying to their ve≈ø≈øels, becau≈øe General Wa≈øhington and Mon≈øieur Fermoy, a General from Old France, and General Putnam, each with a body of troops, ≈øurround them.</p>
                           <p>That France has ≈øent us 200,000 l. worth of artillery and warlike ≈øtores. Many French officers and Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, among≈øt others, Mon≈øieur Laboniere, the Engineer who built Ticonderoga la≈øt war. Write upon a bit of paper <hi>Laboniere Engineer,</hi> and let them take it with them, as he is well known by the Caghnawagas.</p>
                           <p>Reque≈øt of Colonel Elmore as much powder and ball as the party may want.</p>

The forage which will be wanted ≈øhould be ≈øtored as I have directed. Carpenters mu≈øt, without delay, be ≈øent up to repair the batteaus on both Lakes and at Skeen≈øbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, together with pitch, oakum, and every nece≈ø≈øary for the purpo≈øe. The cordage for the ve≈ø≈øels to be built at Fort George ≈øhould al≈øo be there. In ≈øhort, every article in your department, that can be procured, ≈øhould be ≈øent up without the lea≈øt delay; for be≈øides the extra expence of tran≈øporting the≈øe articles in ≈øpring, when the roads are bad, you will, I fear, not be able to accompli≈øh it with all the wheel carriages you will then be able to procure, and the probable con≈øequences will be, that our army at Ticonderoga will be obliged to leave it, for want of the nece≈ø≈øary ≈øupplies. You are therefore bound, by every con≈øideration, to leave nothing undone a moment, which it is po≈ø≈øible for you to do, that we may not experience all the evils which would con≈øequently en≈øue from an evacuation of Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>Va≈øt quantities of boards and timber will, in all probability, be wanted, as well for the army in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as for that which may be ≈øtationed in the ≈øouthern parts of this State. Provi≈øion ≈øhould therefore be made to procure them. And as the proprietors of mills find it impo≈ø≈øible to procure workmen to cut and draw logs, ≈øuch of the fifteen companies of batteaumen and labourers now rai≈øing, and that can be fir≈øt got ready, ≈øhould be employed in cutting timber, and ≈øleds procured to draw it to the mills.</p>
                           <p>The roads between this and Fort Edward, and from thence to Fort George and Che≈øhire's, al≈øo claim your early and ≈øerious attention, and timber ≈øhould be drawn for cau≈øewaying where it is nece≈ø≈øary, and for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bridges where they may be wanted. To depend upon cro≈ø≈øing Hud≈øon's river at the two ferries, McNeal's and Jones's, with what ≈øcows are now there, is too precarious. At each place two good ≈øcows mu≈øt therefore be immediately con≈øtructed.</p>
                           <p>In ≈øhort, all that I have at any time ordered that you ≈øhould ≈øend up, purcha≈øe or cau≈øe to be made, ought to be done with the utmo≈øt di≈øpatch; for, if it is not, the bu≈øine≈øs that will croud upon you ≈øo va≈øtly when the campaign opens will involve you in inextricable difficulties.</p>
                           <p>A quantity of rum ≈øhould be purcha≈øed by you for the artificers employed in your department, that you may not labour under difficulties on that account.</p>
                           <p>I entreat you to pay the clo≈øe≈øt attention to every part of your department, that the public may reap the advantage of your exertions, and you the honour thereof.</p>

                           <p>THE Honourable Continental Congre≈øs, by a re≈øolution of the 28th December la≈øt, have ordered,
<q>That a fort be con≈øtructed on Mount Independence; that the navigation of the Lake, near that place, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed by ca≈ø≈øoons, to be ≈øunk in the water at ≈ømall di≈øtances from one another, and joined together by ≈øtring pieces, ≈øo as at the ≈øame time to ≈øerve for a bridge between the fortifications on the ea≈øt and we≈øt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016142_0023_0F9B8E6CD2F2BD10"/>
≈øides; that to prevent the enemy from drawing their ≈ømall craft over land beyond Three Mile Point into Lake George, the pa≈ø≈øage of that Lake be al≈øo ob≈øtructed in like manner by ca≈ø≈øoons, from i≈øland to i≈øland, in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries; that Fort Stanwix be ≈øtrengthened, and other fortifications be made, at proper places, near the Mohawk River; and that General Schuyler, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of the Northern Department, execute the≈øe works this winter, and that the commanding officer of artillery, Chief Engineer, Quarter Ma≈øter General and Commi≈ø≈øary General, provide and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatever things in their re≈øpective departments are nece≈ø≈øary, or may contribute to the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; that there be a general ho≈øpital erected at Mount Independence.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>In order, therefore, to fulfil the intentions of Congre≈øs, you are immediately to proceed to Lake George, to examine if it is practicable to ≈øunk ca≈ø≈øoons in the Narrows in the manner directed; and if you find it ≈øo, to report the ≈øame to me, and immediately to order one or more of your Sub-Engineers to execute the work. If it is not practicable, you will report to me, by letter, the rea≈øons why, together with the depth of the water, and the di≈øtance from ≈øhore to ≈øhore, and from i≈øland to i≈øland. The report to be accompanied with a ≈øketch of the i≈ølands.</p>
                           <p>You are then to proceed to Ticonderoga, and, as I conceive the ob≈øtructions of the Lake will be much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øier and cheaper executed while the Lake continues frozen than at any other time, you will fir≈øt execute that work. The ca≈ø≈øoons ≈øhould be ≈øo far above water, as that the bridge may not be under water when the Lake is at the highe≈øt, and to prevent batteaus from pa≈ø≈øing underneath, when the Lake is at the lowe≈øt, a boom ought to be laid on the water on each ≈øide of the bridge.</p>
                           <p>It will be nece≈ø≈øary, the ≈øoone≈øt you po≈ø≈øibly can, to prepare what timber and other materials may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the con≈øtruction of the fort on Mount Independence, and to furni≈øh me with an actual and accurate ≈øurvey of Mount Independence, and a plan of the fort you may judge ≈øhould be built on it.</p>
                           <p>You are al≈øo to lo≈øe no time in preparing and collecting the materials for a ho≈øpital, ≈øufficiently large to contain ≈øix hundred ≈øick, be≈øides the nece≈ø≈øary apartments for the Director, and the other officers of the ho≈øpital.</p>
                           <p>You will al≈øo immediately ≈øend an engineer to examine and report the ≈øtate of Fort Stanwix, and what works ought to be con≈øtructed there, and on his return to ≈øix on one or more proper places on this ≈øide Fort Stanwix, to erect fortifications, to prevent the enemy from coming down the river in batteaus, in ca≈øe they ≈øhould be able to po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of Fort Stanwix, or leave it in their rear.</p>
                           <p>Whatever carriages you may want for drawing timber for the works on Lake George, and at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, you are to apply to Colonel Lewis, Deputy Quarter-Ma≈øter General, for, who will have my orders to furni≈øh you therewith.</p>
                           <p>The armourers tools, that are now at Ticonderoga, you will immediately ≈øend to Colonel Lewis, to be delivered to ≈øuch per≈øon as you may direct to ≈øuperintend the armoury here, and leave orders for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourers to repair all the arms in this place, before they proceed to Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>Early provi≈øion is to be made, to have a ≈øufficiency of battery carriages for the cannon that may be ≈øent up, and for ≈øuch as may be wanted on board any ve≈ø≈øels to be con≈øtructed. In ≈øhort, you will u≈øe your be≈øt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to have every thing put in the be≈øt order, and what is to be executed done with the utmo≈øt expedition.</p>
                           <p>Carpenters always require clo≈øe attention, and to be pu≈øhed to their duty; you will therefore give ≈øtrict orders to all your officers to keep them clo≈øely to work.</p>
                           <p>You will probably be able to procure ≈øoldiers, who can work with the whip-≈øaw. You ≈øhould therefore procure as many as you po≈ø≈øibly can, and immediately on your arrival at Ticonderoga apply for all the ≈øawyers in any of the corps there, and ≈øet them to work. It will be be≈øt to agree by the foot, becau≈øe it will be cheape≈øt, and that you will get more work done.</p>
                           <p>A hou≈øe to boil ≈øoap and make candles in is much wanted at Mount Independence. You will therefore con≈øtruct one, and al≈øo a bake-hou≈øe, as ≈øoon as you can, and repair the provi≈øion ≈øtores, that the public may not ≈øu≈øtain ≈øo great a lo≈øs as formerly by damaged provi≈øions.</p>

                           <p>Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer, is directed to carry on very con≈øiderable works on Lake George and at Ticonderoga.

                           <p>NOT a ≈øingle armourer is yet arrived at this place; and as all our dependence was placed on tho≈øe you were to procure, I am greatly apprehen≈øive of the con≈øequence, if they ≈øhould not ≈øoon arrive. Pray inform me immediately of the names of the over≈øeers, and their places of abode, that I may di≈øpatch an expre≈øs for them. I hope the works you have in hand are in good forwardne≈øs. Much is to be done, and exertions required. Carpenters are very expen≈øive to the public, as their wages are high; you will therefore ≈øee that they are clo≈øely kept to their duty, and charged with every neglect. For which purpo≈øe you mu≈øt appoint an able clerk of the checque, who is to keep regular accounts of every per≈øon's name, and of every day they are employed.</p>

                           <p>AS the ice has now left Hud≈øon's river, you will forward the cannon, and whatever military ≈øtores are now here, as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible to Fort George, to be conveyed to Ticonderoga as ≈øoon as Lake George ≈øhall be navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable.

If the batteaus at that place are not already repaired, no time ≈øhould be lo≈øt in doing it. The ≈øchooner there ≈øhould al≈øo be overhauled, and put into repair, without delay.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øhip carpenters now moving up to Fort George will require a number of carriages, to draw in the timber for the ve≈ø≈øels they are to build. The≈øe carriages you will furni≈øh immediately, and ≈øend one of your a≈ø≈øi≈øtants to ≈øuperintend the works at that place. The ho≈øpital there will al≈øo require repairs, and ≈øhould be done immediately. Two black≈ømiths mu≈øt be kept at work there, and a quantity of iron ≈øent up. If the ≈øhip nails are not already forwarded, ≈øend them on without lo≈øs of time. A company of carpenters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt of an over≈øeer and twenty men, mu≈øt be engaged, and ≈øent without delay to Fort Stanwix. Captain Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øie, the Engineer, who is at Schenectady, will take charge of them.</p>
                           <p>Fort George will probably be navigable by the fir≈øt week in April. About that time therefore the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cattle, de≈øigned for Ticonderoga and the Carrying-place, ≈øhould be at Fort George, to be tran≈øported without delay.</p>
                           <p>All the working cattle for the communication between this and Fort George and Fort Ann ≈øhould al≈øo be there about the fir≈øt of April.</p>
                           <p>Nails, pitch or tar, and oakum for the batteaus building at Saratoga, mu≈øt be ≈øent on immediately.</p>
                           <p>Three ploughs, and as many harrows, with the nece≈ø≈øary apparel, mu≈øt be ≈øent to Ticonderoga, under the care of a tru≈øty per≈øon, who under≈øtands farming and gardening, in order to prepare the earth for rai≈øing turnips and other vegetables for the u≈øe of the army. You will give orders to ≈øupply them with working cattle and men, and direct your a≈ø≈øi≈øtants to procure a piece of land for the purpo≈øe. As ≈øoon as the ice has left Wood Creek, you are to cau≈øe it to be cleared from the old timber which ob≈øtructs its navigation.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øaw-mills at Wyng's and Che≈øhire's, Skeen≈øborough and Ticonderoga, mu≈øt be immediately ≈øet to work.</p>
                           <p>Thirty of the batteaus building at Saratoga mu≈øt be ≈øent to Wood Creek, to be employed between Fort Ann and Skeen≈øborough.</p>
                           <p>Do not forget the ferry ≈øcows I formerly ordered to be con≈øtructed, nor the repairs to the roads.</p>
                           <p>At Half-Moon, Stillwater, M'Larin's, Fort Miller, Fort Edward and Che≈øhire's, turning cranes ≈øhould be erected, to load and unload the batteaus with.

No ≈øitting down to ≈ømoak and drink at eleven o'clock, or at any other time, except that at meals. In very hot weather, two hours may be allowed at dinner.</p>

The Court will be plea≈øed to ob≈øerve, that in my ≈øeveral orders I de≈øcended to minutiae, in a manner not u≈øual for general officers, and which nothing but the mo≈øt ardent zeal for the ≈øervice could have prompted.</p>

               <p>On the fourth day of June, 1777, I again re≈øumed the command of the department, and I offer the following letters and orders as evidence of the manner in which I continued to provide for the exigencies of the en≈øuing campaign, and for the general defence of the whole department.</p>
               <p>I arrived at Albany on the third day of June, and the next day wrote the following letter to Major General Gates.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>YOU will plea≈øe to repair to Ticonderoga with all convenient ≈øpeed, and take the command of the troops at that place.</p>
                           <p>As the whole of our force in the Northern Department, if collected at Ticonderoga, would not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of properly meaning the exten≈øive works on both ≈øides of the Lake, and as Mount Independence is by much the mo≈øt defen≈øible, and may be made a po≈øt capable of ≈øu≈øtaining a long and vigorous ≈øiege, it is my intention that your fir≈øt care ≈øhould be to be≈øtow the utmo≈øt attention to fortifying the Mount. You will therefore plea≈øe, immediately on your arrival, to give directions for erecting the nece≈ø≈øary fortifications, and employ all the troops that can be ≈øpared from other duty and nece≈ø≈øary works in that bu≈øine≈øs. If the ob≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the French redoubt and Mount Independence is not compleated, that work will al≈øo claim your immediate attention, and I wi≈øh that ≈øtrong piles ≈øhould be drove in the intervals between every ca≈ø≈øoon, and others in the front of each ca≈ø≈øoon, and if po≈ø≈øible a line of pickets drove acro≈øs the channel, ≈øo far below Mount Independence, as that the cannon from thence may render it impo≈ø≈øible for the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels to lay there, or be employed in removing the ob≈øtructions. This ≈øeems to be work in the execution of which no time ≈øhould be lo≈øt, as it may, by preventing the enemy's ≈øhips from pa≈ø≈øing, enable us to keep up the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with our ve≈ø≈øels, if the Mount ≈øhould be inve≈øted.</p>
                           <p>I wi≈øh you to keep ≈øcouting parties con≈øtantly out on both ≈øides of the Lake. That on the we≈øt ≈øhould go as far as the road by which the Tories la≈øt fall marched to Crown-Point.</p>
                           <p>Be ≈øo good as to order returns to be made immediately by the Chief Engineer, Commanding Officer of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, Commi≈ø≈øary of Provi≈øions, and Clothier, of every article in their re≈øpective departments, and of what is wanting in each, that the deficiency may be procured without delay.</p>
                           <p>Inclo≈øe you a credit on the military che≈øt for Ten Thou≈øand Dollars, to pay any contingent expences that may ari≈øe, and not payable by any of the civil departments.</p>
                           <p>I am confident that no officer is more deeply impre≈ø≈øed with the nece≈ø≈øity of pre≈øerving the health of the men than you, and I doubt not but you will be≈øtow much of your attention on ≈øo capital a matter. Tents are arrived here, and orders are given to ≈øend up five hundred. If more are wanted, you will plea≈øe to ≈øignify it to me.</p>
                           <p>You will plea≈øe to ≈øend me a return of the troops at Ticonderoga, as ≈øoon after your arrival as you po≈ø≈øibly can.</p>
                           <p>You will lay in a magazine of fire wood on Mount Independence, to be pre≈øerved in ca≈øe of a ≈øiege, and to be as ≈øparing of the ≈øalt meat as you po≈ø≈øibly can, con≈øi≈øtent with the health of the men.</p>
                           <p>As an arrangement of the troops into brigades cannot ≈øo properly be made here as at Ticonderoga, and it being probable that I ≈øhall not be able to repair to that place until towards the end of the month, you will plea≈øe, con≈øulting with the other general officers, to brigade them, putting the militia into one by them≈øelves.</p>
                           <p>You will give directions that no con≈øiderable quantity of provi≈øion, or other military ≈øtores, are at any time left on the carrying place at the north end of Lake George.</p>
                           <p>As the health of the troops is very much injured by an improper mode of dre≈ø≈øing their victuals, I wi≈øh you to order an officer of every company daily to ≈øuperintend that bu≈øine≈øs; and as I conceive it would be for the benefit of the troops to be furni≈øhed with kettles ≈øufficiently large to cook for a whole company, I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Deputy Quarter Ma≈øter General to ≈øend twenty to Ticonderoga for that purpo≈øe.</p>
                           <p>Plea≈øe to cau≈øe a ≈øurvey to be made of the ≈øalted meat. I apprehend much of it will require to be repacked and well brined.</p>
                           <p>I ≈øhall be extremely happy frequently to be favoured with a line from you.</p>

                           <p>BY the Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary General's return, I find there is a con≈øiderable quantity of flour, 213 barrels of pork, 582 barrels of beef, and near 600 bu≈øhels of pea≈øe, at Fort George.

                           <p>I DO my≈øelf the honour to advi≈øe you that I arrived here on Tue≈øday, the third in≈øtant, and found an account, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</p>
                           <p>Inclo≈øe you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As ≈øoon as I procure tho≈øe from the other po≈øts I ≈øhall make out a general return, and do my≈øelf the honour to tran≈ømit copies to you and his Excellency General Wa≈øhington.</p>
                           <p>You will perceive by the return of the Commi≈ø≈øary of Provi≈øions, which I al≈øo inclo≈øe, that only 337 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of the meat kind have been forwarded to Ticonderoga ≈øince the 26th of March, and no fre≈øh beef, ≈øo that the ≈øtock of ≈øalted provi≈øions ≈øince that time is con≈øiderably dimini≈øhed, nor is there any con≈øiderable quantity provided in the country. I have therefore directed the Commi≈ø≈øary to forward an immediate ≈øupply of fre≈øh beef, that as much of the ≈øalted beef and pork may be ≈øaved as po≈ø≈øible, in order to have a ≈øtock on hand, in ca≈øe the enemy ≈øhould be able ≈øo to interrupt the communication as to prevent cattle being ≈øent on.</p>
                           <p>Inclo≈øe you copy of the in≈øtructions I have given General St. Clair. I have directed that Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence ≈øhould be the primary object of attention. 1<hi>st.</hi> Becau≈øe, if even the lines on the we≈øt ≈øide ≈øhould be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force de≈øtined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticonderoga, which it cannot, for the ≈øeveral po≈øts on the Mohawk river, and tho≈øe on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at lea≈øt two thou≈øand men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this ≈øide of the Lake.</p>
                           <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Becau≈øe I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army ≈øhould occupy a po≈øt, which if the enemy ≈øhould be able ≈øo to inve≈øt as to cut off the communication with the country on this ≈øide, we might po≈ø≈øibly experience a di≈øa≈øter ≈øimilar to that at Fort Wa≈øhington.</p>
                           <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Becau≈øe I am fully convinced that between two and three thou≈øand men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and ≈øecure the pa≈øs.</p>
                           <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is po≈ø≈øible that a want of provi≈øion might oblige us to abandon that important po≈øt.</p>
                           <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> If the enemy ≈øhould attempt to draw their boats over land into Lake George, from beyond the Three Mile Point, our naval ≈øtrength on Lake George will prevent their progre≈øs; and if it did not, we ≈øhould have a body of troops to oppo≈øe them with.</p>
                           <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Becau≈øe, if Mount Independence ≈øhould be inve≈øted, the militia will readily march when they have an army to join, and the ≈øiege may be rai≈øed.</p>
                           <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> Becau≈øe, if they ≈øhould attempt to march a body of troops from Crown Point, leaving Ticonderoga on their left (by the road la≈øt year cut by the tories who joined General Carleton) to interrupt the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, there will be a force to meet them, and to prevent the evil con≈øequences of ≈øuch a manoeuvre of theirs.</p>
                           <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> Becau≈øe, if a ≈øudden irruption ≈øhould be made on the Mohawk river, or from New-York, by Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon's river, a force will be at hand to face them. Be≈øides the≈øe con≈øiderations, there are oeconomical ones

al≈øo to induce to this di≈øpo≈øition of the army, if it can be done without danger, which I am fully of opinion it may, and will certainly be ≈øo, if General Carleton ≈øent part of his troops from Canada to New-York or el≈øewhere.</p>
                           <p>I have mentioned the matter to General St. Clair, and although I did not adduce to him all the rea≈øons given above, yet he is in ≈øentiment with me on the ≈øubject. May I be permitted to entreat the direction of Congre≈øs?</p>
                           <p>Some tru≈øty Indians, with two of the French officers, accompanied by an approved Canadian, who leaves a wi≈øe and numerous family here, are going into Canada, to try to gain ≈øome intelligence of the enemy's ≈øtrength and intentions.</p>

Having had ≈øome intimation before I left Albany, that Jo≈øeph Brandt had drove off ≈øome cattle from the we≈øtern frontiers of this State, and threatened the inhabitants, I di≈øpatched a me≈ø≈øage to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>neidas on that ≈øubject. I have this day ≈øent them a ≈øecond me≈ø≈øage, couched in ≈øuch firm, but, I hope, prudent terms, that I expect it will have the de≈øired effect, and that we ≈øhall have no farther trouble from that fellow and his a≈ø≈øociates. Le≈øt, however, I ≈øhould be mi≈øtaken in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, I have ordered Colonel Van Schaick into that quarter with 150 men, to protect the inhabitants, and have directed him in the line of conduct he is to hold, which is to be ≈øuch as not to give umbrage to our Indian allies.</p>
                           <p>At twelve I received an expre≈øs from General St. Clair, copies of his letters No. 3 and 4, with copy of the letter to General Sullivan No. 5, and of the pa≈øs to Am≈øbury No. 6, I herewith tran≈ømit.</p>
                           <p>Con≈øidering the exten≈øivene≈øs of our works at Ticonderoga, the ≈ømallne≈øs of the garri≈øon is alarming; but I hope that, by confining our whole attention to Mount Independence, we ≈øhall be able to hold that pa≈øs again≈øt any effort of the enemy.</p>
                           <p>Though chagrined, I am not di≈øcouraged by the variety of difficulties that pre≈øent them≈øelves; becau≈øe I am confident that by ≈øteady exertions and per≈øeverance we ≈øhall ≈øurmount them, and hope that the enemy will find that we ≈øhall be able to prevent them from penetrating the country, ≈øhould they attempt it, which I believe they will not do, even if they ≈øhould (contrary to my expectations) be able to po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of Ticonderoga, unle≈øs General Howe ≈øhould penetrate up Hud≈øon's river. I have already di≈øpatched an expre≈øs to the States of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts, and New-Hamp≈øhire, to ha≈øten on the remainder of their troops, and have given the mo≈øt pointed orders to the Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary and Quarter Ma≈øter General to furni≈øh what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary in their re≈øpective departments, and as ≈øoon as I have brought matters in ≈øome train at Ticonderoga, and the communication above this, I ≈øhall ha≈øten back to pu≈øh on the nece≈ø≈øaries, and regulate affairs on the We≈øtern Communication, where al≈øo much di≈øorder prevails.</p>
                           <p>I take the liberty to enclo≈øe this under flying ≈øeal to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, as I cannot find time to do my≈øelf the honour to give Congre≈øs and him a ≈øeparate detail of what I have written.</p>

                           <p>I DO my≈øelf the honour to inclo≈øe your Excellency a letter to Congre≈øs under flying ≈øeal. The variety of affairs which claim my attention, do not permit me time to communicate to your Excellency and Congre≈øs, ≈øeparately, ≈øuch information as it may be nece≈ø≈øary both ≈øhould know. You will therefore plea≈øe to excu≈øe the mode I take.</p>
                           <p>Our numbers are ≈øo few to the northward, and we have ≈øo little pro≈øpect of their encrea≈øing, that, ≈øhould a di≈øa≈øter befal us at Ticonderoga, we ≈øhould have very few troops indeed to oppo≈øe, if the enemy ≈øhould make an attempt to penetrate the country. I ≈øhall probably be under the nece≈ø≈øity of calling for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from Peek's-Kill. Perhaps your Excellency may think proper to lodge an order with the commanding officer to comply with my requi≈øition (if I ≈øhould make one) a≈øcertaining the number you may think proper to ≈øpare. Be a≈ø≈øured that I ≈øhall not a≈øk any aid as long as there is a po≈ø≈øibility of doing without.</p>
                           <p>Your letter of the 11th of May to General Gates was this day delivered me by Brigadier General Learned. The cloathing for Colonel Shepherd's regiment, if at Ticonderoga, will be immediately ≈øent down.</p>

                           <p>I HAVE this moment received di≈øpatches from General St. Clair, who is at Ticonderoga, advi≈øing me that by intelligence from Canada a body of the enemy may be expected in a very little while, and another on the Mohawk river; that the militia from New-Hamp≈øhire are gone home; that the troops at Ticonderoga do not amount to more than two thou≈øand two hundred men, ≈øick included; that all the regiments are greatly deficient in numbers. Let me entreat you, Sir, to ≈øpare no exertions to ha≈øten on the troops from your State. Such as can conveniently come by the way of Albany to do it.

                           <p>ON the 17th in≈øtant I arrived at Ticonderoga, where I found General St. Clair, and the other General Officers, a≈ø≈øidno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>≈øly employed in the nece≈ø≈øary works. I ≈øoon found that much was to be done, and, after having informed my≈øelf of the ≈øtate of the fortifications, ≈øtores, &amp;c. I thought it nece≈ø≈øary to convene a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the General Officers, and laid before them the propo≈øitions contained in the paper No. 1, which being taken into their con≈øideration, we came to the re≈øolutions noted in the ≈øame paper.</p>
                           <p>I was in hopes to have found the po≈øt in a better ≈øtate of defence than it is, and the works for ob≈øtructing the pa≈ø≈øage to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into the rear of our fortifications compleated, or, at the very lea≈øt, con≈øiderably more advanced than it unhappily is. That matters have not been carried on with more di≈øpatch is in a great mea≈øure to be imputed to the late arrival of any troops, who could be brought to work with ≈øpirit, that the artificers did not come by the time they were ordered, and to a want of working cattle. The latter I have already ≈øupplied, and I have ≈øent on an additional number of carpenters, ≈øo that the bu≈øine≈øs will now go on in better train, and I hope with much more ≈øpirit, and tru≈øt we ≈øhall ≈øtill be able to put every thing in ≈øuch order as to give the enemy a good reception, and, I hope, a repul≈øe, ≈øhould they attempt a real attack, which I conjecture will not be ≈øoon, if at all, although <hi>I expect they</hi> will approach with their fleet, to keep us in alarm, and to draw our attention from other quarters where they may meditate a real attack.</p>
                           <p>I left Ticonderoga on Sunday evening, and arrived at Fort George on Monday afternoon; and having, previous to my cro≈ø≈øing the lake, taken mea≈øures to bring on a ≈øupply of provi≈øions, I had the happine≈øs to ≈øend on from Fort George between three and four hundred barrels of beef and pork, ≈øo that we have now near ≈øixty days provi≈øions of the meat kind at Ticonderoga, and flour for near double that time, al≈øo at lea≈øt fifteen hundred barrels now at Fort Edward and Fort George, which will all be at the latter place by the end of this month. A ≈ømall quantity of beef and pork is be≈øides on the way up; but, le≈øt this ≈øhould ≈øtill be an in≈øufficient quantity in ca≈øe of a ≈øiege, and that the ≈øalted meat may be hu≈øbanded as much as po≈ø≈øible, I have ≈øent Commi≈ø≈øary Yancey with a ≈ømall party into the interior part of the country to bring up fat cattle; of which, I am informed, there is a con≈øiderable number, chiefly in the hands of per≈øons who have purcha≈øed them to get our paper currency out of their hands. The orders I have given to procure them (copy whereof, No. 2, I do my≈øelf the honour to tran≈ømit) will, if carried into execution, certainly infringe on the civil rights of the inhabitants; but, con≈øidering the nece≈ø≈øity of the ca≈øe, and what kind of people will be mo≈øt affected by them, I hope I ≈øhall ≈øtand excu≈øed for this ≈øtretch of power. I expect the ≈øupply will be ≈øpeedy; if ≈øo, it will eradicate every anxiety on the ≈øcore of provi≈øions, at lea≈øt until our numbers con≈øiderably encrea≈øe.</p>
                           <p>I was very di≈øagreeably di≈øappointed to find the troops of Ticonderoga ≈øo mi≈øerably clad and armed, and nothing in ≈øtore for them. Many are literally barefooted, and mo≈øt of them ragged. It is not po≈ø≈øible to procure ≈øome cloathing, arms and blankets? Many are al≈øo de≈øtitute of the latter.</p>
                           <p>The tents I ≈øent from Philadelphia came in good time, as there was hardly ≈øhelter for what troops we have, and that very indifferent.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered all ≈øuch ≈øick as are not likely to recover ≈øoon to be conveyed to Fort George in covered boats, which are made for the purpo≈øe. If it had been equally proper to have ≈øuffered them to remain, and that they could have been as well provided with vegetables, yet nece≈ø≈øity would have ju≈øtified it, as not one ≈øingle room in the ho≈øpital is yet fini≈øhed, nor will it ≈øoon be in a condition to receive a con≈øiderable number of ≈øick.</p>
                           <p>The corps of artillery not affording even one man to a gun, I have drafted two hundred from the different regiments, but was under the nece≈ø≈øity to promi≈øe ≈øuch additional pay as to make it equal to that of the artillery corps, which I hope will meet the approbation of Congre≈øs.</p>
                           <p>One of the ≈øchooners at Lake George is launched: She is to carry fourteen guns. Another will be in the lake by the fir≈øt of next month, and the timber for the gallies is hauled to the ≈øpot where they are to be built. But the rigging which I ordered up in the winter is not all arrived, nor have we a ≈øufficient number of guns for the≈øe ve≈ø≈øels. I tru≈øt, however, I ≈øhall ≈øtill be able to procure both in time.</p>
                           <p>The paper, No. 3, is copy of Francis Montly's information, who is lately arrived from Canada.</p>

                           <p>YOUR favour of the 24th was delivered me la≈øt evening. If the enemy ≈øhould not mean a ≈øerious attack on your po≈øt, their movement is probably calculated to cover an attempt on New Hamp≈øhire, the Mohawk river, or to cut off the communication between Fort George and Fort Edward, or perhaps all three.

                           <p>I have di≈øpatched an expre≈øs to Congre≈øs and General Wa≈øhington, and have entreated the latter to afford as a reinforcement.

                           <p>BY the inclo≈øed, which I left under flying ≈øeal for the peru≈øal of the Council of Safety, you will perceive that the enemy are arrived at Crown Point. Whether their intentions are only to make a feint to draw our attention, or a real attack, is ≈øtill doubtful; but as General St. Clair wi≈øhes to have the militia up, I ≈øhall apply to General Ten Broeck for half of the militia under his command. They may be in≈øufficient, even with what may come from the neighbouring States, to make effectual oppo≈øition, if a di≈øa≈øter ≈øhould befal us at Ticonderoga. I wi≈øh therefore, if po≈ø≈øible, to have ≈øome from the northern parts of Dutche≈øs and Ul≈øter counties, and de≈øire General Herkimer to keep that of Tryon county in readine≈øs to march at a moment's warning.</p>
                           <p>I wi≈øh you to expedite the letter to General Putnam by expre≈øs, with a copy of General St. Clair's letter to me, and if there are any ≈øtoops in the vicinity of King≈øton to order them down to Peek's-Kill.</p>

Employ all hands to throw up lines from the Fort towards the ≈øpot where the Regimental Ho≈øpital was to be built, and continue them from thence on the brow of the hill to the Guardhou≈øe. Al≈øo threw up a brea≈øtwork from the ea≈øt ≈øide of the fort to the precipice by the low land. This, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the guns from the ve≈ø≈øels, will render you perfectly ≈øecure.

Send a tru≈øty officer with my letter to General St. Clair, and if, on his arrival near the north end of the lake, he apprehends danger on the carrying place, direct him to land about four miles on this ≈øide, on the ea≈øt ≈øide of the lake, and cro≈øs the mountains, ≈øo as to ≈øtrike the lake oppo≈øite Ticonderoga.

                           <p>GENERAL BURGOYNE, with his army, is advanced as far as Crown Point, and meditates an attack on Ticonderoga; and it is ≈øaid that Sir John John≈øon is to come by the way of O≈øwego, to make an attempt on Fort Schuyler. I have written to Colonel Gan≈øevoort to give you the mo≈øt early intelligence, ≈øhould he learn that the enemy approach. You will therefore plea≈øe to keep the militia in readine≈øs to march at a moment's warning to the ≈øupport of Colonel Gan≈øevoort.</p>
                           <p>By ≈øpirited exertions, we ≈øhall be able, I tru≈øt, to repul≈øe them in every quarter.</p>

                           <p>I HAVE received your letter, in an≈øwer to mine of ye≈øterday. I believe the difficulty of procuring cattle at pre≈øent, is very great, but a ≈øufficient ≈øtock of provi≈øions might have been laid in, if the orders I gave on
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016142_0037_0F9B8E76E63FDAD8"/>
the 6th of November la≈øt had been complied with; for it was on that day that I wrote the Commi≈ø≈øary General on the ≈øubject, the receipt of which letter he acknowledged.</p>
                           <p>You labour under a mi≈øtake, when you a≈ø≈øert that there was not ≈øufficient ≈øledding to carry up the provi≈øions. If there had been ten times the quantity, it might have been ≈øent to Fort George and Che≈øhire's; for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but remember that crouds of ≈øleds offered daily; that many returned from hence home without a loading; that no provi≈øion was left in the ≈øtores here. Indeed, many of the ≈øledmen complained per≈øonally to me, that they had come to ride, and could get no loading. It is true, that the military che≈øt was not ≈øufficiently ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to an≈øwer every demand; but, if my memory fails not, you had a ≈øufficiency to have laid in a ≈øtock con≈øiderably beyond what is. I confe≈øs that it would be mortifying to any per≈øon to have the frowns and cen≈øures of his ≈øuperior officer, when he is ≈øen≈øible he has done his duty. But I ≈øhould be glad to know in what in≈øtances you have had my frowns. All my letters to you point out to you the rever≈øe. They give you whole≈øome advice, and direct you what might be proper to do. That the army is ≈øo well ≈øupplied with flour you know is, in a great mea≈øure, owing to the hints I gave you. That you procured barrels for that flour was in con≈øequence of a plan I ≈øtruck out for you. I wi≈øh you therefore, nay, I in≈øi≈øt upon your pointing out in what in≈øtance you have not been ≈øupported by me, whenever you required my ≈øupport. I believe you will not be able to adduce one. I promi≈øed you my countenance when you came into the office, and you have had it. If I had wi≈øhed that another ≈øhould have enjoyed it, I might probably have had it in my power to have obtained it; but, ≈øu≈øpicious as you are, I will ≈øtill be candid. I declare that I believe you took ≈øuch mea≈øures as you thought be≈øt to procure a ≈øufficient ≈øtock of provi≈øion. I believe your Agents have greatly deceived you. I believe they made returns of larger quantities than they were po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of. I do not believe that you would have returned ≈øo large a quantity to me as you did on the 13th of March, if you had not been deceived; but you ought not to have been deceived. It was faulty in you to be ≈øo, and of that I have great rea≈øon to complain. The militia are ordered up, and a body of continental troops are expected from Peek's-Kill. I ≈øuppo≈øe we ≈øhall have ≈øix or ≈øeven thou≈øand additional men to feed. You mu≈øt therefore ≈øtrain every nerve to procure a ≈øupply of provi≈øions. If you want money, ≈øend to me for a warrant. Coopers are greatly wanted, both of Fort George and Fort Edward, you ≈øhould ≈øend one to each po≈øt.</p>

                           <p>YOUR favour of the 28th in≈øtant I received la≈øt night. The militia are moving up with the continental troops, and this day I expect another body from Peek's-Kill, with which I propo≈øe to move without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay.</p>
                           <p>By all accounts, the enemy have had a mo≈øt ≈øevere drubbing. They did not retreat, but fled from Brun≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick to Amboy, where they took ≈øhelter in their lines.

                           <p>I HAVE received further information that a body of the enemy are on their march to Tryon county, by the way of O≈øwego, and have de≈øired General Herkimer to hold the militia in readine≈øs to march to the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Fort Schuyler.</p>
                           <p>I am very apprehen≈øive that, ≈øhould a di≈øa≈øter befal the garri≈øon of Ticonderoga, the enemy might po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of Fort George before we can be in force to make oppo≈øition. I wi≈øh therefore, mo≈øt heartily, for the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Council of Safety in forwarding on the militia. A Committee from that re≈øpectable body might afford us very material a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. Perhaps it would tend much to in≈øpirit the people, if all the State pri≈øoners, except ≈øuch as were under ≈øentence of death, were removed from this city.</p>

                           <p>I AM favoured with your letter of the 20th June, which came to hand on my arrival at this place from Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have opened the campaign in every quarter in this department. By a letter from General St. Clair, of the 28th ult. their main body and fleet were ≈øtill at Crown Point, where they had been ≈øome days, and from whence they have ≈øent ≈øtrong parties to interrupt the communication. If we had a ≈øufficient number of troops at that po≈øt, I ≈øhould not be in pain for the event if they made a ≈øerious attack; but our numbers are con≈øiderably below half what they ought to be. I am waiting with impatience for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and for a reinforcement from Peek's-Kill, which is expected in a day or two to move up, either to give a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to the garri≈øon, or to cover its retreat, ≈øhould ≈øuch an event unhappily take place. An incur≈øion on the Mohawk river is al≈øo momently expected. Some ≈øcalping parties have already made their appearance.</p>

                           <p>I am doubly di≈øtre≈ø≈øed for blankets.

                           <p>THE nece≈ø≈øity of inducing the Six Nations to abide by the neutrality they have promi≈øed to ob≈øerve is a matter of capital moment. The troops it would require to awe the≈øe people, if they were unfriendly, would create a very con≈øiderable expence, whil≈øt a ≈øum, equal to the tenth part of it, properly laid out in pre≈øents, would have all the de≈øired effect. A conference is to be held with them at this place on the 15th in≈øtant, and as they inform me that they will generally attend, it is nece≈ø≈øary that the articles nece≈ø≈øary to give them ≈øhould be procured without delay.

                           <p>The enemy, from ≈øome late manoeuvres, do not appear to be in great force.

                           <p>The Six Nations of Indians, who were invited to a conference to be held at this place on the 15th in≈øtant, have ≈øent me word that they would generally attend. The importance of keeping the≈øe people to ob≈øerve that neutrality which they have promi≈øed is ≈øo evident, that it needs not to be particularly dwelt upon. Permit me only to ob≈øerve, that one tenth part of the money, nece≈ø≈øary to maintain a force equal to keep them in awe, expended in pre≈øents, will have the de≈øired effect. The difficulty is, to procure the articles that are wanted; and as they are not to be got any where but with you, I have ≈øent Major Ren≈ø≈øelaer for the purpo≈øe, and mu≈øt earne≈øtly entreat you that you will be plea≈øed to afford him every a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in your power, and to order Major Cha≈øe, the Deputy Quarter Ma≈øter General, to provide him with carriages, for which he will pay.

Should any of the articles, or any thing as a ≈øub≈øtitute, be found in any of the continental ≈øtores, you will plea≈øe to order ≈øuch to be delivered.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have approached to within three miles of Ticonderoga, where they are retrenching them≈øelves, and al≈øo are throwing a boom acro≈øs the lake. This does not carry with it an idea that they have any great force. The militia are marching up, and part of the continental troops from Peek's-Kill are momently expected. I ≈øhall make all the ha≈øte po≈ø≈øible with them, and hope we ≈øhall be able, at lea≈øt, to prevent the enemy from doing any thing capital.</p>

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 2d in≈øtant was delivered me la≈øt night by Mr. Moore.</p>
                           <p>As General Herkimer has made an agreement with Brandt, and that the latter is gone or going to Onendoga, I do not apprehend that the inhabitants of Cherry Valley will be in any danger from the Indians, more e≈øpecially as the treaty is to be held here on the 15th in≈øtant, to which the Indians have generally promi≈øed to come. I ≈øhall, however, order Colonel Van Schaick to remain in Tryon county. I cannot but think that he will be more advantageou≈øly po≈øted for the protection of the inhabitants at Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joharie, on the north ≈øide of the river. I have, however, directed him, on this head, to con≈øult you and General Herkimer.</p>
                           <p>I am very ≈øorry that ≈øuch a de≈øpondency ≈øhould have taken place, as to induce you to ≈øay,
<q>;If not ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, the well affected people of the≈øe frontiers will be left in ≈øuch a dilemma, that will render them obliged either to abandon their habitations, or ≈øubmit to the terms of the friends of Great-Britain, <hi>≈øeeing them≈øelves out of the protection of the States of America.</hi>

                           <p>You ≈øeem to entertain an idea that the enemy are capable of doing what they plea≈øe; whereas, in fact, there is great rea≈øon to believe that they will not be able to do much. I entreat you to keep up the ≈øpirits of the people. Encourage them to ≈øtep forth with alacrity, whenever they may be called upon, and our enemies will be ha≈ø≈øled in their attempts, and do not ≈øuppo≈øe that the United States of America will not afford you protection. I am ≈øure I have been always ready and willing to afford every a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in my power, and hitherto it has been effectual; for no mi≈øchief worth mentioning has as yet been perpetrated in any part of your country, and you may depend upon it, that upon no nece≈ø≈øary occa≈øion will you be left without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ≈øupport.</p>

                           <p>I do my≈øelf the honour to tran≈ømit you copy of ≈øundry letters and papers received from General St. Clair.</p>
                           <p>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with impatience and anxiety, and ≈øhall pu≈øh with them the moment they do; but if they do not arrive by to-morrow, I ≈øhall go without them, and do the be≈øt I can with the militia.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who have ≈øcalped a Captain and Corporal of Gan≈øevoort's regiment. This, with the threatnings of Jo≈øeph Brandt and his party, and the pro≈øpect of the enemy's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by O≈øwego, greatly di≈øpirits the people of Tryon county, who have called upon me for ≈øupport, in ≈øuch a manner that I am obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick's in that quarter, and apprehend that a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement will ≈øoon be required there. If ≈øo, I ≈øhall be greatly di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, as we are, and with the reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coming up will ≈øtill be, but weak to the northward, a great part of which mu≈øt be employed as convoys to e≈øcort the provi≈øions from Fort George and Fort Edward to Fort Ann, and thence to Skeen≈øborough and Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>I mentioned in a former letter from Saratoga, that I ≈øuppo≈øed ≈øuch an additional quantity of provi≈øions had arrived by that time, as that the garri≈øon was ≈øupplied with near ≈øixty days; but as great part, if not all of what was at the landing is ≈øent back to Fort George, they are much ≈øhort of it. I have ordered it to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016142_0040_0F9B8E79A4A224B0"/>
to Fort Ann. I with it had been conveyed to Ticonderoga in the months of April and May. I a≈ø≈øure you I am far from being at ea≈øe on the ≈øcore of provi≈øions, for if we ≈øhould not be able to throw in a ≈øupply of fat cattle, I fear that we ≈øhall not have a ≈øufficient quantity of ≈øalt meat in this part of the country. At Fort Schuyler only, twenty-nine thou≈øand odd hundred weight has been condemned.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Spencer is returned from the Six Nations. He advi≈øes that the meeting at this place will be numerous. The enemy's agents have indu≈øtriou≈øly propagated that we have nothing to give them; that if we get any thing, it mu≈øt come from Heaven; that all our ports are ≈øhut up, and that we can neither get in or out. A good u≈øe might be made of this a≈ø≈øertion, if we could give them a tolerable good ≈øupply; but the goods I ≈øent for to the ea≈øtward in March la≈øt have come ≈øo extravagantly high, that the cargoe is ≈ømall indeed, and not one blanket, and very little ≈øtrouds, two articles, without which every thing el≈øe is con≈øidered as almo≈øt nothing. In this ≈øituation, Mr. Douw and I thought it advi≈øable that another attempt ≈øhould be made to procure a ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and I have di≈øpatched Major Ren≈ø≈øelaer expre≈øs to Bo≈øton, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </opener>
                           <p>I DO my≈øelf the honour to tran≈ømit you copies of General St. Clair's letters to me of the 30th of June, continued to the 1≈øt of July, together with copies of tho≈øe of the 2d and 3d in≈øtant, and two papers inclo≈øed in the la≈øt, all of which are numbered in the order of time I received them.</p>
                           <p>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with anxiety, and the moment they do I ≈øhall move with them. If they do not arrive by to-morrow, I go without them, and will do the be≈øt I can with the militia.</p>

This, with the threatnings of Jo≈øeph Brandt, a natural ≈øon of Sir William John≈øon, who commands a party of about two hundred Indians, and the pro≈øpect of being attacked by the way of O≈øwego, has ≈øo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpirited the inhabitants of Tryon county, that I have been obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick, who has about one hundred and fifty continental troops with him, in that part of the country, and apprehend that I ≈øhall ≈øoon be under the nece≈ø≈øity of reinforcing him. If ≈øo, I propo≈øe to ≈øend him ≈øome of the militia de≈øtined for the northward, that we may keep the continental troops as much together as po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                           <p>Inclo≈øe your Excellency a return of the army at Ticonderoga. Should any accident befal us in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the troops be lo≈øt, we ≈øhall be in a di≈øagreeable ≈øituation, with little el≈øe be≈øides militia, with not a ≈øingle piece of heavy or light artillery, and not one artillery-man.</p>
                           <p>If it be po≈ø≈øible, I wi≈øh your Excellency to order as many artillery-men and field-pieces to this quarter as can be ≈øpared, with a competent quantity of fixed ammunition, as we have no cannon cartridge paper, and very little of any other.</p>
                           <p>As part of the provi≈øions I ≈øent by the way of Lake George is returned to that po≈øt, I ≈øhall now be under the nece≈ø≈øity of drawing it from thence to Fort Ann, that we may attempt to ≈øupply the garri≈øon of Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga by the way of Wood Creek and Skeen≈øborough; but ≈øhould we be incapable of getting a ≈øupply of fre≈øh provi≈øions into that fortre≈øs, I dread the con≈øequences, as the hopes I have of obtaining any con≈øiderable quantity of ≈øalted meat are next to none, unle≈øs it can be ≈øent from below, a good deal of what was in this department being ≈øpoiled.</p>

The waggons that carry the baggage of the militia will be of con≈øiderable aid to you on this occa≈øion.

               <p>From the aforegoing facts and papers I humbly conceive the Court will clearly perceive, that during the whole time of my command, prior to the evacuation, I was guilty of no neglect of duty, either in not tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting information to Congre≈øs, preparing for the campaign of 1777, obtaining intelligence of the enemy's de≈øigns, or pur≈øuing every mea≈øure in my power for rendering them abortive. Should you, Gentlemen, be of this opinion, I pre≈øume a ≈øuppo≈øition of my having neglected my duty in the in≈øtance charged again≈øt me will not be ≈øo ea≈øily admitted, as if my prior attention had been le≈øs exten≈øive and unremitted.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall now proceed to the ≈øecond thing propo≈øed, viz. To lay before the Court the rea≈øons of my ab≈øence from Ticonderoga at the time of the ≈øiege.‚ÄîThey are as follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>≈øt.</hi> I did not then, nor can I now, think it the duty of a Commander in Chief of an exten≈øive Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever to ≈øuffer him≈øelf to be ble≈øieged in a ≈øort.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> I did not apprehend it to have been the de≈øire, or even wi≈øh of Congre≈øs, that I ≈øhould have remained in the garri≈øon of Ticonderoga at the time of the ≈øiege.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> The particular and various circum≈øtances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and con≈øequences capitally injurious to the public good would have en≈øued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the ≈øiege.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>≈øt.</hi> That Commanders in Chief ≈øhould not permit them≈øelves to be be≈øieged in a fort appears ≈øo ≈øtriking and evident, that I am at a lo≈øs to adduce rea≈øons for rendering it more clear.</p>
               <p>When it is con≈øidered that there may be and generally are in every department various po≈øts and pa≈ø≈øes, all of which demand his care; that occa≈øional aid is to be afforded, in proportion to their re≈øpective nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that the operations of the enemy may frequently render new di≈øpo≈øitions nece≈ø≈øary, and that applications from every quarter of the department mu≈øt be made to him; I think he would merit cen≈øure were he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his care to a ≈øingle garri≈øon, lock him≈øelf up in it, and, during the cour≈øe of perhaps a long ≈øiege, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the remainder of the department of his ≈øuperintendence.</p>
               <p>The propriety of this rea≈øoning receives additional force from general practice. I am ignorant of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of Commanders in Chief having acted this part. The pre≈øent war affords numerous in≈øtances to the contrary.</p>
               <p>His Excellency General Wa≈øhington never ≈øuffered him≈øelf to be be≈øieged. What would have been the con≈øequence had be taken the command of Fort Wa≈øhington? His abilities perhaps might have ≈øaved it, but it might even then have been lo≈øt, and ≈øurely it was not his duty to have run the ri≈øque. His per≈øonal valour, as well as good conduct, ≈øtands confe≈ø≈øed, and yet he never thought him≈øelf ju≈øtifiable to take ≈øuch a ≈øtep. I would not here be ≈øuppo≈øed to compare my≈øelf, in point of importance, to that great and good man. I mean nothing further by this, than to repre≈øent the impropriety of ≈øuch conduct in a Commander in Chief in a ≈øtronger light.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the command of ≈øorts is generally given to ≈øubordinate officers; and as the object of the appointment of a Commander in Chief is the good of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>hole department, it would, in my opinion, be repugnant to the de≈øign of his appointment, to put him≈øelf in ≈øuch a ≈øituation as to be able to extend his care no further than the walls of one ≈øingle fort in it. On the contrary, ≈øhould be not leave him≈øelf at large, to concert and execute mea≈øures for the relief of ≈øuch po≈øts as may be in danger, to afford them ≈øuccours, to annoy the enemy, to cut off their retreat, to intercept their ≈øupplies, and generally to do every thing, which, in his opinion, may be calculated to fru≈øtrate their de≈øigns?</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Had I received the lea≈øt intimation that it was the de≈øire of Congre≈øs that I ≈øhould take the command of Ticonderoga, I ≈øhould, without the lea≈øt he≈øitation, have done it, but ≈øuch intimation was never given me. On the contrary be≈øides the rea≈øons above mentioned, I had particular ones, which induced me to believe that they neither expected or de≈øired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ticonderoga has been deemed an important po≈øt ever ≈øince the war, and when it became mo≈øt ≈øo, Congre≈øs was plea≈øed to name the officer who they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> ≈øhould command at it.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of March, 1776. Congre≈øs re≈øolved that I ≈øhould for the pre≈øent, or until I ≈øhould receive farther orders, ≈øix my Head-Quarters at Albany.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:016142_0042_0F9B8E7DC2498A70"/>And although in the fall following the enemy appeared in force in the vicinity of Ticonderoga under General Carleton, and apparently with de≈øign to inve≈øt it, yet the above order remained unrepealed, and the immediate command of that po≈øt was committed to another officer.</p>
               <p>Nor were the≈øe orders annulled till the 22d of May, 1777, in con≈øequence of my repre≈øenting to Congre≈øs the impracticability of my paying proper attention to the department, during the continuance of that re≈øtriction.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of April, 1777, the Congre≈øs pa≈ø≈øed the following re≈øolution:</p>
               <p>"<hi>Ordered,</hi> That General St. Clair be informed by expre≈øs of the approach of the enemy to Ticonderoga, "and that he repair without lo≈øs of time to that place.</p>
               <p>As General St. Clair was at that time one of the officers de≈øigned for the Northern Department, and of cour≈øe under my command, the above order receives all its propriety and u≈øe, from a ≈øuppo≈øition that I ≈øhould not remain with the garri≈øon in ca≈øe of a ≈øiege.</p>
               <p>At no time, during my command in that department, did I ever intimate a de≈øign of taking the particular command of that po≈øt. Indeed, I had informed Congre≈øs, as the Court will perceive by my letter of the 14th of June, already quoted, that
<q>as ≈øoon as matters were brought into ≈øome train at Ticonderoga, and on the communication above, that I ≈øhould ha≈øten back to pu≈øh on the nece≈ø≈øary ≈øupplies, and regulate affairs on the We≈øtern Communication, where al≈øo much di≈øorder prevailed.</q>
As this letter was di≈øpatched by expre≈øs, and as it inclo≈øed General St. Clair's letter of the 13th of June, if Congre≈øs had intended that I ≈øhould have remained at Ticonderoga, it is rea≈øonable to conclude that they would have given me orders for the purpo≈øe. Nor do any letters or re≈øolves I have been honoured with from Congre≈øs hint ≈øuch an expectation. Shortly before, and at the time of the ≈øiege, I tran≈ømitted ≈øeveral letters from General St. Clair to Congre≈øs, by which they were informed of the enemy's progre≈øs; and I al≈øo informed Congre≈øs of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention (not to command the garri≈øon) but to put my≈øelf at the head of all the troops and militia I could collect, and do my utmo≈øt to rai≈øe the ≈øiege. From the above circum≈øtances therefore, and from the ≈øilence of Congre≈øs re≈øpecting a de≈øire that I ≈øhould confine my≈øelf to the fort, I had not the lea≈øt rea≈øon to infer that they wi≈øhed it, or that they were di≈øplea≈øed with my ab≈øence. About this time a treaty with the Indians was to be held, the ≈øecurity of Fort Schuyler to be provided for, the incur≈øions of the Indians on the we≈øtern fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to be oppo≈øed, a long chain of communication to be kept open, the militia to be collected, ≈øupplies to the different po≈øts to be forwarded, and my utmo≈øt exertions throughout the whole department required. I mu≈øt therefore ≈øubmit it to you, Gentlemen, whether I had any rea≈øon to conjecture that Congre≈øs expected I would confine my≈øelf at Ticonderoga, and thereby ≈øubject my≈øelf to the nece≈ø≈øity of neglecting tho≈øe other very important objects, e≈øpecially too as an officer of reputation, nominated by them to command at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, was then at that po≈øt.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The particular and various circum≈øtances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and that con≈øequences very injurious to the public good would have en≈øued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the ≈øiege.</p>
               <p>Permit me to remind you, Gentlemen, that Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Fort George, Fort Schuyler, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, and various other po≈øts, are included in the Northern Department, and then under my command; that an expedition was then carrying on again≈øt Ticonderoga by General Burgoyne; another again≈øt Fort Schuyler by General St. Leger; and a third by a party of ≈øavages again≈øt the we≈øtern ≈øettlements of this State; that, to e≈øtabli≈øh a communication for the pa≈ø≈øage of ≈øupplies from Albany and the interior country to Ticonderoga, a chain of po≈øts was to be maintained, which chain con≈øi≈øted of the following po≈øts, Half Moon, Stillwater, Saratoga, Fort Miller, Fort Edward, Fort George, Fort Ann and Skeen≈øborough; that a like chain of po≈øts was nece≈ø≈øary to be maintained to the we≈øtward, to ≈øecure a communication with Fort Schuyler, viz. Schenec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tady, Fort John≈øon and Fort Dayton. At all the≈øe po≈øts troops were ≈øtationed, and care to be taken to prevent any of them from being ≈øurprized; it being evident that the lo≈øs of one of the≈øe po≈øts would have broken the whole communication, and have ≈øtopped the progre≈øs of ≈øupplies too important to be ri≈øqued in that critical ≈øea≈øon.</p>
               <p>It will be unnece≈ø≈øary here to mention the frequent applications made to me for ≈øuccour from the we≈øtern country, I mean from Cherry Valley, Umadilla, Schohary, Canajoharie, German Flatts, and Fort Schuyler, which was afterwards relieved by a detachment I ≈øent under General Arnold for that purpo≈øe, ≈øome of which places were in danger, others had ≈øuffered, and all in the greate≈øt con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ernation, as will appear by ≈øundry papers which I ≈øhall have the honour to lay before the Court.</p>
               <p>The fate of ≈øort Schuyler, as well as Ticonderoga, was precarious. In ca≈øe of the reduction of either, mea≈øures were to be taken for oppo≈øing the victorious army, and the ≈øy≈øtem of that oppo≈øition was to depend on events and circum≈øtances, then only to be conjectured.</p>
               <p>Pacific, as well as ho≈øtile mea≈øures, to avoid the depredations of the ≈øavages, were then in agitation, a treaty was to be held, me≈ø≈øages were to be ≈øent and received, agents to be employed and in≈øtructed, ≈øpeeches to be made and an≈øwered, pre≈øents to be collected and di≈øtributed. Add to this, that there was not a general officer in the department, who had a competent knowledge of that exten≈øive country, immediately to direct the military operations in it. With what propriety could I throw my≈øelf into Ticonderoga, and, as it were, abandon tho≈øe numerous and e≈ø≈øential objects?</p>
               <p>Had I remained with the garri≈øon of Ticonderoga, the valuable ≈øtores at Fort George would have been lo≈øt, a competent ≈øupply of provi≈øions for Fort Schuyler would not have been afforded, for although I had given or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The militia of this State would not have been ≈øo ≈øoon collected or the cattle and carriages in the reach of the enemy removed. The ob≈øtructions in the navigation of Wood Creek, and of the roads into the country (which was done before General St. Clair and the garri≈øon came up) whereby the progre≈øs of the enemy was greatly retarded, might not have been effected, nor would the country ≈øo ≈øpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

by the re≈øolution of Congre≈øs of the 29th of July, 1777, were charged to make the mo≈øt critical enquiry, in order to inve≈øtigate the cau≈øes of the misfortunes in the Northern Department, and that in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the orders of Congre≈øs, and in conformity to their duty, they publi≈øhed the re≈øolutions in the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, and in the ≈øame public manner called upon every per≈øon capable of giving information to do ≈øo, wrote to the ≈øeveral officers in the Northern Department, and to the ≈øeveral Executive Powers of this and the Ea≈øtern States, to afford their aid in procuring information, and as the charge of my not being at Ticonderoga is founded on a fact which was notorious, which Congre≈øs were fully informed of, previous to that re≈øolution, it affords ≈øtrong pre≈øumptive proof that the Committee received no information on which they could ground any charge, and authorizes the conclu≈øion, that if I erred in judgment, in not being at Ticonderoga during the ≈øiege, it was by no means an intentional neglect of duty. Indeed, I have every rea≈øon to believe, from the confidence which Congre≈øs have been plea≈øed to place in me after I was la≈øt ≈øuperceded in the command of the Northern Department, in≈øtances of which I ≈øhall beg leave to produce, that that Honourable Body does not con≈øider me either as a criminal, or even unworthy ≈øervant of the public.

Inclo≈øed you have a li≈øt of nece≈ø≈øaries wanted at Fort Schuyler.

S.</label> Three hundred carriages are wanted at this place, which it will be nece≈ø≈øary to detain only a few days Your be≈øt exertions will be required to ≈øend up that number. Let none be neglected. Apply to the Committee of Albany and General Ten Broeck, and reque≈øt their aid to induce the people from every quarter to come up with waggons. Let the militia bring with them as many as they think proper, and a≈ø≈øure them that their detention will be only for a few days. We are in great di≈øtre≈øs for want of lead, an article ≈øo e≈ø≈øentially requi≈øite, that we cannot even hope to do any thing here to prevent the enemy's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing without it.

The lead from windows and weights may perhaps afford a ≈øupply for the pre≈øent. As ≈øoon as it can be collected, Mr. Ren≈ø≈øelaer will have it made into ball, and ≈øend it up without a moment's delay.</p>

                           <p>I AM this moment favoured with your Excellency's letter of the 6th in≈øtant. You will before this have received my ≈øeveral letters, advi≈øing your Excellency of the evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed ≈øituation we are in. We are by no means now in a better, rather wor≈øe, as de≈øertion is frequent. General Nixon's brigade is not yet come up, nor do I get a reinforcement of the militia. General St. Clair, from whom I have heard for the fir≈øt time about ten this morning (copy of his letter I inclo≈øe) is about fifty miles ea≈øt of me. If he ≈øhould go to Bennington, as I fear he will be obliged to do, he will be ≈øtill farther off, and the more he gets into the inhabited part of the country, the greater will the de≈øertion from the army be, which is already much, very much dimini≈øhed, by numbers going off. I am very apprehen≈øive General St. Clair will not join me with more than one thou≈øand men. General Nixon's corps, I am informed, is under that. Thus, with le≈øs than three thou≈øand continental and not quite one thou≈øand militia, I am to face a powerful enemy from the north, flu≈øhed with ≈øucce≈øs, and pre≈ø≈øed at the ≈øame time from the we≈øt by a body, which, from repeated information (copies whereof I have not time to ≈øend), is re≈øpectable, and already at O≈øwego.</p>
                           <p>We have ≈øtill ≈øtores of ≈øuch importance left at Fort George, that I am very anxious to bring them off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I order that po≈øt to be abandoned, which I mu≈øt do, or ≈øuffer the garri≈øon to fall into the enemy's hands, which it inevitably will, if the enemy, who are approaching by Wood Creek, throw them≈øelves between this and Lake George.</p>
                           <p>I have brought away about twenty pieces of artillery from Lake George, together with nearly all the powder, amounting to about thirteen tons.</p>
                           <p>General Fellows, with a ≈ømall body of militia, but all I could get, are breaking up the road between this and Fort Ann, and felling trees into it. I will throw every ob≈øtacle in their route I po≈ø≈øibly can, and retard their progre≈øs as much as po≈ø≈øible. For this purpo≈øe, I ≈øhall di≈øengage my≈øelf of every thing cumber≈øome, the artillery e≈øpecially, as I can make no u≈øe of it.</p>
                           <p>Permit me to a≈ø≈øure your Excellency, that I ≈øhall make every re≈øi≈øtance I po≈ø≈øibly can, and that nothing ≈øhall be left undone to prevent the enemy from penetrating farther in the country.</p>

                           <p>YOU will immediately march your brigade to Fort Ann. On your arrival there, you will di≈øpatch two ≈øcouts, one on the we≈øt and the other on the ea≈øt ≈øide of Wood Creek, to di≈øcover if the enemy are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

either by land or water. You will direct the officers commanding the≈øe ≈øcouts to be as exact as po≈ø≈øible in a≈øcertaining the numbers of any of the enemy they may ≈øee, and to give you the earlie≈øt intelligence of it, that I may be advi≈øed thereof by you as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible.

In retreating, you are to break up all the bridges in your rear, that the enemy may be as much ob≈øtructed in their march as po≈ø≈øible.

                           <p>You will find Brigadier General Fellows, with a body of troops, on your march. You are to take him and the troops under his command with you.</p>

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 10th in≈øtant I have received. The information that four or five hundred Indians were on their way to New-Perth is totally groundle≈øs. There are not even any ≈øo high up Wood Creek as Fort Ann, where we have a large body of troops. If it was nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend troops to White Creek, I would mo≈øt readily do it. My care ≈øhall be extended to every quarter, and if my countrymen will ≈øupport me with vigour and activity, we ≈øhall be able to prevent the enemy from penetrating much farther into the country; but if they ≈øuffer their ≈øpirits to ≈øink, and meanly de≈øpond, the word of con≈øequences are to be apprehended.</p>
                           <p>I am informed that ≈øeveral people, forgetting the duty they owe their country, di≈øcourage the good inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and are ready to take protection from the enemy. Any that have made ≈øuch declarations, I would advi≈øe to have immediately ≈øecured and ≈øent pri≈øoners to Albany.</p>
                           <p>The enemy's view, in offering protection, is only to prevent the inhabitants from acting ≈øpiritedly; to get into the country, and, when once there, to plunder indi≈øcriminately, as well tho≈øe that may have relied on their promi≈øes, as tho≈øe that have gloriou≈øly ≈øtepped forth for the defence of their country, and tho≈øe ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings which they can only enjoy by having that country free. Let every one therefore exert him≈øelf, and all will go well.</p>

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 11th in≈øtant I received la≈øt night. I ≈øhould be extremely happy if I had it in my power to afford you the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance you reque≈øt, but in fact I have not that number of militia in this quarter. From every intelligence I can procure, the enemy mean to bend their force this way, and it would therefore be highly imprudent to weaken the army in this quarter.</p>
                           <p>I would, by all means, advi≈øe that the cattle of every kind, and carriages, ≈øhould be moved from every town≈øhip expo≈øed to the incur≈øions of the enemy's parties, and which cannot be covered by the troops or militia, to ≈øome more interior places of ≈øafety.</p>
                           <p>I have already ordered a con≈øiderable quantity of powder and ball to be ≈øent on to Colonel Warner. If more of the former ≈øhould be wanted, it will be ≈øent on application. As to fire-arms, I have not one, and many of the troops are without, con≈øequently cannot give any.</p>

                           <p>De≈øertion prevails and di≈øca≈øe gains ground, nor is it to be wondered at, for we have neither tents, hou≈øes, barns, boards, or any ≈øhelter except a little bru≈øh.

We are informed the enemy are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Fort George, becau≈øe they find it rather difficult to penetrate by the way of Skeen≈øborough. Secure all the cattle and carriages you can. Much depends upon preventing them from getting ≈øupplies of that kind. Advance as near to the enemy as you po≈ø≈øibly can. Secure all tories, and ≈øend them to the interior part of the country. Be vigilant; a ≈øurpri≈øe is inexcu≈øable. Thank the troops, in my name, for behaving ≈øo well as you ≈øay they did at Hubbarton. A≈ø≈øure them that I will get whatever I can to make them comfortable. All of your regiment that were here are already on the way to join you. If we act vigorou≈øly, we ≈øave the country. Why ≈øhould we de≈øpond? Greater misfortunes have happened, and have been retrieved. Cheer up the ≈øpirits of the people in your quarter.</p>

It is certain that a con≈øiderable body of their troops with General Burgoyne are at Skeen≈øborough; that, from corroborated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, a body of them are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Lake George.</p>
                           <p>It is, doubtle≈øs, extremely difficult to move the inhabitants that lie neare≈øt the enemy, but I ≈øhould hope that Colonel Warner, ≈øupported by the militia under Colonel Simmonds, which I have ordered to join him, and with that of the State of New-Hamp≈øhire, and ≈øuch as can be collected from the more ≈øouthern parts of what are commonly called the Grants, would be able to effect this bu≈øine≈øs in a very great mea≈øure.</p>
                           <p>The enemy, by the be≈øt accounts, are not above ≈øix thou≈øand; and, if it be true that they are di≈øpo≈øed of as I have mentioned, the body at Ca≈øtle-Town cannot be con≈øiderable.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered ≈øuch per≈øons as are going to the enemy for protections to be ≈øeized, and ≈øent pri≈øoners to me. Three have been delivered to me, and I have ≈øent them to goal in Albany. I think it would be right to adopt a ≈øimilar conduct, e≈øpecially to tho≈øe who are not yet ≈øo much in their power as to be obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept protection from them.</p>
                           <p>I have delivered Captain Fitch a proclamation, of which I wi≈øh you to make copies, and di≈øtribute them in the country neare≈øt the enemy.</p>

                           <p>I AM this moment informed by Captain Fitch, that the New-Hamp≈øhire militia are marching to join me. It is not my intention, much as I am in want of troops, that they ≈øhould come hither, as it would expo≈øe the country in that quarter to the depredations of the enemy. I therefore inclo≈øe you an order for them to join you. If none are arrived, you will ≈øend expre≈øs for them.

                           <p>I AM honoured with your letter of the 17th in≈øtant, and the papers it inclo≈øed.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øub≈øtance of Colonel Harper's and Mr. John≈øon's information had been tran≈ømitted about a month ago; in con≈øequence whereof I ≈øent Colonel Van Schaick into Tryon county, with as many troops as I could collect. After the improper agreement made by General Herkimer, the≈øe troops marched back; but as ≈øoon as I was informed of their march, I ordered them to remain in Tryon county, where they are ≈øtill, and I have ≈øeat up Colonel We≈øion's continental regiment to reinforce the≈øe; but, if I may be allowed to judge of the temper of General Herkimer and the Committee of Tryon county from their letters to me, nothing will ≈øatisfy them, unle≈øs I march the whole army into that quarter.</p>
                           <p>With deference to the better judgment of the Council of Safety, I cannot, by any means, think it prudent to bring on an open rupture with the ≈øavages at this time. The inhabitants of Tryon county, as you will have perceived by copy of ≈øome letters which I have had the honour to tran≈ømit you, are already too much inclined to lay down their arms, and <hi>take what terms the enemy may plea≈øe to afford them.</hi> Half of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia from this county, and the neighbouring State of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts, we have been under the nece≈ø≈øity of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øing, le≈øt the whole ≈øhould go, and I believe what are left will only remain a few days. The continental troops I have in this quarter are under three thou≈øand, and the enemy encrea≈øing with tories, who daily join them in very con≈øiderable numbers. Should we, in this ≈øituation, precipitate a rupture with the Indians, we ≈øhould probably involve our≈øelves in the mo≈øt inextricable difficulties. If I ≈øhould a≈øk the Indians for leave to build a fort at Onioquago, I am very certain that they would refu≈øe me, and prejudice us in their minds. I have hopes that they will meet me at Albany in a week or two. If they do, I ≈øhall be under no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions that they will join again≈øt us.</p>

                           <p>PART of the enemy continue at Skeen≈øborough, whil≈øt others of them are coming through Lake George. From intelligence I have received, they mean ≈øoon to approach us. I was in hopes we ≈øhould have been in better force to oppo≈øe them, but we have not three thou≈øand continental troops, as you will have ≈øeen by the la≈øt return tran≈ømitted, and about one thou≈øand five hundred militia, who are daily going off. If an accident ≈øhould happen to us, it would probably be ≈øaid by the people in the country that we had ten or twelve thou≈øand men, and that we are traitors or cowards, as it is with great indu≈øtry propagated that I and the general officers who were at Ticonderoga are. It is, however, a con≈øolation to me, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs will not condemn us unheard.

We had not a carpenter's tool left in this department, our whole ≈øtock having been lo≈øt at Ticonderoga.

In ≈øhort, Sir, I labour under a thou≈øand difficulties at pre≈øent for want of a ≈øufficiency of tools. Their complaint that the tools were taken from them is ju≈øt.

                           <p>I RETURNED here la≈øt night to meet ≈øome Indians, who are deputed to me on bu≈øine≈øs which they are to di≈øclo≈øe at twelve to-day. Our army is at Stillwater, twenty-two miles north of this, where we wi≈øh to make a ≈øtand, and will do it, if ≈øupported by militia, none of which are yet arrived, nor any on the march. General Burgoyne's head-quarters were at Fort Edward on the fourth in≈øtant, and I am informed that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes moving down in a few days. Great ≈øickne≈øs begins to prevail in our army, chiefly occa≈øioned, I believe, by living altogether on fre≈øh meat, we not having had any ≈øalted meat for about twenty days pa≈øt, there being next to none, nor any to be procured. The very little we have is kept for ≈øcouting parties.</p>
                           <p>At ≈øix this morning an expre≈øs arrived from Tryon county, advi≈øing me
<q>That General Herkimer march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 3d in≈øtant to ≈øupport the garri≈øon at Fort Schuyler; that on Wedne≈øday, between Ori≈øko and the fort, the militia were attacked, and, according to the information received, the militia entirely cut to pieces, the General killed, with mo≈øt of the field officers. The number of the enemy that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>e the attack is no wi≈øe a≈øcertained, but are thought to be very numerous. The fort, by all the accounts received, was attacked before the militia marched, but in what manner we know not; whether by Indians firing with ≈ømall arms at a di≈øtance, to confine our people within the fort, or whether their main body was near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced or not, I cannot ≈øay; therefore hope you will immediately ≈øend a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, or this quarter mu≈øt of cour≈øe fall into the enemy's hands, as the whole of the militia was in the engagement, except a few guards that were ≈øtationed in different places.</q>
This from Lieut. Col. Deygert of the militia, and I have not had a line from any one el≈øe on the ≈øubject. The garri≈øon, as the Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary General informs me in a letter of the 4th in≈øtant, is provided with 500 barrel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>THE ≈øituation of affairs in the we≈øtern quarter will detain me, at lea≈øt, until to-morrow. Fort Schuyler is inve≈øted, and has been ≈øo ≈øome days.</p>

                           <p>In vain have I exerted every nerve to procure a body of men to march to its relief. The militia of this county, in every part of it, are borne down by the tories.

Let me beg you to exert your≈øelves to the utmo≈øt ≈øpeedily to collect the militia of your county, and join General Learned. Upon your exertions the ≈øafety of our country greatly depends; and as the force ordered to your a≈ø≈øi≈øtance is re≈øpectable, I confidently hope that you will act with ≈øpirit, and manfully join in repul≈øing the enemy, which I have not the lea≈øt doubt but you will be able to effect, if your exertions are equal to your abilities.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>IT gives me great ≈øatisfaction that you have offered to go and conduct the military operations in Tryon county. You will plea≈øe to repair thither with all convenient ≈øpeed, and take upon you the command of all the continental troops, and ≈øuch of the militia as you can prevail upon to join your troops. Fort Schuyler being be≈øieged, you will ha≈øten to its relief, and I hope that the continental troops now in the county of Tryon, if joined by ≈øome of the militia, will be adequate to the bu≈øine≈øs. Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck is very well acquainted, not only with the country, but with many of the Indians, and will be capable of doing you good ≈øervice. Permit me therefore to recommend him to your attention.</p>
                           <p>Henry Glen, <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> is A≈ø≈øi≈øtant Deputy Quarter Ma≈øter General at Schenectady, to whom you will apply for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in waggons and batteaus. If you could procure ≈øuch a number of waggons as to convey the mens packs, it would greatly expedite your march. Orders are given to ≈øend on a ≈øupply of provi≈øions. You will, however, not be retarded on that account, as the country is capable of affording a ≈øufficiency for your troops.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Van Dyck will inform you of the names of the Colonels of militia in Tryon county, and although I have already written to General Herkimer and the General Committee of the county to draw forth their militia, yet it will be proper for you, as ≈øoon as you join the troops marched under the command of General Learned, to expedite expre≈ø≈øes, entreating that the militia may be collected at the German Flats by the time you may arrive there.</p>
                           <p>A ≈ømall regiment, commanded by Colonel Living≈øton, is at John's-Town. The inhabitants of Caghna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waga have offered to hold that po≈øt, if Colonel Living≈øton ≈øhould be ordered up. You will be better enabled to judge of the propriety of moving him when you arrive there, and will do what you judge be≈øt.</p>
                           <p>Although the Mohawk Indians are far from being friendly to us, yet it would greatly prejudice our cau≈øe if they were in≈øulted. You will therefore take every precaution to prevent it. The Oneidas have friendly ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents towards us, and mu≈øt be cheri≈øhed. They may perhaps be induced to take an active part in our ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Inclo≈øe you a warrant for one thou≈øand dollars in ≈øpecie, which you will plea≈øe to make u≈øe of in order to conciliate the Oneidas, and to induce them to a≈ø≈øi≈øt you. Be plea≈øed to a≈ø≈øure them that I wi≈øh to ≈øee them as ≈øoon as they can come down, and that I have provided a genteel pre≈øent for them.</p>
                           <p>The inhabitants of Tryon county are cheifly Germans, e≈øpecially tho≈øe at the German Flats. I think it would ≈øerve a good purpo≈øe to extol the action under General Herkimer, to prai≈øe their bravery, and give a≈ø≈øurances that you wi≈øh to be joined by men, who have ≈øo bravely defended them≈øelves. Compliment General Herkimer, and plea≈øe to make mine to him.</p>
                           <p>It is not only impo≈ø≈øible, but needle≈øs, to be more particular. I ≈øhall therefore only add that if Fort Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ≈øhould unhappily have fallen into the enemy's hands, that you will then ≈øo di≈øpo≈øe of the troops as be≈øt to cover the country.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered on a quantity of ammunition from Albany. If it is not yet gone, pray take it with you. I very much que≈øtion whether more lead can be ≈øpared, as none of that from Peek's Kill which was de≈øigned for this department is come up. If you ≈øhould think the quantity of powder I have ordered to be in≈øufficient, you can take more. It is be≈øt you ≈øhould carry it on with you.</p>

If St. John's ≈øhould not be reduced before the ≈øpring of the year, as I ≈øu≈øpect it would not, at I≈øle-aux-Noix three hundred men, under the command of a judicious officer, ≈øhould be left, with directions to fortify him≈øelf in the be≈øt manner he could. The re≈øt of the army ≈øhould then proceed towards St. John's, which I ≈øuppo≈øe the enemy would not abandon; and if it was found impracticable to form the ≈øiege, becau≈øe of the fro≈øt and ≈ønow, one thou≈øand men ≈øhould be left to blockade it. The remainder of the army ≈øhould then proceed to reduce Chamble, which would be the work of a day or two, and then go on to Montreal, and ≈øecure what ≈øtores might be left there by the enemy, and take all the merchandize that would be u≈øeful for the army, and ≈øend it to Albany, paying the French merchants a generous price by bills on France, if Congre≈øs has a fund there to draw on, as I have been informed they have, nothing to ≈øuch of the Engli≈øh as have been our enemies, when we were in Canada in 1775 and 1776. When at Montreal, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer will be able to judge with certainty what force the enemy can gather in Canada to oppo≈øe him, and, if he finds that he can ≈øpare a detachment, he ≈øhould lend it to O≈øwegatchie, to ≈øecure or de≈øtroy the enemy's ≈øhipping, which are always laid up at that place. This bu≈øine≈øs appears to me of the fir≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as it would not only be a great ≈øtep towards the reduction of Niagara, if Congre≈øs ≈øhould attempt in the next campaign to get po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of that very important pa≈øs, and which, if in our hands, would have a variety of ≈øuch obvious good con≈øequences that I need not mention them; but it would al≈øo be nece≈ø≈øary, in order to ≈øecure a retreat that way, which, if a retreat is nece≈ø≈øary, I would rather wi≈øh than by the way of Champlain, if St. John's ≈øhould hold out ≈øo long as that the enemy might ≈øend forces into Canada from New-York or el≈øewhere. It may be a≈øked, why I ≈øhould with a retreat by Ontario, and how it could be effected? To the fir≈øt I an≈øwer, becau≈øe mea≈øures may be taken to reinforce the army at their arrival at O≈øwego by troops from Albany, thence to proceed to the reduction of Niagara, if Congre≈øs thought proper; if not, they might return by the way of Fort Schuyler. To the ≈øecond, that all the batteaus in the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Montreal, might be collected, and tho≈øe would probably be ≈øufficient to convey all the troops, if not, an additional number might ≈øoon be con≈øtructed; and for that and other bu≈øine≈øs one hundred carpenters ≈øhould be ≈øent with the army into Canada. Nor ≈øhould the Commanding Officer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, when at Montreal, to take ho≈øtages from the Cagnawaga and Cana≈øwago Indians, who will be in his power, for their peaceable behaviour, and tho≈øe ≈øhould be ≈øent to the≈øe parts without delay. If St. John's

≈øhould be reduced, I think it is pretty certain that a body of troops appearing before Ticonderoga the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon would ≈øurrender, ≈øhould they not abandon it this fall, or on ≈øeeing our preparations for going into Canada. It would therefore be nece≈ø≈øary to collect a body of troops, not only for that purpo≈øe, if nece≈ø≈øary, but, if Ticonderoga ≈øhould be abandoned, to be ≈øent into Canada, to reinforce the army there in ≈øuch a manner as that the country might be kept, and, if po≈ø≈øible, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the≈øe troops, batteaus ≈øhould be built at Fort George, and begun upon as ≈øoon as advice is received that the army is got into Canada. But if the army ≈øhould be obliged to retreat, this expence may be thought needle≈øs. Not at all; for, if they retreat by Champlain, they may want boats; if by Ontario, the boats may be ea≈øily conveyed into Hud≈øon's river, and from thence into the Mohawk river, to carry on provi≈øions for the troops to go to Niagara, ≈øhould an expedition be determined on; but whether it is or not, it would be imprudent not to prepare in ≈øuch a manner as that troops might be ≈øent to Canada, if it ≈øhould be found nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                           <p>Congre≈øs will perceive that great exertions are nece≈ø≈øary for ≈øuch an enterprize, and that the officer who commands it, let him be who he will, will require a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. And although I firmly re≈øolve to quit the army as ≈øoon as the examination into my conduct ≈øhall be made, and not again venture on the boi≈øterous ocean of public life, in which I have been ≈øo mi≈øerably buffetted by ≈øtorms, yet, as a private gentleman, and without fee or reward, I will give every aid in my power to procure every nece≈ø≈øary, and make u≈øe of every exertion for the ≈øucce≈øs of the enterprize, if Congre≈øs ≈øhould think fit to order the attempt to be made.</p>

                           <p>ON the 12th of January la≈øt we did our≈øelves the honour to inform Congre≈øs of the re≈øult of our delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions re≈øpecting Indian affairs in this department. They will be plea≈øed to ob≈øerve, from the inclo≈øed copy of a letter from Mr. Deane, the Interpreter, that our opinion of the temper of the Senecas and Cayugas was but too well founded. Tho≈øe haughty nations cannot brook the di≈øgrace which they ≈øu≈øtained from the militia of Tryon county, under the late brave and worthy General Herkimer, near the German Flats, and from the Garri≈øon of Fort Schuyler, under the command of the gallant Colonel Gan≈øevoort. Their re≈øentment has undoubtedly been highly irritated by the infidious arts and bribes of our enemies, who, at a treaty held at Niagara, and which is ju≈øt concluded, have had an opportunity to give an edge to their animo≈øity. The On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondagoes we are apprehen≈øive will al≈øo be drawn in to manife≈øt the ≈øame ho≈øtile ≈øpirit. From the≈øe unfavourable circum≈øtances, there is too much rea≈øon to believe that an expedition will be formed again≈øt the we≈øtern frontiers of this State, Virginia and Penn≈øylvania, in concert with the Briti≈øh troops, Ottowas, Chippewas, Wio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is therefore, with the utmo≈øt anxiety, that we wait for the direction of Congre≈øs in an≈øwer to our la≈øt di≈øpatches, without which we ≈øhall be at an utter lo≈øs how to proceed. It is our opinion that vigorous preparations ought to be made, not only to defend the frontiers, but to cha≈øti≈øe tho≈øe nations, by carrying the war, if po≈ø≈øible, into their country. Till they feel the power and the ju≈øt re≈øentment of the United States, there can be no ≈øafety for the defencele≈øs inhabitants. The militia, who lo≈øt their leaders and many of their brave≈øt men at the German Flats, ≈øuffered the additional misfortune of being deprived of their crops. If they ≈øhould again be called upon in planting or harve≈øt time, their families mu≈øt be deprived of all ≈øub≈øi≈øtence. Indeed, they are very ≈øore from what they have already ≈øuffered, and want time to repair their pa≈øt calamities. Little therefore can be expected from their exertions, willing as they may be to give their aid. The Oneidas and Tu≈øcaroras are ≈øtill very friendly; but, ≈øo far from being capable of an active part, are under well grounded apprehen≈øions of falling victims to the rage of their ≈øavage neighbours. They call upon the United States, in who≈øe cau≈øe they took up the hatchet, and are in danger, to protect them, and it is become indi≈øpen≈øably nece≈ø≈øary to erect ≈øome fortre≈øs, and ≈øtation a ≈ømall garri≈øon in their country, for the ≈øecurity of their women and children. We flatter our≈øelves that the Commanding Officer of this department will have in≈øtructions to receive our information, and to make immediate preparations for the defence of the frontiers and protection of our allies. The garri≈øon of Fort Schuyler, which con≈øi≈øts only of one regiment, may be able to defend that fortre≈øs, but cannot repel the incur≈øions and ravages of the enemy; and, if it ≈øhould ≈øo happen that Tryon county and the we≈øtern di≈øtricts of Albany ≈øhould be de≈øerted, to ≈øay nothing of the di≈øtre≈øs of individuals, the difficulties of ≈øupplying the army with flour would be in≈øermount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The treaty will be held about the middle of the month. We cannot defer it long, and ≈øhall be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the utmo≈øt anxiety by the in≈øtructions from the Honourable Congre≈øs, which we hope are on the way, or will be handed to us by the return of this expre≈øs without lo≈øs of time. We mu≈øt, if left to our≈øelves, do the be≈øt in our power, making u≈øe of the liberty given Mr. Duane to alter the ≈øpeech, ≈øo that it may be adapted to circum≈øtances.</p>

                           <p>I DO my≈øelf the honour to inclo≈øe the proceedings of the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Indian affairs at the la≈øt treaty, held at John's-Town. The Board of Commi≈ø≈øioners intended to have addre≈ø≈øed the Honourable Congre≈øs in an official letter, which was prevented by the departure of Mr. Duane and Mr. Edwards, who were obliged by a ≈øudden thaw to ha≈øten from John's-Town before the bu≈øine≈øs of the Indians was compleated, left the ≈øwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rivers ≈øhould have prevented them from reaching their families.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Duane, the gentlemen mentioned in the minutes, as well as the Commi≈ø≈øioners, were unanimou≈øly of opinion that it was ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to threaten the ≈øavages with cha≈øti≈øement, as the only means left, ≈øhort of actual cha≈øti≈øement, to induce them to ob≈øerve a ≈øtrict neutrality.</p>
                           <p>Whether it will have the wi≈øhed for effect, the re≈øult of the Council to be held at Onondago, of which we expect to be informed in about forty days, mu≈øt determine. But, from the accounts received of their hitherto inimical di≈øpo≈øition and revengeful re≈øolutions, the gentlemen, I think, unanimou≈øly believed that ≈øuch of the Mohawks as have fled from their country, a majority of the Onondagoes, and the Cayugas and Senecas in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, will commence ho≈øtilities again≈øt us as ≈øoon as they conveniently can, and that it would therefore be prudent early to take mea≈øures to carry the war into their country, as it would not require a greater body of troops to de≈øtroy their towns than what would be nece≈ø≈øary to protect the frontier inhabitants, who already labour under the greate≈øt apprehen≈øions that they will ≈øoon experience the ravages and cruelty of tho≈øe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Since my return to this place, I have been honoured with a letter from the Legi≈ølature of this State, covering petitions from the inhabitants of Schohary, Cherry-Valley, Charlotte River, Delaware and Harper's Field, praying the Legi≈ølature for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. As it is not in the power of the Commi≈ø≈øioners to afford any aid to the≈øe expo≈øed ≈øettlements, I have communicated the contents of the letter and petitions to the Marquis de la Fayette, that he may take mea≈øures to enable the inhabitants to remain on their plantations.</p>
                           <p>Before I left John's-Town, an account which we had received that the enemy meant to take po≈øt at O≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wego was confirmed by the information of a tru≈øty Indian, whom I had rea≈øon to believe had good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for what he a≈ø≈øerted. Should this really be the ca≈øe, there will be little hope left that the Indians will remain neuter. I cannot avoid ≈øugge≈øting, that I ≈øu≈øpect the enemy intend to pro≈øecute the plan which the French began in 1753, and to approach our frontiers with a line of ≈øorts, from whence the Indians may be ≈øupplied with every nece≈ø≈øary, ≈øent out to harra≈øs us, and to which they may retire after an excur≈øion on our frontiers. As ≈øuch a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps the mo≈øt, if not the only, effectual means to defeat ≈øuch an intention of the enemy would be, by ≈øending a re≈øpectable army, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of O≈øwego, but to attempt the reduction of Niagara. The honourable Hou≈øe is too well aware of the various advantages that would re≈øult to the States from having that pa≈øs in our hands, for me to pre≈øume to point out even a ≈øingle one. I confe≈øs that ≈øuch an expedition would be attended with many difficulties, that many requi≈øites are to be procured, but if men and ≈øalted provi≈øions can be procured, I ≈øhould imagine every thing el≈øe might be got in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The enemy's ≈øhipping on Ontario might indeed prove trouble≈øome, but not ≈øo as to prevent the troops from cro≈ø≈øing. It is certain they were not able to do it in 1758, when Colonel Brad≈øtreet took Fort Fron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If Congre≈øs ≈øhould enter on ≈øuch a mea≈øure, perhaps it might be well to cover the real de≈øign by building the boats on Hud≈øon's River, and give out that they are intended for the more ≈øpeedy convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of troops up and down that river.</p>
                           <p>Reflecting that Congre≈øs might perhaps have in contemplation the reduction of Niagara, or an expedition into Canada through Ontario, I have engaged Louis (commonly called Colonel Lewis, a friendly Caghna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waga, and a man of enterprize, who is going into Canada by the way of O≈øwegatchie, with three or four tru≈øty Oneidas) to burn, if po≈ø≈øible, the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels on Ontario; if not, to attempt the de≈øtruction of tho≈øe at St. John's; and have promi≈øed a thou≈øand dollars in ≈øpecie as a reward, if the one or the other is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed. I hope for the approbation of Congre≈øs.</p>
                           <p>Louis, who expects to return in le≈øs than forty days, is al≈øo charged to bring me the mo≈øt exact account he can procure of the enemy's force in Canada, the po≈øts occupied by them, and the numbers at each po≈øt; to inform him≈øelf, if po≈ø≈øible, what military operations the enemy mean to pro≈øecute from Canada in the en≈øuing campaign, and to engage ≈øome of our Caghnawaga friends to give the earlie≈øt intelligence of the movements of the enemy, and of what provi≈øions and military ≈øtores may be ≈øent either to St. John's or up the St. Lawrence.</p>

                           <p>ON the 7th in≈øtant I received a packet, which I believe was di≈øpatched from your office, inclo≈øing ≈øeveral York-Town papers of the 24th ult. which contained copies of Lord North's ≈øuppo≈øed motion of the 17th of February, of the two hills in con≈øequence thereof, and the re≈øolutions of Congre≈øs thereon. I am peculiarly happy that the latter coincides ≈øo perfectly with the ideas I had entertained, declared and propagated of the former.

                           <p>If the bu≈øine≈øs at Onondago terminates according to our wi≈øhes, and that the Senecas are willing to enter into an alliance with us, I think no time ≈øhould be lo≈øt to bring them into the field; and therefore wi≈øh you to take mea≈øures accordingly, by having it hinted to them, that if a body of their warriors would join Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wa≈øhington it would be an evidence of their ≈øincerity, and an attonement for pa≈øt mi≈øconduct.</p>
                           <p>I think, if the re≈øult of the Council at Onondago is favourable, that a meeting with the whole Six Nations would not be improper, perhaps beneficial. I wi≈øh you to favour us with your opinion on this ≈øubject as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible.</p>

                           <p>I have thought it nece≈ø≈øary to advi≈øe the Six Nations of Indians of the Alliance with France, and of the rejection of the treaty propo≈øed by Britain.

                           <p>On the 25th in≈øtant I received a letter from Mr. Deane, on the 27th one from Mr. Kirkland, and ye≈øterday a ≈øecond from Mr. Deane, copies of which I have the honour to tran≈ømit you. The conduct of the ≈øavages is my≈øterious and embarra≈ø≈øing. The twenty Senecas mentioned in Mr. Deane's la≈øt letter as coming down with a pri≈øoner are expected in a few days. I propo≈øe detaining them here until the pri≈øoner I wrote for ≈øome time ago arrives from the ≈øouthward. Whil≈øt the≈øe people are with us, I do not apprehend that any ho≈øtilities will be committed by the others on the frontiers of this State, and perhaps Congre≈øs may think it expedient to order troops to be ≈øent up before they return. I think one thou≈øand men, with half the garri≈øon of Fort Schuyler, ≈øuch militia as may be procured in Tryon county, and ≈øome of the Oneidas and Tu≈øcaroras, would be quite ≈øufficient to burn the Cayuga Town and ≈øome of the Seneca Villages.

                           <p>Congre≈øs will be plea≈øed to pardon me, if I pre≈øume to ob≈øerve that the object of the expedition, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the cha≈øti≈øement of the Senecas only, does not ≈øeem to be broad enough, as the Cayugas are equally in≈øo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I have taken the liberty to inclo≈øe General Gates copy of a letter la≈øt night received from Mr. Deane (copy of which I have al≈øo the honour herewith to tran≈ømit to Congre≈øs) and ob≈øerved that, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation it contained, the pro≈øecuting of the expedition with all po≈ø≈øible di≈øpatch ≈øeems to have become now more indi≈øpen≈øibly nece≈ø≈øary.</p>

                           <p>I do not know if General Gates will con≈øider him≈øelf at liberty to order Colonel Gan≈øevoort's regiment as part of the troops for this ≈øervice.

               <p>Major General St. Clair being ≈øworn,</p>
               <p>Q. by General Schuyler. During the time I had the honour of having you under my command, did you ever ob≈øerve any neglect of duty in my conduct?</p>
               <p>A. None. As far as it fell within my ob≈øervation, I have ≈øeen the direct contrary.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's que≈øtion. If I had been in Ticonderoga during the ≈øiege, what would have been the probable con≈øequences?</p>
               <p>A. The immediate con≈øequences, it appears to me, mu≈øt have been, that the re≈øt of the department mu≈øt have been neglected; becau≈øe your post ought to have been at or near Albany, to have collected the nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to have urged on the militia for the aid of the whole. Ticonderoga was at a corner of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in an uninhabited part of the country, and the communication to it from any part of the country (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept New-England) acro≈øs a Lake.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's que≈øtion. Upon any alarm, did I turn out my≈øelf and the troops with any degree of alacrity?</p>
               <p>A. Whenever there was an alarm, and I was pre≈øent, I have always ≈øeen you do it with great alacrity, and you were always pre≈øent your≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What did you under≈øtand the intention of the order of Congre≈øs was, in appointing you to the command of Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I under≈øtood it was that I ≈øhould take the command of that po≈øt, ≈øubject to the orders of General Schuyler, or the Commanding Officer in the Northern Department; but I did not expect that he, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer, was per≈øonally to have taken the command of that po≈øt from me.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's que≈øtion to Major Lan≈øing. Were you at Fort Edward with me immediately after the evacuation of Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's que≈øtion. Did you at that time, or at any time before or ≈øince, ob≈øerve any negligence in my conduct with re≈øpect to public matters?</p>
               <p>A. I did not; but at that time, and at every other time before and ≈øince, I ob≈øerved in you the greate≈øt attention to public matters, as far as came within my ob≈øervation.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's que≈øtion. Did I not, immediately after I returned from Ticonderoga, on being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the approach of the enemy, make application to the State of New-York, and to the other States, to endeavour to get out the militia?</p>
               <p>A. You did to the State of New-York and to the Ea≈øtern States, except Rhode-I≈øland, immediately on your return to Saratoga, on being informed of the enemy's approach.</p>
               <p>After the examination of the above witne≈ø≈øes, the General clo≈øes his Defence as follows:</p>
               <p>It is incumbent on me to remark that the ob≈øervation made by the Judge Advocate, that I went to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga in con≈øequence of General St. Clair's letters of the 13th or 18th June, is founded in error, which will appear by a retro≈øpect of my letter to Congre≈øs of the 14th from Saratoga, in which I expre≈øly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them that I arrived at that place on the evening of the 13th, on my way to Ticonderoga, and that at twelve I received an expre≈øs from General St. Clair, with his letters of the 13th.</p>
               <p>Permit me, Mr. Pre≈øident, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial, briefly to ob≈øerve, that from the beginning of November, 1776, to the latter end of March following, which was a month after I was ≈øuperceded, my exertions to prepare for the campaign of 1777 were without intermi≈ø≈øion. That immediately on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment I returned to Albany, and adopted every po≈ø≈øible mea≈øure to provide the nece≈ø≈øaries for the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, to procure intelligence of the enemy's intentions, and to conciliate the affections, or guard again≈øt the ho≈øtile intentions, of the Indians; that within eight days after my arrival at Albany I went to vi≈øit Ticonderoga and the northern communication, that I might be per≈øonally informed of what was nece≈ø≈øary to be provided or done; that I was on the point of doing the like to Fort Schuyler and the we≈øtern commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, when General St. Clair's letter arrived, advi≈øing me of the approach of the enemy; that I lo≈øt not a moment's time in applying for reinforcements both of continental troops and militia; that I was on the way to put my≈øelf at the head of the ≈ømall body of militia which had moved, when I received the account of the evacuation of Ticonderoga; that after that my exertions to prevent or retard the enemy's progre≈øs were without intermi≈ø≈øion, and not without ≈øucce≈øs, until I was, unhappily for me, no longer permitted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the military operations in the Northern Department; that from that time until this day I have never cea≈øed affording every aid in my power to give ≈øucce≈øs to the glorious cau≈øe America is engaged in.</p>
               <p>Here, Gentlemen, I ≈øhall re≈øt my defence. It has indeed been prolix, but important. Facts and plain narrative, not declamation, have made it ≈øo. My whole conduct has been, with the utmo≈øt candour, ≈øubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your examination, and I hope the re≈øult of this enquiry will re≈øtore me to that full confidence, which, at lea≈øt, the rectitude of my intentions gives me rea≈øon to expect. I forbear dwelling on the cau≈øes to which its diminution is to be a≈øcribed, le≈øt I ≈øhould be ≈øu≈øpected of a de≈øign rather to reproach than explain. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be time event, permit me to a≈ø≈øure you that my affection for my country will continue unimpaired,

and that among the late≈øt actions of my life will be found the mo≈øt ≈øincere endeavours to promote her pro≈øperity.</p>
               <p>I cannot di≈ømi≈øs this ≈øubject, without acknowledging my obligations for the candour and patience with which I have been heard, or without expre≈ø≈øing the high ≈øen≈øe I entertain of the attention of his Excellency the Commander in Chief, in in≈øtituting ≈øo re≈øpectable a Court on my trial.</p>
               <p>THE Court, having con≈øidered the charge again≈øt Major General Schuyler, the evidence, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, are unanimou≈øly of opinion that he is NOT GUILTY of any Neglect of Duty in not being at Ticonderoga, as charged, and the Court therefore do acquit him with the highe≈øt honour.</p>
