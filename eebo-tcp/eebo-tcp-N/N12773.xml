            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>OCTOBER <hi>1</hi>ſt.</head>
               <p>THE Preſident, Members, and Judge Advocate being duly ſworn, the Court proceed to the trial of Major General Schuyler, who appears, and the following charge (contained in a report of a Committee of Congreſs, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and ſtate charges, againſt the General Officers, who were in the Northern Department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated) is exhibited againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neglect of Duty,</hi> in not being preſent at Ticonderoga to diſcharge the functions of his command, from the middle of June, 1777, until it was no longer poſſible to maintain Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores, when he ſhould have cauſed a retreat to be made for the preſervation of both,—under the 5th article of the 18th ſection of the Rules and Articles of War.</p>
               <p>Major General Schuyler, being deſired to plead, ſays, I admit that I was abſent from Ticonderoga from the 24th of June to the concluſion of the ſiege, but I beg leave to inſiſt, and doubt not ſhall be able to prove, that I was guilty of no neglect of duty in not being there.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate obſerves, That Major General Schuyler having been appointed to command the Northern Department (including Albany, Ticonderoga, Fort Stanwix, and their dependencies) he was, by Congreſs, on the 22d of May, 1777, releaſed from all reſtraint reſpecting the eſtabliſhment of his Head-Quarters.</p>
               <p>That, by letters to him from General St. Clair, Commanding Officer at Ticonderoga, dated the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1ſt of July, 1777, he was informed of the deſigns, ſtrength and advance of the enemy againſt Ticonderoga, and of the great danger in which that poſt and Mount Independence would be, in caſe of an attack.</p>
               <p>That it appears, in conſequence of the letters of the 13th and 18th of June, he went to Ticonderoga; for on the 20th he there held a Council of War. That, although in this Council of War it was determined that the effective rank and file were greatly inadequate to the defence of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, but that nevertheleſs both poſts ought to be maintained as long as poſſible, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores, and that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient, and that the repairs and additions to them ought to claim immediate attention, yet General Schuyler made no ſtay at Ticonderoga, to expedite the works on Mount Independence, and to cauſe a retreat to be made, when it became no longer poſſible to maintain the poſts, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores; for his abſence appears from General St. Clair's letter to him on the 24th of June, and thoſe that followed.</p>
               <p>That, Ticonderoga and Mount Independence being the poſts of greateſt defence to the United States againſt the advance of the Britiſh forces from Canada, and the main army of the Northern Department being ſtationed at thoſe poſts, it was General Schuyler's duty to have been at the head of that army, and to have remained there, when he knew the enemy were actually advanced againſt it. That his forces were greatly inadequate to the defence of the poſts, and that they were to be abandoned in the moment when it ſhould become no longer poſſible to maintain them, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores, a moment, of which it was neceſſary the firſt-officer in the department ſhould judge.</p>
               <p>That, in the abſence of General Schuyler, this critical and important moment paſſed unobſerved or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved; for on the 6th day of July the poſts were abandoned, with the loſs of the ſick, ammunition, cannon, proviſion and cloathing of the army, and the loſs of many lives in the retreat.</p>
               <p>The Judge Advocate produces a copy of a reſolution of Congreſs, dated March 6, 1776; a copy of a reſolution of Congreſs, dated May <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>HERE follows the ſubſtance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken priſoners by one of our parties on Onion River.</p>
                           <p>That General Burgoyne is arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the Britiſh army is aſſembling as faſt as poſſible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is ſaid to conſiſt of about ten thouſand men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John Johnſon, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River, whilſt the reſt of the army under General Burgoyne croſſes the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the incloſed letter to General Sullivan) is all on the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at fartheſt.</p>
                           <p>From the nature and circumſtance of the paſs granted to one of the two, which I here incloſe, and his own account of the manner in which he was ſent from Montreal, viz. to ſearch plans of the country which he pretended to know were hid at Metcalf's, and his being poſſeſſed of a conſiderable ſum of continental money, and ſome gold and ſilver, I have the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicion of his being a ſpy, and have ſecured him as ſuch, and ſent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him yourſelf, and that, if you ſhould think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, ſhould he be found guilty, the ſentence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer who lately ſuffered a ſpy he had in charge to eſcape, through the groſſeſt miſconduct, has been honourably acquitted by a Court Martial.</p>
                           <p>You will likewiſe find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen ſent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circumſtance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if theſe fellows have really been ſent by him to ſee what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an eaſy reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwithſtanding be genuine, and Amſbury ſays it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a ſeparate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he ſeemed unwilling to part with, and which I ſuppoſe to have been a private ſignal by which he was to be known upon his return.</p>
                           <p>If the enemy intend to attack us, I aſſure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of the continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, excluſive of Baldwin's artificers 140, and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Beſides theſe there are three regiment of Hampſhire militia, engaged for no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time, and who go off whenever they pleaſe, 150 are gone ſince laſt return; two regiments of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with ſome of them is already expired. Amongſt the number returned ſick there is no doubt but many would be uſeful in caſe of neceſſity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this diſagreeable detail, but I have ſomething worſe to add to it.—We cannot increaſe our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commiſſary's return, and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for ſeven weeks only on the ground, and he has no proſpect of any ſupply of ſalt-meat, but from ſome place near Still-Water, nor of freſh, but by ſending to New-England for it.—This I have deſired him to do, but muſt own I have little proſpect of advantage from it; for be aſſured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very eaſily be cut off.—I have heard of ſome cattle below Crown-Point, which I ſhall ſend for to-morrow.</p>
                           <p>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy troubleſome job.—The caſſoons, Colonel Baldwin ſays, will be ſunk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower ſide of them, which will ſerve as a kind of ſecond boom, and retard at leaſt, if not prevent, the enemy's veſſels from paſſing, ſhould they attempt it.</p>
                           <p>A magazine of wood ſhould be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a ſtick upon the Mount.—All the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwiſe be neceſſary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purpoſes.—What can the Quarter-Maſter mean by leaving this place, where ſo many works are to be carried on, without ſo neceſſary an article as draught cattle?</p>
                           <p>The tents here are in general very bad. I muſt beg you, my dear General, to haſten up the new tents, for I ſhall get no good of the troops here in any way, whilſt they remain in barracks.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="5" facs="unknown:016142_0004_0F9B8E5D69B36A40"/>Our powder magazines are in ſo wretched a ſtate, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In ſhort, every thing is ſo much out of order, that I will add no more to this liſt of grievances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</p>
                           <p>When I write again, I hope to have ſomething more agreeable to entertain you with, and am, with much eſteem.</p>

                           <p>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and ſtores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is ſo drained I thought it needleſs to aſk for any from him, as he has almoſt literally nothing.</p>
                           <p>Since my laſt I have had conſtant ſcouts out, but have made no diſcovery of the enemy, ſave that four of their veſſels are lying about a mile on the hither ſide of the Split Rock; they conſiſt of two ſhips, and two gondolas; and on Friday laſt a ſchooner beat up within four miles of Crown Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</p>
                           <p>Yeſterday about noon we had two men, who had ſtrolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of ſavages, who had ſtole down to the road ſide betwixt M'Intoſh's and the bridge, and concealed themſelves in the buſhes; they were immediately purſued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be overtaken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, however, they fell in with a ſcouting party I had ſent down to diſcover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and ſcalped, and one miſſing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</p>
                           <p>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned laſt night on diſcovering a large party of Indians on the eaſt ſide of the lake about four miles above Crown Point. I think of ſending to feel their pulſe to-night, as I am ſure it would be of conſequence to give theſe fellows a drubbing.</p>
                           <p>I am at a loſs to form a judgment of the deſigns of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indiſcreet to put us on our guard by ſuch a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the ſavages to come on, unleſs they had an army not far off to ſupport them. Be that as it will, I ſhall uſe every precaution poſſible againſt ſurprize, and will endeavour to penetrate their deſigns. The ſame reaſon, notwithſtanding our weakneſs, ſtill prevails againſt calling for the militia as when I wrote laſt, having as yet received no ſupply of meat either freſh or ſalt.</p>
                           <p>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was raiſed. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promiſed his people that they ſhould have the ſame bounty as the troops of the State in which they were raiſed, notwithſtanding they were not part of their quota. This promiſe has not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I am making ſome improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga ſide have ſuch dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our preſent numbers hold both. I deſign, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and, after defending Ticonderoga as long as poſſible, retreat to Mount Independence.</p>
                           <p>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have ordered them to Albany. <hi>I am, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016142_0005_0F9B8E5E83043398"/>
of batteaus and ſome gondolas—that ſome of the troops come over frequently, and ſay their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the reſt of their veſſels and ſtores, when they are to attack this place.</p>
                           <p>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their deſign is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harraſs us, and give confidence to their ſavages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by ſome regular troops. Were they in force, it is improbable they would waſte their time at ſuch a diſtance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refreſh themſelves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the eaſt ſide.</p>

                           <p>I had all the ground between this and Crown Point, from the lake ſome diſtance over the mountains, well examined yeſterday with a heavy ſcout, but they diſcovered no enemy, nor appearance of any. Whitcomb ſays he is certain there has not been an Indiain but three in that quarter ſince the priſoners were taken, and that it was three or four days ſince theſe three had been there; ſo that the Indians ſaid to have been about us, and fired at, were, I believe, the children of a diſturbed imagination.</p>
                           <p>You had an exceeding bad time to croſs the lake, but I hope you got well over, and without any injury to your health, though it muſt have been expoſed, as I doubt if you was not obliged to be out a ſecond night.

Laſt night two of their veſſels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are ſeven lying at that place; the reſt of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns diſtinctly at different places. They have alſo debarked ſome troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at Crown Point my ſcout-boat did not diſcover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpoſe, on account of their ſhipping; but I have ſent a party on this ſide the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a juſt account of their ſituation.</p>

I have thoughts of calling for the Berkſhire militia, which are neareſt to us, and will probably be the moſt alert to come to our aſſiſtance, becauſe they are in ſome meaſure covered by this poſt; but on that I ſhall conſult the other General Officers. This, however, is clear to me, that we ſhall be obliged to abandon this ſide, and then they will ſoon force the other from us; nor do I ſee a retreat will in any ſhape be practicable. Every thing, however, ſhall be done, that is poſſible, to fruſtrate the deſigns of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred.

They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before yeſterday, and killed and dreſſed the cattle; and it is ſuppoſed that to-night they will be at the new road near Caſtle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeenſborough. They reported that a very large party had gone on the weſt ſide of the Lake, to fall upon Fort George. That is ſaid to conſiſt of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</p>
                           <p>We have alſo had juſt now another attack at the Mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The ſcene thickens faſt, and Sunday next, it ſeems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We muſt make the beſt we can of it, and I hope at leaſt to cripple them ſo as they may not be able to purſue their fortune, ſhould it declare in their favour.</p>
                           <p>I ſent a party down laſt night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me ſome uneaſineſs. I hope, however, they are ſafe, and will bring me ſome intelligence of conſequence. I have ſome thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the worſt, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many left to become priſoners.</p>
                           <p>I have ſent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to deſire that all they can poſſibly ſpare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</p>

                           <p>MY ſcout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It conſiſted of three men only, the beſt of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for that purpoſe. The woods are ſo full of Indians, that it is difficult for parties to get through. I ſhall ſend off Whitcomb himſelf

preſently, for intelligence I muſt have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, leſt he ſhould fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no ſmall deſire to have him in their power.</p>
                           <p>I ſent Colonel Warner to the Grants yeſterday, to raiſe a body of men to oppoſe the incurſions of the ſavages that are gone by Otter Creek, and have ordered him to attack and rout them, and join me again as ſoon as poſſible. I am very happy to find the country were apprized of the march of that party before Col. Warner got to Skeenſborough, as it will probably prevent their ſucceſs, and may end in their ruin.</p>
                           <p>We are going on with the neceſſary works on the Mount as faſt as poſſible, and have removed the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable of the ſtores and proviſion to that ſide. The bridge is in very little more forwardneſs, to appearance, than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will finiſh the getting timber for it. The boom is likewiſe placed, but very feebly ſecured for want of cables.</p>
                           <p>A party of Bradford's arrived yeſterday in very good ſeaſon, and has had a pleaſing effect upon our people, who, never the moſt lively or gallant, began to ſhow ſigns of dejection already. How they may hold out, God knows, but this has raiſed their ſpirits a little.</p>
                           <p>I could wiſh the batteaus were all over ſoon, or that you would not ſend them. I am extremely apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that the enemy will poſſeſs themſelves of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I cannot find a ſingle perſon, on whom I can depend, to venture amongſt them for intelligence; but from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclude that they are either in full force, or very weak, and hope by letting looſe the Indian, to intimidate us. I incline to believe the laſt, but have as yet no certain rule to go by. However, we muſt know ſoon, and it is ſaid they have marked to-morrow to attack. I beg leave to refer you for further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to Colonel Varrick, who takes the charge of this, and am,</p>

                           <p>THIS morning ſome of the enemy's gun-boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could ſee them diſembark a number of men, and the boats increaſed to eighteen, which are now lying abreaſt from the hither ſide of the point to about half way acroſs the Lake. The batteaus in which they tranſported their troops are not come in ſight, lying on the far ſide of the point, under cover of it.</p>
                           <p>Soon after their landing, a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, puſhed towards our lines. As we had a ſcout down the Lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately ſent out two parties to ſupport and bring them off. The ſcout fell in with the enemy, and after a few ſhot, in which they ſay ſome of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, diſperſed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greateſt part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that ſome of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but they were occaſioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</p>
                           <p>My people are in the beſt diſpoſition poſſible, and I have no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, ſhould they think proper to attack us; and if the perſon I mentioned to you in my laſt purſues the opportunity that now preſents itſelf, they will go back faſter than they came on. He has above 1000 men.</p>

I have ordered a feu-de-joye upon the occaſion, and will find ſome way to communicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to the enemy. We have now two ſhips, eighteen gun-boats, and three ſloops, lying off the Three Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the Point, and retrenching it.

General Schuyler requeſts the advice of the Council on the premiſes.</p>
                           <p>The Council, having taken into their moſt ſerious conſideration the ſeveral matters ſtated in the firſt article, are clearly and unanimouſly of opinion,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First.</hi> That the number of troops now at this poſt and Mount Independence, which are under 2500 effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defence of both poſts.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Second.</hi> That both poſts ought, nevertheleſs, to be maintained as long as poſſible, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the troops and ſtores.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Third.</hi> That if it ſhould become neceſſary to evacuate one or other of the poſts, and that it remains in our election which, that it ought to be the Ticonderoga ſide.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourth.</hi> That ſuch cannon and ſtores as are not immediately neceſſary on the Ticonderoga ſide be removed, without delay, to Mount Independence.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fifth.</hi> That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient; and that the repairing the old, and adding new works, ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be directed to repair and make the neceſſary fortifications.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sixth.</hi> That the obſtructions in the Lake to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off all ſupplies, or preventing a retreat, if ſuch a meaſure ſhould unhappily become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, ought to be compleated with all imaginable diſpatch.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventh.</hi> That ſo much remains to be done effectually to compleat the obſtructions, that, with the few troops we have, there is no great probability that it can be done in leſs than ſix weeks.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eighth.</hi> That although our forces may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unleſs a ſufficient ſtock of proviſion can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days proviſion of meat kind, we think it would be imprudent to expoſe the army to be made priſoners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prudent to provide for a retreat; to effectuate which, that all the batteaus now at this poſt be immediately repaired, and as many as can be ſpared out of Lake George be brought hither.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ninth.</hi> That a quantity of proviſion of the meat kind ſhould, if poſſible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or elſe-where.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Tenth.</hi> That immediate application be made to his Excellency General Waſhington for a reinforcement to be ſent on with all expedition.</p>

                                 <desc>•••</desc>
                              </gap>d article of what General Schuyler laid before the Council, being read, and ſome alterations made, was agreed to by the Council, and reſolved ſhould be ſent to Mr. Livius.</p>
                           <p>That the ſentence of the Court Martial on Caleb Runnels, a ſoldier in Captain Miller's company, in the regiment lately commanded by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Patterſon, be carried into execution. On the ſubject of Captain Whitcomb's corps of rangers, the Council recommend that they be informed, that General Schuyler will immediately lay a ſtate of the caſe before the Honourable Continental Congreſs, and take their direction; that if Congreſs ſhould not allow them the bounty given by the Eaſtern States, they will be diſcharged, agreeable to their contract.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>June</hi> 21<hi>ſt.</hi> General Schuyler informed the Council, that only four men of Captain Whitcomb's corps were willing to continue in the ſervice, unleſs the bounty given by the Eaſtern States was allowed them, and begged the farther opinion of the Council on the matter, who, taking the matter again into conſideration, unanimouſly reſolved, that, conſidering the weak ſtate of the garriſon, the great uſe which experience has evinced the corps is of, eſpecially at this critical juncture, when the enemy have ſo many parties of Indians in the vicinity of this poſt, the information given by Captain Marſhall and Captain Alredges, which is hereunto annexed, the probability that either the State of New-Hampſhire or the Maſachuſſetts-Bay would be willing to ſtand charged with the extra bounty, provided this corps were conſidered as part of their quota, it would be adviſeable to pay the bounty, and they recommend it ſhould immediately be done.</p>

               <p>Major General Schuyler proceeds in his Defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS Courts Martial may, with propriety, be conſidered not only as Courts of Juſtice, but alſo as Courts of Honour, I am happy that my conduct is to be examined, and its merits aſcertained by this. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſolation conſcious rectitude may afford me and others, who have reaſon to complain of calumny and detraction, I am ſtill too ſenſible of the value of reputation to myſelf and family, not to wiſh for the eſteem of thoſe who merit commendation, and, particularly, to poſſeſs the good opinion of thoſe great and good men, to whoſe virtuous exertions, in the Council and the Field, America will be indebted for Liberty, Independence and Security.</p>
               <p>The charge againſt me is ſimple, and confined to one point, and the evidence adduced to ſupport it is comprized in very little compaſs. I wiſh the nature of my defence would admit of equal conciſeneſs. But, gentlemen, it will be neceſſary to remind you, that, to invalidate a charge of neglect, inſtances of attention and care muſt be produced, and, of conſequence, that may defence will principally conſiſt of a detail of facts, and neceſſarily be prolix. Permit me therefore to entreat your patience, and to aſſure you that I will ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avoid calling your attention to any matters, either of evidence or argument, but ſuch as ſhall appear to me eſſential to the elucidation of the important queſtion you are now to determine.</p>
               <p>On the 19th day of June, 1775, Congreſs did me the honour of appointing me a Major General in the American army, and ſoon after to the command of the Northern Department, in which I was ſuperſeded in the month of February or beginning of March, 1777, and reſtored to it on the 22d day of May following, and again ſuperſeded in it on the 20th day of Auguſt, in the ſame year. Within the laſt mentioned period Major General St. Clair was, by Congreſs, appointed to take charge of the ſorts at Ticonderoga. Thoſe ſorts were inveſted on or about the firſt day of July, and evacuated on the ſixth day of July, 1777. During the whole time of the ſiege, I am charged with having been abſent, and therein of having neglected my duty. To this charge I am now to anſwer. But as the readineſs or reluctance, of perſons accuſed, to come to trial, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally creates preſumptions for or againſt them, which become, with great propriety, part of the evidence on which their acquittal or condemnation will reſt, I beg leave previouſly to lay before you certain facts and papers, from which not only my willingneſs, but ſolicitude, for a trial will evidently appear.</p>
               <p>As the loſs of Ticonderoga was ſenſibly felt by all America, and had occaſioned much reſentment as well as ſurprize, I preſumed that this enquiry would have been made as ſoon as the neceſſary information and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be obtained, and therefore the reſpect due to Congreſs reſtrained me from preſſing it until near two months after the date of their order had elapſed. After this I took the liberty of writing to Congreſs ſundry letters on the ſubject, of which the following are extracts. The receipts of all which, except that of the 4th of November and 26th of January, were either acknowledged by the Honourable Preſident of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or by reſolutions founded on the ſubject matter of the letters, from whence the extracts, were drawn.</p>

                     <p>WHEN a man of ſentiment, labouring under odious and injurious ſuſpicions, has in proſpect a period which promiſes to afford him relief, and reſtore quiet to his mind, it is natural that he ſhould anxiouſly wiſh for its arrival. The conviction of a good and a clear conſcience leaves not a doubt in my mind, that the reſult of the enquiry into my conduct will have that effect, and reſtore me to the full confidence of ſuch of my honeſt countrymen as have been led away by popular clamour, and that I ſhall ſtand confeſſed the ſincere and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate friend of my country. Congreſs will therefore pardon me, if I am importunate on this ſubject. I have ſuffered ſo much in public life, that it cannot create ſurprize if I anxiouſly wiſh to retire, and pay that attention to my private affairs, which the loſſes I have ſuſtained by the enemy, and the derangement occaſioned by devoting all my time to the duties of my offices, have occaſioned; and yet the impropriety of reſigning them, before the enquiry has taken place, or the Committee reported my innocence, is too ſtriking to need dwelling upon.</p>

                     <p>THE weakneſs of the Board of Commiſſioners, and the diſtance at which two of the members reſide from hence, has frequently obliged General Schuyler and Mr. Douw ſolely to tranſact the buſineſs. General Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott has little hopes that he will be able to attend the next conference, and General Schuyler thinks it probable that he ſhall before that be favoured with the orders of Congreſs, to attend at Head Quarters for the enquiry into his conduct. On theſe accounts, it is neceſſary that the Board ſhould be ſtrengthened, eſpecially as the buſineſs of the approaching treaty is highly intereſting.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE already treſpaſſed on the patience of Congreſs, but I feel myſelf obliged to intreat their attention a moment longer. Eight months have already nearly elapſed ſince the appointment of the Committee to enquire into the cauſes of the loſs of Ticonderoga, and no report as yet made. What I have ſuffered in the interim, although ſupported by an approving conſcience, will be more eaſily conceived by every man of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, than deſcribed by any. Let it ſuffice for me to obſerve that to a man, far from being indifferent as to the manner in which his character may be handed down to poſterity, the reflection that he may be called from the ſtage of life before his ſuperiors have juſtified him to the world, or before he has had an opportunity given him to do it himſelf, creates the moſt diſagreeable feelings, and theſe, if poſſible, encreaſed by the reflection that a young family may be deeply injured, and the ſuppoſed guilt (however unjuſt the ſuſpicion) of the father embitter the lives of his children. Let me then moſt humbly intreat Congreſs, that the Committee may be ordered to report without delay; and permit me to beg of you, Sir, to adviſe me, by the return of the expreſs which carries this, of the determination of the Honourable Houſe.</p>

Indeed, the delay has been extremely injurious and chagrining to me, and has moſt effectually operated as a puniſhment much more ſevere than I deſerved, even if the error in judgment with which I am charged had really exiſted, which I by no means can avow. I do not, however, wiſh to have it underſtood that the delay was intentional. Indeed, I ſtill retain the ſame opinion, which I have expreſſed in one of the letters I have quoted, that I was confident it was not the intention of Congreſs, or of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to let me remain in the diſgraceable ſituation I was in longer than abſolute neceſſity required; but I impute that delay to the vaſt variety of important objects, which claimed the attention of the Repreſentative Body of the United States towards the cloſe of laſt campaign, during the winter, and ſubſequent ſpring, and which might juſtify them in ſacrificing the feelings of an individual to the more weighty concerns of the United States.</p>

                     <p>IT is with the utmoſt ſatisfaction, that the Congreſs received your information of the ſurrender of Montreal, and the general ſucceſs which has attended the American arms in the province of Canada.</p>
                     <p>They are ſenſible of the various obſtacles you had to encounter, and have unanimouſly reſolved, that your conduct, attention and perſeverance, merit the thanks of the United Colonies, which I have now the pleaſure of preſenting to you.</p>
                     <p>The Congreſs hear, with concern, your requeſt of leave to retire. They regret the injuries your health has ſuſtained in the ſervice, and beg you will not inſiſt on a meaſure, which would, at once, deprive America of the future benefits ſhe expects from your zeal and abilities, and rob you of the honour of compleating the glorious work you have ſo happily and ſucceſsfully begun.</p>
                     <p>You have hitherto riſen ſuperior to a thouſand difficulties, in giving freedom to a great and oppreſſed people. You have already reaped many laurels, but a plentiful harveſt ſtill invites you. Proceed therefore, and let the footſteps of victory open a way for bleſſings of liberty, and the happineſs of well ordered govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to viſit that extenſive dominion.</p>
                     <p>Conſider! that the road to glory is ſeldom ſtrewed with flowers, and that, when the black and bloody ſtandard of tyranny is erected in a land poſſeſſed by freemen, patriots ceaſe to remain inactive ſpectators of their country's fate.</p>
                     <p>Reflect, Sir, that the happineſs or miſery of millions yet unborn is now to be determined, and remember that you will receive an honourable compenſation for all your fatigues, in being able to leave the memory of illuſtrious actions, attended by the gratitude of a great and free people, as a fair, a ſplendid, and a valuable inheritance to your poſterity. I have the honour to be, with the greateſt reſpect and eſteem, Sir,</p>

               <p>But as the winter previous to the ſiege of Ticonderoga, included in this period, was the ſeaſon of preparing for the enſuing campaign, and as the commencement of that campaign proved unfortunate, and many have from thence inferred that due preparations were not made for it, I think it of importance that my conduct relative to it ſhould be made known to you.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper to remark, that the campaign, on our part, was to be merely defenſive. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the plan for the defence are contained in the following extract of a letter to a Committee of Congreſs, appointed to viſit the Northern Department, &amp;c.

                     <p>AGREEABLE to your requeſt, I do myſelf the honour to communicate to you my opinion of what preparations I conceive neceſſary to be made the enſuing winter, and what meaſures to be adopted, effectually to prevent the enemy from penetrating into this country by the Northern or Weſtern communications. If the enemy are not able to diſlodge our troops from Ticonderoga, or penetrate to the Mohawk River this fall,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016142_0011_0F9B8E62ABFD5A40"/>
they will probably attempt an expedition in the winter, Canada being able to furniſh them with ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſleds as will ſuffice to tranſport all their artillery and proviſion, if their number ſhould be 10,000; nor will our garriſons of Ticonderoga or Fort George be any obſtacles, as they can eaſily paſs by the former in ſleds, at ſuch a diſtance as to be out of the reach of our cannon, and the latter is too inſignificant to make any reſiſtance, ſo as much to retard their progreſs. It is therefore of the laſt importance, that as much of the army as can be kept together ſhould be cantoned in the vicinity of this place, of which the enemy will be informed, and it will probably deter them from the attempt. But, ſhould they remain quiet in Canada until next ſpring, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they will then make the moſt vigorous exertions to penetrate either by Ticonderoga, or, what is much more likely, by Fort Stanwix. Both communications, therefore, claim our attention.</p>
                     <p>The fortifications at Ticonderoga ſhould, in my opinion, be as much contracted as poſſible, and a fort built on Mount Independence, to cover batteries near the Lake ſide, and the redoubt on the Ticonderoga ſide, ſo as that the paſs may be defended with a few men. The navigation ſhould be effectually ſtopped by ſinking caſſoons at ſmall diſtances, and joined together by ſtring pieces, ſo as, at the ſame time, to ſerve for a bridge between the fortifications on the eaſt and weſt ſides. This work ſhould be executed in the winter. But as theſe fortifications would not prevent the enemy from drawing their ſmall craft over land, from beyond the Three Mile Point, into Lake George, the paſſage of that lake ſhould alſo be obſtructed, either by caſſoons from iſland to iſland in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt a part of the army is employed in this ſervice, another body of troops ſhould be ſent to Fort Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wix, to ſtrengthen that fortification, and to make ſome others, at ſuch places near the Mohawk river as may be deemed beſt for the purpoſe of retarding the enemy, ſhould they make themſelves maſters of Fort Stanwix. And that we may be well prepared, and every department put in order, I conceive it neceſſary that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of artillery ſhould be directed to procure every neceſſary in his department, that we may not have to ſeek it when the campaign opens.</p>
                     <p>That the chief Engineer be directed to do the like.</p>
                     <p>That the Quarter Maſter General do the ſame.</p>
                     <p>That the like order be given to the Commiſſary General.</p>
                     <p>That all the battraus now on Lake Champlain and Lake George ſhould be put into the beſt repair as early as poſſible, in the months of February or March at fartheſt.</p>
                     <p>That one hundred batteaus be built in thoſe months at Schenectady.</p>
                     <p>That a quantity of boards and plank ſhould be collected at Fort George.</p>
                     <p>That a ſufficiency of pitch, oakum, and whatever may be neceſſary for building and repairing veſſels, floating-batteries or batteaus, be collected, and carried to Fort George, Fort Ann, Skeenſborough and Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectady, in the courſe of the winter.</p>
                     <p>That proviſion for 5000 men, for eight months, be immediately brought to Albany, and carried in the winter to Fort Ann; a like quantity to remain in ſtore at Albany, to be ſent to the weſtward, if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. This is a matter that ought immediately to be attended to, and therefore a ſufficient quantity of ſalt ſhould directly be ſent to Albany.</p>
                     <p>That a large train of artillery, both heavy and light, ſhould be ſent, in the courſe of the winter; part to remain at Albany, and as much as may be neceſſary for Ticonderoga and Fort George to be ſent there. This muſt be done in winter, at once to ſave a vaſt expence, and that we may not be embarraſſed in the ſpring with the tranſportation of articles ſo extremely difficult to move.</p>
                     <p>That a Laboratory ſhould be eſtabliſhed at Albany, to fix all the ammunition neceſſary for the campaign.</p>
                     <p>That fifteen companies, to conſiſt of a Captain, or Overſeer, and thirty men, be engaged for the batteau ſervice, and to be employed on the highways, and other neceſſary works in the Quarter-Maſter General's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. It not only ruins ſoldiers to employ them in ſuch buſineſs, and is more expenſive, but alſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the army too much.</p>
                     <p>That four companies of carpenters, to conſiſt of an Overſeer and 25 each, be engaged to attend the army. If more are occaſionally wanted, they can be procured in Albany or its vicinity. I have taken the liberty to encloſe a liſt of ſome articles, that may be abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The duty of the Pay-Maſters ſhould be clearly pointed out to them. Who is to appoint Pay-Maſters to thoſe regiments who yet have none?</p>
                     <p>What is to be done with the remainder of Livingſton's, Hazen's and Duggen's Canadian corps, and with the Canadian refugees now in Albany?</p>
                     <p>Are Nicholſon's and Elmore's regiments to be compleated? If ſo, who is to grant warrants for recruiting them?</p>
                     <p>The bedding for the troops ſhould be ſent as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Be ſo good as to ſend me a draft of Schuylkill ferry ſcows, with their dimenſions. I wiſh to have this as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>If ſilled woollen caps could be procured at Philadelphia, a quantity-ſhould be ſent up to the army.</p>
                     <p>Glaſs for the barracks is much wanted.</p>
                     <p>Altho' the enemy's fleet on Lake Champlain is formidable, would it not be well to conſtruct very large and ſtrong veſſels this winter? If Congreſs ſhould reſolve on doing it, a very large number of carpenters ſhould be ſent up immediately, and guns and carriages provided.</p>

                           <p>THE duties of your office, by much the moſt difficult to fulfil of any in the army, are ſo many, and depend ſo much on circumſtances, which no one can poſſibly foreſee, that only general rules can be laid down for your conduct in the execution of it. Great diligence, activity, prudence and foreſight, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, as you will ſoon experience. A cloſe attention to your duty is the only means of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfect knowledge of it. I ſhall, however, ſketch out a few directions.</p>
                           <p>The ſupplying the army with proviſions, when they are delivered to you by the Commiſſary General, is a capital part of your buſineſs; and as it muſt be done partly by water, and partly by land, it demands a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye to keep a proper number of boats and carriages at each ſtation. The proviſion goes from hence in batteaus to Half-Moon, from whence it is conveyed in carriages to Stillwater. There it is again embarked in batteaus, and tranſported to the Saratoga Falls. Thence by land acroſs a ſmall portage. Thence by water to Fort Miller Falls. Then acroſs a ſmall carrying-place by land, and again by water to Fort Edward. Then by land to Fort George or Fort Ann. From the former by water to the north end of Lake George, and by land to the Saw Mills, whence it is conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. If it goes by the way of Fort Ann, it is there put in batteaus, and conveyed down Wood Creek to Skeen's Falls, and rolled acroſs a ſmall portage to the ſouth end of Lake Champlain, and conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. Between this and Half Moon eleven batteaus are now employed, carrying from 160 to 170 barrels. As the days are now ſhort, the batteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will not be able to make a trip a day, unleſs they are diſpatched by ſun-riſe every morning. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incumbent on you to ſee that done, and that it may not be detained at Half Moon, 34 waggons, at leaſt, ſhould be daily employed between that and Stillwater. Seventeen batteaus are now employed in carrying it from Stillwater to Saratoga Falls. Theſe muſt make two trips in three days. Two waggons are employed at that place and four batteaus, to convey it to Fort Miller, each making three trips.</p>
                           <p>At Fort Miller two waggons are employed, and from thence twelve batteaus convey it to Fort Edward, where 70 waggons muſt be conſtantly employed in tranſporting it either to Fort Ann or Fort George, from whence the troops are to carry it on, which you muſt take care to ſee done. The leaſt reflection will point out, that if at any one ſtation the proviſion is detained, all above it are idle. To keep all going together is therefore indiſpenſably neceſſary, and will frequently require your perſonal inſpection.</p>
                           <p>Providing quarters for the troops is another part of your duty, and furniſhing thoſe quarters with every neceſſary muſt be done without delay.—2500 men will remain at Ticonderoga,—about 400 at Fort George,— 400 at Fort Edward,—1000 at Saratoga,—500 at Albany,—100 at Skeenſborough,—100 at Fort Ann,—500 at Schenectady,—200 at John's-Town,—100 at the German Flats,—and 400 at Fort Schuyler,—making in the whole 6200. For all theſe bedding, or ſtraw at leaſt, is to be furniſhed, fire-wood and barrack utenſils, ſuch as pails, tongs, ſhovels, trammels, axe, and kettles. Theſe are to be delivered to the Barrack-Maſter, who is to be accountable for them.</p>
                           <p>When troops march, all carriages are to be furniſhed by you. Indeed, you are to furniſh carriages and veſſels for whatever belongs to the army, except the carriages for conveying the cannon, although you muſt find the cattle to draw them.</p>
                           <p>A ſtock of fire-wood muſt be immediately laid in here, for the uſe of the troops, and the barracks put into the beſt repair. Directions are given by me for erecting the barracks at the other places.</p>

You will continually keep ſcouting parties on the Lake, as long as the ſeaſon will permit it to be navigated, and when that is no longer practicable, parties muſt be kept out on both ſides of the Lake, to give the earlieſt intelligence of the approach of an enemy. You will pay the ſtricteſt attention to your guards and centinels, and puniſh ſeverely the leaſt remiſſneſs in a duty, on which the ſafety of the ſorts and troops ſo imminently depend.</p>
                           <p>Proviſions are forwarding to you in very conſiderable quantities, and I have ordered ſuch a ſtock to be laid in before the navigation ſtops, as will maintain your garriſon for three months, and long before that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended a freſh ſupply will be ſent on. A very conſiderable quantity of vegetables will be forwarded to you, as ſoon as the troops that are retiring into winter quarters are paſſed this place. Bedding is alſo preparing, and will be ſent you as ſoon as poſſible, together with a number of iron ſtoves, which I have ſent for, to be put up in your barracks, for the greater comfort of the men.</p>
                           <p>You well know of what importance it is, that the greateſt attention ſhould be paid to the health of the men. Cleanlineſs in their perſons and quarters, and having their victuals properly dreſſed, are capital p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The chief Engineer is likewiſe to make a return of every article in his department, and his wants for an army of 10,000 men. Major Hay will make a like return, and the Commiſſary one of what proviſion he has in ſtore. If ſoap and candles are wanted, he muſt immediately apply to Mr. Avery for them.</p>
                           <p>You will pleaſe to order all the batteaus between you and Skeenſborough, and from every other part of the lake, to be collected and drawn out of the water.

                           <p>AS I have not been honoured with a line from Congreſs, on the ſubject of the preparations neceſſary for the next campaign in the Northern Quarter, altho' I tranſmitted my opinion on the ſubject in the beginning of November, I conclude that the enemy's manoeuvres in Jerſey have ſo entirely engroſſed their attention, that they have not been able to attend to what I ſuggeſted. I have therefore reſolved, without waiting any longer for their directions, as the winter is ſlipping away, to carry into execution whatever I deem eſſential to the ſervice, and which does not admit of further delay, of which, amongſt other things, that of procuring a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of cannon for the defence of Ticonderega, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a capital article. I ſhould therefore be glad to know what cannon you can furniſh me with, and where I may ſend for them, as I wiſh that an article, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to move in the ſpring of the year, ſhould be carried to the places for which they are deſigned whilſt we are favoured with good ſledding. A very conſiderable quantity of ſhot is alſo wanted; and as Mr. Livingſton's furnace is out of blaſt, I cannot procure them there. Can theſe be got at Saliſbury, and when? Beſides the cannon for the forts, a number will be wanted for five or ſix ſtout gallies which I propoſe to build in Lake George, to prevent the enemy's penetrating by that Lake, if they ſhould be able to diſlodge us from the Ticonderoga ſide of Lake Champlain, and draw their boats by land into Lake George, which it would be poſſible for them to do, altho' we keep poſſeſſion of Mount Independence. By the way of Skeenſborough, I am morally ſure they will not be able to penetrate; as I hope, in the courſe of the winter, ſo effectually to obſtruct the Lake, between Ticonderoga and the Mount, as that no kind of veſſels will be able to paſs, unleſs they firſt make themſelves maſters of Mount Independence, which I think will be impoſſible, if we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men, cannon and ammunition. A ſtock of proviſion I ſhall take care to lay in this winter.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Simmonds, with part of his regiment, from the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, is on his way from hence to Ticonderoga. I ſhall be extremely happy to ſee a ſucceſſion of troops coming on, for I very much fear that the garriſon will not be detained after the term of their enliſtment expires.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall want two companies of carpenters, to conſtruct the veſſels intended for Lake George. Captain Leſter and Captain Winſlow gave good ſatisfaction laſt campaign, and I wiſh them to be employed in that buſineſs. Permit me to beg the favour of you to enquire of them, if they will each raiſe a company, ſo as to leave Connecticut about the firſt day of April. As Fort George is an extremely healthy place, they will, in all probability, not ſuffer ſo much by ſickneſs as they did at Skeenſborough.</p>
                           <p>I have the pleaſure to inform you that I have received friendly meſſages from the Indians, who ſeem deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to obſerve a ſtrict neutrality.</p>

                           <p>By a letter from the Honourable General Ward, of the 16th inſtant, which I alſo received laſt night, I find that I am to expect no cannon from your State. There are none in this, nor can I procure any from Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania or Jerſey. I am not yet adviſed what Connecticut can afford me, but I am confident it will be greatly ſhort of our wants. I therefore wiſh the Legiſlature of your State would reconſider the matter, and ſupply me with all the cannon you poſſibly can. I muſt alſo entreat that as much powder, lead and cartridge paper may be ſent, as can be collected in your State; and as theſe articles are much eaſier and cheaper moved in winter than they can be at any other time, I ſhall hope that they will be forwarded without delay.</p>
                           <p>The cannon, if any are furniſhed, might be carried directly to Ticonderoga, where the Aſſiſtant Deputy Quarter-Maſter General will pay the expence of tranſportation. The powder, lead and cartridge paper to this place.</p>

                              <p>I have been diſappointed in procuring two tons of ſteel from New-Jerſey, and it is an article ſo eſſentially neceſſary that it cannot be diſpenſed with. Pray be ſo good as to ſend me that quantity, or rather three tons, if it is to be had.</p>

                           <head>Extract of a letter to Congreſs, dated Albany, <date>December <hi>30, 1776.</hi>

                           </head>
                           <p>THAT I have not been honoured with the commands of Congreſs, on the various matters mentioned in my former letters, and in a paper which I delivered Meſſrs. Stockton and Clymer on the 11th ult. is moſt probably to be imputed to the neceſſity it has been under, of giving the cloſeſt attention to the manoeuvres of the enemy in Jerſey. This conſideration, and that of the winter's being conſiderably advanced, has induced me to proceed in making ſuch preparations for the next campaign as I deem eſſentially neceſſary, without waiting the determination of Congreſs, truſting that Congreſs will readily pardon any <hi>ſaux pas</hi> I may commit from erring in judgment.</p>
                           <p>On the 3d inſtant I addreſſed myſelf to General Ward, on the ſubject of cannon and military ſtores. From the copy of his letter, which is incloſed, Congreſs will perceive that I am not likely to receive any aid from the Maſſachuſetts-Bay. I have, however, ſince the receipt of his letter, which was received on the 29th inſt. written by expreſs to the Honourable Thomas Cuſhing, entreating that the Legiſlature of that State would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider the matter, and furniſh what cannon, &amp;c. they can, and urged the neceſſity of their being ſent whilſt the earth is covered with ſnow, as a great expence in the tranſportation will be ſaved by theſe articles being carried to Ticonderoga in winter. I have made ſimilar applications to Governor Trumbull, and the Preſident of New-Hampſhire, and I propoſe in a few days to viſit the Convention of this State on the ſame ſubject; for indeed, unleſs a ſufficient number of cannon and ammunition can be procured, we muſt inevitably loſe Ticonderoga, and what the conſequences of ſuch a diſaſter will be are too evident to dwell upon.</p>
                           <p>I have cauſed ten blackſmiths ſhops to be erected in this city, and have engaged workmen to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making intrenching tools, axes, nails, &amp;c. and hope, with the aſſiſtance of the ſmiths in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to get a ſufficient ſtock of thoſe neceſſary articles, provided I can any how procure a quantity of ſteel, for which I have applied to the Maſſachuſetts-Bay; but left none ſhould be ſent from thence, I muſt again entreat Congreſs to order three tons from Pennſylvania or Jerſey, with all the diſpatch poſſible.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered all the proviſions that can be procured to be ſent to Fort George, Cheſhire's and Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga. I fear a deficiency of ſalted meat, of which a ſufficient ſtock ſhould be laid in, as it would be riſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much to depend on the precarious ſupply of freſh beef, at a time when the fortreſſes may be inveſted by the enemy.</p>
                           <p>Forage is laying in for the cattle, which it will be neceſſary to employ in the ſpring, both at Ticonderoga and on the communication to it.</p>
                           <p>Directions are given for repairing the batteaus on Lake Champlain and Lake George, and for building one hundred and fifty, adapted to the navigation of Hudſon's and the Mohawk rivers and Wood creek. Should the enemy be able to force us from Ticonderoga, it will be poſſible for them, although we keep poſſeſſion of Mount Independence, to get into Lake George, by drawing their batteaus over land from below Ticonderoga; for although the taſk would be arduous, yet it is feaſable, and ought to be guarded againſt. I therefore propoſe to build five or ſix flat bottomed veſſels, of conſiderable force, on Lake George, and ſhall begin to prepare the neceſſary articles in the beginning of February, unleſs Congreſs ſhould pleaſe to direct other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and about the ſame time I propoſe to begin the neceſſary work of obſtructing the navigation of Lake Champlain, between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, which I hope to execute ſo effectually, as not to leave a poſſibility for any kind of craft to paſs whilſt we keep poſſeſſion of the latter place, and which <hi>I think we can do againſt any force whatever, provided we have a ſufficient garriſon, properly ſupplied with cannon, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and proviſion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A conſiderable quantity of cordage and oakum is wanted. If it cannot be ſupplied in this State, I ſhall ſend to Eaſtern ones, and ſo indeed I muſt for many articles that will be wanted. I wiſh therefore a reſolution of Congreſs, directing every State to comply with my applications in whatever they can.</p>
                           <p>The Indians have ſent me a friendly meſſage, and I have great hopes that they will abide by the neutrality they have promiſed to obſerve. A report prevails that the enemy have requeſted the Mohawks to remove into the country, beyond our ſettlements, but I have reaſon to believe that it is void of foundation. I ſoon expect a viſit from a conſiderable number of Chiefs and Warriors. They are in great diſtreſs for blankets. Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately we have none here. I have applied for ſome to the Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-Hampſhire, and may probably receive ſome from thence.</p>
                           <p>The Legiſlature of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay have ordered one-fourth of the militia of the country of Berkſhire, and one-eighth of that of Hampſhire, to Ticonderoga, to continue three months in ſervice. Part of one regiment is marched from the former. What the whole number will be, from both, I cannot make a gueſs at. No troops are yet arrived here from Connecticut, nor can I learn that any are got to Ticonderoga from Hampſhire, neither was any part of Colonel Warner's regiment there on the 26th; and Colonel Wayne adviſes me that he has no hopes of any troops remaining after the term of their enliſtment expires, unleſs it be the Pennſylvanians, who, he believes, will not quit the poſt until regularly relieved. For three weeks, or perhaps a month to come, we have little to fear from an enemy, but as after that Lake Champlain will be paſſable, it is probable they will make an attempt, as I am well informed that they have two regiments at St. John's, three at Iſle-aux-Noix, and a ſmall body, as an advanced poſt, at Iſle-la-Motte; and I conjecture that they would hardly keep ſo many troops at thoſe places, if they did not meditate a winter expedition. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of importance that the garriſon ſhould be ſtrengthened, and have therefore repeated my former applications for aſſiſtance to the Eaſtern States Thoſe of Van Schaick's and Ganſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>voort's regiments, that are raiſed, are under orders to march to Fort Edward, Fort George, Cheſhire's and Skeenſborough; but I fear the garriſons of thoſe places will have left them before the relief gets there, which is detained through want of blankets, which I am trying to collect from the inhabitants in this city and county.</p>
                           <p>The non-commiſſioned officers and privates of Colonel Nicholſon's regiment are all engaged in other corps, to ſerve during the war, or for three years, and the officers mentioned in the incloſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> are unprovided for. I beg the direction of Congreſs with reſpect to them.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Livingſton has given me a liſt of ſome officers, copy of which I incloſe for the approbation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Perhaps ſome of Nicholſon's officers might be provided for in Livingſton's.</p>
                           <p>Moſt of the men in Colonel Elmore's regiment would re-engage for the war, ſome have already done it; but I have inhibited the recruiting officers of other corps to enliſt any more of the men, as they are ſtill to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016142_0017_0F9B8E672F4F6B70"/>
ſerve to the middle of April, and that Congreſs may perhaps order that regiment to be kept up, that there may not be ſo many officers unprovided for.</p>
                           <p>I wiſh to know the pleaſure of Congreſs on the ſubject the ſooneſt poſſible.</p>
                           <p>We are greatly at a loſs for iron rods, to make nails out of. If I knew where to procure them, I ſhould not trouble Congreſs.</p>
                           <p>If any cannon are to come from Pennſylvania, as I believe there muſt, for I have very little proſpect of getting a ſupply elſewhere, I wiſh them to be ſent whilſt the ſnow continues on the ground.</p>
                           <p>The Pay Maſter General informs me that he has very little caſh left. A ſpeedy ſupply will be neceſſary, as ſuch a variety of articles are to be purchaſed, and ſo much tranſportation to be paid for.</p>
                           <p>The Regimental Pay Maſters will ſtand in need of very explicit inſtructions for the rule of their conduct. I take the liberty again to mention the neceſſity of ſending them very ſoon, leſt the accounts of the new army ſhould get involved into that variety of confuſion which has attended the old. If they do not arrive ſoon, I ſhall take the liberty to do it for thoſe in this department.</p>
                           <p>Much as I wiſh to do myſelf the honour to pay my reſpects to Congreſs, yet ſo much is to be done here, and no other general officer in the department, that it would not be prudent for me to quit it at this conjuncture.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Pallefier was ſo bent on going to Congreſs, and importuned me ſo much on the occaſion, that I conſented, on his promiſe to return before the expiration of January. I hope he will not be permitted to tarry beyond that time.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered the director of the hoſpital to lay in a ſufficient quantity of medicine and neceſſary ſtores for the hoſpital. He will find it extremely difficult to procure them; I therefore wiſh, if poſſible, that ſome may be ſent from Philadelphia.</p>
                           <p>Be pleaſed to accept the compliments of the ſeaſon, and may every ſucceeding one bring with it an increaſe of happineſs to America is my firſt wiſh.</p>
                           <p>As I do not chuſe to riſk this letter by the common expreſſes, I have thought it neceſſary to ſend an officer, and Captain Bloomfield, a very deſerving one, of Colonel Dayton's regiment, is the bearer of this.</p>

                           <p>YOUR influence with the Caghuawaga and St. Francois Indians gives me reaſon to believe that you may procure intelligence, by means of thoſe people, of the enemy's intentions either this winter or next ſpring.

You will promiſe any perſons you may employ in this buſineſs a generous and adequate recompence, and they will have no cauſe to repent, if they leave the reward to my generoſity. But if they ſhould not chuſe what they may term a precarious reward, you will make the beſt terms you can.</p>

Your father informed me that you are employed by Congreſs, together with another gentleman, whoſe name had ſlipped his memory, to purchaſe cloathing, &amp;c. and adviſed me to diſpatch an expreſs to you, requeſting an immediate ſupply. You and your colleague will therefore pleaſe to forward to Albany 1500 ſuits of cloathing, and, if poſſible, double that number of blankets, as a very conſiderable quantity of the latter are wanted for our Indian allies. Should any Indian goods come to your hands, or you be able to purchaſe them, you will alſo pleaſe to ſend to Albany 5000 l. worth.</p>
                           <p>The difficulties we labour under for want of all theſe articles is inconceivable, and greatly injures the ſervice. You will therefore pleaſe to make uſe of your beſt exertions to expedite a ſupply.</p>

                           <p>I AM honoured with your diſpatches of the 30th ult. which were delivered me yeſterday, on my arrival at this place. Congreſs will pleaſe to reſt aſſured, that my beſt endeavours ſhall be exerted to carry into execution their intentions, conveyed in the ſeveral reſolutions tranſmitted me, part of which I have already anticipated, as you will obſerve in a letter which I had the honour to addreſs you on the laſt ult. or firſt of this month, and forwarded by Captain Bloomfield.</p>
                           <p>It is with great pain that I ſee no proſpect of procuring the neceſſary artillery for the defence of Ticonderoga, and for arming the veſſels to be conſtructed on Lake George. By the incloſed copy of a letter from Governor Trumbull, you will perceive that I cannot flatter myſelf with the hopes of receiving all the cannon Congreſs has ordered in the reſolution of the 28th ult. but, ſhould they even be ſent, we ſhall ſtill want a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number in addition; nor ſhould we be deſtitute of a competent number of field pieces, left the enemy ſhould change their route, and attempt an invaſion by the way of Oſwego.</p>
                           <p>Apprehenſive that applications to the different States, for the many articles which are wanted, would be attended with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>o much delay, I ſome days ſince diſpatched Mr. M'Carty to the Eaſtern States, to procure a number of articles which I enumerated, and amongſt which were cordage and oakum. He gave me great hopes that he ſhould be able ſpeedily to accompliſh his commiſſion. Colonel Baldwin and Major Stevens, who left me early in December, had orders to procure whatever they could in their reſpective departments.</p>
                           <p>The reſolution, inveſting General Waſhington with ſuch ample powers, will certainly be attended with very ſalutary effects to our common cauſe, and ſeemed indiſpenſibly neceſſary at this critical conjuncture. It will therefore doubtleſs meet with the approbation of every good American.</p>
                           <p>The Continental money is ſinking with an alarming rapidity in this State; but as I doubt not but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof will enter ſpiritedly into meaſures conducive to prevent ſo alarming an evil, I hope ſoon to find its credit re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
                           <p>As it is of great importance to be well informed of the enemy's intentions, I have made ſeparate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to two perſons in Canada, in whoſe friendly ſentiments to the cauſe of America I have the fulleſt confidence, and have promiſed them a generous recompence, to furniſh me from time to time with the beſt intelligence. I have alſo directed Colonel Bedel, whoſe influence with the Caghnawaga and St. Francois In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians is very conſiderable, to attempt to gain information by their means. By receiving of it in three different channels, we ſhall be better enabled to judge of the truth or fallacy of what is given us by any of them.</p>

This is to be underſtood as excluſive of what may be expended, between this day and the firſt of May next, by 3000 men. One thouſand barrels of beef or pork, and a like quantity of flour, and the ſmaller ſpecies in proportion, ſhould be lodged at Fort George, excluſive of what may be neceſſary for a garriſon of 200 men to the firſt of May.

All this proviſion muſt be procured in ſuch time, as that it may be ſent up to the places above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned whilſt it can be carried in ſleds, as it will be impoſſible to tranſport it in the ſpring. You are therefore not to loſe a moment's time in procuring it, and give conſtantly notice to the Deputy Quarter Maſter General, that he may convey it away as faſt as you can procure it.</p>
                           <p>A farther ſtock for 5000 men for eight months is, by the reſolutions of Congreſs, to be laid in at this place, and you will alſo provide eight months proviſion for 500 men, to be ſent to Fort Schuyler, and cauſe it to be ſtored at Schenectady.</p>

                           <p>YESTERDAY I received ſundry papers from Colonel Elmore and Mr. Kirkland, copies whereof I do myſelf the honour to encloſe.</p>
                           <p>The ſalt ſprings, mentioned in Mr. Kirkland's letter, No. 1, I conceive might be improved to advantage, if perſons acquainted with the proceſs of making ſalt were ſent up, and furniſhed with proper boilers. It is an article ſo extremely ſcarce here, that I fear a deficiency of ſalt proviſion for the army in this Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſpecimen which Mr. Kirkland mentioned to have ſent me is not come to hand.</p>
                           <p>The information contained in No. 2 is alarming, but by a cloſe attention to it, and purſuing proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the intention of the enemy, I perceive, may be fruſtrated. I ſhall immediately ſend up what Mr. Kirkland recommends, as neceſſary to rekindle the council fire at Onondago.</p>
                           <p>I have Indians, more or leſs, every day with me, complaining of the want of cloathing, blankets eſpecially, of which we have not one. I clearly perceive that our cauſe will be moſt eſſentially prejudiced, unleſs a large ſtock of Indian goods be immediately ſent here. To tranſact buſineſs with Indians at any time is a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable taſk, to do it with empty hands greatly encreaſes the difficulty.</p>

                           <p>YOUR Excellency's favour of the 18th inſtant I had the honour to receive on the 28th. I cannot plead that buſineſs, altho' I am cloſely employed, has been the only motive that I have not latterly done myſelf the pleaſure to write you. I well know that every moment of your time muſt neceſſarily be engroſſed in thoſe affairs, which, from your immediate ſituation, muſt claim the earlieſt attention. I therefore contented myſelf with writing to Mr. Harriſon; but I fear either his or mine have miſcarried, as I have not been favoured with an anſwer to mine of the 3d and 21ſt ult. I hope your Excellency has received mine of the 15th and 25th, each incloſing one to Congreſs.</p>
                           <p>Your ſucceſs in the Jerſeys has greatly inſpirited the people in this quarter, and the ſituation to which you have driven the enemy, affords us the pleaſing hope that we ſhall ſoon hear you have reaped freſh laurels.</p>
                           <p>I have not the leaſt doubt, ſhould General Carleton leave us unmoleſted this winter, which I really do not believe he will, that he will puſh very early in the ſpring, and he may come in the latter end of April. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, therefore, the army ought to be at Ticonderoga. <hi>I do not think it ſhould conſiſt of leſs than</hi>
10,000 <hi>men, beſides</hi> 1000 <hi>for the ſeveral paſts on the communication, and as many for Fort Schuyler and the other poſts on the Mohawk river.</hi> With theſe I think we ſhall have nothing to fear, provided we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſupplied with cannon, ammunition and proviſion.</p>

forty or fifty tons of tin is in the continental ſtores at Boſton, together with a number of blankets, cloathing, &amp;c. but that the ſtore-keepers adviſed him that none could be iſſued without the immediate order of Congreſs.

                           <p>I have borrowed fifty thouſand dollars from this State, and conſiderable ſums from individuals, for the public ſervice, all of which is already expended, and ſtill every department is deeply indebted.

                           <p>As the garriſon of Ticonderoga is daily weakening, and that I have no proſpect of a ſpeedy reinforcement, I ſhall not dare to ſend the cannon to that place, which are expected from Saliſbury with the firſt ſledding, but order them to be left at Fort George and Cheſhire's.</p>
                           <p>No ammunition of any kind is yet arrived here, nor do I know where to procure it. His Excellency General Waſhington cannot furniſh me with any from Jerſey.

                           <p>I WROTE you yeſterday, but forgot to mention to you to give the Indians intended for Canada an account of the ſucceſs of our arms; for altho' I have done it here, yet I wiſh you to repeat to them, that after the enemy had obliged our people to leave Long-Iſland and New-York, they attempted to get us between them and the ſea, in order to cut off our ſupplies, but although they tried all ſummer to do this, they were not able to effect it. They then took a fort of ours, ſituate upon York Iſland, where we could not come to its relief, becauſe their ſhips of war prevented us. As ſoon as they had taken this fort they marched into New-Jerſey, and as moſt of General Waſhington's army was gone home, the ſoldiers term of enliſtment being expired, he was obliged to retreat before them to Trenton; but, having collected ſome troops there, he fought them on the 26th of December, as is already related. On the 3d of January he purſued them, and fought them at Princeton, twelve miles on this ſide of Trenton. There he killed near three hundred, and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two hundred priſoners. He has ſince that taken ninety-five loaded waggons, and five empty ones, alſo eighty-four war horſes, and upwards of two hundred priſoners. The enemy are now at Brunſwick, and they cannot get away, except by flying to their veſſels, becauſe General Waſhington and Monſieur Fermoy, a General from Old France, and General Putnam, each with a body of troops, ſurround them.</p>

                           <p>A SNOW has happily fallen, which will greatly facilitate the tranſportation of the various articles that ought to be ſent to Fort George and Cheſhire's, for the reaſons mentioned in my former orders; but as the winter ſeaſon is ſo far advanced, that we have no reaſon to expect the ſledding will laſt much longer, I muſt again entreat you to loſe no time. The cannon from Saliſbury muſt claim your firſt attention. All the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching tools already made ſhould be forwarded without delay. Whatever proviſions the Deputy Commiſſary General may have in ſtore here, or elſewhere, ſhould be immediately ſent on, as alſo the oars, ſcoops, and other utenſils for the batteaus on the Lakes. The forage which will be wanted ſhould be ſtored as I have directed. Carpenters muſt, without delay, be ſent up to repair the batteaus on both Lakes and at Skeenſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, together with pitch, oakum, and every neceſſary for the purpoſe. The cordage for the veſſels to be built at Fort George ſhould alſo be there. In ſhort, every article in your department, that can be procured, ſhould be ſent up without the leaſt delay; for beſides the extra expence of tranſporting theſe articles in ſpring, when the roads are bad, you will, I fear, not be able to accompliſh it with all the wheel carriages you will then be able to procure, and the probable conſequences will be, that our army at Ticonderoga will be obliged to leave it, for want of the neceſſary ſupplies. You are therefore bound, by every conſideration, to leave nothing undone a moment, which it is poſſible for you to do, that we may not experience all the evils which would conſequently enſue from an evacuation of Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>Vaſt quantities of boards and timber will, in all probability, be wanted, as well for the army in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as for that which may be ſtationed in the ſouthern parts of this State. Proviſion ſhould therefore be made to procure them. And as the proprietors of mills find it impoſſible to procure workmen to cut and draw logs, ſuch of the fifteen companies of batteaumen and labourers now raiſing, and that can be firſt got ready, ſhould be employed in cutting timber, and ſleds procured to draw it to the mills.</p>
                           <p>The roads between this and Fort Edward, and from thence to Fort George and Cheſhire's, alſo claim your early and ſerious attention, and timber ſhould be drawn for cauſewaying where it is neceſſary, and for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bridges where they may be wanted. To depend upon croſſing Hudſon's river at the two ferries, McNeal's and Jones's, with what ſcows are now there, is too precarious. At each place two good ſcows muſt therefore be immediately conſtructed.</p>
                           <p>In ſhort, all that I have at any time ordered that you ſhould ſend up, purchaſe or cauſe to be made, ought to be done with the utmoſt diſpatch; for, if it is not, the buſineſs that will croud upon you ſo vaſtly when the campaign opens will involve you in inextricable difficulties.</p>
                           <p>A quantity of rum ſhould be purchaſed by you for the artificers employed in your department, that you may not labour under difficulties on that account.</p>
                           <p>I entreat you to pay the cloſeſt attention to every part of your department, that the public may reap the advantage of your exertions, and you the honour thereof.</p>

                           <p>THE Honourable Continental Congreſs, by a reſolution of the 28th December laſt, have ordered,
<q>That a fort be conſtructed on Mount Independence; that the navigation of the Lake, near that place, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by caſſoons, to be ſunk in the water at ſmall diſtances from one another, and joined together by ſtring pieces, ſo as at the ſame time to ſerve for a bridge between the fortifications on the eaſt and weſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016142_0023_0F9B8E6CD2F2BD10"/>
ſides; that to prevent the enemy from drawing their ſmall craft over land beyond Three Mile Point into Lake George, the paſſage of that Lake be alſo obſtructed in like manner by caſſoons, from iſland to iſland, in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries; that Fort Stanwix be ſtrengthened, and other fortifications be made, at proper places, near the Mohawk River; and that General Schuyler, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of the Northern Department, execute theſe works this winter, and that the commanding officer of artillery, Chief Engineer, Quarter Maſter General and Commiſſary General, provide and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatever things in their reſpective departments are neceſſary, or may contribute to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; that there be a general hoſpital erected at Mount Independence.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>In order, therefore, to fulfil the intentions of Congreſs, you are immediately to proceed to Lake George, to examine if it is practicable to ſunk caſſoons in the Narrows in the manner directed; and if you find it ſo, to report the ſame to me, and immediately to order one or more of your Sub-Engineers to execute the work. If it is not practicable, you will report to me, by letter, the reaſons why, together with the depth of the water, and the diſtance from ſhore to ſhore, and from iſland to iſland. The report to be accompanied with a ſketch of the iſlands.</p>
                           <p>You are then to proceed to Ticonderoga, and, as I conceive the obſtructions of the Lake will be much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and cheaper executed while the Lake continues frozen than at any other time, you will firſt execute that work. The caſſoons ſhould be ſo far above water, as that the bridge may not be under water when the Lake is at the higheſt, and to prevent batteaus from paſſing underneath, when the Lake is at the loweſt, a boom ought to be laid on the water on each ſide of the bridge.</p>
                           <p>It will be neceſſary, the ſooneſt you poſſibly can, to prepare what timber and other materials may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the conſtruction of the fort on Mount Independence, and to furniſh me with an actual and accurate ſurvey of Mount Independence, and a plan of the fort you may judge ſhould be built on it.</p>
                           <p>You are alſo to loſe no time in preparing and collecting the materials for a hoſpital, ſufficiently large to contain ſix hundred ſick, beſides the neceſſary apartments for the Director, and the other officers of the hoſpital.</p>
                           <p>You will alſo immediately ſend an engineer to examine and report the ſtate of Fort Stanwix, and what works ought to be conſtructed there, and on his return to ſix on one or more proper places on this ſide Fort Stanwix, to erect fortifications, to prevent the enemy from coming down the river in batteaus, in caſe they ſhould be able to poſſeſs themſelves of Fort Stanwix, or leave it in their rear.</p>
                           <p>Whatever carriages you may want for drawing timber for the works on Lake George, and at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, you are to apply to Colonel Lewis, Deputy Quarter-Maſter General, for, who will have my orders to furniſh you therewith.</p>
                           <p>The armourers tools, that are now at Ticonderoga, you will immediately ſend to Colonel Lewis, to be delivered to ſuch perſon as you may direct to ſuperintend the armoury here, and leave orders for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourers to repair all the arms in this place, before they proceed to Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>Early proviſion is to be made, to have a ſufficiency of battery carriages for the cannon that may be ſent up, and for ſuch as may be wanted on board any veſſels to be conſtructed. In ſhort, you will uſe your beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to have every thing put in the beſt order, and what is to be executed done with the utmoſt expedition.</p>
                           <p>Carpenters always require cloſe attention, and to be puſhed to their duty; you will therefore give ſtrict orders to all your officers to keep them cloſely to work.</p>
                           <p>You will probably be able to procure ſoldiers, who can work with the whip-ſaw. You ſhould therefore procure as many as you poſſibly can, and immediately on your arrival at Ticonderoga apply for all the ſawyers in any of the corps there, and ſet them to work. It will be beſt to agree by the foot, becauſe it will be cheapeſt, and that you will get more work done.</p>
                           <p>A houſe to boil ſoap and make candles in is much wanted at Mount Independence. You will therefore conſtruct one, and alſo a bake-houſe, as ſoon as you can, and repair the proviſion ſtores, that the public may not ſuſtain ſo great a loſs as formerly by damaged proviſions.</p>

                           <p>The Deputy Commiſſary General has returned three hundred barrels of flour at Skeenſborough; theſe muſt be immediately forwarded to Ticonderoga; alſo one hundred and eighty barrels of beef, which are at Fort George, as ſoon as Lake George is paſſable, if it is not ſo already.</p>

You will pleaſe to procure a number to go to that place, furniſhed with ſodder for twenty days, or as much as you can prevail on the ſleighmen to carry up.

                           <p>MAJOR Stevens delivered me, in the beginning of December, an eſtimate of what would be wanted in the artillery department. Part of the articles he has procured, and I have now ſent him to wait on you for what is ſtill deficient, his Excellency General Waſhington having directed that my application for ordnance and ordnance ſtores ſhould be made to you. I ſhall, beſides the articles the Major may mentions, ſtand in need of forty ſhip-guns, ten of which to carry nine pound ball, fifteen carrying ſix pound ball, and as many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying four pound ball, with carriages, cartridges, ſhot, and every neceſſary belonging to them. Theſe to be ſent to this place or Fort George, where I wiſh to have them by the laſt of April at fartheſt.</p>

                           <p>NOT a ſingle armourer is yet arrived at this place; and as all our dependence was placed on thoſe you were to procure, I am greatly apprehenſive of the conſequence, if they ſhould not ſoon arrive.

Much is to be done, and exertions required. Carpenters are very expenſive to the public, as their wages are high; you will therefore ſee that they are cloſely kept to their duty, and charged with every neglect. For which purpoſe you muſt appoint an able clerk of the checque, who is to keep regular accounts of every perſon's name, and of every day they are employed.</p>

If the batteaus at that place are not already repaired, no time ſhould be loſt in doing it. The ſchooner there ſhould alſo be overhauled, and put into repair, without delay.</p>
                           <p>The ſhip carpenters now moving up to Fort George will require a number of carriages, to draw in the timber for the veſſels they are to build. Theſe carriages you will furniſh immediately, and ſend one of your aſſiſtants to ſuperintend the works at that place. The hoſpital there will alſo require repairs, and ſhould be done immediately. Two blackſmiths muſt be kept at work there, and a quantity of iron ſent up. If the ſhip nails are not already forwarded, ſend them on without loſs of time. A company of carpenters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of an overſeer and twenty men, muſt be engaged, and ſent without delay to Fort Stanwix.

                           <p>Three ploughs, and as many harrows, with the neceſſary apparel, muſt be ſent to Ticonderoga, under the care of a truſty perſon, who underſtands farming and gardening, in order to prepare the earth for raiſing turnips and other vegetables for the uſe of the army. You will give orders to ſupply them with working cattle and men, and direct your aſſiſtants to procure a piece of land for the purpoſe.

You will make the alterations agreeable to the plan you have laid before me, and to guard as much as poſſible againſt any misfortunes that might be occaſioned by an attack before the alterations are compleat, you will leave as much of the preſent work ſtanding, whilſt the other is going on, as poſſible, that the garriſon may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.

The Court will be pleaſed to obſerve, that in my ſeveral orders I deſcended to minutiae, in a manner not uſual for general officers, and which nothing but the moſt ardent zeal for the ſervice could have prompted.</p>
               <p>The third period extends from the time I reſumed the command to the evacuation of Ticonderoga.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day of June, 1777, I again reſumed the command of the department, and I offer the following letters and orders as evidence of the manner in which I continued to provide for the exigencies of the enſuing campaign, and for the general defence of the whole department.</p>
               <p>I arrived at Albany on the third day of June, and the next day wrote the following letter to Major General Gates.</p>

                           <p>You will give the moſt pointed orders, that no delay be made in making theſe returns; and, to avoid confuſion, you will furniſh each of your Aſſiſtants with a blank form of a return, with directions to fill it up.</p>

If any are ſtationed at a poſt where there is no magazine, they muſt find it, and you will pay for it. Two good horſes, with ſaddles and bridles, muſt be kept here, two at Saratoga, and two at Fort George, for the purpoſe of carrying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches.</p>
                           <p>The commanding officers at theſe poſts, when they have occaſion to ſend diſpatches, to make written appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to you, or your aſſiſtants, for the horſes. You will give directions that none of the horſes be turned to graſs, and that they be well fed.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>YOU will pleaſe to repair to Ticonderoga with all convenient ſpeed, and take the command of the troops at that place.</p>
                           <p>As the whole of our force in the Northern Department, if collected at Ticonderoga, would not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of properly meaning the extenſive works on both ſides of the Lake, and as Mount Independence is by much the moſt defenſible, and may be made a poſt capable of ſuſtaining a long and vigorous ſiege, it is my intention that your firſt care ſhould be to beſtow the utmoſt attention to fortifying the Mount. You will therefore pleaſe, immediately on your arrival, to give directions for erecting the neceſſary fortifications, and employ all the troops that can be ſpared from other duty and neceſſary works in that buſineſs. If the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the French redoubt and Mount Independence is not compleated, that work will alſo claim your immediate attention, and I wiſh that ſtrong piles ſhould be drove in the intervals between every caſſoon, and others in the front of each caſſoon, and if poſſible a line of pickets drove acroſs the channel, ſo far below Mount Independence, as that the cannon from thence may render it impoſſible for the enemy's veſſels to lay there, or be employed in removing the obſtructions. This ſeems to be work in the execution of which no time ſhould be loſt, as it may, by preventing the enemy's ſhips from paſſing, enable us to keep up the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with our veſſels, if the Mount ſhould be inveſted.</p>
                           <p>I wiſh you to keep ſcouting parties conſtantly out on both ſides of the Lake. That on the weſt ſhould go as far as the road by which the Tories laſt fall marched to Crown-Point.</p>
                           <p>Be ſo good as to order returns to be made immediately by the Chief Engineer, Commanding Officer of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, Commiſſary of Proviſions, and Clothier, of every article in their reſpective departments, and of what is wanting in each, that the deficiency may be procured without delay.</p>
                           <p>Incloſe you a credit on the military cheſt for Ten Thouſand Dollars, to pay any contingent expences that may ariſe, and not payable by any of the civil departments.</p>
                           <p>I am confident that no officer is more deeply impreſſed with the neceſſity of preſerving the health of the men than you, and I doubt not but you will beſtow much of your attention on ſo capital a matter. Tents are arrived here, and orders are given to ſend up five hundred. If more are wanted, you will pleaſe to ſignify it to me.</p>
                           <p>You will pleaſe to ſend me a return of the troops at Ticonderoga, as ſoon after your arrival as you poſſibly can.</p>
                           <p>You will lay in a magazine of fire wood on Mount Independence, to be preſerved in caſe of a ſiege, and to be as ſparing of the ſalt meat as you poſſibly can, conſiſtent with the health of the men.</p>
                           <p>As an arrangement of the troops into brigades cannot ſo properly be made here as at Ticonderoga, and it being probable that I ſhall not be able to repair to that place until towards the end of the month, you will pleaſe, conſulting with the other general officers, to brigade them, putting the militia into one by themſelves.</p>
                           <p>You will give directions that no conſiderable quantity of proviſion, or other military ſtores, are at any time left on the carrying place at the north end of Lake George.</p>
                           <p>As the health of the troops is very much injured by an improper mode of dreſſing their victuals, I wiſh you to order an officer of every company daily to ſuperintend that buſineſs; and as I conceive it would be for the benefit of the troops to be furniſhed with kettles ſufficiently large to cook for a whole company, I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Deputy Quarter Maſter General to ſend twenty to Ticonderoga for that purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>Pleaſe to cauſe a ſurvey to be made of the ſalted meat. I apprehend much of it will require to be repacked and well brined.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall be extremely happy frequently to be favoured with a line from you.</p>

                           <p>BY the Deputy Commiſſary General's return, I find there is a conſiderable quantity of flour, 213 barrels of pork, 582 barrels of beef, and near 600 buſhels of peaſe, at Fort George. You will immediately cauſe the ſame to be conveyed to Ticonderoga, except 100 barrels of flour, 50 barrels of pork, 50 barrels of beef, and 50 buſhels of peaſe. You will ſend 32 of the ſmall batteaus into Lake George, 30 of which to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into Lake Champlain, from thence into Wood Creek. The large batteaus now in Wood Creek to be carried below the Falls, and well ſecured. The quantity of proviſion at Fort Schuyler is very inadequate.

Five hundred of the tents which arrived yeſterday to be immediately ſent to Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga. You will alſo purchaſe twenty pot-aſh kettles, to be ſent to Ticonderoga. A number of bricks will be wanted at Ticonderoga, Fort George and Saratoga; you will therefore take meaſures, the ſooneſt poſſible, to get them made. Fort Edward may be ſupplied with this article from Fort George in returning carriages. Skeenſborough and Fort Ann may be ſupplied in returning batteaus from Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>You will alſo give directions for burning lime at Ticonderoga, Fort George and Saratoga, for the uſe of the works there, and the places mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p>
                           <p>If no bricks are to be purchaſed in this place, you will alſo cauſe fifty thouſand to be made here, and lay in a quantity of lime, which may be procured in the vicinity of Poukeep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

You will alſo take care that the troops at that and every other poſt in this department be well ſupplied with ſoap, vinegar, and ſuch vegetables as you may be able to procure. As I wiſh that as little of the ſalted meat ſhould be expended as poſſible, you will take immediate meaſures to ſupply the troops with freſh beef, and you will order all the ſalted beef and pork at Bennington, or elſewhere to the eaſtward, to be immediately brought to Hudſon's River, and from time to time to adviſe the Deputy Quarter Maſter General of its arrival.</p>

                           <p>I DO myſelf the honour to adviſe you that I arrived here on Tueſday, the third inſtant, and found an account, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</p>
                           <p>Incloſe you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As ſoon as I procure thoſe from the other poſts I ſhall make out a general return, and do myſelf the honour to tranſmit copies to you and his Excellency General Waſhington.</p>
                           <p>You will perceive by the return of the Commiſſary of Proviſions, which I alſo incloſe, that only 337 bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of the meat kind have been forwarded to Ticonderoga ſince the 26th of March, and no freſh beef, ſo that the ſtock of ſalted proviſions ſince that time is conſiderably diminiſhed, nor is there any conſiderable quantity provided in the country. I have therefore directed the Commiſſary to forward an immediate ſupply of freſh beef, that as much of the ſalted beef and pork may be ſaved as poſſible, in order to have a ſtock on hand, in caſe the enemy ſhould be able ſo to interrupt the communication as to prevent cattle being ſent on.</p>
                           <p>Incloſe you copy of the inſtructions I have given General St. Clair. I have directed that Mount Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence ſhould be the primary object of attention. 1<hi>st.</hi> Becauſe, if even the lines on the weſt ſide ſhould be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force deſtined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticonderoga, which it cannot, for the ſeveral poſts on the Mohawk river, and thoſe on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at leaſt two thouſand men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this ſide of the Lake.</p>
                           <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Becauſe I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army ſhould occupy a poſt, which if the enemy ſhould be able ſo to inveſt as to cut off the communication with the country on this ſide, we might poſſibly experience a diſaſter ſimilar to that at Fort Waſhington.</p>
                           <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Becauſe I am fully convinced that between two and three thouſand men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and ſecure the paſs.</p>
                           <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is poſſible that a want of proviſion might oblige us to abandon that important poſt.</p>
                           <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> If the enemy ſhould attempt to draw their boats over land into Lake George, from beyond the Three Mile Point, our naval ſtrength on Lake George will prevent their progreſs; and if it did not, we ſhould have a body of troops to oppoſe them with.</p>
                           <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Becauſe, if Mount Independence ſhould be inveſted, the militia will readily march when they have an army to join, and the ſiege may be raiſed.</p>
                           <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> Becauſe, if they ſhould attempt to march a body of troops from Crown Point, leaving Ticonderoga on their left (by the road laſt year cut by the tories who joined General Carleton) to interrupt the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, there will be a force to meet them, and to prevent the evil conſequences of ſuch a manoeuvre of theirs.</p>
                           <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> Becauſe, if a ſudden irruption ſhould be made on the Mohawk river, or from New-York, by Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's river, a force will be at hand to face them. Beſides theſe conſiderations, there are oeconomical ones
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016142_0029_0F9B8E71AA3B5B08"/>
alſo to induce to this diſpoſition of the army, if it can be done without danger, which I am fully of opinion it may, and will certainly be ſo, if General Carleton ſent part of his troops from Canada to New-York or elſewhere.</p>
                           <p>I have mentioned the matter to General St. Clair, and although I did not adduce to him all the reaſons given above, yet he is in ſentiment with me on the ſubject. May I be permitted to entreat the direction of Congreſs?</p>
                           <p>Some truſty Indians, with two of the French officers, accompanied by an approved Canadian, who leaves a wiſe and numerous family here, are going into Canada, to try to gain ſome intelligence of the enemy's ſtrength and intentions.</p>

When Brandt arrived with his men, he marched to one McGinnis, who is a noted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>neidas on that ſubject. I have this day ſent them a ſecond meſſage, couched in ſuch firm, but, I hope, prudent terms, that I expect it will have the deſired effect, and that we ſhall have no farther trouble from that fellow and his aſſociates. Leſt, however, I ſhould be miſtaken in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, I have ordered Colonel Van Schaick into that quarter with 150 men, to protect the inhabitants, and have directed him in the line of conduct he is to hold, which is to be ſuch as not to give umbrage to our Indian allies.</p>
                           <p>At twelve I received an expreſs from General St. Clair, copies of his letters No. 3 and 4, with copy of the letter to General Sullivan No. 5, and of the paſs to Amſbury No. 6, I herewith tranſmit.</p>
                           <p>Conſidering the extenſiveneſs of our works at Ticonderoga, the ſmallneſs of the garriſon is alarming; but I hope that, by confining our whole attention to Mount Independence, we ſhall be able to hold that paſs againſt any effort of the enemy.</p>
                           <p>Though chagrined, I am not diſcouraged by the variety of difficulties that preſent themſelves; becauſe I am confident that by ſteady exertions and perſeverance we ſhall ſurmount them, and hope that the enemy will find that we ſhall be able to prevent them from penetrating the country, ſhould they attempt it, which I believe they will not do, even if they ſhould (contrary to my expectations) be able to poſſeſs themſelves of Ticonderoga, unleſs General Howe ſhould penetrate up Hudſon's river. I have already diſpatched an expreſs to the States of Maſſachuſetts, and New-Hampſhire, to haſten on the remainder of their troops, and have given the moſt pointed orders to the Deputy Commiſſary and Quarter Maſter General to furniſh what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in their reſpective departments, and as ſoon as I have brought matters in ſome train at Ticonderoga, and the communication above this, I ſhall haſten back to puſh on the neceſſaries, and regulate affairs on the Weſtern Communication, where alſo much diſorder prevails.</p>
                           <p>I take the liberty to encloſe this under flying ſeal to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, as I cannot find time to do myſelf the honour to give Congreſs and him a ſeparate detail of what I have written.</p>

                           <p>I DO myſelf the honour to incloſe your Excellency a letter to Congreſs under flying ſeal. The variety of affairs which claim my attention, do not permit me time to communicate to your Excellency and Congreſs, ſeparately, ſuch information as it may be neceſſary both ſhould know. You will therefore pleaſe to excuſe the mode I take.</p>
                           <p>Our numbers are ſo few to the northward, and we have ſo little proſpect of their encreaſing, that, ſhould a diſaſter befal us at Ticonderoga, we ſhould have very few troops indeed to oppoſe, if the enemy ſhould make an attempt to penetrate the country. I ſhall probably be under the neceſſity of calling for aſſiſtance from Peek's-Kill. Perhaps your Excellency may think proper to lodge an order with the commanding officer to comply with my requiſition (if I ſhould make one) aſcertaining the number you may think proper to ſpare. Be aſſured that I ſhall not aſk any aid as long as there is a poſſibility of doing without.</p>
                           <p>Your letter of the 11th of May to General Gates was this day delivered me by Brigadier General Learned. The cloathing for Colonel Shepherd's regiment, if at Ticonderoga, will be immediately ſent down.</p>

                           <p>I HAVE this moment received diſpatches from General St. Clair, who is at Ticonderoga, adviſing me that by intelligence from Canada a body of the enemy may be expected in a very little while, and another on the Mohawk river; that the militia from New-Hampſhire are gone home; that the troops at Ticonderoga do not amount to more than two thouſand two hundred men, ſick included; that all the regiments are greatly deficient in numbers. Let me entreat you, Sir, to ſpare no exertions to haſten on the troops from your State. Such as can conveniently come by the way of Albany to do it.

You will give ſtrict orders that no inſult is offered to any Indian whatever, unleſs the troops are abſolutely attacked, in which caſe force is to be repelled by force; nor are any of the troops to go beyond the line of patented lands, unleſs it be in purſuit of Brandt and his party, ſhould he kill or captivate any of the inhabitants.

Inform them that you have orders not to croſs the line, unleſs it be in purſuit of Brandt, or others that may kill or captivate our people. Remark, that I have ſent two meſſages to them by the way of Fort Schuyler; that all the Six Nations are to meet the Commiſſioners on the 15th of next month; that I hope we ſhall meet, as at every former meeting, in love and friendſhip, and that we ſhall part perfectly ſatisfied with each other.

                           <p>In a day or two you will receive all the pork and ſalted beef now at this poſt, fifty barrels only excepted. Eighteen barrels are only come from Albany ſince March laſt.</p>
                           <p>When the pork and other articles are ſent on, the flour will come in the large ſchooner only, until you can have more time and ſpare cattle to tranſport it from the landing to the ſaw-mills.</p>
                           <p>Seven barrels of tar go over to-day, and two tons of iron, with all the tents that are arrived here, together with four boxes of axes, and about three hundred buſhels of peaſe, and about twenty new batteaus. Theſe ſhould be carried acroſs the ſooneſt poſſible, and not ſuffered to be uſed. The remainder will come on from day to day.</p>
                           <p>Pray oblige me with your commands for whatever you may need for a public or private uſe.</p>

                           <p>ON the 17th inſtant I arrived at Ticonderoga, where I found General St. Clair, and the other General Officers, aſſidno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ſly employed in the neceſſary works. I ſoon found that much was to be done, and, after having informed myſelf of the ſtate of the fortifications, ſtores, &amp;c. I thought it neceſſary to convene a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the General Officers, and laid before them the propoſitions contained in the paper No. 1, which being taken into their conſideration, we came to the reſolutions noted in the ſame paper.</p>
                           <p>I was in hopes to have found the poſt in a better ſtate of defence than it is, and the works for obſtructing the paſſage to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into the rear of our fortifications compleated, or, at the very leaſt, conſiderably more advanced than it unhappily is. That matters have not been carried on with more diſpatch is in a great meaſure to be imputed to the late arrival of any troops, who could be brought to work with ſpirit, that the artificers did not come by the time they were ordered, and to a want of working cattle. The latter I have already ſupplied, and I have ſent on an additional number of carpenters, ſo that the buſineſs will now go on in better train, and I hope with much more ſpirit, and truſt we ſhall ſtill be able to put every thing in ſuch order as to give the enemy a good reception, and, I hope, a repulſe, ſhould they attempt a real attack, which I conjecture will not be ſoon, if at all, although <hi>I expect they</hi> will approach with their fleet, to keep us in alarm, and to draw our attention from other quarters where they may meditate a real attack.</p>
                           <p>I left Ticonderoga on Sunday evening, and arrived at Fort George on Monday afternoon; and having, previous to my croſſing the lake, taken meaſures to bring on a ſupply of proviſions, I had the happineſs to ſend on from Fort George between three and four hundred barrels of beef and pork, ſo that we have now near ſixty days proviſions of the meat kind at Ticonderoga, and flour for near double that time, alſo at leaſt fifteen hundred barrels now at Fort Edward and Fort George, which will all be at the latter place by the end of this month. A ſmall quantity of beef and pork is beſides on the way up; but, leſt this ſhould ſtill be an inſufficient quantity in caſe of a ſiege, and that the ſalted meat may be huſbanded as much as poſſible, I have ſent Commiſſary Yancey with a ſmall party into the interior part of the country to bring up fat cattle; of which, I am informed, there is a conſiderable number, chiefly in the hands of perſons who have purchaſed them to get our paper currency out of their hands. The orders I have given to procure them (copy whereof, No. 2, I do myſelf the honour to tranſmit) will, if carried into execution, certainly infringe on the civil rights of the inhabitants; but, conſidering the neceſſity of the caſe, and what kind of people will be moſt affected by them, I hope I ſhall ſtand excuſed for this ſtretch of power. I expect the ſupply will be ſpeedy; if ſo, it will eradicate every anxiety on the ſcore of proviſions, at leaſt until our numbers conſiderably encreaſe.</p>
                           <p>I was very diſagreeably diſappointed to find the troops of Ticonderoga ſo miſerably clad and armed, and nothing in ſtore for them. Many are literally barefooted, and moſt of them ragged. It is not poſſible to procure ſome cloathing, arms and blankets? Many are alſo deſtitute of the latter.</p>
                           <p>The tents I ſent from Philadelphia came in good time, as there was hardly ſhelter for what troops we have, and that very indifferent.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered all ſuch ſick as are not likely to recover ſoon to be conveyed to Fort George in covered boats, which are made for the purpoſe. If it had been equally proper to have ſuffered them to remain, and that they could have been as well provided with vegetables, yet neceſſity would have juſtified it, as not one ſingle room in the hoſpital is yet finiſhed, nor will it ſoon be in a condition to receive a conſiderable number of ſick.</p>
                           <p>The corps of artillery not affording even one man to a gun, I have drafted two hundred from the different regiments, but was under the neceſſity to promiſe ſuch additional pay as to make it equal to that of the artillery corps, which I hope will meet the approbation of Congreſs.</p>
                           <p>One of the ſchooners at Lake George is launched: She is to carry fourteen guns. Another will be in the lake by the firſt of next month, and the timber for the gallies is hauled to the ſpot where they are to be built. But the rigging which I ordered up in the winter is not all arrived, nor have we a ſufficient number of guns for theſe veſſels. I truſt, however, I ſhall ſtill be able to procure both in time.</p>
                           <p>The paper, No. 3, is copy of Francis Montly's information, who is lately arrived from Canada.</p>

                           <p>YOUR favour of the 24th was delivered me laſt evening. If the enemy ſhould not mean a ſerious attack on your poſt, their movement is probably calculated to cover an attempt on New Hampſhire, the Mohawk river, or to cut off the communication between Fort George and Fort Edward, or perhaps all three. I wiſh you therefore to keep a ſmall ſcout on the eaſt ſide of the lake, near the road leading from St. John's to New Hampſhire, and others as far weſt as the road leading to the north branch of Hudſon's river.</p>
                           <p>I have diſpatched an expreſs to Congreſs and General Waſhington, and have entreated the latter to afford as a reinforcement. Pray let nothing be left at the landing, and the batteaus be brought over as ſoon as poſſible, that your retreat may not be cut off, ſhould you be unable to maintain your poſt. I cannot learn that any troops are arrived at Albany. I ſhall haſten to that place to forward on whatever I can, and to be in the way to bring up the militia, if neceſſary. God bleſs you, and believe me, &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>I am this moment favoured with a letter of the 25th inſtant from General St. Clair, copy whereof I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with tranſmit. Should an accident happen to the garriſon of Ticonderoga, and General Burgoyne make a puſh to gain the ſouth part of the lake, I know of no obſtacle to prevent him, as, comparatively ſpeaking, I have not a man to oppoſe him. The whole number at the different poſts at and on this ſide of the lake, including the garriſon of Fort George and Skeenſborough, not exceeding ſeven hundred men, and theſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw away from their ſeveral ſtations, in every one of which they are already much too weak. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore highly neceſſary that a ſtrong reinforcement ſhould without delay be ſent me. If the ſloops are not yet ſent to bring the troops your Excellency has ordered to be kept in readineſs at Peeks-kill, I ſhall puſh them off without delay.</p>
                           <p>As it is not probable that we ſhall in time be ſupplied with field pieces from the eaſtward, I muſt entreat that the reinforcement may bring ſome up with them.</p>
                           <p>I have this moment alſo received a letter from Mr. Deane, the Indian Interpreter, extract whereof I incloſe you.<note n="*" place="bottom">Copy of a letter from James Deane, Interpreter, to Major General Schuyler, dated Albany, June <hi>25, 1777.</hi>
                              </note> As the information tallies exactly with what I had before, it leads me to conclude that an irruption will be made from the weſtward.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall apply for the aid of the militia of this and the neighbouring States, but I fear it will not be very powerful, as many muſt neceſſarily be left at home.</p>

He will come in at Fort Schuyler, as he thinks it rather unſafe to come directly to Ticonderoga from Canada, leſt our ſcouts ſhould miſtake him for a party of the enemy.

                           <p>SINCE the letter which I ſhewed you this morning, I have received another from General St. Clair, adviſing me that a large party of the enemy had gone up Otter Creek, in order to cut off the communication by Skeenſborough, and that another ſtrong body had marched on the weſt ſide of the lake to cut off Fort George. It is therefore neceſſary that one half of the militia under your command ſhould immediately march, with orders to rendezvous at Fort Edward, where I ſhall be with what continental troops I can collect. Pray urge thoſe neareſt Fort Edward to repair thither, without waiting for others to come up, as a conſiderable quantity of proviſions lie at that poſt, and which may be in danger of being loſt, ſhould the enemy make an attempt on that poſt.</p>

You will therefore put yourſelf in the beſt poſture of defence you poſſibly can. Let a quantity of proviſion be immediately put into the Fort, and as much water as you can poſſibly collect. Employ all hands to throw up lines from the Fort towards the ſpot where the Regimental Hoſpital was to be built, and continue them from thence on the brow of the hill to the Guardhouſe. Alſo threw up a breaſtwork from the eaſt ſide of the fort to the precipice by the low land. This, with the aſſiſtance of the guns from the veſſels, will render you perfectly ſecure. I have the fulleſt confidence that the poſt will be defended to the laſt. I ſhall haſten up to your relief as ſoon as I can collect any body of troops. Send a truſty officer with my letter to General St. Clair, and if, on his arrival near the north end of the lake, he apprehends danger on the carrying place, direct him to land about four miles on this ſide, on the eaſt ſide of the lake, and croſs the mountains, ſo as to ſtrike the lake oppoſite Ticonderoga. He, and the men with him, muſt be prepared for that march. <hi>I am, &amp;c.</hi>

It will therefore be beſt that you order it to be examined before it leaves the ſtores in the country, that the public may not pay the tranſportation of what may not be fit for ſervice. Pleaſe to let me know if any of the beef or pork, which is lately come directly to this place, was damaged or not.

                           <p>I HAVE received your letter, in anſwer to mine of yeſterday. I believe the difficulty of procuring cattle at preſent, is very great, but a ſufficient ſtock of proviſions might have been laid in, if the orders I gave on
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016142_0037_0F9B8E76E63FDAD8"/>
the 6th of November laſt had been complied with; for it was on that day that I wrote the Commiſſary General on the ſubject, the receipt of which letter he acknowledged.</p>
                           <p>You labour under a miſtake, when you aſſert that there was not ſufficient ſledding to carry up the proviſions. If there had been ten times the quantity, it might have been ſent to Fort George and Cheſhire's; for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but remember that crouds of ſleds offered daily; that many returned from hence home without a loading; that no proviſion was left in the ſtores here. Indeed, many of the ſledmen complained perſonally to me, that they had come to ride, and could get no loading. It is true, that the military cheſt was not ſufficiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to anſwer every demand; but, if my memory fails not, you had a ſufficiency to have laid in a ſtock conſiderably beyond what is. I confeſs that it would be mortifying to any perſon to have the frowns and cenſures of his ſuperior officer, when he is ſenſible he has done his duty. But I ſhould be glad to know in what inſtances you have had my frowns. All my letters to you point out to you the reverſe. They give you wholeſome advice, and direct you what might be proper to do. That the army is ſo well ſupplied with flour you know is, in a great meaſure, owing to the hints I gave you. That you procured barrels for that flour was in conſequence of a plan I ſtruck out for you. I wiſh you therefore, nay, I inſiſt upon your pointing out in what inſtance you have not been ſupported by me, whenever you required my ſupport. I believe you will not be able to adduce one. I promiſed you my countenance when you came into the office, and you have had it. If I had wiſhed that another ſhould have enjoyed it, I might probably have had it in my power to have obtained it; but, ſuſpicious as you are, I will ſtill be candid. I declare that I believe you took ſuch meaſures as you thought beſt to procure a ſufficient ſtock of proviſion. I believe your Agents have greatly deceived you. I believe they made returns of larger quantities than they were poſſeſſed of. I do not believe that you would have returned ſo large a quantity to me as you did on the 13th of March, if you had not been deceived; but you ought not to have been deceived. It was faulty in you to be ſo, and of that I have great reaſon to complain. The militia are ordered up, and a body of continental troops are expected from Peek's-Kill. I ſuppoſe we ſhall have ſix or ſeven thouſand additional men to feed. You muſt therefore ſtrain every nerve to procure a ſupply of proviſions. If you want money, ſend to me for a warrant. Coopers are greatly wanted, both of Fort George and Fort Edward, you ſhould ſend one to each poſt.</p>

                           <p>By all accounts, the enemy have had a moſt ſevere drubbing.

                           <p>I AM juſt now informed by a perſon from Tryon county, that the enemy are actually got to Oſwego with a conſiderable body, to make an attack on Fort Schuyler; that I ſhall have authentic information this day. The garriſon is weak, and but poorly ſupplied with cannon. I have requeſted General Herkimer to keep his militia in readineſs to march to their ſupport. I have as yet only been able to march Colonel Bailey's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſting of two hundred and fifty-five rank and file, half of it to reinforce Fort George, and the other half Fort Edward. None of the militia are yet moved.</p>
                           <p>Should our troops at Ticonderoga fall into the enemy's hands, I fear they will be able to march where they pleaſe, unleſs a greater force is ſent me than what your Excellency at firſt intended.</p>

                           <p>I AM favoured with your letter of the 20th June, which came to hand on my arrival at this place from Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have opened the campaign in every quarter in this department. By a letter from General St. Clair, of the 28th ult. their main body and fleet were ſtill at Crown Point, where they had been ſome days, and from whence they have ſent ſtrong parties to interrupt the communication. If we had a ſufficient number of troops at that poſt, I ſhould not be in pain for the event if they made a ſerious attack; but our numbers are conſiderably below half what they ought to be. I am waiting with impatience for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and for a reinforcement from Peek's-Kill, which is expected in a day or two to move up, either to give aſſiſtance to the garriſon, or to cover its retreat, ſhould ſuch an event unhappily take place. An incurſion on the Mohawk river is alſo momently expected. Some ſcalping parties have already made their appearance.</p>

You will pleaſe to order four of the pans mentioned in your letter to be expedited to this place.</p>
                           <p>I am doubly diſtreſſed for blankets. Many are wanted for the troops, and a conſiderable number for the Indians, who are to meet me in great numbers at this place on the 15th inſtant, and who will be greatly diſappointed if they do not meet with a ſupply. Permit me therefore to entreat your beſt exertions to aſſiſt me in procuring a ſupply, and be ſo good as to obſerve to the Repreſentative Bodies of the State, that it is of the firſt importance that we ſhould be able to ſupport the good opinion the Indians have entertained of us.</p>
                           <p>His Excellency General Waſhington adviſes me that light artillery are daily expected at Boſton from France, and that I may be furniſhed with a ſupply. You will be ſo good as to give me the earlieſt intimation of its arrival, that I may ſend horſes to bring it on. <hi>I am, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>THE neceſſity of inducing the Six Nations to abide by the neutrality they have promiſed to obſerve is a matter of capital moment. The troops it would require to awe theſe people, if they were unfriendly, would create a very conſiderable expence, whilſt a ſum, equal to the tenth part of it, properly laid out in preſents, would have all the deſired effect. A conference is to be held with them at this place on the 15th inſtant, and as they inform me that they will generally attend, it is neceſſary that the articles neceſſary to give them ſhould be procured without delay. The importance of the buſineſs will apologize for the liberty I take, by entreating your aid to Major Renſſelaer, who is expreſly ſent to procure ſuch articles as are indiſpenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. I have alſo addreſſed myſelf to General Heath on the ſubject, and hope, by your joint exertions, that Major Renſſelaer will be able to return here in good time, with moſt, if not all, the articles I have given him a memorandum of, which he will lay before you.</p>
                           <p>The enemy, from ſome late manoeuvres, do not appear to be in great force. They have entrenched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thrown a boom acroſs the lake, at a point of land about three miles north of Ticonderoga. The militia are moving up, and I hope to follow to-morrow or next day with the troops from Peek's-Kill, who are momently expected.</p>

                           <p>I DID myſelf the pleaſure to write you on the firſt inſtant, but not having been able to forward any letters, it will be delivered you, with this, by Major Renſſelaer.</p>
                           <p>The Six Nations of Indians, who were invited to a conference to be held at this place on the 15th inſtant, have ſent me word that they would generally attend. The importance of keeping theſe people to obſerve that neutrality which they have promiſed is ſo evident, that it needs not to be particularly dwelt upon. Permit me only to obſerve, that one tenth part of the money, neceſſary to maintain a force equal to keep them in awe, expended in preſents, will have the deſired effect. The difficulty is, to procure the articles that are wanted; and as they are not to be got any where but with you, I have ſent Major Renſſelaer for the purpoſe, and muſt earneſtly entreat you that you will be pleaſed to afford him every aſſiſtance in your power, and to order Major Chaſe, the Deputy Quarter Maſter General, to provide him with carriages, for which he will pay. I have written to the Preſident of the State, entreating his aſſiſtance alſo. Should any of the articles, or any thing as a ſubſtitute, be found in any of the continental ſtores, you will pleaſe to order ſuch to be delivered.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have approached to within three miles of Ticonderoga, where they are retrenching themſelves, and alſo are throwing a boom acroſs the lake. This does not carry with it an idea that they have any great force. The militia are marching up, and part of the continental troops from Peek's-Kill are momently expected. I ſhall make all the haſte poſſible with them, and hope we ſhall be able, at leaſt, to prevent the enemy from doing any thing capital.</p>
                           <p>I have ſent General Learned to collect the militia at Fort Edward and Fort Ann.</p>

                           <p>As General Herkimer has made an agreement with Brandt, and that the latter is gone or going to Onendoga, I do not apprehend that the inhabitants of Cherry Valley will be in any danger from the Indians, more eſpecially as the treaty is to be held here on the 15th inſtant, to which the Indians have generally promiſed to come. I ſhall, however, order Colonel Van Schaick to remain in Tryon county. I cannot but think that he will be more advantageouſly poſted for the protection of the inhabitants at Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joharie, on the north ſide of the river.

                           <p>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with impatience and anxiety, and ſhall puſh with them the moment they do; but if they do not arrive by to-morrow, I ſhall go without them, and do the beſt I can with the militia.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who have ſcalped a Captain and Corporal of Ganſevoort's regiment. This, with the threatnings of Joſeph Brandt and his party, and the proſpect of the enemy's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by Oſwego, greatly diſpirits the people of Tryon county, who have called upon me for ſupport, in ſuch a manner that I am obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick's in that quarter, and apprehend that a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement will ſoon be required there. If ſo, I ſhall be greatly diſtreſſed, as we are, and with the reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coming up will ſtill be, but weak to the northward, a great part of which muſt be employed as convoys to eſcort the proviſions from Fort George and Fort Edward to Fort Ann, and thence to Skeenſborough and Ticonderoga.</p>
                           <p>I mentioned in a former letter from Saratoga, that I ſuppoſed ſuch an additional quantity of proviſions had arrived by that time, as that the garriſon was ſupplied with near ſixty days; but as great part, if not all of what was at the landing is ſent back to Fort George, they are much ſhort of it. I have ordered it to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016142_0040_0F9B8E79A4A224B0"/>
to Fort Ann. I with it had been conveyed to Ticonderoga in the months of April and May. I aſſure you I am far from being at eaſe on the ſcore of proviſions, for if we ſhould not be able to throw in a ſupply of fat cattle, I fear that we ſhall not have a ſufficient quantity of ſalt meat in this part of the country. At Fort Schuyler only, twenty-nine thouſand odd hundred weight has been condemned.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Spencer is returned from the Six Nations. He adviſes that the meeting at this place will be numerous. The enemy's agents have induſtriouſly propagated that we have nothing to give them; that if we get any thing, it muſt come from Heaven; that all our ports are ſhut up, and that we can neither get in or out. A good uſe might be made of this aſſertion, if we could give them a tolerable good ſupply; but the goods I ſent for to the eaſtward in March laſt have come ſo extravagantly high, that the cargoe is ſmall indeed, and not one blanket, and very little ſtrouds, two articles, without which every thing elſe is conſidered as almoſt nothing.

                              <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I DO myſelf the honour to tranſmit you copies of General St. Clair's letters to me of the 30th of June, continued to the 1ſt of July, together with copies of thoſe of the 2d and 3d inſtant, and two papers incloſed in the laſt, all of which are numbered in the order of time I received them.</p>
                           <p>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with anxiety, and the moment they do I ſhall move with them. If they do not arrive by to-morrow, I go without them, and will do the beſt I can with the militia.</p>
                           <p>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who ſcalped a Captain and Corporal of Ganſevoort's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This, with the threatnings of Joſeph Brandt, a natural ſon of Sir William Johnſon, who commands a party of about two hundred Indians, and the proſpect of being attacked by the way of Oſwego, has ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited the inhabitants of Tryon county, that I have been obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick, who has about one hundred and fifty continental troops with him, in that part of the country, and apprehend that I ſhall ſoon be under the neceſſity of reinforcing him. If ſo, I propoſe to ſend him ſome of the militia deſtined for the northward, that we may keep the continental troops as much together as poſſible.</p>
                           <p>Incloſe your Excellency a return of the army at Ticonderoga. Should any accident befal us in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the troops be loſt, we ſhall be in a diſagreeable ſituation, with little elſe beſides militia, with not a ſingle piece of heavy or light artillery, and not one artillery-man.</p>
                           <p>If it be poſſible, I wiſh your Excellency to order as many artillery-men and field-pieces to this quarter as can be ſpared, with a competent quantity of fixed ammunition, as we have no cannon cartridge paper, and very little of any other.</p>
                           <p>As part of the proviſions I ſent by the way of Lake George is returned to that poſt, I ſhall now be under the neceſſity of drawing it from thence to Fort Ann, that we may attempt to ſupply the garriſon of Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga by the way of Wood Creek and Skeenſborough; but ſhould we be incapable of getting a ſupply of freſh proviſions into that fortreſs, I dread the conſequences, as the hopes I have of obtaining any conſiderable quantity of ſalted meat are next to none, unleſs it can be ſent from below, a good deal of what was in this department being ſpoiled.</p>
                           <p>I have tranſmitted Congreſs copy of General St. Clair's letters.</p>

                           <p>YOUR favour of the 1ſt inſtant I received this morning by Lieutenant Denney. Beſides four companies of Colonel Bailey's regiment, I have ordered two hundred militia to reinforce you. The whole, or part of theſe, you will ſend over to the hoſpital, and cauſe them to throw up two little redoubts, ſo ſituated as to protect the hoſpital. A Captain Fleurimont, who pretends to be an Engineer, is going up to you, and may poſſibly be of uſe. If there are arms in ſtore, you may furniſh the artificers with them. Let all the batteaus be brought out of the creek, and ſo placed as that there may be no danger of their being deſtroyed by the enemy. Afford every aſſiſtance in your power to get the veſſels finiſhed.</p>

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>From the aforegoing facts and papers I humbly conceive the Court will clearly perceive, that during the whole time of my command, prior to the evacuation, I was guilty of no neglect of duty, either in not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting information to Congreſs, preparing for the campaign of 1777, obtaining intelligence of the enemy's deſigns, or purſuing every meaſure in my power for rendering them abortive. Should you, Gentlemen, be of this opinion, I preſume a ſuppoſition of my having neglected my duty in the inſtance charged againſt me will not be ſo eaſily admitted, as if my prior attention had been leſs extenſive and unremitted.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, viz. To lay before the Court the reaſons of my abſence from Ticonderoga at the time of the ſiege.—They are as follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> I did not then, nor can I now, think it the duty of a Commander in Chief of an extenſive Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever to ſuffer himſelf to be bleſieged in a ſort.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> I did not apprehend it to have been the deſire, or even wiſh of Congreſs, that I ſhould have remained in the garriſon of Ticonderoga at the time of the ſiege.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> The particular and various circumſtances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and conſequences capitally injurious to the public good would have enſued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the ſiege.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> That Commanders in Chief ſhould not permit themſelves to be beſieged in a fort appears ſo ſtriking and evident, that I am at a loſs to adduce reaſons for rendering it more clear.</p>
               <p>When it is conſidered that there may be and generally are in every department various poſts and paſſes, all of which demand his care; that occaſional aid is to be afforded, in proportion to their reſpective neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that the operations of the enemy may frequently render new diſpoſitions neceſſary, and that applications from every quarter of the department muſt be made to him; I think he would merit cenſure were he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his care to a ſingle garriſon, lock himſelf up in it, and, during the courſe of perhaps a long ſiege, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the remainder of the department of his ſuperintendence.</p>
               <p>The propriety of this reaſoning receives additional force from general practice. I am ignorant of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Commanders in Chief having acted this part. The preſent war affords numerous inſtances to the contrary.</p>
               <p>His Excellency General Waſhington never ſuffered himſelf to be beſieged. What would have been the conſequence had be taken the command of Fort Waſhington? His abilities perhaps might have ſaved it, but it might even then have been loſt, and ſurely it was not his duty to have run the riſque. His perſonal valour, as well as good conduct, ſtands confeſſed, and yet he never thought himſelf juſtifiable to take ſuch a ſtep. I would not here be ſuppoſed to compare myſelf, in point of importance, to that great and good man. I mean nothing further by this, than to repreſent the impropriety of ſuch conduct in a Commander in Chief in a ſtronger light.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the command of ſorts is generally given to ſubordinate officers; and as the object of the appointment of a Commander in Chief is the good of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hole department, it would, in my opinion, be repugnant to the deſign of his appointment, to put himſelf in ſuch a ſituation as to be able to extend his care no further than the walls of one ſingle fort in it. On the contrary, ſhould be not leave himſelf at large, to concert and execute meaſures for the relief of ſuch poſts as may be in danger, to afford them ſuccours, to annoy the enemy, to cut off their retreat, to intercept their ſupplies, and generally to do every thing, which, in his opinion, may be calculated to fruſtrate their deſigns?</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Had I received the leaſt intimation that it was the deſire of Congreſs that I ſhould take the command of Ticonderoga, I ſhould, without the leaſt heſitation, have done it, but ſuch intimation was never given me. On the contrary beſides the reaſons above mentioned, I had particular ones, which induced me to believe that they neither expected or deſired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</p>
               <p>Ticonderoga has been deemed an important poſt ever ſince the war, and when it became moſt ſo, Congreſs was pleaſed to name the officer who they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould command at it.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of March, 1776. Congreſs reſolved that I ſhould for the preſent, or until I ſhould receive farther orders, ſix my Head-Quarters at Albany.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:016142_0042_0F9B8E7DC2498A70"/>And although in the fall following the enemy appeared in force in the vicinity of Ticonderoga under General Carleton, and apparently with deſign to inveſt it, yet the above order remained unrepealed, and the immediate command of that poſt was committed to another officer.</p>
               <p>Nor were theſe orders annulled till the 22d of May, 1777, in conſequence of my repreſenting to Congreſs the impracticability of my paying proper attention to the department, during the continuance of that reſtriction.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of April, 1777, the Congreſs paſſed the following reſolution:</p>
               <p>"<hi>Ordered,</hi> That General St. Clair be informed by expreſs of the approach of the enemy to Ticonderoga, "and that he repair without loſs of time to that place.</p>
               <p>As General St. Clair was at that time one of the officers deſigned for the Northern Department, and of courſe under my command, the above order receives all its propriety and uſe, from a ſuppoſition that I ſhould not remain with the garriſon in caſe of a ſiege.</p>
               <p>At no time, during my command in that department, did I ever intimate a deſign of taking the particular command of that poſt. Indeed, I had informed Congreſs, as the Court will perceive by my letter of the 14th of June, already quoted, that
<q>as ſoon as matters were brought into ſome train at Ticonderoga, and on the communication above, that I ſhould haſten back to puſh on the neceſſary ſupplies, and regulate affairs on the Weſtern Communication, where alſo much diſorder prevailed.</q>
As this letter was diſpatched by expreſs, and as it incloſed General St. Clair's letter of the 13th of June, if Congreſs had intended that I ſhould have remained at Ticonderoga, it is reaſonable to conclude that they would have given me orders for the purpoſe. Nor do any letters or reſolves I have been honoured with from Congreſs hint ſuch an expectation. Shortly before, and at the time of the ſiege, I tranſmitted ſeveral letters from General St. Clair to Congreſs, by which they were informed of the enemy's progreſs; and I alſo informed Congreſs of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention (not to command the garriſon) but to put myſelf at the head of all the troops and militia I could collect, and do my utmoſt to raiſe the ſiege. From the above circumſtances therefore, and from the ſilence of Congreſs reſpecting a deſire that I ſhould confine myſelf to the fort, I had not the leaſt reaſon to infer that they wiſhed it, or that they were diſpleaſed with my abſence. About this time a treaty with the Indians was to be held, the ſecurity of Fort Schuyler to be provided for, the incurſions of the Indians on the weſtern fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to be oppoſed, a long chain of communication to be kept open, the militia to be collected, ſupplies to the different poſts to be forwarded, and my utmoſt exertions throughout the whole department required. I muſt therefore ſubmit it to you, Gentlemen, whether I had any reaſon to conjecture that Congreſs expected I would confine myſelf at Ticonderoga, and thereby ſubject myſelf to the neceſſity of neglecting thoſe other very important objects, eſpecially too as an officer of reputation, nominated by them to command at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, was then at that poſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The particular and various circumſtances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and that conſequences very injurious to the public good would have enſued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the ſiege.</p>
               <p>Permit me to remind you, Gentlemen, that Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Fort George, Fort Schuyler, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, and various other poſts, are included in the Northern Department, and then under my command; that an expedition was then carrying on againſt Ticonderoga by General Burgoyne; another againſt Fort Schuyler by General St. Leger; and a third by a party of ſavages againſt the weſtern ſettlements of this State; that, to eſtabliſh a communication for the paſſage of ſupplies from Albany and the interior country to Ticonderoga, a chain of poſts was to be maintained, which chain conſiſted of the following poſts, Half Moon, Stillwater, Saratoga, Fort Miller, Fort Edward, Fort George, Fort Ann and Skeenſborough; that a like chain of poſts was neceſſary to be maintained to the weſtward, to ſecure a communication with Fort Schuyler, viz. Schenec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tady, Fort Johnſon and Fort Dayton. At all theſe poſts troops were ſtationed, and care to be taken to prevent any of them from being ſurprized; it being evident that the loſs of one of theſe poſts would have broken the whole communication, and have ſtopped the progreſs of ſupplies too important to be riſqued in that critical ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>It will be unneceſſary here to mention the frequent applications made to me for ſuccour from the weſtern country, I mean from Cherry Valley, Umadilla, Schohary, Canajoharie, German Flatts, and Fort Schuyler, which was afterwards relieved by a detachment I ſent under General Arnold for that purpoſe, ſome of which places were in danger, others had ſuffered, and all in the greateſt con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ernation, as will appear by ſundry papers which I ſhall have the honour to lay before the Court.</p>
               <p>The fate of ſort Schuyler, as well as Ticonderoga, was precarious. In caſe of the reduction of either, meaſures were to be taken for oppoſing the victorious army, and the ſyſtem of that oppoſition was to depend on events and circumſtances, then only to be conjectured.</p>
               <p>Pacific, as well as hoſtile meaſures, to avoid the depredations of the ſavages, were then in agitation, a treaty was to be held, meſſages were to be ſent and received, agents to be employed and inſtructed, ſpeeches to be made and anſwered, preſents to be collected and diſtributed. Add to this, that there was not a general officer in the department, who had a competent knowledge of that extenſive country, immediately to direct the military operations in it. With what propriety could I throw myſelf into Ticonderoga, and, as it were, abandon thoſe numerous and eſſential objects?</p>
               <p>Had I remained with the garriſon of Ticonderoga, the valuable ſtores at Fort George would have been loſt, a competent ſupply of proviſions for Fort Schuyler would not have been afforded, for although I had given or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The militia of this State would not have been ſo ſoon collected or the cattle and carriages in the reach of the enemy removed. The obſtructions in the navigation of Wood Creek, and of the roads into the country (which was done before General St. Clair and the garriſon came up) whereby the progreſs of the enemy was greatly retarded, might not have been effected, nor would the country ſo ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

by the reſolution of Congreſs of the 29th of July, 1777, were charged to make the moſt critical enquiry, in order to inveſtigate the cauſes of the misfortunes in the Northern Department, and that in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the orders of Congreſs, and in conformity to their duty, they publiſhed the reſolutions in the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, and in the ſame public manner called upon every perſon capable of giving information to do ſo, wrote to the ſeveral officers in the Northern Department, and to the ſeveral Executive Powers of this and the Eaſtern States, to afford their aid in procuring information, and as the charge of my not being at Ticonderoga is founded on a fact which was notorious, which Congreſs were fully informed of, previous to that reſolution, it affords ſtrong preſumptive proof that the Committee received no information on which they could ground any charge, and authorizes the concluſion, that if I erred in judgment, in not being at Ticonderoga during the ſiege, it was by no means an intentional neglect of duty. Indeed, I have every reaſon to believe, from the confidence which Congreſs have been pleaſed to place in me after I was laſt ſuperceded in the command of the Northern Department, inſtances of which I ſhall beg leave to produce, that that Honourable Body does not conſider me either as a criminal, or even unworthy ſervant of the public. I hope alſo to evince to the Court, that, although extremely wounded in my feelings to be deprived of the command in the moment when there was a proſpect of acquiring great reputation, I continued in that line of conduct which I conceived it to be the duty of every good man to hold to his country, however highly that country may have injured him; and for that purpoſe I ſhall beg leave to read ſome letters and papers, for the information of the Court, after having laid before them ſundry applications that were made me from different quarters <note n="*" place="bottom">

Apply to the Committee of Albany and General Ten Broeck, and requeſt their aid to induce the people from every quarter to come up with waggons. Let the militia bring with them as many as they think proper, and aſſure them that their detention will be only for a few days. We are in great diſtreſs for want of lead, an article ſo eſſentially requiſite, that we cannot even hope to do any thing here to prevent the enemy's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing without it. The citizens of Albany only can ſupply our preſent exigencies immediately. Recourſe muſt therefore be had to the Committee, begging their interpoſition to collect ſuch lead as is in the city. The lead from windows and weights may perhaps afford a ſupply for the preſent. As ſoon as it can be collected, Mr. Renſſelaer will have it made into ball, and ſend it up without a moment's delay.</p>

                           <p>I AM this moment favoured with your Excellency's letter of the 6th inſtant. You will before this have received my ſeveral letters, adviſing your Excellency of the evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the diſtreſſed ſituation we are in. We are by no means now in a better, rather worſe, as deſertion is frequent. General Nixon's brigade is not yet come up, nor do I get a reinforcement of the militia. General St. Clair, from whom I have heard for the firſt time about ten this morning (copy of his letter I incloſe) is about fifty miles eaſt of me. If he ſhould go to Bennington, as I fear he will be obliged to do, he will be ſtill farther off, and the more he gets into the inhabited part of the country, the greater will the deſertion from the army be, which is already much, very much diminiſhed, by numbers going off. I am very apprehenſive General St. Clair will not join me with more than one thouſand men. General Nixon's corps, I am informed, is under that. Thus, with leſs than three thouſand continental and not quite one thouſand militia, I am to face a powerful enemy from the north, fluſhed with ſucceſs, and preſſed at the ſame time from the weſt by a body, which, from repeated information (copies whereof I have not time to ſend), is reſpectable, and already at Oſwego.</p>
                           <p>We have ſtill ſtores of ſuch importance left at Fort George, that I am very anxious to bring them off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I order that poſt to be abandoned, which I muſt do, or ſuffer the garriſon to fall into the enemy's hands, which it inevitably will, if the enemy, who are approaching by Wood Creek, throw themſelves between this and Lake George.</p>
                           <p>I have brought away about twenty pieces of artillery from Lake George, together with nearly all the powder, amounting to about thirteen tons.</p>
                           <p>General Fellows, with a ſmall body of militia, but all I could get, are breaking up the road between this and Fort Ann, and felling trees into it. I will throw every obſtacle in their route I poſſibly can, and retard their progreſs as much as poſſible. For this purpoſe, I ſhall diſengage myſelf of every thing cumberſome, the artillery eſpecially, as I can make no uſe of it.</p>
                           <p>Permit me to aſſure your Excellency, that I ſhall make every reſiſtance I poſſibly can, and that nothing ſhall be left undone to prevent the enemy from penetrating farther in the country.</p>

                           <p>I have ſaved about forty pieces of cannon, and fifteen tons of powder. The cannon I ſhall ſend to Saratoga, to get carriages made for them at that place.

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 7th inſtant is before me. I doubt not but that you will have parties of Indians about you. Thoſe you mention ſeem to have been very quiet ones, for they not only ſhewed themſelves, but ſtood and talked with a Negroe. You muſt expect that ſome miſchief will be done, but that ought not to diſcourage the people. If only a ſmall portion of your militia turn out, you will drive them off. The garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Fort Schuyler will be ſufficiently ſtrong when your detachment arrives, but as ſoon as I can afford troops to go into that quarter, I ſhall ſend them. We muſt oppoſe the enemy where they ſhew themſelves, that is here, at preſent; and although Ticonderoga is abandoned, I am nevertheleſs not afraid that they will be able to get much lower into the country. Keep up the ſpirits of the people, and all will be well.</p>

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 10th inſtant I have received. The information that four or five hundred Indians were on their way to New-Perth is totally groundleſs. There are not even any ſo high up Wood Creek as Fort Ann, where we have a large body of troops. If it was neceſſary to ſend troops to White Creek, I would moſt readily do it. My care ſhall be extended to every quarter, and if my countrymen will ſupport me with vigour and activity, we ſhall be able to prevent the enemy from penetrating much farther into the country; but if they ſuffer their ſpirits to ſink, and meanly deſpond, the word of conſequences are to be apprehended.</p>
                           <p>I am informed that ſeveral people, forgetting the duty they owe their country, diſcourage the good inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and are ready to take protection from the enemy. Any that have made ſuch declarations, I would adviſe to have immediately ſecured and ſent priſoners to Albany.</p>
                           <p>The enemy's view, in offering protection, is only to prevent the inhabitants from acting ſpiritedly; to get into the country, and, when once there, to plunder indiſcriminately, as well thoſe that may have relied on their promiſes, as thoſe that have gloriouſly ſtepped forth for the defence of their country, and thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which they can only enjoy by having that country free. Let every one therefore exert himſelf, and all will go well.</p>

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 11th inſtant I received laſt night. I ſhould be extremely happy if I had it in my power to afford you the aſſiſtance you requeſt, but in fact I have not that number of militia in this quarter. From every intelligence I can procure, the enemy mean to bend their force this way, and it would therefore be highly imprudent to weaken the army in this quarter.</p>
                           <p>I would, by all means, adviſe that the cattle of every kind, and carriages, ſhould be moved from every townſhip expoſed to the incurſions of the enemy's parties, and which cannot be covered by the troops or militia, to ſome more interior places of ſafety.</p>
                           <p>I have already ordered a conſiderable quantity of powder and ball to be ſent on to Colonel Warner. If more of the former ſhould be wanted, it will be ſent on application. As to fire-arms, I have not one, and many of the troops are without, conſequently cannot give any.</p>

Secure all the cattle and carriages you can. Much depends upon preventing them from getting ſupplies of that kind. Advance as near to the enemy as you poſſibly can. Secure all tories, and ſend them to the interior part of the country. Be vigilant; a ſurpriſe is inexcuſable. Thank the troops, in my name, for behaving ſo well as you ſay they did at Hubbarton. Aſſure them that I will get whatever I can to make them comfortable. All of your regiment that were here are already on the way to join you. If we act vigorouſly, we ſave the country. Why ſhould we deſpond? Greater misfortunes have happened, and have been retrieved. Cheer up the ſpirits of the people in your quarter.</p>

                           <p>BOTH your letters of this day have been delivered me.</p>
                           <p>I am quite in opinion with you and General Fellows, that deſtroying the cauſeway will be a very material obſtruction to the enemy's march. I beg therefore that you will do it in the moſt effectual manner, as I hope that of ſelling trees acroſs the road is done; but unleſs both roads are compleatly ſtopped, it will be of little avail. You will therefore pleaſe, as ſoon as that which leads by Jones's is done, to go upon that which leads paſt Huffnagel's, and ſtop that alſo.</p>
                           <p>You will obſerve by my orders to General Fellows, that he was directed to ſend parties to the different farm houſes, to drive off all the cattle. This you will pleaſe to do without exception, leaving only the milch cows with ſuch families as cannot move off.</p>
                           <p>You will alſo bring away the ſcows, and all the iron work from Jones's and Huffnagel's mills, or ſee they do it themſelves, that the enemy may not have the advantage of thoſe mills.</p>
                           <p>Pray keep out ſcouts continually, and order them to go as far beyond Fort Ann as poſſible. When you have compleatly carried into execution what is hereby directed, you will adviſe me thereof, that I may give directions or your future deſtination.</p>

                           <p>IT gives me great pain that I am not in a capacity directly to anſwer your letter of the 15th inſtant. As an officer of the Honourable the Congreſs, who repreſent the Thirteen United States of America. I cannot with propriety take notice of a Fourteenth State, unknown in their Confederacy. In order that the public ſervice may not ſuffer, I ſhall however anſwer your letter, which, for the reaſons already aſſigned, I am under the neceſſity of doing in your private capacity.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="51" facs="unknown:016142_0050_0F9B8E841F787908"/>That the enemy ſhould fortify at Caſtle-Town is to me exceeding unaccountable. It is certain that a conſiderable body of their troops with General Burgoyne are at Skeenſborough; that, from corroborated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, a body of them are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Lake George.</p>
                           <p>It is, doubtleſs, extremely difficult to move the inhabitants that lie neareſt the enemy, but I ſhould hope that Colonel Warner, ſupported by the militia under Colonel Simmonds, which I have ordered to join him, and with that of the State of New-Hampſhire, and ſuch as can be collected from the more ſouthern parts of what are commonly called the Grants, would be able to effect this buſineſs in a very great meaſure.</p>
                           <p>The enemy, by the beſt accounts, are not above ſix thouſand; and, if it be true that they are diſpoſed of as I have mentioned, the body at Caſtle-Town cannot be conſiderable.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered ſuch perſons as are going to the enemy for protections to be ſeized, and ſent priſoners to me. Three have been delivered to me, and I have ſent them to goal in Albany. I think it would be right to adopt a ſimilar conduct, eſpecially to thoſe who are not yet ſo much in their power as to be obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept protection from them.</p>
                           <p>I have delivered Captain Fitch a proclamation, of which I wiſh you to make copies, and diſtribute them in the country neareſt the enemy.</p>

                           <p>I AM this moment informed by Captain Fitch, that the New-Hampſhire militia are marching to join me. It is not my intention, much as I am in want of troops, that they ſhould come hither, as it would expoſe the country in that quarter to the depredations of the enemy. I therefore incloſe you an order for them to join you. If none are arrived, you will ſend expreſs for them. I hope when they come you will be able, if not to attack the enemy, at leaſt to advance ſo near as to bring off the well affected and ſecure the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.

                           <p>The ſubſtance of Colonel Harper's and Mr. Johnſon's information had been tranſmitted about a month ago; in conſequence whereof I ſent Colonel Van Schaick into Tryon county, with as many troops as I could collect. After the improper agreement made by General Herkimer, theſe troops marched back; but as ſoon as I was informed of their march, I ordered them to remain in Tryon county, where they are ſtill, and I have ſeat up Colonel Weſion's continental regiment to reinforce theſe; but, if I may be allowed to judge of the temper of General Herkimer and the Committee of Tryon county from their letters to me, nothing will ſatisfy them, unleſs I march the whole army into that quarter.</p>
                           <p>With deference to the better judgment of the Council of Safety, I cannot, by any means, think it prudent to bring on an open rupture with the ſavages at this time. The inhabitants of Tryon county, as you will have perceived by copy of ſome letters which I have had the honour to tranſmit you, are already too much inclined to lay down their arms, and <hi>take what terms the enemy may pleaſe to afford them.</hi> Half of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia from this county, and the neighbouring State of Maſſachuſetts, we have been under the neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing, leſt the whole ſhould go, and I believe what are left will only remain a few days. The continental troops I have in this quarter are under three thouſand, and the enemy encreaſing with tories, who daily join them in very conſiderable numbers. Should we, in this ſituation, precipitate a rupture with the Indians, we ſhould probably involve ourſelves in the moſt inextricable difficulties. If I ſhould aſk the Indians for leave to build a fort at Onioquago, I am very certain that they would refuſe me, and prejudice us in their minds. I have hopes that they will meet me at Albany in a week or two. If they do, I ſhall be under no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that they will join againſt us.</p>

Our continental force is between twenty-ſeven and twenty-eight hundred. With this ſmall body we have to encounter a much more numerous body of enemy, well appointed, fluſhed with ſucceſs, and daily encreaſing by the acquiſition of tories. Happy I ſhould ſtill be, in ſome degree, if I could cloſe the melancholy tale here; but every letter I receive from the county of Tryon adviſes me that the inhabitants of it will lay down their arms, unleſs I ſupport them with continental troops. From what I have ſaid, you will ſee the impoſſibility of my complying with their requeſt.

                           <p>It is very true, that, in direct violation of the contract with the carpenters, their tools were taken from them.

We had not a carpenter's tool left in this department, our whole ſtock having been loſt at Ticonderoga. I had gun carriages to make, and others to mend, a bridge to throw over Hudſon's River, for the ſecurity of the country, and all that variety of carpentry to be done, which is ever neceſſary with an army. In ſhort, Sir, I labour under a thouſand difficulties at preſent for want of a ſufficiency of tools. Their complaint that the tools were taken from them is juſt. They are to be paid for them; but I cannot remove the cauſe by reſtoring the tools, without ſacrificing the country.</p>

You will pleaſe to repair to Mancheſter, the place where the troops above mentioned are collected and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and take the command of the whole. As General Burgoyne is advancing towards us, and a movement of a body of troops from the Grants towards Skeenſborough will doubtleſs much embarraſs him, and will certainly oblige him to leave a conſiderable force at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you ſhould find there, or thoſe that may join, are in ſuch numbers as that you can do it without riſking too much.</p>

                           <p>I HAVE this moment received your letter of yeſterday's date. The information you gave me made me bluſh for my countrymen.</p>
                           <p>Is it becoming rational beings, when a misfortune has happened to them, to deſpond, and not to counteract the evil? Surely not; and if the militia would do their duty, we ſhould ſoon make the enemy repent their ever having come into the country, and retreat with infinitely more loſs than we have experienced; but if the militia will ſit ſtill, folding their hands, and not make uſe of thoſe exertions which God has put it in their power to make uſe of for their own defence, they certainly will become the victims of an enemy, whoſe very mercies are cruelty. How, Sir, can you think that I can ſpare men, when I have applied to you for men? Exert yourſelves! Shew that you are men, and you will find men in numbers, and your enemies will vaniſh. We are all in good ſpirits. Be you ſo too, and do not create enemies by deſponding.</p>

                           <p>I RETURNED here laſt night to meet ſome Indians, who are deputed to me on buſineſs which they are to diſcloſe at twelve to-day. Our army is at Stillwater, twenty-two miles north of this, where we wiſh to make a ſtand, and will do it, if ſupported by militia, none of which are yet arrived, nor any on the march. General Burgoyne's head-quarters were at Fort Edward on the fourth inſtant, and I am informed that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes moving down in a few days. Great ſickneſs begins to prevail in our army, chiefly occaſioned, I believe, by living altogether on freſh meat, we not having had any ſalted meat for about twenty days paſt, there being next to none, nor any to be procured. The very little we have is kept for ſcouting parties.</p>
                           <p>At ſix this morning an expreſs arrived from Tryon county, adviſing me
<q>That General Herkimer march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 3d inſtant to ſupport the garriſon at Fort Schuyler; that on Wedneſday, between Oriſko and the fort, the militia were attacked, and, according to the information received, the militia entirely cut to pieces, the General killed, with moſt of the field officers. The number of the enemy that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>e the attack is no wiſe aſcertained, but are thought to be very numerous. The fort, by all the accounts received, was attacked before the militia marched, but in what manner we know not; whether by Indians firing with ſmall arms at a diſtance, to confine our people within the fort, or whether their main body was near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced or not, I cannot ſay; therefore hope you will immediately ſend aſſiſtance, or this quarter muſt of courſe fall into the enemy's hands, as the whole of the militia was in the engagement, except a few guards that were ſtationed in different places.</q>
This from Lieut. Col. Deygert of the militia, and I have not had a line from any one elſe on the ſubject. The garriſon, as the Deputy Commiſſary General informs me in a letter of the 4th inſtant, is provided with 500 barrel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>THE ſituation of affairs in the weſtern quarter will detain me, at leaſt, until to-morrow. Fort Schuyler is inveſted, and has been ſo ſome days.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered up more batteaus to Fort's, to aſſiſt in bringing down the ſtores that are there.</p>

                           <p>In vain have I exerted every nerve to procure a body of men to march to its relief. The militia of this county, in every part of it, are borne down by the tories.

                           <p>A BRIGADE of continental troops, under the command of Brigadier General Learned, is on its march to the relief of Fort Schuyler. Let me beg you to exert yourſelves to the utmoſt ſpeedily to collect the militia of your county, and join General Learned. Upon your exertions the ſafety of our country greatly depends; and as the force ordered to your aſſiſtance is reſpectable, I confidently hope that you will act with ſpirit, and manfully join in repulſing the enemy, which I have not the leaſt doubt but you will be able to effect, if your exertions are equal to your abilities.</p>

                           <p>IT gives me great ſatisfaction that you have offered to go and conduct the military operations in Tryon county. You will pleaſe to repair thither with all convenient ſpeed, and take upon you the command of all the continental troops, and ſuch of the militia as you can prevail upon to join your troops. Fort Schuyler being beſieged, you will haſten to its relief, and I hope that the continental troops now in the county of Tryon, if joined by ſome of the militia, will be adequate to the buſineſs. Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck is very well acquainted, not only with the country, but with many of the Indians, and will be capable of doing you good ſervice. Permit me therefore to recommend him to your attention.</p>
                           <p>Henry Glen, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is Aſſiſtant Deputy Quarter Maſter General at Schenectady, to whom you will apply for aſſiſtance in waggons and batteaus. If you could procure ſuch a number of waggons as to convey the mens packs, it would greatly expedite your march. Orders are given to ſend on a ſupply of proviſions. You will, however, not be retarded on that account, as the country is capable of affording a ſufficiency for your troops.</p>
                           <p>Colonel Van Dyck will inform you of the names of the Colonels of militia in Tryon county, and although I have already written to General Herkimer and the General Committee of the county to draw forth their militia, yet it will be proper for you, as ſoon as you join the troops marched under the command of General Learned, to expedite expreſſes, entreating that the militia may be collected at the German Flats by the time you may arrive there.</p>
                           <p>A ſmall regiment, commanded by Colonel Livingſton, is at John's-Town. The inhabitants of Caghna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waga have offered to hold that poſt, if Colonel Livingſton ſhould be ordered up. You will be better enabled to judge of the propriety of moving him when you arrive there, and will do what you judge beſt.</p>
                           <p>Although the Mohawk Indians are far from being friendly to us, yet it would greatly prejudice our cauſe if they were inſulted. You will therefore take every precaution to prevent it. The Oneidas have friendly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents towards us, and muſt be cheriſhed. They may perhaps be induced to take an active part in our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Incloſe you a warrant for one thouſand dollars in ſpecie, which you will pleaſe to make uſe of in order to conciliate the Oneidas, and to induce them to aſſiſt you. Be pleaſed to aſſure them that I wiſh to ſee them as ſoon as they can come down, and that I have provided a genteel preſent for them.</p>
                           <p>The inhabitants of Tryon county are cheifly Germans, eſpecially thoſe at the German Flats. I think it would ſerve a good purpoſe to extol the action under General Herkimer, to praiſe their bravery, and give aſſurances that you wiſh to be joined by men, who have ſo bravely defended themſelves. Compliment General Herkimer, and pleaſe to make mine to him.</p>
                           <p>It is not only impoſſible, but needleſs, to be more particular. I ſhall therefore only add that if Fort Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhould unhappily have fallen into the enemy's hands, that you will then ſo diſpoſe of the troops as beſt to cover the country.</p>
                           <p>I have ordered on a quantity of ammunition from Albany. If it is not yet gone, pray take it with you. I very much queſtion whether more lead can be ſpared, as none of that from Peek's Kill which was deſigned for this department is come up. If you ſhould think the quantity of powder I have ordered to be inſufficient, you can take more. It is beſt you ſhould carry it on with you.</p>

I ſhould charge myſelf with a want of candour to that reſpectable character, if I did not acknowledge that I believe, nay that I know, that he afforded me every aid it was in his power to give. I could dwell with ſatisfaction on the many marks of attention which I have experienced from his hands, but in this place it would be improper. I therefore proceed to lay before the Court ſome papers, which will exhibit my conduct after I was ſuperceded, together with ſome from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, evincive of the confidence they ſtill repoſed in me.</p>

                           <p>ON the 14th inſtant about three hundred Indians (including men, women and children) of the Oneidas, Tuſcaroras, and a few Onondagos and Mohawks, arrived here.

They have already taken about thirty priſoners, and intercepted ſome diſpatches from General Burgoyne to General Powel, commanding at Ticonderoga.

                           <p>YOUR favour of the 12th ult. I had the honour to receive on the ſecond inſtant. I feel myſelf much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by your friendly wiſhes for my happineſs. The ſentiments I have been happy enough to entertain of your humanity and ſenſibility have encreaſed with my misfortunes, nor ſhall ought ever be able to efface them.</p>
                           <p>On the ſecond inſtant, two Britiſh officers, on their return to Canada, took ſhelter in a violent ſtorm of rain in my little hut, the only remains of all my buildings in this quarter. In the courſe of converſation, I found that the one was attached to General Carleton, the other to General Burgoyne. Carleton was faulted by the one for keeping more troops in Canada than what were neceſſary. An alternation enſued, and, from what paſſed, I had every reaſon to conclude that the number now in Canada, including the garriſon of Ticonderoga, does not exceed two thouſand. I ſpeak of thoſe in Canada proper, excluſive of the garriſon of Oſwegatchie, Niagara, and the upper poſts, which, from the converſation of theſe officers, I concluded to be between 1500 and 2000.</p>
                           <p>Whether it was poſſible to have ſent a body of troops immediately after the Convention of this place to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga I will not venture n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If ſo, it argues that they are too weak in Canada to ſupport that garriſon in caſe of an attack.</p>
                           <p>Impelled, Sir, by that affection for my country, which not all the injuries I have ſuſtained have been able to ſhake, I venture to ſuggeſt to Congreſs, that I can conceive an irruption into Canada in the enſuing win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be attended with a variety of happy conſequences, which will readily occur to Congreſs, provided that the force employed be ſo reſpectable as to create ſuch a confidence in the Canadians, as would induce them to join our arms for the preſervation of the country after we ſhould have entered it. Perhaps five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men would be ſufficient.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="57" facs="unknown:016142_0056_0F9B8DCF41F772D0"/>I am well aware that a winter's expedition is attended with more difficulties than will offer to a ſuperficial obſerver; but I am very far from thinking them inſurmountable, provided that meaſures are purſued without delay, and the proper officers exert themſelves in the execution of the orders they receive. Congreſs may, perhaps, determine on ſuch an expedition. I ſhall therefore take the liberty to ſay, if they do, that the men who go on this ſervice ſhould, beſides their ordinary under-cloaths, be provided each with a good woollen cap, a ſhort, but good, blanket coat, with a cape to turn over the cap, to prevent the ſnow falling on the neck, each two chequered woollen ſhirts, a woollen pair of breeches, two pair of good woollen ſtockings, a pair of Indian legings, ſo long as to come up to the crotch, a pair of good Indian ſhoes, and a pair of Engliſh ſhoes, with a pair of good warm ſocks, and a pair of ſtout mittens, and not to be ſuffered to carry any other cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

One thouſand pair of ſnow ſhoes ſhould alſo be provided, 100 pair of ſkates, 100 hand machines for firing veſſels or buildings, 2000 muſket wooden cartridges, canes with ſpikes, to be filled with a combuſtible compoſition, to be ſhot into veſſels or buildings. Each man to be alſo furniſhed with a powder horn and bullet pouch. Two thouſand ſpare ſtand of arms ſhould alſo be carried on, to furniſh ſuch Canadians as might be willing to engage with us. All theſe articles ſhould be collected at Albany, to be delivered to the troops immediately before they are to march. One thouſand men ſhould alſo be ſent without delay to Skeenſborough, by the way of Fort Ann, from whence they ſhould take down in rafts the boards that remain at the ſaw-mill near that place, none of which have been deſtroyed by the enemy, and 16000 are left there, a number ſufficient not only to cover the men comfortably, but alſo the proviſions, of which a quantity, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient for 5000 men for three months, ſhould be carried to Skeenſborough in the courſe of the winter, and biſcuit ſent inſtead of flour. Before the march of the troops from thence, the Commiſſary ſhould pick of the beſt pork ſufficient for the army for fifteen days, and have it well boiled, then laid out to freeze, and packed up again, that the men may not be under the neceſſity of cooking on their march.</p>
                           <p>As it will require 1500 carriages to move ſuch a body of troops, and two of the three months proviſions, with all the other ſtores, a great quantity of hay ſhould be purchaſed, packed, and diſpoſed of in ſuch place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as I apprehend that a ſufficient number of hired ſleds could not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently procured, I would adviſe that 500 common co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As it is in vain to attempt to carry on ſuch an enterprize in a ſecret manner, application ſhould be made to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of Maſſachuſetts and this State to aid in procuring the ſleds, that every farmer who is to furniſh one may prepare himſelf in time, and the Committee of each diſtrict ſhould be obliged to deliver the ſleds they are to furniſh at ſuch rendezvous as the officer commanding the expedition ſhould direct.</p>
                           <p>The whole ſhould be in readineſs to move as ſoon as the Lakes have taken, which will probably be by the middle of February; and if Ticonderoga ſhould be abandoned, the army might move that way, if not, by the way of Caſtle-Town and Otter-Creek, ſo as to fall in with the Lake between Crown-Point and the Mouth of Otter-Creek, or, if the Lakes ſhould not be ſtrong enough from thence, then not to approach the Lake until the army reaches Onion River.</p>
                           <p>If it ſhould be aſked what military operations I have in idea to carry on, I would anſwer, whether Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga is or will be abandoned or not, I would adviſe in the firſt place to ſecure Iſle-aux-Noix, and the army to halt there for three or four days, and all the ſleds employed to bring timber on it for erecting a fortification; and before the army left it, five or ſix rows of ſtrong and heavy pickets ſhould be drove in the ſhip channel, which is there very narrow, and not deep, to prevent the enemy's ſhipping from getting into the Lake. If St. John's ſhould not be reduced before the ſpring of the year, as I ſuſpect it would not, at Iſle-aux-Noix three hundred men, under the command of a judicious officer, ſhould be left, with directions to fortify himſelf in the beſt manner he could. The reſt of the army ſhould then proceed towards St. John's, which I ſuppoſe the enemy would not abandon; and if it was found impracticable to form the ſiege, becauſe of the froſt and ſnow, one thouſand men ſhould be left to blockade it. The remainder of the army ſhould then proceed to reduce Chamble, which would be the work of a day or two, and then go on to Montreal, and ſecure what ſtores might be left there by the enemy, and take all the merchandize that would be uſeful for the army, and ſend it to Albany, paying the French merchants a generous price by bills on France, if Congreſs has a fund there to draw on, as I have been informed they have, nothing to ſuch of the Engliſh as have been our enemies, when we were in Canada in 1775 and 1776. When at Montreal, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer will be able to judge with certainty what force the enemy can gather in Canada to oppoſe him, and, if he finds that he can ſpare a detachment, he ſhould lend it to Oſwegatchie, to ſecure or deſtroy the enemy's ſhipping, which are always laid up at that place. This buſineſs appears to me of the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as it would not only be a great ſtep towards the reduction of Niagara, if Congreſs ſhould attempt in the next campaign to get poſſeſſion of that very important paſs, and which, if in our hands, would have a variety of ſuch obvious good conſequences that I need not mention them; but it would alſo be neceſſary, in order to ſecure a retreat that way, which, if a retreat is neceſſary, I would rather wiſh than by the way of Champlain, if St. John's ſhould hold out ſo long as that the enemy might ſend forces into Canada from New-York or elſewhere. It may be aſked, why I ſhould with a retreat by Ontario, and how it could be effected? To the firſt I anſwer, becauſe meaſures may be taken to reinforce the army at their arrival at Oſwego by troops from Albany, thence to proceed to the reduction of Niagara, if Congreſs thought proper; if not, they might return by the way of Fort Schuyler. To the ſecond, that all the batteaus in the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Montreal, might be collected, and thoſe would probably be ſufficient to convey all the troops, if not, an additional number might ſoon be conſtructed; and for that and other buſineſs one hundred carpenters ſhould be ſent with the army into Canada. Nor ſhould the Commanding Officer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, when at Montreal, to take hoſtages from the Cagnawaga and Canaſwago Indians, who will be in his power, for their peaceable behaviour, and thoſe ſhould be ſent to theſe parts without delay. If St. John's
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:016142_0057_0F9B8E8B2F8F5E88"/>
ſhould be reduced, I think it is pretty certain that a body of troops appearing before Ticonderoga the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon would ſurrender, ſhould they not abandon it this fall, or on ſeeing our preparations for going into Canada. It would therefore be neceſſary to collect a body of troops, not only for that purpoſe, if neceſſary, but, if Ticonderoga ſhould be abandoned, to be ſent into Canada, to reinforce the army there in ſuch a manner as that the country might be kept, and, if poſſible, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of theſe troops, batteaus ſhould be built at Fort George, and begun upon as ſoon as advice is received that the army is got into Canada. But if the army ſhould be obliged to retreat, this expence may be thought needleſs. Not at all; for, if they retreat by Champlain, they may want boats; if by Ontario, the boats may be eaſily conveyed into Hudſon's river, and from thence into the Mohawk river, to carry on proviſions for the troops to go to Niagara, ſhould an expedition be determined on; but whether it is or not, it would be imprudent not to prepare in ſuch a manner as that troops might be ſent to Canada, if it ſhould be found neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>Congreſs will perceive that great exertions are neceſſary for ſuch an enterprize, and that the officer who commands it, let him be who he will, will require aſſiſtance. And although I firmly reſolve to quit the army as ſoon as the examination into my conduct ſhall be made, and not again venture on the boiſterous ocean of public life, in which I have been ſo miſerably buffetted by ſtorms, yet, as a private gentleman, and without fee or reward, I will give every aid in my power to procure every neceſſary, and make uſe of every exertion for the ſucceſs of the enterprize, if Congreſs ſhould think fit to order the attempt to be made.</p>

                           <p>ON the 12th of January laſt we did ourſelves the honour to inform Congreſs of the reſult of our delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpecting Indian affairs in this department. They will be pleaſed to obſerve, from the incloſed copy of a letter from Mr. Deane, the Interpreter, that our opinion of the temper of the Senecas and Cayugas was but too well founded. Thoſe haughty nations cannot brook the diſgrace which they ſuſtained from the militia of Tryon county, under the late brave and worthy General Herkimer, near the German Flats, and from the Garriſon of Fort Schuyler, under the command of the gallant Colonel Ganſevoort. Their reſentment has undoubtedly been highly irritated by the infidious arts and bribes of our enemies, who, at a treaty held at Niagara, and which is juſt concluded, have had an opportunity to give an edge to their animoſity. The On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondagoes we are apprehenſive will alſo be drawn in to manifeſt the ſame hoſtile ſpirit. From theſe unfavourable circumſtances, there is too much reaſon to believe that an expedition will be formed againſt the weſtern frontiers of this State, Virginia and Pennſylvania, in concert with the Britiſh troops, Ottowas, Chippewas, Wio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>dots, Mingoes and other tribes. It is therefore, with the utmoſt anxiety, that we wait for the direction of Congreſs in anſwer to our laſt diſpatches, without which we ſhall be at an utter loſs how to proceed. It is our opinion that vigorous preparations ought to be made, not only to defend the frontiers, but to chaſtiſe thoſe nations, by carrying the war, if poſſible, into their country. Till they feel the power and the juſt reſentment of the United States, there can be no ſafety for the defenceleſs inhabitants. The militia, who loſt their leaders and many of their braveſt men at the German Flats, ſuffered the additional misfortune of being deprived of their crops. If they ſhould again be called upon in planting or harveſt time, their families muſt be deprived of all ſubſiſtence. Indeed, they are very ſore from what they have already ſuffered, and want time to repair their paſt calamities. Little therefore can be expected from their exertions, willing as they may be to give their aid. The Oneidas and Tuſcaroras are ſtill very friendly; but, ſo far from being capable of an active part, are under well grounded apprehenſions of falling victims to the rage of their ſavage neighbours. They call upon the United States, in whoſe cauſe they took up the hatchet, and are in danger, to protect them, and it is become indiſpenſably neceſſary to erect ſome fortreſs, and ſtation a ſmall garriſon in their country, for the ſecurity of their women and children. We flatter ourſelves that the Commanding Officer of this department will have inſtructions to receive our information, and to make immediate preparations for the defence of the frontiers and protection of our allies. The garriſon of Fort Schuyler, which conſiſts only of one regiment, may be able to defend that fortreſs, but cannot repel the incurſions and ravages of the enemy; and, if it ſhould ſo happen that Tryon county and the weſtern diſtricts of Albany ſhould be deſerted, to ſay nothing of the diſtreſs of individuals, the difficulties of ſupplying the army with flour would be inſermount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The treaty will be held about the middle of the month. We cannot defer it long, and ſhall be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the utmoſt anxiety by the inſtructions from the Honourable Congreſs, which we hope are on the way, or will be handed to us by the return of this expreſs without loſs of time. We muſt, if left to ourſelves, do the beſt in our power, making uſe of the liberty given Mr. Duane to alter the ſpeech, ſo that it may be adapted to circumſtances.</p>

                           <p>I DO myſelf the honour to incloſe the proceedings of the Commiſſioners of Indian affairs at the laſt treaty, held at John's-Town. The Board of Commiſſioners intended to have addreſſed the Honourable Congreſs in an official letter, which was prevented by the departure of Mr. Duane and Mr. Edwards, who were obliged by a ſudden thaw to haſten from John's-Town before the buſineſs of the Indians was compleated, left the ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rivers ſhould have prevented them from reaching their families.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Duane, the gentlemen mentioned in the minutes, as well as the Commiſſioners, were unanimouſly of opinion that it was abſolutely neceſſary to threaten the ſavages with chaſtiſement, as the only means left, ſhort of actual chaſtiſement, to induce them to obſerve a ſtrict neutrality.</p>
                           <p>Whether it will have the wiſhed for effect, the reſult of the Council to be held at Onondago, of which we expect to be informed in about forty days, muſt determine. But, from the accounts received of their hitherto inimical diſpoſition and revengeful reſolutions, the gentlemen, I think, unanimouſly believed that ſuch of the Mohawks as have fled from their country, a majority of the Onondagoes, and the Cayugas and Senecas in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, will commence hoſtilities againſt us as ſoon as they conveniently can, and that it would therefore be prudent early to take meaſures to carry the war into their country, as it would not require a greater body of troops to deſtroy their towns than what would be neceſſary to protect the frontier inhabitants, who already labour under the greateſt apprehenſions that they will ſoon experience the ravages and cruelty of thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Since my return to this place, I have been honoured with a letter from the Legiſlature of this State, covering petitions from the inhabitants of Schohary, Cherry-Valley, Charlotte River, Delaware and Harper's Field, praying the Legiſlature for aſſiſtance. As it is not in the power of the Commiſſioners to afford any aid to theſe expoſed ſettlements, I have communicated the contents of the letter and petitions to the Marquis de la Fayette, that he may take meaſures to enable the inhabitants to remain on their plantations.</p>
                           <p>Before I left John's-Town, an account which we had received that the enemy meant to take poſt at Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wego was confirmed by the information of a truſty Indian, whom I had reaſon to believe had good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for what he aſſerted. Should this really be the caſe, there will be little hope left that the Indians will remain neuter. I cannot avoid ſuggeſting, that I ſuſpect the enemy intend to proſecute the plan which the French began in 1753, and to approach our frontiers with a line of ſorts, from whence the Indians may be ſupplied with every neceſſary, ſent out to harraſs us, and to which they may retire after an excurſion on our frontiers. As ſuch a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>euvre would not only prove extremely diſtreſſing to us, but alſo oblige us to keep a large body of troops on the interior frontiers, Congreſs will pardon me if I expreſs a wiſh that early and moſt vigorous meaſures may be taken to counteract it. Perhaps the moſt, if not the only, effectual means to defeat ſuch an intention of the enemy would be, by ſending a reſpectable army, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain poſſeſſion of Oſwego, but to attempt the reduction of Niagara. The honourable Houſe is too well aware of the various advantages that would reſult to the States from having that paſs in our hands, for me to preſume to point out even a ſingle one. I confeſs that ſuch an expedition would be attended with many difficulties, that many requiſites are to be procured, but if men and ſalted proviſions can be procured, I ſhould imagine every thing elſe might be got in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>adineſs by the laſt of May, provided that orders are given im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. The enemy's ſhipping on Ontario might indeed prove troubleſome, but not ſo as to prevent the troops from croſſing. It is certain they were not able to do it in 1758, when Colonel Bradſtreet took Fort Fron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>tenac. If Congreſs ſhould enter on ſuch a meaſure, perhaps it might be well to cover the real deſign by building the boats on Hudſon's River, and give out that they are intended for the more ſpeedy convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of troops up and down that river.</p>
                           <p>Reflecting that Congreſs might perhaps have in contemplation the reduction of Niagara, or an expedition into Canada through Ontario, I have engaged Louis (commonly called Colonel Lewis, a friendly Caghna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waga, and a man of enterprize, who is going into Canada by the way of Oſwegatchie, with three or four truſty Oneidas) to burn, if poſſible, the enemy's veſſels on Ontario; if not, to attempt the deſtruction of thoſe at St. John's; and have promiſed a thouſand dollars in ſpecie as a reward, if the one or the other is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. I hope for the approbation of Congreſs.</p>
                           <p>Louis, who expects to return in leſs than forty days, is alſo charged to bring me the moſt exact account he can procure of the enemy's force in Canada, the poſts occupied by them, and the numbers at each poſt; to inform himſelf, if poſſible, what military operations the enemy mean to proſecute from Canada in the enſuing campaign, and to engage ſome of our Caghnawaga friends to give the earlieſt intelligence of the movements of the enemy, and of what proviſions and military ſtores may be ſent either to St. John's or up the St. Lawrence.</p>

                           <p>ON the 7th inſtant I received a packet, which I believe was diſpatched from your office, incloſing ſeveral York-Town papers of the 24th ult. which contained copies of Lord North's ſuppoſed motion of the 17th of February, of the two hills in conſequence thereof, and the reſolutions of Congreſs thereon. I am peculiarly happy that the latter coincides ſo perfectly with the ideas I had entertained, declared and propagated of the former. I have the further ſatisfaction to adviſe Congreſs that the ſentiments of all thoſe of my immediate country, with whom I have converſed on the ſubject, are ſimilar to mine, and I have not a doubt but that the people in general will think alike on this important ſubject, notwithſtanding the induſtry of the enemy's agents in ſpreading the bills through the country, and their inſinuations that Great-Britain will yield to every thing except the Independency of the States, and that therefore the ſenſe of the people ought to be taken on that ſubject. A ſeſſion of the Superior Court, which is at preſent held in this city, affords an opportunity of giving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <p>MR. KIRKLAND has tranſmitted me a ſpeech from Oneida, containing a meſſage from the Senecas. Incloſe you an anſwer, which you will pleaſe to communicate, making ſuch additions and alterations as you ſhall judge, from circumſtances that may ariſe, to be neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>If the buſineſs at Onondago terminates according to our wiſhes, and that the Senecas are willing to enter into an alliance with us, I think no time ſhould be loſt to bring them into the field; and therefore wiſh you to take meaſures accordingly, by having it hinted to them, that if a body of their warriors would join Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington it would be an evidence of their ſincerity, and an attonement for paſt miſconduct.</p>
                           <p>I think, if the reſult of the Council at Onondago is favourable, that a meeting with the whole Six Nations would not be improper, perhaps beneficial. I wiſh you to favour us with your opinion on this ſubject as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                           <p>I AM juſt honoured with your favour of the 8th inſtant, covering the hand-bill and paper referred to. Pleaſe to accept of my beſt congratulatory compliments on events, which promiſe happineſs to America and confuſion to her enemies, and my thanks for your polite attention.</p>
                           <p>I have thought it neceſſary to adviſe the Six Nations of Indians of the Alliance with France, and of the rejection of the treaty propoſed by Britain. I hope I have not gone beyond the line of my duty, though I have done it without conſulting my colleagues, as I apprehended that in waiting their arrival we ſhould loſe the opportunity of communicating the intelligence whilſt they were convened at Onondago. Copy of what I have ſaid on the occaſion I have the honour to incloſe.</p>

                           <p>On the 25th inſtant I received a letter from Mr. Deane, on the 27th one from Mr. Kirkland, and yeſterday a ſecond from Mr. Deane, copies of which I have the honour to tranſmit you. The conduct of the ſavages is myſterious and embarraſſing. The twenty Senecas mentioned in Mr. Deane's laſt letter as coming down with a priſoner are expected in a few days. I propoſe detaining them here until the priſoner I wrote for ſome time ago arrives from the ſouthward. Whilſt theſe people are with us, I do not apprehend that any hoſtilities will be committed by the others on the frontiers of this State, and perhaps Congreſs may think it expedient to order troops to be ſent up before they return. I think one thouſand men, with half the garriſon of Fort Schuyler, ſuch militia as may be procured in Tryon county, and ſome of the Oneidas and Tuſcaroras, would be quite ſufficient to burn the Cayuga Town and ſome of the Seneca Villages. Unleſs thoſe people are made to feel our power, they will, I fear, continue hoſtile as long as the enemy keep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Canada, and afford them ſuch ample ſupplies as they have hitherto done.</p>

                           <p>After I had diſpatched the letter in which I expreſſed a wiſh to have the papers I mentioned tranſlated and ſent into Canada, I communicated the matter to Chief Juſtice Jay.

                           <p>YOUR letter of the 16th inſtant, covering reſolutions of Congreſs of the 11th, I had the honour to receive on the 25th at night. I was determined to have commenced my journey to York-Town on this day, but conceive it my duty to delay my departure until the buſineſs directed to the attention of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Indian affairs is adjuſted.</p>
                           <p>Congreſs will be pleaſed to pardon me, if I preſume to obſerve that the object of the expedition, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the chaſtiſement of the Senecas only, does not ſeem to be broad enough, as the Cayugas are equally inſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ent and hoſtile, and that ſome of the Onondagoes are alſo proper objects of puniſhment. Both of theſe lie directly in the route to the Seneca country.</p>
                           <p>I have taken the liberty to incloſe General Gates copy of a letter laſt night received from Mr. Deane (copy of which I have alſo the honour herewith to tranſmit to Congreſs) and obſerved that, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation it contained, the proſecuting of the expedition with all poſſible diſpatch ſeems to have become now more indiſpenſibly neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>I have alſo hinted that the real object of the enterprize ought to be carefully concealed. I do not adduce the reaſons, as they will occur, or probably have already occurred.</p>
                           <p>I do not know if General Gates will conſider himſelf at liberty to order Colonel Ganſevoort's regiment as part of the troops for this ſervice. As it is numerous, and I believe well appointed, may I be permitted to wiſh that they were employed on this occaſion, and that orders be given for the purpoſe. There can be no danger of Fort Schuyler, whilſt the troops for the expedition are in that part of the country, and I humbly apprehend it might be ſafely truſted to a corps of militia, eſpecially if two or three of Colonel Ganſevoort's officers were left, with about twenty-five of his privates.</p>
                           <p>

                           <p>If the Senecas, who went from hence to Head-Quarters, are not yet advertiſed of the death of the Chief they are in ſearch of, I wiſh them to be detained as long as poſſible. Perhaps a pretence of ſending an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to Fort Pitt to enquire for the Indian may anſwer the end.</p>

               <p>Major General Schuyler requeſts that Major General St. Clair may be ſworn.</p>
               <p>Major General St. Clair being ſworn,</p>
               <p>Q. by General Schuyler. During the time I had the honour of having you under my command, did you ever obſerve any neglect of duty in my conduct?</p>
               <p>A. None. As far as it fell within my obſervation, I have ſeen the direct contrary.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's queſtion. If I had been in Ticonderoga during the ſiege, what would have been the probable conſequences?</p>
               <p>A. The immediate conſequences, it appears to me, muſt have been, that the reſt of the department muſt have been neglected; becauſe your post ought to have been at or near Albany, to have collected the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to have urged on the militia for the aid of the whole. Ticonderoga was at a corner of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in an uninhabited part of the country, and the communication to it from any part of the country (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept New-England) acroſs a Lake.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's queſtion. Upon any alarm, did I turn out myſelf and the troops with any degree of alacrity?</p>
               <p>A. Whenever there was an alarm, and I was preſent, I have always ſeen you do it with great alacrity, and you were always preſent yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Court. What did you underſtand the intention of the order of Congreſs was, in appointing you to the command of Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I underſtood it was that I ſhould take the command of that poſt, ſubject to the orders of General Schuyler, or the Commanding Officer in the Northern Department; but I did not expect that he, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer, was perſonally to have taken the command of that poſt from me.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's queſtion to Major Lanſing. Were you at Fort Edward with me immediately after the evacuation of Ticonderoga?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's queſtion. Did you at that time, or at any time before or ſince, obſerve any negligence in my conduct with reſpect to public matters?</p>
               <p>A. I did not; but at that time, and at every other time before and ſince, I obſerved in you the greateſt attention to public matters, as far as came within my obſervation.</p>
               <p>General Schuyler's queſtion. Did I not, immediately after I returned from Ticonderoga, on being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the approach of the enemy, make application to the State of New-York, and to the other States, to endeavour to get out the militia?</p>
               <p>A. You did to the State of New-York and to the Eaſtern States, except Rhode-Iſland, immediately on your return to Saratoga, on being informed of the enemy's approach.</p>
               <p>After the examination of the above witneſſes, the General cloſes his Defence as follows:</p>
               <p>It is incumbent on me to remark that the obſervation made by the Judge Advocate, that I went to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga in conſequence of General St. Clair's letters of the 13th or 18th June, is founded in error, which will appear by a retroſpect of my letter to Congreſs of the 14th from Saratoga, in which I expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them that I arrived at that place on the evening of the 13th, on my way to Ticonderoga, and that at twelve I received an expreſs from General St. Clair, with his letters of the 13th.</p>
               <p>Permit me, Mr. Preſident, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial, briefly to obſerve, that from the beginning of November, 1776, to the latter end of March following, which was a month after I was ſuperceded, my exertions to prepare for the campaign of 1777 were without intermiſſion. That immediately on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment I returned to Albany, and adopted every poſſible meaſure to provide the neceſſaries for the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, to procure intelligence of the enemy's intentions, and to conciliate the affections, or guard againſt the hoſtile intentions, of the Indians; that within eight days after my arrival at Albany I went to viſit Ticonderoga and the northern communication, that I might be perſonally informed of what was neceſſary to be provided or done; that I was on the point of doing the like to Fort Schuyler and the weſtern commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, when General St. Clair's letter arrived, adviſing me of the approach of the enemy; that I loſt not a moment's time in applying for reinforcements both of continental troops and militia; that I was on the way to put myſelf at the head of the ſmall body of militia which had moved, when I received the account of the evacuation of Ticonderoga; that after that my exertions to prevent or retard the enemy's progreſs were without intermiſſion, and not without ſucceſs, until I was, unhappily for me, no longer permitted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the military operations in the Northern Department; that from that time until this day I have never ceaſed affording every aid in my power to give ſucceſs to the glorious cauſe America is engaged in.</p>
               <p>Here, Gentlemen, I ſhall reſt my defence. It has indeed been prolix, but important. Facts and plain narrative, not declamation, have made it ſo. My whole conduct has been, with the utmoſt candour, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your examination, and I hope the reſult of this enquiry will reſtore me to that full confidence, which, at leaſt, the rectitude of my intentions gives me reaſon to expect. I forbear dwelling on the cauſes to which its diminution is to be aſcribed, leſt I ſhould be ſuſpected of a deſign rather to reproach than explain. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be time event, permit me to aſſure you that my affection for my country will continue unimpaired,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016142_0061_0F9B8E8EE92D0400"/>
and that among the lateſt actions of my life will be found the moſt ſincere endeavours to promote her proſperity.</p>
               <p>I cannot diſmiſs this ſubject, without acknowledging my obligations for the candour and patience with which I have been heard, or without expreſſing the high ſenſe I entertain of the attention of his Excellency the Commander in Chief, in inſtituting ſo reſpectable a Court on my trial.</p>
               <p>THE Court, having conſidered the charge againſt Major General Schuyler, the evidence, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, are unanimouſly of opinion that he is NOT GUILTY of any Neglect of Duty in not being at Ticonderoga, as charged, and the Court therefore do acquit him with the higheſt honour.</p>
