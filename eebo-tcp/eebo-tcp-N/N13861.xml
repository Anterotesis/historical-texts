            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I have the heart of a tyrant. I never felt one tender emotion for all the ſufferings of mankind, and I hope to prove that my head is equal to my heart. Permit me, my liege, to ſay that I have ſome merit for paſt ſervices, and for my future deſigns. I have, at a moderate computation, by my attempts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I mean to be a demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devil. I have in my imagination new tortures for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; I mean that my furnace of torture ſhould be ſeventy ſeven times hotter than Nebuchadnezzar's; for a novelty, and to ſhow my genius, I will have a ſaw-mill carried by a ſtream of virgin blood to ſaw off rebels heads!—think of this my liege, and allow me the credit of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Did ever Nero, or Caligula, perform any thing equal to this?</p>

                  <p>As to perſeverance, never fear my falling in that, I am of the blood hound breed, never leave the track, and my beſt friends have for this reaſon call'd me obſtinate. I have ſaid, and I ſwear to it, and ſtand to it, that I'll loſe my crown before I'll give up America.</p>

                  <p>Why, even in that deſperate extremity, I ſhall ſtill have great deſigns left; I mean to perfect my tyranny in Britain if I fail in America; this I can eaſily do by bribing parliaments; and the immenſe increaſe of public burdens will facilitate my deſign; the ſpirits of the people are more and more depreſſed and broken, and the avarice of the great is likewiſe increaſed; the work is eaſy, and I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a little tyrant than a great king. To be a deſpot over the reſt of my dominions, would be a compenſation even for the loſs of America: tyranny has been the plan and purſuit of my life, it is ſweet to my ſoul, and a tyrant I will be, or be nothing.</p>
