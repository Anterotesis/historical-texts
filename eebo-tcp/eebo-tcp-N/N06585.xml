            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And that your Honour may long be continued a rich public Bleſſing to your Country and to Mankind, by exploring and cutting off ſuch as in Contempt of the Laws, would deſtroy our Peace and prevent our Proſperity; and at laſt enjoy the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and eternal Reward of Well-doing, is the conſtant Prayer of him who accounts it his Honour to ſubſcribe himſelf, in all Duty and Obedience,</hi>

            <p>THO' we, of the preſent Generation, are fallen into the very Dregs of Time, wherein, if the Stewards in God's Houſe are faithful to their divine Maſter, they muſt lift up their Voices as Trumpets, to teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify againſt the God-provoking Impieties of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, and warn a ſinful Generation to flee from the Wrath to come: However all their ſolemn Declarations may be reproached with the faſhionable Epithet of Cant and Whine, and their moſt plain and ſcriptural Repreſentations of the dreadful Conſequences of Rebellion againſt Heaven, be eſteemed harſh, ungenteel and unmannerly, by the Gay and polite Sinners of the Age; Yet if Men wou'd but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider this Matter, without any Reſentment of the Preacher's honeſt Plainneſs, only as it is repreſented in the ſacred Cannon, it will appear that the dreadful Confuſion, the amazing Horror and eternal Torments, which will be the inevitable Conſequence of a Life of Impiety, inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably exceeds the utmoſt Reach of their moſt extended Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; enough to make the ſtouteſt hearted Rebel, againſt the moſt high God, fall down and cry out, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved,</hi> from the impending Wrath of a juſt God, that is ready to be poured out on my guilty naked Soul, in one eternal Storm! yea, to lay his Hand upon his Mouth, and his Face in the Duſt, if ſo be, there may be Hope.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould we, for once, put even Eternity out of the Account, and only view the various Miſchiefs done to human
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008356_0004_102F3C2A5CB63070"/>
Society, by the daring Crimes of bold Tranſgreſſors, as well as the Miſeries ſuch bring upon themſelves, even in this World; one would think that a due Conſideration, even of this, might be a ſufficient Reſtraint from groſs Iniquities, to every one that has the leaſt Degree of Benevolence, or Spark of Self-Love dwelling in his Heart. Yet, alas! ſuch is that Tyranny which the unbridled Luſts of abandon'd Sinners, exerciſe over their rational Powers, that they thoughtleſsly, hurry on in the full Career of ſenſual Gratifications; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Deſtruction and Miſery is in their Way, nor once regarding the Miſchief they are doing to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, whereof they are Members; whilſt by their Contempt of all Laws, both Divine and Human, they are really the Troublers of God's People, bringing crimſon Guilt on the Land, and pulling down complicated Judgments upon the Inhabitants thereof; and when God's People are not vigilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful to bring ſuch to ſuitable Puniſhment, their criminal Connivance, or indolent Negligence, inhances common Guilt, and brings down aggravated Wrath: Whereas, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when the Powers, which are ordained of God, exert themſelves to their utmoſt to detect and puniſh Evil-doers, they hereby become Miniſters of God for Good to his People, remove Guilt, and prevent Judgments. Thus it was in the Caſe of Achan, whoſe Crime, Trial, Confeſſion and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have the Record of in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>As I have already, both for the Benefit of the condemned Criminal, now before me, and alſo of the Public, from Joſhua's Advice to Achan, Ver. 19, took Occaſion to point out, and enforce this Criminal's Duty, to make a full, free and unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved public Confeſſion of his Crimes, by which he has forfeited his Life, and a faithful Diſcovery of all his Aſſociates in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: So as we are now aſſembled to ſee the Execution of a juſt Sentence pronounced upon him, and witneſs his ſuffering the Penalty of the Law, which he has broken, and behold him violently cut off from the Land of the Living; as being ſo miſchevious to Community, that he deſerves not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Member of human Society: Allow me to ſuggeſt to you a few Things on this melancholly Occaſion, from the Words of Joſhua to Achan, juſt before his Execution. You doubtleſs remember Theft was the Crime for which Achan was both indicted and executed. The ſad Affair ſtood thus:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008356_0005_102F3C2F2A4EB040"/>
Upon the miraculous Reduction of Jericho, Achan, contrary to an Expreſs divine Prohibition, Chap. vi. Ver. 18, feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly takes away ſundry Goods, with a Wedge of Gold, which he hid under the Earth in his Tent: Soon after Joſhua ſends three Thouſand Men on an Expedition againſt Ai, but on their firſt Attack they fled before the Men of that Place, and returned with the Loſs of Thirty-ſix Men. Joſhua, ſenſible of the Cauſe by the Effect, that a jealous God was ſome way provoked, rent his Cloaths, fell upon his Face to the Earth, with the Elders of Iſrael, in which Poſture he and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till Even-Tide; when Joſhua prays to God to diſcover the Reaſon of ſo ſhameful a Defeat. God anſwers his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhews him the Reaſon, gives Direction to find out the Felon, and orders what Death he ſhall die. Thereupon Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua ariſes early in the Morning, and by attending the divine Direction given him, Achan is taken, whom Joſhua exhorts to make a public and full Confeſſion of his Crime; with this he readily complies; and his Confeſſion appears true, by the ſtolen Goods being found in the Spot where he ſaid he had hid them; then the Children of Iſrael take and bring him to the Place of Execution, where Joſhua previouſly addreſſes him in the Words of my Text, both by Way of Query and awful Threatning, <hi>Why haſt thou troubled us? the Lord ſhall trouble thee this Day;</hi> q. d. Can you poſſibly offer any Reaſon to juſtify your Conduct, in abuſing and thus troubling the whole Camp of Iſrael, by provoking God to anger with them? Know aſſuredly, it will be repaid this Day; we are ordered to take thee from the Land of the Living, and ſend thee to God's dread Tribunal, to anſwer for all thy Crimes, nor can one Day's Reprieve be allowed thee from the Execution of that Sentence of Death thou art now under.</p>
            <p>WHAT I deſign, further from the Words, is to ſhew:</p>
            <p>I. How it is, that notorious Sinners trouble God's People.</p>
            <p>II. WHAT Troubles ſuch undergo, when God brings them to condign Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>III. MAKE ſome ſuitable Improvement.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> I am to ſhew, how it is that notorious Sinners Trouble God's People. And in general: They trouble them in their whole common Courſe of Life. All their Schemes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed and proſecuted, ſome Way or other, to the Damage
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008356_0006_102F3C32E3069D20"/>
and Injury of the Publick. They ſet up their own private and perſonal Intereſt, above that of the Community; nay, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Oppoſition to it, and purſue it in ſuch a Way, as that if they ſucceed, the publick Intereſt muſt neceſſarily ſink. It is one of the firſt Maxims with this Sort of Vermin, that it is no Matter what Injury is done to any particular Perſon, or what Damage accrues to Communities, if it is but ſubſervient to their own private Advantage, nor do they regard how ſhameful, ſordid and vile the Methods are, in which they purſue it, if they are but ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>BUT particularly, ſuch trouble God's People, by ruining the Intereſt of the Publick. Every Body Politic, whether Kingdom, Province, Colony or Corporation, has an Intereſt of its own, in which all its Members are included, and hence it becomes both the Duty and Intereſt of every Member, in their Conduct, to purſue the Good of the Whole; and where theſe come in Competition, to prefer the public Weal to their own private Intereſt; nor can they honeſtly proſecute their own Profit, but in this beautiful and becoming Subordination. Such therefore, as ſet up their own perſonal Advantage, as the chief Prize they keep in their Eye, regard not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Public, even though their own private Advantage ſhould finally terminate in its utter Deſtruction. Their own Gain is the Deity they worſhip, let the Conſequences be what they will unto others. Thus Achan, to gratify his own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Thirſt after Gain, fell a pilfering among the Stuff, not regarding in the leaſt, what malign Influence his Theft might have on the whole Congregation of Iſrael. <hi>Auri Sacra Fames, quid non Mortali Pectora coges!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Principle acts variouſly in different Perſons; yet the Conſequences are, in a greater or leſs Degree, the ſame in all, <abbr>viz.</abbr> deſtructive to the Intereſts of Society; for it is only the ſame Principle acting in various Forms, or the Improvement of different Methods, for the Attainments of the ſelf ſame End, to-wit, the building up perſonal, on the Ruin of public Intereſt. Some it inclines to the Practice of picking, pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtealing from their Neighbours; while others chuſe to act more covertly, under ſome Shew of Honeſty, yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a Trade of over-reaching, cozening, cheating, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion and defrauding in their Dealings. Some not ſo well ſuited with the former baſe Methods of hurting the Public,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008356_0007_102F3C3480E585D0"/>
by ruining its Members, as it were, ſingly, one after another; take a more expeditious Method, as they conceive, to become rich, by ruining whole Provinces and Colonies; aiming, by one fatal Stab, to let out the very Heart's Blood of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Theſe Miſcreants are very ſenſible that no civil State can ſubſiſt or flouriſh without Trade and Commerce, and that this can never be maintained without ſome fix'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medium; being too lazy by lawful Induſtry, to procure a Sufficiency of ſuch Medium, to provide Things honeſt in the Sight of all Men, and aſhamed to beg, they lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out in the moſt ſhameful Practice of counterfeiting the public Currency, of their own and neighbouring Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Of this Kind are our Money-Makers, a Brood of Vipers, that are eating out the Bowels of Provinces and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and by their Practice rendering themſelves a common Neuſance, to be deteſted and purged out by every one, who has any Reliſh for the Comforts of a ſocial Life: Theſe care not how much they diſtreſs the State, by ruining its Trade, and cheating it out of its proper Medium, whilſt they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to impoſe upon it, their own ſpurious Stuff, as if it were current Money with the Merchants; who ſees not when this Cheat is artfully managed, and ſucceſsfully carried on, that it increaſes the Medium, in Proportion to the Number of Counterfeits; and that this, with other Things, has had a direct Tendency to depreciate the public Bills of ſome Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to ſo great a Degree, as rendered them almoſt uſeleſs: Beſides ſuch Bills muſt finally periſh in the Hands of ſome or other, who muſt inevitably ſuſtain the Loſs of it, and the Loſs of every Member is the Loſs of the Whole. Others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Traveller on the public Road, rob him of his Property, and ſometimes of his Life. Others leave the Land, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence Pirates by Sea, to the great Detriment of foreign Trade, and Ruin of particular Undertakers. Thus, in their ſeveral Turns, and various Methods of Iniquity, ſuch Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Mankind, as far as lies in their Power, ruin the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Intereſt, and thereby render themſelves Troublers of God's People.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> By bringing Diſtreſs on the Public; and this they do in ſundry Reſpects; as,</p>
            <p>BY bringing divine Judgments on God's People. God declares, that becauſe of ſwearing, the Land mourns. In Hoſ.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008356_0008_102F3C3729DDCDD0"/>
iv. 1, 2, 3, God declares, <hi>He had a Controverſy with the Land, becauſe there was no Truth, nor Mercy, nor Knowledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing Adultery, they breake out, and Blood toucheth Blood; therefore ſhall the Land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein, ſhall languiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>BUT why need I multiply Quotations of this Kind from the Scriptures, the Inſtance in our Text may be ſufficient. Here in our Context, we have the Army of Iſrael fleeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Men of Ai, on the Account of Achan's Villany, as the God of Armies himſelf teſtifies, Ver. 11, 12, of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned, and they have alſo tranſgreſſed my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the accurſed Thing, and have alſo ſtolen and diſſembled, and they have put it among their Stuff. Therefore the Children of Iſrael could not ſtand before their Enemies, becauſe they were accurſed, neither will I be with you any more, except ye deſtroy the accurſed from among you.</hi> God, the Judge of all the Earth, expreſsly charges the whole Camp with Guilt, and pronounces it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed for the Sin of one Man: Well might Solomon ſay, <hi>One Sinner deſtroyeth much Good,</hi> when the Sin of one Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo diſtreſſing to all Iſrael.</p>
            <p>A LIKE Caſe we have, Numb. xxv. Chapter, where the Plague was ſent into the Camp, for the Sin of Zimri and Cozbi, and by their Death it was ſtay'd. Again,</p>
            <p>THEY often troubled God's People to find them out, and bring them to deſerved Puniſhment. The Body of a People may feel the diſtreſſing Effects of Wickedneſs committed amongſt them, and yet for ſome Time not be able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Actors; they feel themſelves ſmitten, and greviouſly wounded in their Intereſts, but cannot diſcern the Hand that ſtrikes them; and ſo, ſometimes in order to prevent their own Ruin, they are obliged to take a great deal of Pains, uſe various Methods, and be at much Coſt, to find out thoſe Troublers of their Peace, and Deſtroyers of their Proſperity. How much Pains did Joſhua take, to explore the true Cauſe of the Miſchief that befel the Army? None knew the Cauſe of the ſad Defeat, therefore the whole Congregation of all the Tribes of Iſrael muſt be aſſembled, a Lot muſt he caſt for every Tribe, then thro' every Family of the taken Tribe, and laſtly thro' every Perſon of the diſcovered Family, Man

by Man, till at laſt Achan is taken. Such Evil-doers exert all their deviliſh Craft and Cunning, to ſecret themſelves and Crimes, that they may keep out of the Hand of Juſtice, and multiply Tranſgreſſion with Impunity, and ſo often cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate much Trouble and Expence to the Publick, as well as to the Perſons particularly injured by them, to find them out, and cut them off.</p>
            <p>THEY occaſion alſo great Trouble and Diſtreſs to the Minds of God's People: Tho' Sinners make light of the blackeſt Crimes, yet they appear awfully aggravated to ſuch as love and fear God. It is a diſtreſſing Thing to every ſuch Soul, to think that God is publickly diſhonoured by the bold Tranſgreſſions of his Law amongſt them, and that heavy Guilt lies upon the Land of their Habitation; hence <hi>their Hearts tremble for Fear of God, and they are afraid of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The Man after God's own Heart, to ſee others vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Precepts, and trample on the Authority of the great God, was moſt deeply affected, when he cries out, Pſalm cxix. cxxxvi, <hi>Rivers of Water run down mine Eyes, becauſe they kept not thy Law.</hi> So Pſalm cxxxix. 21, <hi>Am I not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee?</hi> Grieved for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt caſt on thine Authority, and the eternal Deſtruction brought upon themſelves by their Rebellions againſt thee.

            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> WHAT Trouble ſuch undergo, when divine Juſtice ſeizes them, and brings them to that Puniſhment which is the proper Demerit of their Crimes.</p>
            <p>HERE I muſt own myſelf non-pluſſed, to paint to you, my Hearers, the Shocks, the Racks, the Horrors of a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Malefactor (if he has any Senſe at all of his Guilt) juſt ready to feel the full Weight of his deſerved Puniſhment, from the Hand of that God <hi>who will render to every one according to their Works.</hi> When he comes to the Day of his Execution, ſees the Inſtruments of Death prepared, to ſend him to an unknown World of Spirits, and waft him to the dreadful flaming Tribunal of the great JEHOVAH: My very Soul is ready to ſink under the Burthen of the Thoughts, to conſider how deep Remorſe for all his former Crimes, ſettles on his awakened Conſcience, and the never dying Worm begins to prey upon his very Heart-Strings. O what Horror muſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008356_0010_102F3C3D2005B548"/>
he feel, if in an impenitent State, at the Approach of Death! What diſmal Clouds muſt hang over his Mind! What Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and Anguiſh fill his ſhuddering Soul! when the fatal Period comes, and not one Hour nor Moment's Reprieve can be granted, but die he muſt! Die as a Malefactor, unpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied by Heaven and Earth, if impenitent. Yet all this is nothing to the Pre-apprehenſions of an eternal Exiſtence, if unpardoned, where nothing but Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh, awaits them in a Dungeon, infinitely darker than that from whence he was bro't forth to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever. Could we hear the Soliloquy of a condemned Malefactor, might we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect it would be groaned out in ſuch mournful Language as this, accented with the moſt Heart-rending Sighs! <q>Alas! my trembling Soul, what a Shudder ſeized thee when the awful Sentence of Death, the accurſed Death to hang on a Tree, made both my Ears to tingle! Now I know the certain determined Hour of my Death, and every Moment haſtens it on: O! the awful Hour, when I muſt be hung up, a Spectacle to Angels and Men, between Heaven and Earth, becauſe unworthy of both. How ſcandalouſly ſhameful the Death! and yet how juſt, when I reflect on a Life ſpent in ſuch open Hoſtility againſt the God that made me, and the Villanies I have perpetrated, ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the public Weal of my fellow Men; by which I have forfeited my Life into the Hand of civil Juſtice, and now muſt die unpitied, unlamented! But O! my Soul, all this would be nothing, yea leſs than nothing, did not Death plunge thee into a new World, ſet thee in a new State, where thou muſt meet with a new, and perhaps dreadful Reward for thy Crimes. And now behold the awful Day is come, look my Soul, my Coffin ſtands before me, view the Crouds aſſembled to ſee the juſt Sentence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon me, and now but one Hour or two to make my Peace with Heaven, and do the Buſineſs of my whole Life in, which has hitherto been neglected, and in a few Minutes more O! my guilty trembling Soul, thou art to make thine Appearance before the Judgment-Seat of the dread Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, and all thy Crimes will meet thee before that Bar, and thou muſt give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008356_0011_102F3C40CD313280"/>
of all the Deeds done in the Body, and receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which thou haſt done; and therefore haſt Reaſon to fear a Sentence infinitely more tremendous than that which condemned me to Death here, even, <hi>Depart thou curſed into Everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN a condemned Malefactor, on the very Verge of Eternity, thus views himſelf, and ſpeaks to his own Soul, who can ſtretch a Thought comprehenſive of his Trouble and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs! He looks back, and ſees nothing but an ill-ſpent Life; forward, and ſees Deſtruction and Miſery juſt before him; upwards, and ſees an angry God, ready to frown him away for ever; inwards, and feels nothing but an accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence loaded with the Guilt of blackeſt Crimes; around him, and ſees nothing but Shame and Confuſion, and for ought he knows, the Devils ready to drag his departing Soul, when driven out of his Body, down to the Nethermoſt Sides of the Pit, where his Worm ſhall never die, and his Fire never be quenched; but the Smoak of his Burning muſt aſcend for ever and ever. O! the inexpreſſible Trouble! the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable Diſtreſs that preſſes the Malefactor, when God brings him to Puniſhment!—I now proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> To endeavour a proper Improvement of this awful Subject, and ſorrowful Occaſion.</p>
            <p>ARE egregious Sinners by their atrocious Crimes, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of God's People? then,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt</hi> INFER. Such as vigorouſly exert themſelves to bring ſuch Villains to Puniſhment, muſt be eſteemed by the Public, cordial Friends to its trueſt Intereſt: We all feel the good Effects of Vigilency and Zeal in the civil Magiſtrate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the penal Laws againſt the Diſturbers of our Peace, and Hinderers of our public Proſperity. It is well known, that for a Number of Years paſt, a Banditti of thieving money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making Vermin, from almoſt all Parts, have taken Shelter amongſt us; and had not effectual Meaſures been vigorouſly purſued, they might, by this Time, almoſt ruined the trading Intereſts of this and the neighbouring Governments; but, by the Vigilence and Care, the Pains and Induſtry of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Lieutenant Governor, who has with Zeal, improv'd both his Authority and Influence, to bring ſuch Wretches

under the Execution of the Penal-Laws, the Deſigns of thoſe Enemies to the State, have been fruſtrated, and his Honour merits that moſt endearing Character of a Patriot to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſtands juſtly entitled to our moſt grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments. May he long enjoy the Honour, and feel the Pleaſure of doing good, and never put up the Sword of civil Juſtice until he has hew'd to Pieces that whole Knot of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; brought their black and horrid Schemes to light, and the Authors and Abetters to the deſerved Reward of their Villanies. The Honourable Judges of our Supreme Court of Judicature, in this Province, as well as the Worſhipful Judges of the Seſſions, in this County, together with the other Officers of our Court; have very diſtinguiſhingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted themſelves, to break up that helliſh Club, and prevent further Miſchief to the Public, from that Quarter; and merit our ſincereſt Thanks for their ſingular Service herein, done to the Public, and wherein every Man of us may feel our Share. Here I would juſt beg Leave to wiſh them Succeſs in this Affair, for the future, not doubting from their paſt Conduct, but that they will ſtill exert themſelves ſo as to prove a Terror to ſuch evil Doers, and root ſuch a Sink of Villians out of the Province; which will be an unſpeakable Service done to the Public, tranſmit their Names with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Poſterity, and gain them higheſt Eſteem from all honeſt Men, who have a true Regard to the public Intereſt, and rejoice in its flouriſhing Proſperity.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d</hi> INFER. When wicked Men by their Crimes, become inſupportable to the State, it is a Piece of public Service done to Mankind, for the civil Authority, to cut them off; hereby they become Miniſters of God for the People's Good, nor can they become otherwiſe a Terror to Evil-Doers; to acquit the Guilty is as much an Abomination in the Sight of God, as to condemn the Innocent. The cutting of a Wart or a Wen from the Body, does not only free it from that troubleſome and deforming Excreſcence, which to the Loſs of the whole, drew off ſo much Nutrition to maintain its uſeleſs and troubleſome Bulk; but it may prevent the Growth of many more, that would in Proportion, rob the Body of proper Nouriſhment. The public Puniſhment of a Malefactor, is not meerly to reſtrain him, but that it may
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008356_0013_102F3C486A9BDA28"/>
terrify other Workers of Iniquity, <hi>that they may hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly.</hi> All ſuitable Care and Pains ſhould be taken by the civil Magiſtracy to reform Offenders, and to ſpare all that are like to be reformed, and become whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Members of Society; but ſuch as render themſelves unſufferable, muſt be treated as a gangreened Limb, which muſt be amputated, rather than the whole Body periſh. If we have a proper Temper of Mind, we cannot but feel Pity and Compaſſion moving in our Hearts, to the very worſt of the human Species, when we ſee them ſuffering for their own criminal Follies: Yet a Regard to diſtributive Juſtice and the public Good, ſhould diſpoſe us to approve the Sentence, and bear a ſolemn Teſtimony to its Execution. Achan, by his Wickedneſs, had become a ſinking Burthen, ſuch as all Iſrael could not ſtand under; his Theft was too weighty for the whole Army, and therefore, as ſoon as his Crime was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, they readily gave him up to Death, the happy Conſequence of which was, that God turned away the Fierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Anger from Iſrael, and then they could not only ſtand in Battle, but put their Enemies to Flight. And this, my Hearers, would no doubt be our happy Caſe, were there no Achans to be Trublers of our Iſrael. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d</hi> INFER. The great Reaſon of the ſore and diſtreſſing Judgments we are under, is the open and aggravated Breaches of the divine Laws, that are found in the midſt of us. It muſt be confeſſed, that for Years paſt we have been under the Frowns of Heaven, manifeſted in a long Series of divine Judgments, one after another, ſome in a lighter, and others in a heavier Degree, on this Land. Now as <hi>God delights in Mercy, and Judgment is his ſtrange Work,</hi> ſo he declares that <hi>he does not grieve or afflict the Children of Men willingly;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt determine the procuring Cauſe is in ourſelves, and that our Ways have not pleaſed the Lord; and when we ſearch and try our Ways, will not groſs, open and ſcandalous Sins appear to have the greateſt Influence, in pulling down divine Judgments upon us; do we not find God threatning his ancient People, in a moſt emphatical Manner, for ſuch bold and daring Crimes, the Cry of which reached the very Heavens, Jer. v. 7, 8, &amp;c. Where God points out their Sins, and more than once concludes with this awful Inquiry,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008356_0014_102F3C4A20FB34F0"/>
               <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe Things, ſaith the Lord; and ſhall not my Soul be avenged of ſuch a Nation as this.</hi> Here he lays open and charges upon them, their Idolatry and Uncleanneſs, their Hypocriſy and Injuſtice, their Incorrigibleneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, their Departures from God, and Defiance of him, their Violence and Oppreſſion, their Sabbath-breaking and Prophaneneſs, and an horrid and unnatural Combination of ſome to ruin the whole Nation: Therefore the Judgments they are threatned with, are extremely diſtreſſing, and very terrible. A foreign Enemy ſhall be let looſe againſt them, who ſhould ſet Guards upon them, ſo that if they ſtaid in the City they muſt die by the Famine; and if they came forth they muſt die by the Sword; and thus they ſhould have no where left to look for Safety, no Place to run for Shelter, nor any Power to truſt in for Deliverance: And the Reaſon of all this fore Diſtreſs was, <hi>becauſe their Tranſgreſſions were many, and their Backſlidings encreaſed.</hi> Nay, their Enemies were to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend their <hi>Walls,</hi> deſtroy their <hi>Fortifications,</hi> remove their <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements,</hi> carry them into <hi>Captivity,</hi> and with-hold <hi>Good Things</hi> from them.—May not this teach us, that it is our Land-defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sins, our Uncleanneſs, Intemperance, Profaneneſs, our Violations of God's Sabbaths, our Polution of God's Sactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, our Contempt of his Word, Ordinances and Miniſtry; our Theft, Forgery and Perjury, that have brought divine Judgments upon us, while we have had on the one Side, a barbarous and Blood-thirſty People, of a ſtrange Language, let looſe againſt our Frontiers, who ſhew no Pity, and ſcarcely give any Quarters; and on the other Hand, we have had a Nation not more powerful than treacherous; as innured to Fatigues, as they are expert in the Arts of War, permitted to enter our Limits, take our Fortreſſes, demoliſh our ſtrong Holds, and lead many of our Inhabitants away captive, into a Land of graven Images, where they die unpitied, or live friendleſs or forlorn, till ſome kind Providence open a Door for their Deliverance. O! It is our Sins, my Hearers, that cauſe all theſe Troubles. <hi>We have procured theſe Things to ourſelves; our own Wickedneſs corrects us; our Backſlidings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us.</hi> Theſe our Diſtreſſes clearly point out to us, preſent Duty, even to repent and reform; let us then, <hi>ſearch and try our Ways, and turn to God, with our whole Hearts.</hi> Let

every one of us in our reſpective Places and Capacities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all our Power, Influence, and Advantages, to promote an univerſal Reformation; eſpecially, let the Civil Authority beſtir themſelves, to ſuppreſs Wickedneſs and Villany, by a ſtrict Execution of the penal Laws, ſo as to put all Iniquity out of Countenance, and bear down the moſt faſhionable Sins of the Times, with Reſolution, Fortitude and Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And, for your Excitement, here the bleſſed Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement God gives to faithful Magiſtrates, in Jeremiah v. 1. <hi>Run ye too and fro thro' the Streets of Jeruſalem, and ſee now and know, and ſeek in the broad Places thereof, if ye can find a Man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that ſeeketh the Truth, and I will pardon it.</hi> A very noble Motive indeed, to every civil Officer, to make it his great Care and Buſineſs to execute the Laws upon Tranſgreſſors; ſearch out and puniſh Iniquity: And ſurely happy the People who are in ſuch a Caſe, who are bleſt with ſuch, to bear Rule over them, as by Faithfulneſs in their Places, terrify and chaſe away evil Doers, and ſo avert divine Judgments from the Land.</p>
            <p n="4">4th INFER. How little ſoever great Sinners think of it, while they are troubling God's People by their horrid Crimes, they are all the while pulling down complicated Sorrows and Troubles on themſelves; and they ſhall, by their own ſad Experience feel, that all theſe Things ſhall be Bitterneſs in the End. Whilſt Sinners are in their full Career of Rebellion againſt Heaven, living in Wantonneſs and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, Idleneſs and Theft, Prophaneneſs and Perjury, rolling Sin as a ſweet Morſel under their Tongue; they think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a reckoning Day approaching, or what Sin muſt coſt them in the End. But, alas! alas! when divine Juſtice ſeizes them, and gives them up Priſoners to the Hands of the Civil Magiſtrate, to cut them off from the Face of the Earth, then Sin appears with another Proſpect; before, they ſaw nothing but its painted Face, but now they ſee and feel its Scorpion's Tail, ſtinging them to Death! Now all the Honey turns into the Gall of Aſps. The Diſtreſs that will then unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably ſeize them, from a View of the Vileneſs of their Lives, the ſcandalous Shamefulneſs of their Deaths, the Change of their State, and if they are in any ſuitable Meaſure convinced of the Greatneſs and Aggravations of their Guilt, and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008356_0016_102F3C4FD98061A0"/>
Dreadfulneſs of that Wrath which they have been treaſuring up to themſelves, by their Sins; then, what Racks of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! what Shudders of Soul! what Sinkings of Heart! what bitter Remorſe! whilſt they review their Lives, and then look forward into a boundleſs Eternity, where they expect to feel themſelves in the Hands of a living, and an angry God, whoſe Wrath burns to the loweſt Hell; from whoſe Preſence, and the Glory of whoſe Power, they expect to periſh with everlaſting Deſtruction, and be plunged into the bottomleſs Gulph of perfect Horror, and eternal Deſpair!</p>
            <p n="5">5th INFER. When Sinners, by their heinous and daring Crimes, have forſeited their Lives into the Hand of civil Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, they have none to blame for it, but themſelves. They cannot reaſonably plead Ignorance of the Law; but know, that he who does ſuch and ſuch Things, is worthy of Death; yet they venture on the Crime, and commit the Fact in the Face both of the Law, and of Conſcience, knowing that it is for their Lives. Who can they blame? Not the Law; for it is juſt and good: Not their own Ignorance, but their horrid Preſumption; for they know, that the Murderer, the Thief, the Houſe-breaker, the Robber, the Counterfeiter, if convicted, muſt die. Not the Jury that finds them guilty, for they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſolemn Oath to do ſo, upon ſufficient Evidence, and may not do otherwiſe. Not the Judge who condemns them, for he is obliged in general to give Sentence according to the Jury's Verdict. Not the Governor, becauſe he does not reprieve them, for he is under no Obligations to give them back that Life, which they have already forfeited to the Publick; and it might in its Conſequences, be very injurious to the Public, to ſpare that Life, which has already been juſtly forfeited; ſo that the Blame lies wholly at the Malefactor's own Door, and his Blood will be found upon his own Head. But I ſhall now conclude with a few brief Addreſſes on this ſolemn Occaſion. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, I would addreſs the Criminal ready to be executed.—Poor Malefactor! my Compaſſions are moved, and my Bowels yern towards you.—I am now to make my laſt Addreſs to you, in the Name of my divine Maſter, in Behalf of your precious Soul, juſt before you ſtep into the World of Spirits, to make your moſt ſolemn Appearance before the great and dreadful God. You are to go from hence to the Place of Execution,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008356_0017_102F3C5169D4B1C8"/>
and if you are yet an Impenitent and out of Chriſt, how ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt the gloomy Proſpect be! It is a great thing to die, and enter into Eternity; but to die in ſuch a Manner, and under ſuch Circumſtances, muſt have ſomething in it peculiarly dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Let me then urge and preſs it upon you, with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Compaſſion, and yet with utmoſt Earneſtneſs, as you love your own never-dying Soul, to think cloſely of the dreadful Scene now opening upon you. Think how you will appear before a God of inflexible Juſtice, that will by no Means clear the Guilty. What, O! what have you, poor Criminal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend you to his Love and Favour?</p>
            <p>Since your Condemnation, I have ſhewn you what Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you ought to make for your abuſe to the Public; alſo how you ought to repent, and cry to God with all your Might, if perhaps the Wickedneſs of your Heart and Life may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you, and Mercy extended to your immortal Soul, thro' Jeſus the only Saviour; that he would renew you by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Influence of his holy Spirit, juſtify you by the perfect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet meeten and prepare you for eternal Felicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I alſo told you that the Goſpel conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life, is Faith in the Son of God; which I endeavour'd alſo, in the cleareſt Manner I cou'd, to explain to you. Now poor Man, your Conſcience knows what Improvement you have made of my Advice and Inſtructions. Whether you have inceſſantly ſent up your earneſt Cries to Heaven for renewing Grace; and whether God has enabled you, from a deep and affecting Conviction of your own Vileneſs and Wretchedneſs, Guilt and Miſery, and an effectual Diſcovery of the Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Willingneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Beauty, Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and Safety of the Goſpel Way of Salvation by him, as has prevailed with you to comply with the Terms, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your eternal Intereſt into his Hands, as knowing he is able to keep that which is committed unto him. If you have not accepted the free and gracious Offer, you are yet <hi>in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and under the Bonds of Iniquity,</hi> expoſed to the Wrath and Vengeance of that God, who, out of Chriſt, will be a conſuming Fire to Workers of Iniquity. Nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poor Heart! will ſave you, but an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. You muſt be juſtified, cleanſed, and ſanctified, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of God. O! then, fly, fly

to the Arms of divine Mercy, and lay hold on the Scepter of Grace. Repent of all your Sins, for except you repent, you ſhall ſurely periſh; purſue a Diſpoſition to forgive your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hartily aſk Forgiveneſs of thoſe you have injured and wronged. But remember this, you can never do this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, without Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; nor is Faith a meer ſpeculative View of Truth, or a rational Conviction that gains only a general Aſſent. Human Nature has entirely warp'd off from God, and Sinners muſt turn to him ſincerely and unreſervedly, or they cannot be happy. Hence God bids us look to him, come to him, truſt in him, &amp;c. all which Scripture Phraſes intimate, that the Mind muſt upon a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Power and Ability, Love and Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, turn to him, centre in him, rely upon him, and make choice of him, as its only Portion, and delight in its Choice, and ſo love him ſupremely, with all its Heart; from hence will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow Grief for Sin, Hatred to Sin, Averſion from all Sin, as being what it is, and a ſteady vigorous Endeavour after new Obedience, with a free Deſire frankly to forgive Mankind, as the Penitent deſires to be forgiven of God. This is the Subſtance of what every Child of Adam muſt feel, in Order to partake in the great Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. Conſider then, whether you have really complied with the Terms of the Goſpel, and thus accepted the Grace of God, as one poor and wretched, miſerable, blind and naked; morally uncapable of ſaving or relieving yourſelf, and in this View, have you caſt yourſelf at the Foot of divine Sovreignty, owning the Sentence of God's holy Law to be juſt, and reſolved all your Hopes of Help and Salvation, into the meer ſelf-moving Mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt. Aſſure yourſelf, that you muſt be cloathed with the perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus, or you can never make a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Appearance before a righteous God; for tho' God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>he can be juſt, and yet the Juſtifier of ſuch as believe in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. iii. 26; yet he cannot, conſiſtent with his governing Perfections, ſave one Soul out of Chriſt. It is a vain Thing therefore, for any to fling themſelves on divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without a Regard unto Juſtice, or a Reliance on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Satisfaction that Chriſt hath made; for tho' God be infinitely merciful, yet he is equally juſt, and all his glorious
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008356_0019_102F3C594EA69C40"/>
Attributes are equally dear to him, and muſt therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly harmonize in the Sinner's Salvation: He will never raiſe the Honours of one, on the Ruins of another, but here whilſt Mercy is abundantly magnified, Juſtice is gloriouſly diſplay'd. O! therefore, accept of the Goſpel-Offer of a Saviour, come to him as one weary and heavy laden with Sin, under a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Senſe of your Guilt, and your periſhing need of Help, and ſurrender yourſelf into his Hands, for here is the only Door of Hope, out of which there is no Salvation.</p>
            <p>Spread all your Sins, of every Kind, before God; thoſe Sins that are againſt God only, confeſs to God alone; thoſe againſt Man, muſt be acknowledged to Man. And it will be your Intereſt, poor Man, who are juſt entering into a fix'd Eſtate for a whole Eternity, whoſe precious Soul my Heart pities; your Intereſt it is, I ſay, as well as Duty, to repent of every Sin: Repentance with any Reſerve, will be fatal, one Sin unrepented of, will bring certain Damnation, baniſh from God's Life-giving Preſence, and ſink you into that Lake that burns for ever and ever, which is the ſecond Death. Now ſhould this be your dreadful Portion (which may infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prevent) conſider ſeriouſly, before it be too late, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge God with Severity, nor complain of him as unkind; then you will be convinced, ſadly convinced, that he gave you Means, but you would not uſe them; he gave you Laws, but you wou'd not obey them; Calls, but you wou'd not hearken to them; Threatnings, but you contemned them; Mercies, but you abuſed them; Judgments, but you defy'd them. O poor Creature! Remember, if you periſh, the Fault is your own. God <hi>will be juſt when he ſpeaks, and clear when he judges.</hi> O! what a glorious Reward have you often rejected? What rich Mercy have you all along deſpiſed? What Patience and Long-ſuffering have you abuſed? Muſt not all your Deſtruction then be of your own procuring, your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being Judge? God has not fail'd on his Part, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed you a State of Probation, provided a Saviour for the chief of Sinners, given you his Goſpel, ſent you his Miniſters, repeated his Calls, lengthen'd out his Patience to this Hour, and done all that could be done in theſe Regards; but you have held faſt Wickedneſs and Deceit, and refuſed to turn. Now it is come to the eleventh Hour with you, and even
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008356_0020_102F3C5CAA4D1230"/>
Part of that is ſpent; if you are yet out of Chriſt, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and only Ark of Safety, your Caſe is moſt extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as your Time is juſt ſpent; having but an Hour or Two more to live, and perhaps the great Work of a whole Life, for which you were ſent into the World, all to do, in theſe few remaining Moments, or you undone for ever.</p>
            <p>O! bethink yourſelf, poor Man! for God's Sake, bethink yourſelf, where you are going, and to whom you muſt betake yourſelf in this Hour of Darkneſs and Diſtreſs. Remember Chriſt is ready to ſave the chief of Sinners, even at the eleventh Hour: He ſaved a Malefactor when juſt expiring; follow the Example of that poor Thief on the Croſs, and apply to Jeſus Chriſt as he did, and who knows but you may find the like Acceptance. Chriſt is ſtill the ſame, his Love and Pity, his Willingneſs and Readineſs, his Grace and Sufficiency, ſtill the ſame as ever; and he is near to you, for he poſſeſſes your Reins, and is perfectly acquainted with all your Wants, Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Diſtreſſes; and he alone is able to ſave you from the Wrath to come.</p>
            <p>Time urges me to finiſh, yet I know not how to leave you, and at the ſame Time at a Loſs what farther Motives to uſe with you. My very Heart aches for your precious Soul, and I would gladly be the Inſtrument of ſaving it from eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Your only Safety I muſt again tell you, is in Jeſus Chriſt; but with what Arguments ſhall I prevail with you to accept of his Grace, and be happy for ever! you are at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience with the World, as a Criminal, and perhaps with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alſo as a Sinner. O diſtreſſing State! Fly, O fly, from the Wrath to come, and lay hold on offered Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt; cry to him, pour out your Soul before him; plead the Riches and Freedom of his Grace: Tell him he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged you to plead by former diſplays of his Mercy; he has pitied other Sinners, great Sinners, when in utmoſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and bro't to the laſt Extremity; and beg that he would extend the ſame divine Compaſſion to your precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul, and not leave you now to periſh in your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, after you have lived ſo long in a Land of Light, under the greateſt Advantages; and venture your naked, guilty and polluted Soul into his Hand, truſting to his Merits, relying on his Grace, and proſtrate at his Foot; if you periſh, reſolve to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008356_0021_102F3C5F503FFD08"/>
periſh there. Now, to conclude, what ſhall I, what can I ſay more to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poor wretched Man? I can only beg and beſeech you, for Chriſt's Sake, to be reconciled to God. Spend the very few remaining Moments of Life, in reallizing that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death, that is juſt before you; and that Eternity you muſt this Day enter into; and cry to God with every Breath you have yet to draw, to have Mercy upon your immortal Soul; waſh it in the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſes from all Sin; give Faith unfeigned, and Repentence never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of. And I pray ſovereign rich Mercy may yet pluck you as a Brand, out of the Burning; give you a juſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Senſe of your Guilt and Vileneſs; convince you tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly of your undone State, and lead you to Jeſus Chriſt; accept you thro' his Righteouſneſs, cleanſe you in his Blood, renew and ſanctify you by his Grace; and that tho' now you are to die as a Criminal on Earth, by the Hand of civil Juſtice, yet he wou'd compaſſionately receive you to Glory, and make you a ſingular Monument of his free and ſovereign Grace, to all Eternity. Amen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would beg leave to addreſs the civil Authority, here preſent, on this awful Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, tho' I have in ſome Meaſure anticipated what I deſigned for the Matter of this Addreſs; Yet,</p>
            <p>Allow me to remind you, that your Work, is not in itſelf, greater or more arduous, than it is neceſſary and important to the Public. You are to be Miniſters of God, for the Good of his People; in the purſuit of which noble End, you muſt be a Terror to Evil-doers, and a Praiſe to ſuch as do Well. The executive Power of penal Laws is put into your Hands; you wear the Sword of civil Juſtice, which is the Sword of the Lord; let it not ruſt in the Scabbard, or be worn in vain, but ever keep it drawn in the Cauſe of God, and the Public.</p>
            <p>Suffer me therefore, with that Authority, Freedom, and Faithfulneſs, that becomes a Miniſter of Chriſt; with that Pathos and Solemnity that the Importance of the Matter calls for, and yet with all that dutiful Reſpect to you, as Fathers in the State, to whom Honour is juſtly due, even upon the Foot of divine Inſtitution and Precept, to exhort and beſeech you, to put our wholeſome Laws in the ſtricteſt Execution, againſt the open Contemners and Violaters of them. Let the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008356_0022_102F3C61C5E6C9B8"/>
prophane Swearer, Sabbath Breaker, the beaſtly Drunkard, and the covetous Thief, feel the Weight of the Law, whilſt they Smart under your Rod. Theſe, my Honoured Fathers, theſe are Crimes not only moſt flagicious in themſelves, but pregnant of many others; fill Heaven with Indignation, and pull down the awfull and deſolating Judgments of God upon the Land: Againſt theſe, and ſuch like Tranſgreſſions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enter into a ſacred Combination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among yourſelves, and employ all your Power, Influence and Authority to bear them down as with a ſtrong Hand; and whilſt, on the one Hand, you with a becoming Vigilence, and due Severity, ſearch out and puniſh Immorality, Wickedneſs, Debauchery and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs; be ſure you neglect not to encourage Regularity, Virtue and Piety, on the other. In this Way you may expect a divine Bleſſing on your civil Adminiſtrations, be honoured as Inſtruments of a general Reformation, in a looſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Age, and merit the Character of being the Chariots of our Iſrael, and the Horſe-Men thereof; and to your abundant Satisfaction, ſee Peace and good Order flouriſh in your Day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To conclude, I would addreſs myſelf to this numerous and crouded Auditory, convened on this mournful Occaſion. O Sirs! what more awful than the Errand we are come upon this Day, to ſee one of our poor fellow Men, and fellow Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, receive the juſt Recompence of his Crimes. Now, what can be thought of more dreadful than Sin, that furniſhes us with the rueful Spectacle we are aſſembled to view! Behold then in the poor contemned Criminal, as in a Glaſs, the vile, ſhameful and debaſing Nature of Sin, to how low a State it may bring you, and then leave you expoſed to public Shame and Diſgrace, helpleſs and forlorn: And let this ſad Warning excite every one of you, my Hearers, to flee from all Sin; without Delay to reform, repent and turn to God, through Jeſus the only Mediator, that ſo Iniquity may not be your Ruin. Here I would particularly urge you to beware of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any known Sin, do not ſin againſt the Light and Dictates of your own Conſciences; this is to ſin wilfully, and ſo to ſin preſumptuouſly, and we find no Sacrifices were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, under the Law, for the preſumptuous Sinner. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do not uſually begin with the moſt flagrant Crimes, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008356_0023_102F3C658CFBFD68"/>
they proceed from leſs to greater, and ſo their Progreſſion, is from bad to worſe. Perſons at firſt perhaps learn to lie, then to ſwear prophanely, then to diſobey their Parents, then to break God's Sabbaths, and deſpiſe his Meſſengers; from thence they proceed to pilfer and ſteal, then to Burglary, and it may be, Murder. Beware then of the leaſt Sin, as that which, by ſwift Degrees will draw you on to blacker Crimes, till it bring full Deſtruction upon you. Every Sin, how little ſoever it may appear in your Eye, is an Evil of infinite Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and expoſes to the Curſe of the Law, and the Wrath of the Law-giver, both in this Life and that which is to come; and if unrepented of, will aſſuredly bring eternal Ruin. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therefore every one of you more and more, to get a juſt Senſe of the Soul-damning Nature of Sin. And, O! ſtrive Day and Night, after an Intereſt in Chriſt, whoſe Blood can cleanſe you from all Sin; whoſe Righteouſneſs can cover your Nakedneſs, whoſe Grace can renew, ſanctify, and meeten you for his Kingdom above. Then you will be ſafe in him, and tho' you Sin, you will have an Advocate with the Father, Chriſt Jeſus the Righteous; and he that has begun a good Work in you, will carry it on to the Day of compleat Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then his Grace will be your Sufficiency againſt every Temptation, and his Spirit your Guide into all Truth, and Conducter in the pleaſant Ways of Wiſdom, and peaceful Pathes of Virtue, afford you the Teſtimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for your Rejoicing in the Hour of Death, when you reſign up your Breath, and under the Conduct of Guardian Angels take wing, and ſoar above all created Rounds, to the bleſſed Regions of immortal Peace and Felicity, and place you in the happyfying Preſence of the glorious God, where is Fullneſs of Joy, and give you an honourable Seat at his Right-Hand, where are Pleaſures for ever more; where you ſhall aſcribe Glory and Honour, and Bleſſing and Praiſe to him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb, who loved you and waſhed you from your Sins in his own Blood, and made you Kings and Prieſts unto God for ever and ever. To whom belongs the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, World without End. AMEN.</p>
