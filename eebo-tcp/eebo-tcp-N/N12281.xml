            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THOSE who expect to reap the bleſſings of Freedom, muſt, like men, undergo the fatigue of ſupporting it. The event of yeſterday is one of thoſe kind of alarms, which is juſt ſufficient to rouſe us to duty, without being of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough to depreſs our fortitude. It is not a field of a few acres of ground, but a cauſe that we are defending, and whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by degrees, the conſequence will be the ſame.</p>
            <p>Look back at the events of laſt winter and the preſent year, there you will find that the enemy's ſucceſſes have always contributed to reduce them. What they have gained in ground, they paid ſo dearly for in numbers, that their victories have in the end amounted to defeats. We have always been maſters at the laſt puſh, and always ſhall while we do our duty. Howe has been once on the banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven back with loſs and diſgrace; and why not be again driven from the Schuylkill? His condition and ours are very different. He has every body to fight, we have only his <hi>one</hi> army to cope with and which waſtes away at every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; we can not only reinforce, but can redouble our numbers; he is cut off from all ſupplies, and muſt ſooner or later inevitably fall into our hands.</p>
            <p>Shall a band of ten or twelve thouſand robbers, who are this day fifteen hundred or two thouſand men leſs in ſtrength than they were yeſterday, conquer America, or ſubdue even a ſingle ſtate? The thing cannot be, unleſs we ſit down and ſuffer them to do it. Another ſuch a bruſh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we loſt the ground, would, by ſtill reducing the enemy, put them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated.</p>
            <p>Could our whole army have come up to the attack at one time, the conſequences had probably been otherwiſe; but our having different parts of the Brandywine creek to guard, and the uncertainty which road to Philadelphia the enemy would attempt to take, naturally afforded them an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of paſſing with their main body at a place where only a part of ours could be poſted; for, it muſt ſtrike every thinking man with conviction, that it requires a much greater force to oppoſe an enemy in ſeveral places, than is ſufficient to defeat them in any one place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:015495_0003_0F998683857D9038"/>Men who are ſincere in defending their freedom, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways feel concern at every circumſtance, which ſeems to make againſt them; it is the natural and honeſt conſequence of all affectionate attachments, and the want of it is a vice. But the dejection laſts only for a moment; they ſoon riſe out of it with additional vigor; the glow of hope, courage and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, will, in a little time, ſupply the place of every inferior paſſion, and kindle the whole heart into heroiſm.</p>
            <p>There is a myſtery in the countenance of ſome cauſes, which we have not always preſent judgment enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. It is diſtreſſing to ſee an enemy advancing into a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but it is the only place in which we can beat them, and in which we have always beaten them, whenever they made the attempt. The nearer any diſeaſe approaches to a criſis, the nearer it is to a cure: Danger and deliverance make their advances together, and it is only at the laſt puſh, that one or the other takes the lead.</p>
            <p>There are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted; but a genuine Public ſpirit always appears moſt when there is moſt occaſion for it. Thank GOD! our army, though fatigued, is yet entire. The attack made by us yeſterday was under many diſadvantages, naturally ariſing from the uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy would take; and from that circumſtance, the whole of our force could not be brought up together time enough to engage all at once. Our ſtrength is yet reſerved; and it is evident that Howe does not think himſelf a gainer by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, otherwiſe, he would this morning have moved down and attacked General Waſhington.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the city and country, It is in your power, by a ſpirited improvement of the preſent circumſtance, to turn it to a real advantage: Howe is now weaker than before, and every ſhot will contribute to reduce him. You are more immediately intereſted than any other part of the Continent; your All is at ſtake; it is not ſo with the general cauſe; you are devoted by the enemy to plunder and deſtruction: It is the encouragement which Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promiſed his army. Thus circumſtanced, you may ſave your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a manly reſiſtance, but you can have no hope in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:015495_0004_0F998684A637B100"/>
any other conduct. I never yet knew our brave General, or any part of the army, officers or men, out of heart, and I have ſeen them in circumſtances a thouſand times more trying than the preſent. It is only thoſe that are not in action, that feel languor and heavineſs, and the beſt way to rub it off is to turn out, and make ſure work of it.</p>
            <p>Our army muſt undoubtedly feel fatigue, and want a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of reſt, though not of valour. Our own intereſt and happineſs call upon us to give them every ſupport in our power, and make the burden of the day, on which the ſafety of this city depends, as light as poſſible. Remember, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that we have forces both to the Northward and Southward of Philadelphia, and if the enemy be but ſtopt till thoſe can arrive, this city will be ſaved, and the enemy finally routed. You have too much at ſtake to heſitate. You ought not to think an hour upon the matter, but to ſpring to action at once. Other States have been invaded, and have likewiſe driven off the invaders. Now OUR time and turn is come, and perhaps the finiſhing ſtroke is reſerved for us. When we look back on the dangers we have been ſaved from, and reflect on the ſucceſſes we have been bleſt with, it would be ſinful either to be idle or deſpair.</p>
            <p>I cloſe this paper with a ſhort addreſs to General Howe. You, ſir, are only lingering out the period that ſhall bring with it your defeat. You have yet ſcarce began upon the war; and the farther you enter, the faſter will your troubles thicken. What you now enjoy is only a reſpite from ruin; an invitation to deſtruction; a ſomething, that will lead on to our deliverance at your expence. We know the cauſe we are engaged in, and though a paſſionate fondneſs for it may make us grieve at every injury which threatens it, yet, when the moment of concern is over, the determination to duty returns. We are not the hireling ſlaves of a beggarly tyrant, nor the cringing flatterers of an infamous court. We are not moved by the gloomy ſmile of a worthleſs king, but by the ardent glow of generous patriotiſm. We fight, not to enſlave, but to ſet a country free, and to make room upon the earth for honeſt men to live in. In ſuch a cauſe we are ſure we are right; and we leave to you the deſpairing reflection of being the tool of a miſerable tyrant.</p>
