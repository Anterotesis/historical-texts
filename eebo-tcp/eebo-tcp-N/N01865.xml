            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Obſervations On Receiving the SMALL-POX BY Ingrafting or Inoculating.</head>
            <p>WHEN I firſt had the Account of this common Practice in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and of the wonderful Succeſs of it there, given by <hi>Gentlemen of Learning</hi> to ſuch a Body as that of the <hi>Royal Society in London,</hi> I could not but give Credit to their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> in a Matter of fact whereof they were Eye-Witneſſes. Immediately the <hi>little Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> I am Maſter of led me into the <hi>apparent Reaſons</hi> of the thing. The more readily &amp; eaſily <hi>theſe</hi> occurr'd to me, the more I was affected with the Goodneſs of <hi>GOD Almighty</hi> therein to a Miſerable World. I immediately tho't with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaid to ſome <hi>Superior Perſons</hi> in the Town, (who poſſibly may remember it) What an aſtoniſhing Mercy to <hi>Us</hi> in this Land, this
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002211_0005_0FDACEC414E4FBD8"/>
Diſcovery of a <hi>Gracious Providence</hi> might prove. The more I mus'd upon the thing, and diſcours'd upon it, the more light I had, or ſeem'd to my ſelf to have. It appear'd to me as rational as it was ſurpriſing, and gave me great pleaſure in the proſpect of ſo great a Benefit to Mankind. For I had not forgot the terrors of the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> when it was here the two laſt times, Nineteen and near Thirty Years ſince; tho' it was nothing ſo Mortal either time as it had been before, (1678.) and has been now again. Beſides it being now nineteen Years ſince the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> had been in the Town, it gave us a very dreadful proſpect of Diſtreſs and Deaths, whenever it ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; all the Children and all the Young People born in the Town, or come into it from the Country, within that long term of time having it before them. Now in proportion to the diſtreſs fore ſeen and expected by us, my Joy naturally roſe upon the Diſcovery of ſuch a Way of Relief as ſeem'd Opening before us, by the favour of GOD to us. In this ſimplicity of heart (I ſpeak before GOD who ſearches it) I gave into a kind Opinion of this <hi>New Method;</hi> My Affection to my <hi>Country</hi> and the ſaving the <hi>Lives</hi> of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being the Sole Motive to me, under the <hi>Glory</hi> that ſhould thence redound unto the Name of GOD. I freely ſpake my Tho'ts in Company and on Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions as it ſeem'd proper to me, and when ſome publickly demanded of us, "<hi>Whether People could truſt in GOD in uſing this Means of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> I openly anſwer'd (among my <hi>Brethren</hi>) in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> that I judg'd they might. This was after that Dr. <hi>Boylſtone</hi> had begun the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002211_0006_0FDACEC5934B77E8"/>
practice, which I never put him upon, nor had I light to diſſwade him from it. According to my hope and Expectation it ſucceeded; altho' the firſt Experiment was the moſt diſcouraging; for Mrs. <hi>Boylſtone</hi> being in the Country and the <hi>Doctor</hi> taken up abroad among his Patients, the Children were too much expoſed &amp; neglected, and from my houſe (which faces into the Doctors yard) One of them was ſeen three or four days after their being Inoculated dabling in the cold water under the Pump. This or the like diſorders in the firſt Inoculated <hi>Child</hi> threw him, as well they might, into a high and threatning fever. The cauſe was apparent to the Dr. and ſo did not diſcourage him, nor at all diſgrace the practice with us that ſaw it. It was a pleaſure however to ſee that the Small-Pox might be communicated, as the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> from the <hi>Levant</hi> had informed us. The next Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments were made with more care, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly more anſwered the Accounts which they had given us of a very <hi>light fever</hi> and <hi>few puſtles.</hi> By this time the <hi>Town</hi> was full of the Sickneſs, and the Deaths that began to multiply led a few more into this <hi>Means of ſafety;</hi> as they hop'd by the favour of GOD to find it. The Bleſſing of GOD went along with it; they found <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> and lay praiſing GOD on their Beds, or rather ſat up in their Chairs doing ſo. Their friends ſtood ſmiling about them. Their tongues were filled with laughter, and ours with Thanks-giving on their account when we went to ſee 'em. We ſaw them recover faſt; the communicated Diſtemper working uniformly upon them, and as one would deſire. We ſaw this with wonder and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002211_0007_0FDACEC712E2F9E8"/>
Joy at what GOD had wro't for us. We ſaw <hi>Scores</hi> thus recover, even as many as went into the happy practice, and it appear'd to us more and more to be <hi>the Lord's Doing and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our eyes.</hi> They were as diſcreet and religious a number of People, and Perſons of as good ſenſe and underſtanding, and of as much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fear as their Nei'bours, who made theſe Experiments; and they did it with meekneſs and humility, patience and ſilence, and many prayers, under much provocation from too many. Only <hi>one Gentlewoman</hi> has yet died out of an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> who have now paſſed thro' the Operation. But as you muſt needs ſuppoſe in a Town ſo full of Infection as this has been, ſome ten or twelve of this number appear'd to have taken the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the common way; (among whom the Perſon deceas'd was evidently one) and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they had it of the <hi>Confluent</hi> Kind, or in a fulneſs of the <hi>diſtinct</hi> ſort, not known among the Inoculated in the <hi>Levant.</hi> This will be ſo far from ſeeming ſtrange to you, that indeed it would be next to a <hi>Miracle</hi> had it been otherwiſe. At the ſame time it muſt be allowed, that a good number of thoſe that paſſed ſo favourably thro' the Inoculation, would probably have had it very favourably in the common way. But that ſo many ſhould paſs ſo favourably and <hi>eaſily,</hi> as well as <hi>ſafely,</hi> thro' the Inoculation; while their Nei'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours had ſo many in every hundred that <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> ſo much, as well as <hi>died,</hi> is a ſufficient Diſtinction put by Providence on the Method which we praiſe GOD for; and commend unto others, as GOD has commended it unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002211_0008_0FDACEC896144860"/>
FOR my own part I would not willingly, (at leaſt unneceſſarily) ſay a word that ſhould <hi>grieve,</hi> much leſs <hi>offend</hi> any one, in this preſent <hi>Eſſay,</hi> which I honeſtly mean to <hi>ſerve</hi> my Country, and not provoke my Nei'bours. I have no <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> to ſerve by appearing for this Practice; but the contrary. If I knew any thing in prejudice againſt it, which might <hi>juſtly</hi> be ſaid, GOD knows I would offer it. <hi>Boſton</hi> can now little be ſerved by it, to what it might have been a few Months paſt, and I may ſeem to have been too long ſilent. But what I have ſeen of this dreadful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, from one Sick and Dying Chamber to another, (and it may be ſcarce any one has ſeen more) awakens me now to write for the ſake of <hi>other Towns,</hi> where the Sickneſs is prevailing, or whither it may come; that <hi>they</hi> may not put from them <hi>the Mercy</hi> of GOD in this particular, as it ſeems to me that <hi>we</hi> have done. I can call upon <hi>my Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> who the moſt of them have at times paſs'd from the many ſad Spectacles of Woe, Corruption, Anguiſh and Diſtraction, to the Chambers of the <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> to ſay in what eaſe and ſweetneſs and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>theſe</hi> have lay. As the paſſing out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into light, or from a tempeſtuous Sea into a Calm Haven, or from a place of horror, into a a Garden of pleaſure, ſo it has been to us. A thouſand Compariſons here offer themſelves to mind, which I ſuppreſs becauſe they would ſeem <hi>odious</hi> to ſome, however juſt in themſelves.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſay, <hi>What I have ſeen in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Inoculated;</hi> for I have made it my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002211_0009_0FDACECA16E61B38"/>
to viſit ſome of them, and <hi>to obſerve the Work of GOD to his praiſe;</hi> And what I blame in others is, that they have not viſited them, and without prejudice or paſſion, or regard to any private Intereſt or pique, informed themſelves as they might eaſily have done of this great Thing which GOD has brought to light in our Day; and if I may ſerve to ſet it in any true light before others, I ſhall account my ſelf honoured of GOD therein.</p>
            <p>KNOW then, That the <hi>Inciſion</hi> which the <hi>Dr.</hi> makes in the Arm or Leg, are the leaſt you can well imagine, and but Skin deep; the quantity of the <hi>variolous matter</hi> which I have ſeen him uſe to good effect, has been but a ſingle and very ſmall drop upon a bit of Lint. After twenty four hours we threw it entirely away and put on a dreſſing of Cabbage leaf from day to day: for ſix and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eight days the Patient continues perfectly well; then a gentle Fever riſes, accompanied with all the Symptoms of the Small-Pox, but in a low degree, an aching head and back, and pains in in the bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This makes him dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for a Day or two, and preſently he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well and the Pock appears, riſes, turns, and goes off without any more illneſs or pain, ſave what the burning and ſoreneſs of the Pock may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to him, or ſome external Fever in the Fleſh without any inward one. For the firſt ſix days I have found the Iſſues opened very little; and ſeem'd to vent but little; yet in ſome bodies more than in others; but as the Fever comes on and the Pock begins to appear in the Skin, the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their own accord begin to open and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002211_0010_0FDACECB935C38F8"/>
and as the Pock fills and ripens the Iſſues every Day widen and run more and more, till at the turning of the Pock the ſixth or ſeventh Day, they come to their fulleſt flowing; and after two Days more they gradually decreaſe and abate and quickly heal of themſelves under the ſame dreſſing of Cabbage-leaf, which had before drawn them. So <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> is <hi>Nature</hi> in this its own Work, without the Aſſiſtance of Medicine ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and almoſt any need of Nurſing. Neither is there need ſcarce of a Watcher by night, no more than of a Nurſe by Day, the Patient feels and eats ſo well by Day, and ſleeps ſo well by night. He rarely complains of any pain in his Head, oppreſſion at his Breaſt, ſore Throat, or Thirſt; and is ſeldome offended with his own ſmell.</p>
            <p>BUT that which is the greateſt Benefit by Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and indeed the apparent Cauſe of all the eaſe and ſweetneſs experienc'd under it, is this, That as it <hi>moderates the firſt Fever</hi> and the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms before the Eruption of the Pock, ſo it ſeems totally to prevent <hi>the ſecond Fever</hi> at the turning of it, which is the fatal thing and time unto ſo many: The evident reaſon whereof is, becauſe the <hi>Oil</hi> or putid matter that ſhould be the Fuel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Body for the flame or fever keeps running out from Day to Day at the Inciſions: And beſides, the Body not being cover'd with the Pock, and conſequently not with ſcabs (and corruption un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame) when the Pock turns; as it has enjoyed a free perſpiration by the Pores, ſo there is no foul maſs upon it to return in, and mix with the juices and blood; by which it is that in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002211_0011_0FDACECEF934E5C0"/>
the confluent and fluxy ſort, the Body is tainted a ſecond time, as well as the perſpiring (ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto Life) is prevented. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this again is exceeding happy to the Inoculated, which is, That they have no After-blains and <hi>boils</hi> upon their bodies, which are ſo frequent and terrible after the ſuffering of the Small-Pox in the confluent kind: the reaſon whereof is apparent, Namely, Becauſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> keep open and running at and after the turning of the Pock, and ſo diſcharge freely and fully all the Ill ferment or humour, which if it where in part retain'd in the body would cauſe ſwellings and boils. So that whereas there is in the other way very often a return <hi>in</hi> of ſome of the ejected poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which taints the blood again; ſo here is an eaſy gentle perpetual flow <hi>out,</hi> with a continued perſpiration of the body, which prevents after boils, as well as the kindling any preſent conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming flame within the patient.</p>
            <p>IT is now ſome Months, four or five, ſince many of the Inoculated are come abroad, and they find neither boil nor ſore upon them; but are in as good a ſtate of health as ever they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd in their Life: Nay ſome have found a much better Complexion and Stomach than ever they had before; and particularly my own <hi>Child</hi> has found ſo thro' the favour of GOD.</p>
            <p>I can tell too of a Woman in the weakneſs of Child-bed, who eight days after her Delivery came under the Inoculation to avoid the Small-Pox the common-way, GOD ſending it then into
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002211_0012_0FDACECF94555E38"/>
the houſe where ſhe was; and tho' ſhe had many more puſtles than is uſual in this Method, yet ſhe went chearfully thro' the Viſitation, and even gain'd ſtrength while the Pock roſe to as fine and large a head, of the diſtinct kind, as I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Patient in the common way of Infection would have but <hi>few</hi> puſtles, he has to be ſure fewer, under the Inoculation: When he would elſe be exceeding <hi>full</hi> it greatly abates and leſſens the number of the Pock; and when it would be the <hi>confluent</hi> and fluxy kind we have all the reaſon in the World to think that it prevents the ſame, and brings on a <hi>diſtinct</hi> ſort; which ſort has but little danger attending it in the common way of Infection, and which only are proper to the Inoculation according to the Account given by the Gentlemen from the <hi>Levant.</hi> Sometimes the Inoculated whom I have ſeen have had a <hi>large</hi> and angry Pock and a good number of 'em too; ſometimes when there have not been many I have obſerv'd ſome of thoſe that have appear'd and riſen for two or three days to <hi>ſink</hi> away and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear; yet have they created no feveriſh diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when they have done ſo, which looks as if they diſcharged and vented themſelves by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions. Once I found a Young Man under the Inoculation full eno' to have given diſtreſs and danger as I apprehended, but his chearful eye and ſmiles immediately put me out of pain; profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me that he felt himſelf ſo well within, that were it ſafe or proper he tho't he could goe about his worldly buſineſs as well as ever in his Life. In others their fever has been high and

burning in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> when <hi>inwardly</hi> they have found no diſorder; neither in head nor breaſt, but could breathe and ſleep even as if in health, or next to it.</p>
            <p>I boldly profeſs concerning as many as I have ſeen under the Inoculation, even when their Pock came to the height, <hi>ſcarce the ſmell of ſickneſs has paſſed on them,</hi> in compariſon of what others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo in the common way. In ſome the Iſſues ſcarce ſmell at all, ſo much as to them that dreſs 'em. It has ſeem'd to me nothing more than what a Cabbage-leaf upon a <hi>common Iſſue</hi> muſt needs cauſe at the end of 24 hours. Where the Patient would have <hi>many</hi> Pock in the common way, and conſequently have the more under the Inoculation, there the Iſſues muſt be ſuppoſed to run the more. Where the <hi>Patient</hi> is fulleſt under the Inoculation I affirm I could never ſmell their Iſſues at their Bed-ſide; no not when I have lean'd over their Bed on purpoſe to do it. Yet certainly the Iſſues do ſmell more or leſs as the degree of the Diſtemper is upon the Patient. And where the Infection is taken the common way, and the <hi>Confluent kind</hi> comes in the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there the Iſſues you may well think find much more to vent, and the Diſcharge is <hi>more noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> like the running of the fluxy kind. But at the worſt, even in <hi>this caſe,</hi> the hours excepted wherein <hi>kidneys</hi> have been ſometimes applied to neck or feet, it is nothing, that I could ever find or hear, in compariſon of that prodigious <hi>ſtench</hi> which is ſo common for many days together under the fluxy ſort, wherein one can hardly bear the Rooms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002211_0014_0FDACED253EA5BB0"/>
IT therefore appears to me one of the boldeſt <hi>Impoſitions</hi> on our Senſes and Reaſon, that has been attempted ſince the Day wherein <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> was obtruded and forced upon the Chriſtian World, to bear us down as ſome would, "<hi>That the Inoculation has caus'd the dreadful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and Infection</hi> which has been in the Town. To ſay this to <hi>Us</hi> who have been call'd from day to day to the many <hi>noxious Chambers,</hi> each of which have had <hi>poiſon</hi> eno' in 'em to have ſpread the Town over, and which have been continually by day and night filling the Air with Infection by the Chimneys and doors, till at laſt the Windows have been thrown open too upon the Souls leaving the corrupted Body,—requires an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> indeed. Our Nei'bours muſt forgive us if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it as a moſt fooliſh Opinion, and ridiculous Imputation. We muſt call it ſo, if not worſe; or we muſt forego our ſenſe, and the common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which GOD has given us. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I muſt conſtantly think that the Inoculation has been an Abatement, and Prevention of the greater Malignity that would have been by more of the confluent and fluxy ſort. Beſides, In fact, the Malignity and Mortality has not been now ſo great, in proportion to our preſent numbers, as it was three and forty Year agoe, when in about fourteen Months we are told <hi>Eight hundred</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple died of it; which I ſuppoſe was a greater Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality than if <hi>Eighteen</hi> hundred had died of it now. Some who were then Adult tell me what great numbers were then buried in a Week: Families were then deſolated and broken up, and the very fleſh rotted off the bones of ſome. And we at laſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002211_0015_0FDACED3D4CA4400"/>
find too by ſad experience, that They underſtood as well the managing the Diſtemper then as we do now: For when the Malignity comes to a Height, we find that we know very little or nothing what to do.</p>
            <p>NOR does it appear to me at all reaſonable to think, that what the Iſſues of the Inoculated do diſcharge, is at all Malignant like what is vented by a fluxy Maturated Pock, and after it turns and lies ſtinking on the body: It is not filthy and putid, that ever I ſaw, like the running Pock: It has not the time to come to the venome of that before it is thrown out, and then it is immediately taken away; and conſequently as it arrives to no ſuch Malignity and Infection, ſo it can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate none ſuch.</p>
            <p>MUCH has been ſaid too, and dark hints given at times, about the <hi>Purple Spots</hi> in the skin, or <hi>blewiſh ſtains</hi> which have been upon many and commonly are the ſure and fatal ſigns of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death. But as <hi>theſe</hi> are ſpoken of by them that have wrote of the Small-Pox before our days; ſo I very much queſtion whether the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which I have ſeen ſo ſtained do yield any Malignant Infection equal to the corrupted and noiſome Bodies of others that ly and putrify un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fluxy kind. I am ſure to my ſenſes they have not at all ſeem'd equally noxious. And when I reaſon upon the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of theſe ſtains in the skin, it ſeems generally to be the ſuppreſſion of the Pock under it, which wants to come freely forth, but being obſtructed by the <hi>Stagnation</hi> of the Blood it riſes no higher than to diſcolour the skin; which tho' it may well argue more Malignity
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002211_0016_0FDACED554E169C8"/>
within and may give a more poiſonous breath to the Patient while he lives; yet Methinks the Pores of the Body do by no means breathe out the like Malignity as if the Pock riſes &amp; breaks &amp; ſtinks. How the caſe may be in <hi>Spotted Fevers</hi> I know not, and whether I am right in what I have here advanced I ſubmit to the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and am ready to ſtand corrected by their Judgment.</p>
            <p>THERE yet remains three or four things which have occurred to me, which I think meet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or relate,</p>
            <p>ONE is, That I am at preſent ſtrong in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that thoſe Perſons who had taken the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection before they were Inoculated, yet were greatly ſerv'd in their Sickneſs by the running of their Iſſues, which vented much of the Inflamato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter that would have increas'd their Fevers. Some who have recover'd have tho't ſo themſelves, and ſo have all about them. And as to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman that died, her Huſband has told me that in his opinion the Inciſions did much toward the preſerving his Wife ſo long, and ſo far as ſhe was preſerved thro' her ſore Viſitation.</p>
            <p>NEXTLY, I would obſerve, That in caſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be taken the common way, and the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not have been in ſome Weeks; As we certainly know that it will ly in the Body ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Month before it breaks out; yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Perſon coming under the Inoculation, it will bring on the Diſtemper at the uſual time of ſeven or eight days. Not only the reaſon but the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this ſeems very plain; and it accounts for a Difficulty with ſome, which is, Why the Sickneſs comes at the period proper to the Inoculation, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002211_0017_0FDACED6D76EAC28"/>
yet it proves the confluent kind which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it.</p>
            <p>I lately met with a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> on the Small-Pox wherein the <hi>Author</hi> advances this Rule or Maxim, <q>That all venemous Particles do firſt enter the Body thro' the Pores of the skin, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Humours &amp; juices, &amp; thence into the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin Parts. From hence he accounts why the face &amp; hands &amp; feet are uſually fulleſt of Pocks, becauſe thoſe parts of the body are more open and expoſed for the admiſſion or entrance of thoſe venomous Particles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I carry'd on the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in my own mind a little further, by that <hi>Modern Obſervation</hi> which has been made of a Multitude of <hi>Animalcula</hi> on every Puſtle of the Small-Pox: <hi>Theſe</hi> they tell us their Glaſſes have diſcover'd; and that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Infection is by ſwarms of theſe. If ſo, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho't theſe living Minute Particles, theſe Animated Atoms if I might ſo ſpeak, may much more eaſily find their way into our Pores &amp; ſo into our bodies, than if they were Inanimate.</p>
            <p>BUT if one Hypotheſis or other may be at all admitted, with this further &amp; moſt reaſonable tho't upon them, that theſe <hi>venemous Particles</hi> or <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcules</hi> do alſo flow into our noſtrils, throat and blood by our breath; then may they not give us a <hi>Reaſon</hi> why the Small-Pox communicated by Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the way of Inoculation, does not produce <hi>ſo many</hi> Pock, and ſuch a <hi>flame</hi> &amp; <hi>corruption</hi> in the body, as in the common way of Infection it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily does? Becauſe in this way not ſo many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002211_0018_0FDACED853D8D368"/>
But I pretend not to argue, on <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which are themſelves uncertain; and ly open to many Objections which I could never anſwer.</p>
            <p>I will only add upon all a plain, but to me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; informing <hi>diſcourſe</hi> I lately had with a <hi>poor Negro,</hi> whom I found at work where I made a viſit, and the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the Houſe told me the Fellow had been Inoculated in his own Country. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I put ſeveral queſtions to him, in anſwer to which he told me, That he liv'd in a great Town in his own Country, and when the Small-Pox came into it they did what they could to prevent the ſpreading of it; that the Families that were firſt viſited uſually died among them; but when the Sickneſs got into five or ſix houſes, ſo that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to deſpair of being able to ſtop it, then all who had not had it went preſently &amp; receiv'd it in the way of Inoculation, (as we call it) and that not one more died of it thro' the whole Town.</p>
            <p>WE do not ſtay therefore (ſaid he) till the Town be infected, and People have many of them got the Sickneſs within them, and then go &amp; take it; but a whole place takes it in a Week &amp; are well in a Week. (I uſe but ſome of his words here, giving the true ſenſe of what he ſaid to me.)</p>
            <p>HE went on in anſwer to the queſtions I put to him, and told me, "That he never knew of any blains or boils following this practice in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that as to himſelf none had troubled him, any more than what others are ſubject to; &amp; that He never heard of any bodies having it again in his Country; but to prove that his Country men think themſelves as ſecure from it as any of us may do, he told me, That ſometimes when Young men among them wanted to go a trading two or three hundred
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002211_0019_0FDACED9D32F0A90"/>
Miles off, but were afraid becauſe they had not yet had the Small-Pox, it was common for them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire where it was, &amp; go to the place &amp; be Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, &amp; then go &amp; trade any where without fear. When I aſk'd him (what I did not at all ſuppoſe he could imform me in) How his Country-men came into the knowledge of this way of giving the Small-Pox? &amp; how long it had been among them? he told me he knew nothing of thoſe things; he ſuppos'd it was long before he was born; and no doubt" but GOD told it to poor Negroes to ſave their lives; for they had not knowledge &amp; skill as we have.</p>
            <p>I believe I ſhall be ſcoff'd at for telling this <hi>Simple</hi> ſtory, but I think it very pertinent &amp; much to the purpoſe here; and whoſoever ſeeks the Truth &amp; deſires to be informed will not deſpiſe it. And he that has learnt any thing as he ought, has this—to be willing to learn of the pooreſt <hi>Slave</hi> in the Town.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, I do not think that I at all go out of my <hi>Line</hi> in the preſent Eſſay. The plain intent of it is to ſerve unto the preſerving of Life, and to miniſter unto the comfort of Families. This is a Care beſeeming me, or any one elſe, if it be manag'd with modeſty &amp; decency. My care to do it ſo, is I think viſible eno' in the preſent writing. I have avoided any appearance of ſeeming learned in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> I am not: Nor ſhall I matter it at all, if I have betray'd my Ignorance therein. I write with another deſign, &amp; if that be anſwer'd I have all my deſire; or if it be rejected with ſcorn and revil'd I ſhall be ſatisfyed in <hi>this,</hi> That I have again endeavoured the Good of this People.</p>
