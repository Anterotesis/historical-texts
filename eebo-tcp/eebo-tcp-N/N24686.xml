            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT is a dangerous thing to meddle with a Metaphor. Much knowledge of crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iciſm, and with writers on rhetoric, and much good reading, are requiſite.

               <p>WHEN we look over the works of the antient Eaſtern writers, we find a great ſameneſs in authors who were unknown to each other. Virtues and vices, the paſſions and inclinations, were likened to objects that ſurrounded, and to the various operations of nature. A man of integrity was like a <hi>rock</hi> in the ſea, unmoved with the <hi>waves</hi> of vice, or the <hi>ſtorms</hi> of adverſity. Anger, like a <hi>whirlwind,</hi> deſtroyed whatever oppoſed its fury. An army <hi>poured</hi> like a torrent. The horſemen <hi>flew</hi> over the plain. Love <hi>grew,</hi> Friendſhip <hi>died.</hi> And benevolence <hi>ſcattered</hi> bleſſings.</p>
               <p>NATURE preſents nearly the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in all parts of the world: hence the compariſons and figures of the firſt rude writers of any country have ſo much ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilarity. The Rhetoric of OSSIAN differs but little from that of the Perſian po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, or the Jewiſh prophets. Much original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity may be ſeen in all their writings. But
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032708_0005_0FF42BC3F4725C70"/>
when writers multiplied, and Criticiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enact her laws, impoſe her regulations, and ſet bounds to the irregular ſallies of imagination, originality of ſentiment was in a great meaſure wanting. The Poet read the Iliad; obſerved what ARISTOTLE or LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINUS condemned, and imitated his beauties, but ſcarcely dared to wander from his path, leſt the Critic ſhould cenſure his deviations. Fancy, who, with pleaſure, before wantoned in the garden of rhetoric, collected her odoriferous flowers, or ſtrayed to neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groves, or clumb the diſtant mount, to ſcan the beautiful and ſublime of nature, was now arreſted in her career. Criticiſm built her fences and made her encloſures, planted her vineyards and laid out her alleys; and ordered fancy never to tread prohibited grounds, nor wander from her ſight.</p>

               <p>I HAVE often thought that the fear of appearing before the bar of criticiſm, has been of eſſential diſſervice to a young genius. Tho
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032708_0006_0FF43405A57927A8"/>
leſs correct, the lucubrations of a young writer diſplay a noble wildneſs, and a pleaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherency. A ſuperiority of fire and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mark the works of all writers who were unacquainted with the laws of criticiſm.</p>
               <p>TO the cenſures of the critic, I always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the authority of the poet. The world may conſider it as a happineſs, that ADDISON and VOLTAIRE paſt not their ſtrictures on MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON and SHAKESPEARE, before their immortal works had gained univerſal applauſe. Sin and Death would have been ſtruck out from <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> and the plays of SHAKESPEARE been ſo mangled by the amendments of VOLTAIRE, that the Frenchified Bard of AVON would hardly have thanked the philoſopher of FERNEY, for his undeſerved kindneſs.</p>

               <p>A BAD writer is always a bad critic. True Taſte is as uncommon as an original writer. Some men poſſeſs good taſte in ſome branches of literature, and are deficient in others. One judges well of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032708_0007_0FF43407CEECDCA0"/>
proſaic compoſition, on one ſubject, another on another. Few are capable of criticiſing accurately on all. He that is a great proficient in grammar determines the merit of a piece by the accuracy of the ſpelling or the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. Another by the ſtyle. One is pleaſed with the pathetic only, another with wit; one is delighted with ſublimity, and another with rural ſimplicity. The ſouls of but few are poſſeſſed with apartments for a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive ſatisfaction in all. I know a man who reads POPE, but never perceives any thing pleaſing in MILTON. I know another who is pleaſed with all POPE's writings, who diſpiſes BUTLER's HUDIBRAS or TRUMBUL's M'FINGAL. This difference of ſentiment ariſes wholly from a want of true Taſte.</p>

               <p>EVERY man is a Critic; from him, whoſe whole life has been a continued pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of literary acquirements, to him, who was never converſant with any work but the Bible

and Pilgrim's Progreſs. A certain Juſtice of Peace, who is maſter of the "Town Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer," and has half a dozen old volumes in his library, is conſidered as an accurate judge of compoſition. His word ſanctions the worth of every performance, in the opinion of many. The freſhman, who has juſt gone thro VIRGIL, and has ſeen the works of the Engliſh poets, determines correctly the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act quantum of merit in each. When he arrives to his junior year, he either grows more modeſt, or becomes an arrant pedant. I have ſeen four or five diſcourſing on Mr. PAINE's Prologue; the fineſt allegory in the Engliſh language (the alluſion to the deluge) was condemned as nonſenſical and incorrect. On aſking their reaſons for ſuch a deciſion: "Why," ſaid they, "the ſtage was not erected, till long after the flood, and NOAH on mount <hi>Arrarat</hi> has certainly no connection with the Theatre." Yet theſe gentlemen were <hi>great ſcholars,</hi> and could manage a knotty ſyllogiſm, or demonſtrate the moſt intricate lemma in <hi>Enfield.</hi>

               <p>MANY people imagine that Poetry conſiſts entirely in a knack at rhyming; and on this preſumption have often become, in their own opinions, poets of the firſt rate. 'Tis difficult to give a true definition of this art. Its foundation is a lively imagination. An original manner of conception and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, a knowledge of grammar and metre, an intimate acquaintance with the paſſions and feelings, a correct judgment, long prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, much reading, and above all a good nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural underſtanding, are eſſentially neceſſary. Scribblers being poſſeſſed of ſome, yet defic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ient in moſt of theſe requiſites, what time has been ſpent, what paper has been waſted, what pains have been taken, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of chagrin, diſappointment and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, poverty and diſgrace. Volumes have opened their eyes to infamy and cloſed them in eternal oblivion. The world is ſtocked with poetry, and poetry with nonſenſe or plagiariſm.</p>

               <p>MUCH has been ſaid, and much has been written, on ſtile. A diverſity of ſtile exiſts both in poetry and proſe; but moſtly in poetry. The <hi>nervous, dry, laconic, flowery,</hi> &amp;c. are equally ſeen in both; added to which there ariſes in poetry a great variety, which depends on the conſtruction of poetical ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, the metre, tranpoſition and rhyme. Every one is apt to degrade the ſtile he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reach. One ſpeaks highly of the eaſe, nature and ſimplicity of Addiſon.

Another recommends Gibbon and Johnſon. The ſtately ſtiffneſs, the labored elegance of periods, wound off <hi>in rotundo,</hi> ſo common in Gibbon's Roman Hiſtory, are admired by writers, who approximate to his manner, and condemned by thoſe who are unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a pompous grandeur of periods.

               <p>SO much attention is paid and ſo much care taken to form a ſtile ſimilar to ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent writer, that the cultivation of language, rather than of ideas, becomes the ſtudy of thoſe who are anxious to diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the literary world. Stile is not a matter of ſuch importance as ſuppoſed by many. No man was leſs attentive to ſtile than Swift; yet the proſe works of but few are more admired. There is a mechanical manner of conſtructing ſentences, of which ſome have availed themſelves. The triad ſo frequent in Johnſon's works, the inſertion of an adjective, before almoſt every ſubſtantive, commencing a ſentence with a participle or adjective, the tranſpoſition of ſentences in imitation of the Latins; and every one's read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will furniſh him with a variety of other ways to raiſe and embelliſh the ideas. But by a continual repetition the art is ſeen and diſpleaſes. And unleſs the ſentiments are equal to the ſtile, it reſembles a ſplendid

               <p>IN poetry, the language muſt never fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the dignity is loſt when it fails, whatever the ſentiments.

That this war was a bleſſing to mankind may be proved from the authority of the knowing &amp; divine MILTON; for tho ſome of the fooliſh angels were rather worſted in the encounter, yet ſays he, to ſupply the place of thoſe that were ſent to chew their brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in miſery, and to repeople the abode of thoſe, whoſe places at their departure now became vacant, heaven thought ſit to create a new world, and a new ſet of beings, called man; and certainly man's exiſtence was a bleſſing, or it would never have been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

Had all lived in peace all would have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; all would have been on a level with the beaſts; all would have been as ſavage as the tygers they hunted. War brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, conqueſt reduction, reduction obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, obedience emulation, emulation envy and malice, and malice again brought war.

We all muſt have our exit; and in the great day of reckoning what will be the difference, whether we die by the dagger, the dungeon, or the diſentery? To the ſound of the trumpet flock the lovers from the frowns of the fair, and ruſh indifferently to glory or death. At the ſound of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032708_0036_0FF4346178940628"/>
trumpet flock the diſappointed ſtateſman, the ambitious youth, and the veteran hero. The loud clangor of the horn, the piercing ſhrill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fife, the animating pulſe of the drum, the ſudden whiz of the bullet, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion of the deep gulleted cannon, the other filled with ſmoke, the dying groans of the wounded, the ſpouting blood, the clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gore, and the mountains of departed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are objects, that yield the ſublimeſt ideas, that give the mind the moſt horrid ſatisfaction, that waken revenge, puſh to glory, honor and happineſs.

               <p>WAR has been an eſtabliſhed kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from the remoteſt days of antiquity; and would it not be highly ſatirizing the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of mankind, to ſay that from time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial they have been ignorant of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or have not fully known that war was a manly, rational entertainment and exerciſe, from the ſloth and luxury of peace?

               <p>MUSIC, whether conſidered as a ſource of pleaſure and rational entertainment, or as an ennobling duty in religious ſocieties, may with propriety be denominated the ſweeteſt roſe in the garden of the polite arts. It has little connection with any of the other arts except poetry, between theſe there is the cloſeſt affinity.</p>
               <p>EXCELLENCY in muſic depends on the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032708_0045_0FF42C1BD0CC79E0"/>
natural delicacy and conformity of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. The ſame may be ſaid with regard to a nice and intimate knowledge of accent, quantity and harmony, in poetic num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>As eminence in theſe arts depends pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily on nature, and ſecondly on a ſuitable cultivation of original powers, it has been the lot of but a proportionably ſmall part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to diſtinguiſh themſelves very greatly in the world. Hence many a HANDEL never touched an organ; and many a MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON never learned to read.</p>
               <p>Though few perſons ever become nice and accurate judges of muſic, yet the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure derived from it is almoſt univerſal. There are however ſome, whoſe ſouls ſeem to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize with nothing but diſcord, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the leaſt ſatisfaction from the beſt muſical performances in the world: but we may ſay with Shakeſpeare.</p>

The ruder principles of muſic are found in many of the brutal and inferior parts of creation. The feathered ſongſters, while ſporting from ſpray to ſpray, chant forth their Maker's praiſe. The readbreaſt mourns in ſolitary ſtrains her abſent mate: or when ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky boy has robbed her neſt, and from her love and protection torn her tender young; ſhe flutters round; and in the muſical moan of grief and deſpair, curſes the wretch, and bids and begs the pilfering hand to ſpare her unfledged offspring. The humming bird has muſic in his wings. The beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Canary clings to the grates of his unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come priſon; and, in notes of lively horror, ſeems to implore, at leaſt—the liberty of the yard. Nor birds alone. The regal lion ſtalks his lordly round, and pours his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>baſe</hi> to diſtant wilds. In vain the bleating lamb, with mild, yet melancholy cry, aſks the unfeeling butcher to ſtay his hand. Nay, even the ſurly bullfrog of the meadow, in homely, yet regular notes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulates
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032708_0047_0FF434845E442370"/>
his companions afar off, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes the ſolemn ſilence of the ſummer's night. And ſhall man, endowed with ſuch ſuperior faculties, and capable of heaving to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of human perfection the powers of harmony, ſhall man be ſilent?</p>
               <p>IN all nations and all ages of the world, attention has ever been paid to muſic. Its firſt appearance, we may ſuppoſe, was exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited in the rude tunes of the ſhepherd while tending his flock, or in ſongs ſung to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the triumphs of a victor, or the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of a hero.</p>
               <p>THE general regard that is now paid to muſic gives us the higheſt reaſon to believe that this country, ere long, will not bluſh at a compariſon with the elder nations of the world. While the Columbian muſe is lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſons to the pinnacle of poetical excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, equal in height to the Grecian or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man name; we hope the ſiſter art of muſic will not be ſlow in gathering her votaries, and diffuſing thoſe charms of which ſhe is ſo amply poſſeſt. Wherever a genius for muſic
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032708_0048_0FF42C2832C1E580"/>
is found, it deſerves our greateſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>NOTHING can exceed the vivacity and ſweetneſs which muſic receives when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with female voices.

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032708_0049_0FF4348AF54FEF18"/>
when ſoft muſic glides from her mellifflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tongue, he catches the ardor of angels, and his boſom ſwells with ecſtacy.</p>
               <p>THE towering notes of the <hi>counter,</hi> the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſound of the <hi>tenor,</hi> the ſhrill animating <hi>treble,</hi> the grand majeſtic <hi>baſs,</hi> all conſpiring in glorious concord, afford the ſoul ſuch rapture as the tongue is unable to deſcribe.

Such are the powers of the various modulations of harmony. Is it not then ſtrange that ſo little attention is paid, and ſo little pains taken in many ſocieties to become proficients in ſo divine an art? One reaſon we may aſſign. In many places, ſome elderly people, who, when young<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had attended to ſome particular tunes, once much in vogue, for which they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſuperſtitious fondneſs, continue to praiſe the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, in ſtrains of <hi>naſal twang,</hi> offenſive to the ears of common delicacy. They remain ſtrangers to any innovations or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to which they have not leiſure or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032708_0050_0FF4348E9F744AB8"/>
to attend. The tunes they uſe are the ſame their good old grandmothers ſung in their youth; and thus, having gained a kind of hereditary approbation, ſtill ſtand high in their opinion. Thus the verſification of the pſalms by Sternhold and Hopkins, as they were a long time printed at the end of the bible, led many to believe that the very rhymes were indited by inſpiration. Hence it was with the greateſt difficulty that the fooliſh prejudice of many could be ſo far overcome, as to introduce in our churches the far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior verſification of Tate and Brady, or Watts. And, not many years ſince, the introduction of the pitchpipe, and the raiſing and falling of the hands for the preſervation of time, were by many conſidered as uſeleſs and unhappy ceremonies, tending in a great meaſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Popery among us.</p>
               <p>INSTRUMENTAL muſic is certainly a great addition to vocal, and has the happieſt effect upon it. Yet there are ſome, even to this day, who are unwilling to admit into public worſhip the baſs viol, which adds ſo much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity to vocal muſic. The reaſon prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032708_0051_0FF42C4FC8EE7408"/>
by ſome is, that the baſs viol looks ſo much like the common violin, and the common violin is commonly called a fiddle, and a fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is commonly made uſe of to aſſiſt in danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore, the baſs viol in religions ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties would be apt to make the young men and women think of a fiddle, and a fiddle would lead to dancing: and thus carry their thoughts from religious meditations to danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fiddling, and other worldly and unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contemplations. For which reaſons the baſs viol is by them inadmiſſible. Arguing thus—why ſhould a man carry his legs to meeting on ſunday, when perhaps thoſe ſame legs carried him to a tavern the day before? The truth is, a man's legs may be of great ſervice to him on ſunday as well as week days; ſo may the violin contribute greatly to the innocent amuſements of dancing, and yet add ſolemnity to church muſic in the houſe of God.</p>

               <p>FASHION eſtabliſhes a thouſand ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous practices. I have doubted whether nature teaches the ſhaking of hands on find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend that has been abſent. It is a cuſtom of four thouſand years ſtanding. At the ſiege of Troy, Homer fequently mentions it. One of my neighbors, who ſees me gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally three or four times a day, always ſhakes hands with me, and twitches with ſuch violence, as to put my wriſt frequently in great pain. I ſee no propriety in this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Were it cuſtomary on finding a friend to kick his ſhins, who would be backward in following the faſhion? And there is in nature as much propriety in one practice as the other.</p>

               <p>I PASSED by the door of a very rich man. To ſupply his coffers, the widow had been defrauded; the face of the poor had been ground. His houſe was elegant and coſtly; his gardens and his orchards were delightful. Every thing appeared calculated to communicate happineſs. But peace nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dwelt in his habitation, nor was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ever free from reproof. The ſon of his benefactor was the loweſt menial of his kitchen. The virgins whom he had deprived of their chaſtity, were become common proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titutes. The ſordid ambition, the baſe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of accumulating property, not to aſſiſt his neighbors, not to benefit a friend, not to

               <p>As I was riding by, I ſaw his dog on his door ſtone; I was immediately led into a train of reflections on the dog and his maſter.

He was always eaſy, always in good ſpirits, always contented. His land was well cultured, and ſupplied him with moſt of the neceſſaries of life.

               <p>IT is the firſt "thing needful" to know one's ſelf, but it is almoſt equally important for worldly happineſs, to know other men.</p>
               <p>SOME preach up the propriety of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own buſineſs, and not concerning ourſelves in the affairs of others. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not totally good. The characters of all men ought to be open to inveſtigation: and cenſure, when juſt, ought never to be withheld. Even the name of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON is not ſacred, and never ought to be: yet the ungrounded, malicious calumnies that have been uttered againſt him have made
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032708_0062_0FF434AEE455A6A8"/>
more bright his reputation; for how has the gold become the moſt fine gold!</p>
               <p>THE characters of men, after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, are never beyond the ſcrutiny of truth. The old adage. <hi>Nil de mortuis niſi bonum,</hi> 'Say nothing of the dead except in their favor,' is wholly unreaſonable. What ſhall the honeſt hiſtorion ſay of NERO? He muſt paſs over him in ſilence; for not one good deed ever recommended him to notice.</p>
               <p>LET us be careful never to condemn, or ſpeak evil of men, without convincing proofs of their neglect of duty. Every man has faults enough of his own to mend, and ought ever be ready to hear and correct them.</p>

meant the democracy of the preſent day: but to this I am not willing to accede, for this reaſon; the Apoſtle, I am confident, would never trouble his own head nor thoſe of his readers with an account of a clan, deſtined to anſwer ſome good political end; to agitate the mind of republicans, a few months, and who, after ſailing down the ſtream of ridicule and execration, are wafted to the ocean of forgetfulneſs: to be remembered no more in this world to ſhame and ſorrow, but in the world to come, to their everlaſting miſery. I rather think the Apoſtle had particular ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence to thoſe jacobinical preachers, who, friends of liberty and equality, take the <hi>liberty</hi> to preach without knowledge or virtue, and conſider themſelves as <hi>equal</hi> to the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened divines; and thus, by good words and fair ſpeeches, deceiving the hearts of the ſimple.</p>

               <p>ON ſunday evening laſt, departed this life, after a long and painful ſickneſs, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a redundancy of gall, a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſaddlehorſe, late the property of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor JOHN P—S—Eſq. As it has been an invariable cuſtom, almoſt from time immemorial, to endeavor to tranſmit to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity the names of thoſe illuſtrious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who have deſerved well of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, no one, I preſume, will take it amiſs, if I employ the attention of my readers a few moments, while I endeavor to relate the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements and delineate the moſt ſtriking features of her character.</p>
               <p>SHE received from nature an excellent diſpoſition of mind, as well as great ſtrength and ſtability of ſoul. Tho ſhe was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the precepts of any religion, ſhe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032708_0067_0FF42C6D4DF91660"/>
poſſeſſed many Chriſtians virtues; ſuch as long ſuffering under affliction, and patience when heavy laden, which ſhe diſcovered in tranſporting meal bags, and performing long journies.</p>
               <p>SHE was not addicted to drink, except on warm days after much labor and fatigue. During her whole life 'tis not known that ſhe acquired a ſingle bad habit. The vices moſt common to beaſts of this kind, are biting, kicking, and turning over carriages. But thoughts like thee never touched her ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs imagination. During her illneſs ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no ſigns of remorſe, but ſeemed to be reflecting with pleaſure that ſhe had acted well in her ſphere; and that her work was done, and well done: no guilty conſcience planted her dying couch with thorns; not one tear trickled down her death pale noſtrils; not one ſigh eſcaped from her peaceful bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>As ſhe was fond of company, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grazed, and clubed with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in the ſame paſture, ſome inconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate

perſons have villified her name by repreſenting her to be a rank jacobin. But may that villain be the heir of eternal infamy, who could thus wantonly aſperſe the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo amiable a creature.</p>
               <p>After having eſcaped the SCYLLA of the Botts, &amp; the Charybdis of the horſe diſtemper, ſhe was ſucked in by the vortex of a redundant gall, and reſigned her ſoul with compoſure, on ſunday the 20 day of december, in the year of our LORD 1792, in the 19th year of the independence of the United States of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, aged 24 years, 5 months and 10 days, and in the 21ſt year of her uſefulneſs.</p>
