            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>ISAIAH, xi. 13.</bibl>
               <q>THE ENVY ALSO OF EPHRAIM SHALL DEPART, AND THE ADVERSARIES OF JUDAH SHALL BE CUT OFF: EPHRAIM SHALL NOT ENVY JUDAH, AND JUDAH SHALL NOT VEX EPHRAIM.—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE occaſion of the preſent ſolemnity is evidently decent and pious. We cannot behold theſe military gentlemen, incorporated for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes valuable to ſociety, waiting upon God with humble ſupplication and thankſgiving on this day of their Annual Election, without ſenſations of approbation, eſteem, and pleaſure.—It is owing to the bleſſing of the great and beneficent Being whom they are aſſembled to worſhip, that, they have been ſed, cloathed, and refreſhed during the paſt year, and appear before him this day with the gaiety, elegance, and activity of the ſoldier. And,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021669_0004_0FB508FF86D75BA8"/>
whoſe patronage and favour ſhould they more earneſtly deſire than His, who can ſend forth his light and truth, and influence them to whatever is great, honourable, and good?—Never need ye be aſhamed to expreſs yourſelves in the language, and act in the ſpirit of a pious and celebrated Chief—"<hi>O come let us worſhip and bow down before the Lord our Maker! For, the Lord God is a ſun and ſhield; the Lord will give grace and glory: No good thing will be withhold from thoſe who walk uprightly. O Lord of Hoſts, bleſſed is the man who truſteth in thee.</hi>"</p>
            <p>NOR does this ſolemnity only gain our approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a religious ſervice, but as a reſpectful memorial of the good ſenſe, and piety of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. Could we now ſummons them from their graves, they would be pleaſed with our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and with the warm feelings of parents and patriots would addreſs us—"Shun our vices: Emulate our virtues. Let LEARNING, LIBERTY AND ARMS; INDUSTRY, GOOD MORALS, AND RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION be eſtabliſhed and encouraged amongſt you—and GOD, the omnipotent patron of all good ſocieties, will be your defence and glory."</p>
            <p>BUT, are there not thoſe who will ſay—How af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontive to worſhip the kind and beneficent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of mankind cloathed with the garments of war, and the inſtruments of injury and death in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021669_0005_0FB5090278391CB8"/>
our hands! This appeal immediately intereſts the feelings, and commands the opinion of many, whom we cannot but love for their meek and gentle diſpoſition, againſt war in every form, and under every condition.—However ſpeciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, it is, ſay they, abhorrent to God, to the beſt feelings of human nature, and the amiable and charitable ſpirit of the religion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>PEACE is a lovely object of contemplation to the human mind and imagination, and her influences are moſt pleaſant to our feelings. Under her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignant reign ſecurity ſmiles in the countenances, and rejoices the hearts of mankind: The Stateſman quietly inveſtigates the publick intereſt, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually introduces wiſe and beneficial regulations: Agriculture flouriſhes: Commerce proſpers: The Arts and Sciences improve: And, every cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſpires to propagate and eſtabliſh the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and habits of publick and private order, virtue and happineſs.—Nor can it be diſſembled that WAR is an evil moſt juſtly dreaded by the thoughtful, juſt and humane in every ſociety:—In its mildeſt form it greatly leſſens enjoyment wherever it prevails, and ſubjects mankind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing fears and ſufferings: And, in its harſheſt, like the ſtorm of Heaven, ſpreads darkneſs over the moſt pleaſant and cheerful proſpects, and marks its progreſs with ravage, deſtruction, and miſery. Humanity weeps, and refuſes to be comforted, when ſhe beholds this ſcourge of the world reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021669_0006_0FB5090597ACE5D8"/>
over any region of the earth.—The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants forſake the occupations of peaceful life, and fly hither and thither, expoſed to all the diſtreſſes of inſecurity and want: The fields ceaſe to bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom like the roſe, and become barren and deſolate: The ſweet charities of life fail; vice and diſorder reign uncontrouled: And, wherever we look, ſcenes of ruin and miſery aſtoniſh our minds, and pain our hearts.—From this comparative view, we may be immediately convinced that Peace is more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than War; and much more agreeable to the ſpirit of that gentle and beneficent religion which was introduced into the world proclaiming "<hi>Peace on earth: Good will towards men.</hi>" But ſhall we hence ſay, The profeſſion of the SOLDIER is an unjuſtifiable profeſſion?—And WAR never inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and laudably entered into, and proſecuted by ſocieties?—Truth is ſeldom diſcerned through the medium of feeling. In every important de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, wiſe and good men will place themſelves under the influence of feeling, <hi>only</hi> when guided and corrected by impartial reaſon, and the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtructions of divine revelation.—Perhaps, in this ſituation, and under ſuch light and inſtruction, we ſhall be convinced WAR is our certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the preſent condition of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, juſt as many other of the evils of life are—That the permiſſion of War cannot upon any ſcheme of religion be proved more inconſiſtent
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021669_0007_0FB509089F668B30"/>
with the perfections of the righteous and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Governour of mankind, than the permiſſion of other natural and moral evils:—Yea, like them, is much ameliorated by his efficient hand, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, contrary to its nature, productive of good effects:—And upon the whole that War, in certain ſituations, and under certain conditions, is not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the chriſtian character, and our hope in the glorious promiſes of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to enlarge upon theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, I would mention that the following truths are taken for granted—that we are under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and government of an almighty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being, who has made known his will to us, not only by reaſon and experience, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and expects we ſhould venerate and obey it; and that man is a rational and accountable creature, in ſome proper ſenſe maſter of his own actions, and amenable for his conduct at his bar.—If we are not under the government of God, and are not accountable, then all actions and courſes of action become indifferent, and it is mere idleneſs to ſpend any time in ſpeculation upon their nature and conſequences. But allowing theſe maxims to be juſt, ſuch inveſtigations we muſt conceive immediately proper, for they may be of infinite conſequence to our caſe of mind, and our improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and worth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021669_0008_0FB50909F2C0FB20"/>
1. THE ULTIMATE SOURCE of War is thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and paſſions which experience, obſervation, and univerſal hiſtory prove actuate mankind when formed into different ſocieties, and oppoſed to each other by rivalſhip, and injuries, ariſing from mutual endeavours for ſuperiority and lucrative advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages—Thoſe principles and paſſions which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them when fellow-ſubjects of the ſame civil community, after they are divided into parties, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated by neglects and wrongs, or ſeduced by the ſlattering promiſes of ambition and power to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt preeminence. But the PROXIMATE SOURCE of War is that ſeparation of nations and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als which oppoſes them, and inſpires them with hoſtile intentions.—Until a diviſion takes place between them, leading them to ſuch meaſures as are affrontive, and will in the general opinion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well grounded, or artificially raiſed, be ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their honour and intereſts, thoſe fierce prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in human nature which rouſe to reſiſtance and injury lie inactive, as the various ſprings and wheels of a machine, until ſet in motion by the power which is to govern them. Were mankind individually enlightened, or under the government of enlightened leaders—were they humble, mild, equitable and benevolent, or under the ſupreme direction of rulers governed by a juſt and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent temper, War would be no more. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſocieties on earth would form into one grand
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021669_0009_0FB5090CF7C66588"/>
and peaceful monarchy; or if they continued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate would live together like independent fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies loving, and beloved—Subjects of the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, like affectionate children of the ſame family, would ſweetly unite together in every office of juſtice and kindneſs.—But this is not the preſent condition of mankind; nor has it ever been their condition, if we may believe the hiſtorical regiſters of the times before us. The great body of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and thoſe who controul and govern them, may, in the cool hours of retirement and reflection, judge the ſituation of univerſal peace and love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful: But when they enter the world and begin to act, they are not influenced by ſuch agreeable ſentiments. Their underſtandings perſuade them very differently, when concerned with men and things, than when engaged with ſpeculative no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the pleaſing pictures of fancy and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Mankind do not chooſe to live together under one denomination, to be governed by the ſame laws, and have the ſame intereſts; but to dwell ſeparately, govern themſelves by different civil conſtitutions, and purſue different intereſts, though they cannot without mutual oppoſition and injury. Members of the ſame community will divide into inveterate parties; and will often pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their oppoſite meaſures until they dye each others garments in blood. Or, if we ſuppoſe their choice is not the cauſe of their diviſion into ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nations and parties, then we muſt affirm it
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021669_0010_0FB5091020993ED0"/>
owing to the ordination of our great Creator, who will do all his pleaſure throughout univerſal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—But whether mankind are in a ſeparate ſtate by their own choice, or the will of their Creator, it is their diviſion which awakes and gives force to thoſe principles and paſſions which have in every age of the world, however ignorant and barbarous, civilized and well inſtructed, been a ſource of wars and fightings. The hiſtory of the people men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our text, will exemplify the operation of human paſſions between different nations, nearly enough ſituated to be politically connected; and the ſame nation divided into two powerful parties. For, notwithſtanding EPHRAIM and JUDAH were now different nations, yet they had the feelings of parties in the ſame nation.—They originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the ſame ſtock, poſſeſſed a common territory, and were fellow ſubjects of the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, though they had ſeparated upon political diſſenſions; and ſuppoſed very naturally they had an equal claim to ſuperiority on the inheritance God had given them, if they could acquire it by art or force.—JUDAH enjoyed the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed advantages in conſequence of their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:—They were more numerous, and poſſeſſed the largeſt, the moſt pleaſant and fruitful part of the land—Moreover, they had amongſt them the only authorized worſhip of God, which was eſteemed an invaluable bleſſing.—What was the effect upon EPHRAIM of their more deſirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?—
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021669_0011_0FB50911954C87A8"/>
They beheld their more reſpectable and happy neighbours with a degree of envy which ſoured their minds, irritated their paſſions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to improve every means which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to abaſe them. What was the effect of their reſtleſs diſpoſition and injurious conduct upon JUDAH?—They looked down upon their feeble and impatient enemy with haughty and reſentful airs, and exerted their policy and power to vex and deſtroy them. In this general ſtate of ſentiment and feeling, the great body of their people were eaſily inflamed with the rage of war, whenever their influential men were led by their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their private intereſts and private enmities, their love of power and ſame, or indeed the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and humours of their near connections to wiſh they ſhould be: And, events were often tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in conſequence of their general ſituation, and frequent commerce with each other, which gave them room under the cover of patriotick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to excite a ſpirit of animoſity ſatiated only with injury and bloodſhed. Hence their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inroads, and endeavours to perplex, diſtreſs, and humble each other.</p>
            <p>BUT ye will aſk, how can this conſtitution of things be reconciled to the ſupreme government of perfect rectitude, wiſdom, and benevolence? How can ſo powerful, righteous, and good a Being decree or permit human ſituations and paſſions to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021669_0012_0FB5091A601F57C8"/>
have ſo baneful an influence upon human conduct and enjoyment?—The fact is—it has taken place by his ſupreme agency, or with his permiſſion.—"<hi>He maketh peace, and createth evil—When he giveth quietneſs, who then can make trouble? And when be hideth his face, who then can behold him, whether it be done againſt a nation or againſt a man only?</hi> And, why muſt we ſuppoſe this conſtitution militates with the excellence of his nature? The moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable reaſon we can urge againſt its introduction is, That it places man lower upon the ſcale of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and enjoyment than he otherwiſe would be. This is allowed:—Were mankind governed by the principles of union, and did the motives of piety, juſtice, and benevolence reign in them with an influence deſtructive to every kind of injury and war, they would be much more amiable, lovely, and virtuous than they now are; they would be free from many inconveniences and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which they now feel, and enjoy a degree of happineſs which they now feebly imagine. But this is not their condition. They have ſo large a ſhare of the brutal united with the divine in their nature, as to continue them hitherto in a far leſs reſpectable and happy ſtate of being. Still, this is only ſaying, man is leſs perfect, and leſs happy than God might have made him.—But, "<hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi>" What arrogance and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety?—

May not he who freely gives unto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures capacities of worth and means of enjoyment, give them in the proportion he pleaſes, provided exiſtence is on the whole a bleſſing; not a curſe, but in conſequence of our voluntary ill-behaviour?—Muſt he give in the higheſt degree he is able, or be chargeable with want of wiſdom, with injuſtice and cruelty?—Conſider whither this reaſoning leads you—If the Deity had acted in the ſpirit of this principle, that immenſe variety of creatures he has made, filling up in nice gradation the ſpace between the humbleſt inſect, and the moſt exalted ſpirit, and diſplaying every poſſible degree of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, intelligence, virtue and happineſs would have failed. There would have been but one race of creatures, and that, "<hi>next to the throne of God.</hi>" Judge ye which ſcheme gives us the moſt lively exhibition of the almighty power, and infinite wiſdom of God; and admits the greateſt ſum of happineſs and diſplay of benevolence?</p>
            <p>IT is true, War is a ſource of very diſtreſſing evils. Countries expoſed to every kind of injury from a mad and lawleſs ſoldiery.—Thoſe once happy in the tender connections of life, and eaſy in a ſufficiency to ſupply their wants and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences—mourning with pathetick exclamations of grief their loſt relatives and departed property—are very affecting objects. We tenderly ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with them, and deprecate War as the w<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

judgment with which a juſt God afflicts his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—But let us remember, in this very painful ſituation, that God in the midſt of judgments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets not mercy, and often from exceſſive evils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces very valuable bleſſings.—The violence and miſery we ſo ſenſibly feel and pity, <hi>may</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of very important and happy events:—They may ſecure freedom to a people, depreſſed and miſerable, yield them immediately the moſt exquiſite ſenſations of ſatiſfaction and pleaſure, and lay a foundation for their publick worth and felicity which ſhall laſt for ages.—They may act like very powerful and painful medicine in the human body—produce intire and beneficial charges—rouſe ſocieties thoughtleſs, enervated, and abandoned to conſideration, and influence them to a change of manners which ſhall render them reſpectable and proſperous.—They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times place ſocieties incurably vicious, before mankind, affecting examples of the ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of impious and unſocial manners under the government of God; and very perſuaſively urge thoſe which behold them to ſhun their profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, that they may avoid their ruin. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effects alſo of the operations of war, which we are apt to conceive evil, and only evil, are not ſo. They are productive of tranſport of mind, as well as dejection of ſpirits; very lively pleaſures, as well as very excruciating pains. The ſtormed and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021669_0015_0FB5092750595550"/>
plundered city is a ſcene of diſtreſs and anguiſh, but the conquering army is the ſeat of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cheerful feſtivity. The loſſes of friends and hard-earned property of which the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed complain with ſuch woeful countenances and animated expreſſions of grief; the victorious count their gain, and celebrate as very ſignal favours.—The extreme poverty which overtakes ſome from want of employment, is balanced by the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of buſineſs which war opens, and the diſtinction and plenty with which they bleſs thoſe who proſecute them.—It is evident then of war, as it is of many other cauſes of human ſuffering, that it is not a clear and unmixed evil; but by the indulgence of God made productive of kind effects to balance in a degree the pain which, in many inſtances, it occaſions.</p>
            <p>TAKE the whole variety of human ſituations, and we ſhall find no one ſtate ſo indulgent to vice, as to exclude intirely reſpectable characters, uſeful and divine virtues. War is productive of much depravity and vice.—In the ſtate of war domeſtick and civil government are much relaxed; and there is ſuch a continued ſucceſſion of objects paſſing before us which engage our imaginations and paſſions, and are connected with our moſt valuable intereſts, as takes off our attention from thoſe intereſting ſubjects of religion and morals which deſerve our conſtant reverence, and ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021669_0016_0FB5092F4BF48430"/>
command our conſtant obedience. The uſual courſe of things alters; and the alteration has a pernicious influence upon many. Acquiſitions of property and diſtinction in the natural ſtate of things are gradually made: And before we make them in any diſtinguiſhing degree, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them with equal minds, and the reſolution of a wife and good improvement of them. But in war proſperity often comes upon us by ſurprize, we are inſtantly rich and powerful men—the ſuddenneſs of the elevation intoxicates us, and we act without diſcretion or virtue.—Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity alſo, in the natural courſe of things, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances upon us gradually, and we are prepared to receive it with firmneſs, before it ſeizes us with violence. But, in war, adverſity often falls upon us at an unexpected moment—diſtracts our minds—breaks our ſpirits—and occaſions us to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Divine Providence, and abandon ourſelves without reſtraint to diſreputable and ruinous vices.—Yet war has not univerſally this ill opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Its uncertainties and changes, its proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and adverſities, tend powerfully to teach us our dependence upon God, who rules over all, and the inſecure nature of human happineſs—firmneſs, equanimity, ſympathy and compaſſion, thoſe wiſeſt and beſt of leſſons. Some there are, who improve War to this worthy purpoſe, and make advances in whatever amends, adorns and dignifies the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021669_0017_0FB50930469AB838"/>
man character. The moral and religious proſpect around, may to the ſerious and good be waſte, deformed, and frightful, but there will ſtill be ſome objects of ſuperiour worth and beauty, as if interſperſed on purpoſe to compenſate for the general ſcene.—Particularly we may obſerve, that the ſtate of war creates characters of the moſt brilliant qualities, and extenſive uſefulneſs in the judgment of mankind; and which do not ceaſe with war to be celebrated and beneficial, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue through the periods of peace to deſerve the attention which is paid them. The characters which are formed of courage, magnanimity, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating forefight, and a maſterly command of the paſſions and actions of men, are thoſe which we look upon with the moſt partial fondneſs, and unite to addreſs with the moſt unaffected praiſe. Theſe ariſe amidſt the dangers and perplexities of war as in their proper ſoil, and are manured and perfected by its progreſs. Nor do they ceaſe to live and act when war ceaſes: They continue in the ſtate of peace, and are frequently the chief guardians and conſervators of the publick intereſt, when the members of ſociety, in general, <hi>are</hi> by the ſeducing influence of eaſe and ſecurity, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up intirely within themſelves, and account thoſe expenſes hard, and ſervices laborious, which the exiſtence, proſperity and ſplendour of the State require.—I feel a degree of pride in exemplifying this remark from the hiſtory of our own country,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021669_0018_0FB50931B9815040"/>
which I know my hearers will approve. The late war produced—Politicians endued with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble penetration of mind, and firmneſs and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of ſpirit; who guided us through a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eminent hazards with maſterly ſkill, and eſtabliſhed us in a condition of ſafety, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſperity and happineſs, which nothing will deſtroy but our own imprudence and folly—Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, from Generals to the inferiour officers, who diſplayed the moſt applauded qualifications of their ſtation, and won in action the faireſt wreaths of military honour and renown.—Politicians, who yet have their country near their hearts, and are unweariedly ſtudying its intereſts, and labouring to render it wiſe and happy—Soldiers, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, though unpaid and injuriouſly cenſured; retired to their homes without clamour; and have hitherto remarkably practiſed the virtues which adorn civil life, and manifeſted thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſpoſitions which prove they will yet, ſhould occaſion require, be a firm and intrepid band to ſupport and defend their country.</p>
            <p>THESE reflections tend to ſatiſfy our minds with the divine permiſſion of war, and to render us more compoſed under it as an evil.—Yet we may conceive war, notwithſtanding, oppoſed in all its forms to the ſpirit of chriſtianity; and, not only ſo, but that thoſe cannot be in any ſenſe the true diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, who patronize, ſupport, or perſonally bear part in it.—Thoſe wars entered
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021669_0019_0FB5093503730A98"/>
into by antient and modern princes for the mere purpoſe of gratifying their ambition, pride, and humour, are abhorrent altogether to the juſt and benevolent religion which we profeſs.—The abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch perſons may be exalted, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſplendid, but they are the foes of mankind, and richly deſerve the accumulated pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they have brought upon their fellow creatures.—But War which has for its object the ſecurity of our lives, liberties, and eſtates, and is cloſed when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are ſecured, has been conceived by Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians almoſt univerſally JUSTIFIABLE SELF DEFENCE. They have conceived duty and honour call upon them to defend themſelves when injuriouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked; and that Heaven requires not ſubmiſſion to violence and robbery, until all their efforts are inſufficient to repel them.—Still is it not true that Chriſtianity was deſigned to reſtrain all thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and malignant paſſions which occaſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, injury and war?—Would not this pure and charitable inſtitution, if it had its perfect work upon mankind generally, put an intire cloſe to war, and eſtabliſh the ſupreme dominion of peace?—It would undoubtedly, and thereby vaſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the worth and happineſs of men.—But the complete operation of this divine religion is not conſiſtent with the preſent ſtate of human nature.—Perfect Chriſtians muſt retreat from the world to exemplify their principles. We cannot live in this ſtate without allowing ſome movements of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and adopting, at times, the vigorous
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021669_0020_0FB509363056F448"/>
means of defence. A very conſiderable part of mankind are not Chriſtians, and juſtify themſelves in all the practices of war: Nor would they fail with eager zeal to improve the non-reſiſtance of Chriſtian countries to their complete ſubjugation and miſery.—Moſt of thoſe who call themſelves the diſciples of Chriſt, notwithſtanding they are in ſome degree influenced by the juſt and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſpirit of his religion, yet are ſo far under the government of ſelfiſh deſires, that they will pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and publickly attack each other, and if they are able, wreſt from them their poſſeſſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and convert them to their own uſe.—Yet we may not ſay becauſe we are not perfect Chriſtians, we are altogether unchriſtian; or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſtianity does not produce all thoſe great and good effects in our age, it is capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in a different ſituation, therefore it is not a bleſſing.—The religion of Jeſus has a real and good influence upon individuals and ſocieties now, though it has not its fulleſt and beſt effects. It renders them more juſt, equitable, and humane than they otherwiſe would be; and as it gradually increaſes its power over the minds and feelings and manners of men, becomes a richer and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant bleſſing.—Had chriſtianity a ſovereign influence, our ſituation would be entirely altered. We ſhould be ſupported by its ſingle operation without the influence of reſentment, love of life and property, and the publick principles which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021669_0021_0FB5093DE6BEF200"/>
are in our nature: But until this ſovereign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence commences, we muſt be indebted for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and ſafety partly to their exerciſe; and aim at approving ourſelves the faithful ſervants of God, not by rooting them out, but by preſerving their operation within the bound of that great command, enregiſtered not only in the goſpel, but in every mind, "ALL THINGS, WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM."</p>
            <p>WAR being conſidered as the ſource of miſchief to ſocieties, and miſery to the human race, we have reaſon to bleſs God whenever its deſtructive conſequences are leſſened, in any degree, by his merciful influence. Notwithſtanding all the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviating circumſtances which attend the diſtreſſes of war, thoſe ſocieties have the moſt ſubſtantial reaſons for bleſſing God (who appoints the bounds of our habitations) which conclude upon the beſt grounds they ſhall not be frequently viſited with this cruel ſcourge.—There is in this reſpect a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the ſituations of the nations which people the earth.—And, may we not ſuppoſe, we are favoured in our allotment, when we eſtimate its worth with immediate reference to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of war?—Many circumſtances conſpire to raiſe and eſtabliſh the pleaſant idea in our minds.</p>
            <p>OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ſtrengthens this conception of our ſituation. The more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021669_0022_0FB50940FAE71618"/>
and impartially we contemplate this plan of government, the more fully we ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it is well calculated to promote our publick and private ſafety and felicity. To give us juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, order, and peace at home, and growing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation abroad—To leſſen the danger of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſſenſion and foreign war, and put in action all the cauſes of national honour and proſperity.—It ſecures us all our rights, as men and chriſtians: And has within itſelf the ſtrong principles of wiſe ſelf-regulation—It will be obſerved in all its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with watchful jealouſy by our State govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and powerful individuals—Many of the moſt active cauſes will unite to render it perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and beneficial.—And may we not juſtly hope ſuch a large deſcription of the people for whoſe good it was inſtituted will ſubmit to its regular adminiſtration as to render it an eſtabliſhed and efficient government?—Will they readily ſacrifice a character diſtinguiſhed for wiſdom and a degree of choice in their governments never exhibited in the world before? Will they readily throw up probable liberty and happineſs, and plunge into the ocean of uncertain events?—Nor need we fear but this government will ever be attended with the beſt bleſſings of Heaven while the maxims of its ILLUSTRIOUS PRESIDENT are adopted as ſacred maxims of conduct by its ſeveral branches: They are theſe, and ſhould be recorded on monuments of braſs in full view of all governing bodies of men
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021669_0023_0FB5094259B3E138"/>
throughout the world—"There is no truth more thoroughly eſtabliſhed, than that there exiſts in the oeconomy and courſe of nature, an indiſſoluble union between virtue and happineſs—between du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and advantage—between the genuine maxims of an honeſt and magnanimous policy, and the ſolid rewards of publick proſperity and felicity."—"A truſt of the greateſt magnitude is committed to this Legiſlature, and the eyes of the world are upon you.—Your Country expects from the reſult of your deliberations, in concurrence with the other branches of government, conſideration abroad, and contentment at home—proſperity, order, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, peace, and liberty—And may God Almighty's providence aſſiſt you to anſwer their juſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."—With high anxiety we beheld this EDIFICE gradually riſing! How ſincerely did we rejoice upon its completion!—May it be a TEMPLE con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to enlightened liberty, mild and equal legiſlation, and all the means of publick tranquility and happineſs! May its CHIEF PRIESTS ever be famed for their enlarged minds, their manly and liberal principles, and execute their high powers ſo as to render themſelves moſt juſtly the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delight of this nation—And its MINIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRING SERVANTS an aſſembly of men who have wiſdom to diſcern, and magnanimity to purſue its true intereſts!—O THOU GOD OF THE UNIVERSE, who art wiſer than the wiſeſt, and the almighty patron of all good ſocieties—all ſpace is thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021669_0024_0FB50945EFB0A9F8"/>
and thou condeſcendeſt, when particularly preſent in any part of thy creation; yet be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſent at all times in this TEMPLE made with hands: and may its ſtatutes and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments put an end to the ſound of the trumpet, and the alarm of war in our borders, and bleſs us with all that can render a people free, virtuous, and happy. Again: The comparative ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe United States, and the foreigners in their neighbourhood, render it improbable that <hi>they</hi> will give frequent occaſion for war; and a ſolicitude to avoid embroiling themſelves with the powerful European nations of which <hi>they</hi> are colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, will render our government particularly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to avoid every thing which juſtly irritates. The jealouſy in the European nations of each other, which is ever awake, will never permit any one of them, was a ſcheme of the kind practicable, to make conqueſt, and extend its dominion here. Was any particular nation to adventure this plan, other nations in union with us would fruſtrate it.—Moreover, the diſtance of Europe from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and the number and warlike diſpoſition of the inhabitants of theſe States, render the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſucceſſfully preventing war in oppoſition to them, on their own ground, almoſt inſuperable.—Thus we reaſon upon the ſubject, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the very pleaſing idea that wars will not be frequent amongſt us. May God fulfil the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation!.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:021669_0025_0FB50954E6F148B8"/>
III.—BUT, we can never reaſon with certainty of thoſe events in which the paſſions of men have very conſiderable deciſion.—This people intelligent and free, and now capable of proving to mankind what they have never ſeen proved before—That communities of men are capable of deliberating upon forms of government, chuſing thoſe which are friendly to all the rights which men can enjoy in ſociety, and yet of eſtabliſhing an AUTHORITY which ſhall controul their actions deſtructive to the ſocial ſtate—may yet grow mad; and in their phrenzy deſpiſe the warning voice of wiſdom and the calls of reputation, and place themſelves before mankind an affecting example of a people ruined by their own intemperance.—European Nations may become ſo jealous of a riſing people, which let alone may rival them in power and commerce, as to forget their jealouſies of each other—and ſuffer any ſtate amongſt them which chuſes, to extend conqueſt and dominion upon our territory unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained.—Our own government may become proud and tyrannical, and aim at proſtrating the rights and liberties of this people before them. An ARMED FORCE is the alone effectual mean of completing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe purpoſes, or of ſucceſſfully counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting them. The ſeditious ſubverters of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they cannot ſecure their wiſhes by private practices, appeal to arms—Conqueſt and dominion are gained by arms—Tyrannical power is eſtabliſhed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021669_0026_0FB50955C2FD9C18"/>
by arms—Nor can a people defend their territory, or reſiſt an aſſuming government but by arms—"All authority which is not ſupported by power is nothing but an empty name."—Is not then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this COMPANY, and of every other body of men deſigned to keep alive the ſpirit of arms and diffuſe military knowledge, a valuable meaſure?—It is true, this Company when it was firſt formed was more immediately beneficial than at preſent: Yet <hi>now,</hi> by their example and advice, they may greatly aid and proſper the military arrangements of the government.—In this deſign they ſhould vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly unite with his EXCELLENCY, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief—and with all other wiſe and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick men throughout the State.—A MILITIA is ſaid to be the only legitimate defence of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it is the only defence which our free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will allow us.—Shall any then ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly of a Militia? Shall any fail uſing their utmoſt exertions that our's may be regular and well trained?—It is the ſafeguard, under God, in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate circumſtances, of the fair inheritance which our fathers have left us—of our government and our religion.—Our young men will act worthily in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into it, and exerting their beſt abilities to render it truly reſpectable, and a ſubſtantial ſecurity to their country.—Nor can I conceive why thoſe of the firſt rank and diſtinction ſhould refuſe its ſervices and honours.—It is the only legal defence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021669_0027_0FB5095EA0153220"/>
of the land in which they dwell—Its duties ſerve to give ſtrength to their bodies, and elegance to their form and manners—Its commands give them rank and popularity with their fellow citizens; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them capable of yielding very eſſential ſervices to their country in peace and war; and of riſing to its firſt honours.—The VETERAN GENERAL who has ſeen long ſervice, and dignified his ſtation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes not to command them.—But I have tired your patience and will conclude.—</p>
            <p>IV.—VARIOUS cauſes have united in our age to render mankind much leſs ferocious, and war much leſs cruel and deſtructive, than they have been ages before us.—The celebrated nations of antiquity made war their alone buſineſs, and it was proſecuted by them with a degree of barbarity which offends us. A few centuries back, men comparatively uncivilized, without commerce, arts and ſcience, and under religious impreſſions, falſely ſtiled chriſtian, worſe than none; in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government too feeble to controul their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to render them more reaſonable, or to correct and ſoften their tempers and manners—made war their great employment, and choſe it as their firſt happineſs.—The haughty Noble had no buſineſs but when engaged in feuds with neighbours, or his prince; and his vaſſals and dependents followed him from inclination, or the fear of puniſhment.—But the energy which has been acquired by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021669_0028_0FB5096294500AF0"/>
governments, the progreſs of civilization, that ſpirit of commerce, arts and ſcience, and the influence of the religion of peace, better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, have made in this reſpect an important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in the world.—War is now ſeldom entered into but upon neceſſities of State which render it unavoidable; and is proſecuted with a degree of temperance and humanity which does our age hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.—Let us moſt ſincerely bleſs God, who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the times and ſeaſons, for this favourable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the condition of the human race!—The CAUSES of it exiſt amongſt us. May we aid their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with all the zeal conſiſtent with our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and happineſs.—May we with enterprize and induſtry devote ourſelves to commerce.—Cultivate the arts which will increaſe our conveniences, adorn and enrich us.—Foſterour UNIVERSITY which is our honour, and all ſeminaries and ſchools of learning. By our converſation, examples, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, add that ſtrength to our SUPREME GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT which will enable it to preſerve its various parts in harmony and order, and render us reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the conſideration of other nations. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially may we ſubmit to the influence of that divine religion "<hi>which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated: Full of mercy and good fruits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality and without hypocriſy</hi>"—that we may aid in bringing on the happy period which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured prophet deſcribes with all the force of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021669_0029_0FB5096579AD4240"/>
ſtrong and beautiful figures—"<hi>When knowledge and virtue ſhall cover the earth as the waters cover the ſea;" "when the wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the falling together, and a little child ſhall lead them—when they ſhall not hurt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in all God's holy mountain.</hi>" By thus doing, though this happy ſtate of things may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in our day, we ſhall ſecure ourſelves through the conſtitution of grace, eſtabliſhed by our bleſſed Redeemer, as individuals, that peace which paſſeth underſtanding, which the world can neither give or take away; which will render us happy in life, enable us to triumph over death, and prepare us for a bleſſed immortality—As a ſociety we ſhall place ourſelves under the patronage and bleſſing of Almighty God, "<hi>our light will break forth as the morning, and our health will ſpring forth ſpeedily—our righteouſneſs will go before us; and the glory of the Lord will be our rere-ward.</hi>"</p>
