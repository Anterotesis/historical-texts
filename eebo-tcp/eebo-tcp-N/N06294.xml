            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">The MEMORIAL of us the Subscribers, being Part-Owners and Proprietors of the Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> bordering on the Crown-Lands in this Colony, that lie between the said Patents and the true Line of Division between this Colony and the Colony of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> in Behalf of ourselves, and the other Owners and Proprietors of the said Patents, and the Owners and Proprietors of the other Patents ranging with the said Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> between <hi>Hudson</hi>'s and <hi>Delaware</hi> Rivers.</head>
            <opener>HUMBLY RELATES,</opener>
            <p>THAT your Memorialists have been informed, that his Excellency Sir CHARLES HARDY, Knight, has lately laid before this Honourable House, an additional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from his Majesty, requiring him to apply to this Honourable House, for a Provision on the Part of this Colony, to defray One-half of the Expence that may accrue upon a Settlement of a Line of Partition, between this Colony and <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> by Commissioners to be hereafter appointed by his Majesty for that Purpose.</p>
            <p>That your Memorialists have also been informed, that in Consequence thereof, a Proposal has been made in this Honourable House, to subject your Memorialists, and the other Persons interested in the said Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> and the other Patents ranging with them in this Colony, (a Part whereof only falls within the exorbitant Claim of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of East <hi>New-Jersey,</hi>) to One-half, or some other considerable Proportion of the Sum to be provided on the Part of this Colony, for defraying such Expence as aforesaid: Which Proposal, should it take Effect, would, as your Memorialists conceive, and hope they will be able to evince to this Honourable House, be a Burden too heavy and unequal, considering the proportionably small Interests of your Memorialists, and those whom your Memorialists represent in this Matter, to be imposed on them.</p>
            <p>In order whereto, your Memorialists beg Leave to elucidate the following Points, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> That the Claim of this Colony in Behalf of the Crown, and the Right of the private Owners of the abovementioned Patents, which only in Part interfere with the <hi>New-Jersey</hi> Claim, are intirel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> distinct in their Natures; and that the former, extending a great many Miles more Southerly upon the Pretensions of <hi>New-Jersey</hi> than the latter, the Crown is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, nay, almost wholly, interested in the Determination and Event of the Controversy.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That the Persons, holding Lands under the Government of this Colony, in V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the abovementioned Patents, did obtain their Titles to the same, in a Dependance on certain public Acts of Government and Legislature; and therefore ought to be supported in their Rights by the Legislature of this Colony.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That the interest of his Majesty, and the general Interest of this Colony, are greatly concerned in the Event of the Controversy: And, therefore, that the Expences on our Part, ought to be defrayed by the Colony, and not by any particular Number of its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> That the true Interest of his Majesty, and of the Inhabitants of this Colony in general, requires, that the respective Jurisdictions of the two Colonies be ascertained; and as a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that Point (which ought doubtless to be at the public Expence) will naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Settlement, with Relation to private Property, it would be a Hardship to tax any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons, (however consequentially interested in such Determination) for paying the Charges, on the Part of this Colony, to accrue thereon.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> If the Line should finally be settled in Favour of this Colony, the private Owners of the abovementioned Patents would gain nothing thereby; and if the Settlements should turn in Favour of the <hi>New-Jersey</hi> Claim, would necessarily be considerable Losers. For which Reason also, your Memorialists humbly conceive, they ought not to be taxed towards such Settlement.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007978_0003_102E0C727B95B538"/>6<hi>thly.</hi> That the Patentees of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> by Reason of the Encroachments of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> have already been put to very great Expence; and are, by that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to bear so great a Charge, as the subjecting them to One-half, or any other considerable Part of the Provision to be made on the Part of this Colony, towards defraying the Charges that may accrue on the final Settlement of the said Partition Line, would necessarily create.</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> That by Reason of the complicated Situation of the Rights in the Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> (which are the Patents chiefly concerned in the Controversy) it would be impossible for this Honourable House, equitably to adjust the respective Quota of the Person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> interested in them, for defraying such Expence as aforesaid.</p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> That it would be impracticable to raise a Sum sufficient for the Purpose, by Sale of unappropriated Lands in <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda:</hi> There being no considerable Quantity in either of the said Patents, that remains unlocated at this Day, and clear of Controversy.</p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>thly.</hi> That the said two Patents are largely encroach'd on by the Owners of other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Patents within this Colony: And as the former have originally purchased of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Indians to their utmost Bounds, and at great Expence; they must either lose all the Lands so encroach'd on, or recover them at Law: In which Method they must unavoidably expend very large Sums of Money; and therefore, are unable to contribute to the final Settlement of the Line.</p>
            <p>And, in Support of the first Point, your Memorialists beg Leave to relate to this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able House,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> That his late Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. by his Letters Patent, bearing Date the 12th of <hi>March,</hi> 1663-4, did (among other Tracts of Land mentioned in the said Letters Patent;<note place="margin">

            <p>Having ranged in some sort of Order, a few striking Facts, to shew the real Intent of the Crown, in the very Instant of granting the said Letters Patent; your Memorialists beg Leave to evince that Intent from the Words of the Grant itself; and upon such a Construction of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007978_0004_102E0C75F9424788"/>
those Words, as will be warranted, not only by Reason, but also, as your Memorialists are informed, by the clearest Rules of law: And in order thereto, your Memorialists beg Leave again to observe, that Part of the Boundaries of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Patent, as far as relates to the Colonies of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jersey</hi>; or in other Words, to the Possessions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> at, and before the Date of that Patent, is conceived in these Words, <hi>viz. Together with the said River called</hi> Hudson's <hi>River, and all the Lands from the West-Side of</hi> Connecticut <hi>River, to the East Side of</hi> Delaware <hi>Bay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which your Memorialists beg Leave to observe, That Reason will dictate one or other of the two following Constructions on those Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> As <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, undoubtedly, has a more Southern Commencement at the Ocean, and a less Northern Extent into the Continent than <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, the Words <hi>from the West Side of</hi> Connecticut <hi>River, to the East Side of</hi> Delaware <hi>Bay,</hi> will, in their rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the Lands contained between <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, the Ocean, <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and a Line drawn from the Head of the latter, to the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, <hi>together with</hi> the whole Extent of <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River beyond that Line: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> They will pass (what is still more liberal to the Grantee) the Lands contained within the following Boundaries, viz. <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, the Ocean, the whole West Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, a Line from the Head of that River, to the Head of <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River, a Line thence along the West-Side of <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till it intersect the aforesaid Line from the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, to the Head of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, and from thence such Part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Line, as would extend from the Point of such Intersection, to the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay; which last Construction will depend upon <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River being mentioned in the Description. Your Memorialists say, that they humbly conceive, one or other of those Construction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reason will naturally dictate; but that it would be highly irrational to give the Boundaries any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent along <hi>Delaware</hi> River, because Reason, and the proper Use of Terms, will never permit the Word <hi>Bay</hi> to be construed <hi>River,</hi> (which are Things as different in their Geographical Meaning, as <hi>Bay</hi> and <hi>Ocean</hi>;) and that the more especially, when there is no Necessity of such a Construction to give Sense to the Grant; a great Quantity of Land being evidently included within those Boundaries, upon either of the above Constructions.</p>
            <p>Having thus considered what Reason would dictate in Construction of the abovementioned Boundaries, your Memorialists beg Leave to observe what Aspect the Law will have on them: In order the more clearly to do which, permit your Memorialists to mention what your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialists are inform'd, are some of the known Rules of Law for the Construction of Crown-Grants, and which are as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> The King's Grant shall not enure to any other Intent, than <hi>is express'd in the Grant</hi>; that is, it shall not enure to any <hi>implied Intent,</hi> tho' it may to several Intents, if they be all expressed.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The Words of a Grant (even in the Case of a Subject, and the rather in that of the Crown) shall be construed according to a reasonable and easy Sense; and not strained to Things unlikely and unusual.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Where the Words are so doubtful, as to admit of several Intents, that Intent shall govern which is most in Favour of the Crown.</p>
            <p>To apply these Rules to the Words <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> in the present Case, it seems clear, that the <hi>express</hi> Inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Word <hi>Bay,</hi> is <hi>Bay</hi>; and therefore, even were it possible to put the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> Intent, or Meaning of <hi>River</hi> upon the Word <hi>Bay,</hi> yet the Words <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> must mean <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> and not <hi>Delaware Bay and River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also by the second Rule, if the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> Sense of the Word <hi>Bay</hi> is <hi>Bay,</hi> then <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware Bay</hi> can never mean <hi>Delaware Bay and River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like Manner, if it should even be thought <hi>doubtful</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hether <hi>Delaware Bay</hi> in the Patent, means only <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> or both the <hi>Bay</hi> and <hi>River</hi>; yet by the third Rule, the former Construction will doubtless govern, because it is most advantageous for the Crown.</p>
            <p>And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Memorialists humbly conceive, that the most liberal Construction in Favour of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> will give no other Sense to the Words <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> than what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and naturally meant by the Terms. As to the other Boundaries, and their Relation to <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> your Memorialists do conceive, that in Favour of the Crown, the Law, by the 1st Rule abovementioned, will absolutely reject such a Construction as will pass all the Land between <hi>Connecticut</hi> River and <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River; because a Line from the Head of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Head of <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> would exclude a great Part of those Lands; and because also the Words are, <hi>all the Lands</hi> FROM <hi>the West Side of</hi> Connecticut <hi>River,</hi> TO <hi>the East Side of</hi> Delaware Bay; that is, all the Lands that lie in a Course or Direction between both, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently those Lands that are excluded by a Line, from the Head of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River to the Head of <hi>Delaware Bay</hi>; or in other Words, that do not lie, in a Direction between the said River and Bay, are without the Duke's Patent. But even were this Matter doubtful, the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007978_0005_102E0C7851AF34D8"/>
latter Construction must, by the 3d Rule abovementioned, clearly govern, because it will pass a less Quantity of Land than the other, and therefore be most in Favour of the Crown. However, as either of those Constructions will include the Latitude of 41° on <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River, it is not of much Moment to the Subject of this Memorial, if either of them be admitted.</p>
            <p>Your Memorialists do therefore humbly conceive, that altho' the said Duke of <hi>York,</hi> after obtaining the said Letters Patent, did, by Lease and Release, dated the 23d and 24th of <hi>June,</hi> 1664, grant unto JOHN Lord BERKLEY, and Sir GEORGE CARTARE<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet, as the Duke of <hi>York</hi> himself, was bounded at the Head of <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> his Grantees cannot, as your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialists conceive, take by the said Lease, and Release, any higher on <hi>Delaware</hi> than the Head o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> (unless the River has such a Course from thence, as to coincide with, or be included within a streight Line, from the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, to the Lat. of 41° on <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s River: For, <hi>Nemo plus juris in alium transferre potest, quam ipse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From what your Memorialists have already related to this Honourable House, it is hop'd, that not only the Facts abovementioned, upon which the Grant to the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently founded, but also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the plain Dictates of Reason, and the known Rules of Law, (upon Construction of the very Words of the Grant) do conspire to limit its Extent on <hi>Delaware,</hi> to the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay; and consequently, the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> to a Line from the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, to the Latitude of 41°, on <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River. But as a further Proof of such Const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ction, your Memorialists beg Leave to observe, That, considering the Antiquity of that Grant to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> it ought reasonably to be supposed, that its true Intent and Meaning, as far as concerns its Boundaries, were better understood at, or shortly after the Time of its Date, than at this Day; and accordingly, the Government of this Colony, so soon after the Date of the said Letters Patent, as in the Year 1683, did construe their Extension up <hi>Delaware,</hi> as for <hi>only,</hi> as the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> BAY. The Evidence of this Matter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ancient Minutes of the Council of this Colony, and bears Date the 16th <hi>February</hi> 1683, whereby it appears, that at a Council then held at Fort JAMES, at which were present, not only the Governor, Mr. <hi>Flypse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>The Patent of his Majesty King CHARLES II. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the said Letters Patent) to his Royal Highness JAMES Duke of <hi>York, &amp;c.</hi> was read; and also his Royal Highness his Letters Patent to the Proprietors of East NEW-JERSEY, (meaning the said Lease and Release to BERKLEY and CARTARET,) were read, and Mr. GRAHAM said, that the Clause, [whole in the Premises] was to be understood <hi>whole in the Tract of Land</hi>;</q>
and the other Clause, [as far as in him lieth]
<q>made a Doubt whether the Duke had Authority so far:</q>
Which Construction of Mr. Recorder, together with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi>

plainly intimate, 1<hi>st.</hi> That they had the Boundaries between the two Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then under Consideration. 2<hi>d.</hi> That they took the most rational Means to arrive at the Truth; to wit, by considering the Grants under which the Proprietors of East <hi>New-Jersey</hi> did Claim, and giving them their proper Construction. 3<hi>d.</hi> That upon a Perusal of those Grants, it appeared that the Claim of the then Proprietors, could not be supported by those Grants; or in other Words, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>k,</hi> and those to whom he had granted: For that the Law even in such a Case, will not, by the second Rule abovementioned, allow a Construction to be put upon any Words in a Grant, even in a Case between Subject and Subject, contrary to <hi>their reasonable and easy Sense.</hi> And altho' wherever the Meaning of a Term in a Grant from one Subject to another, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; yet if what is absolutely certain in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Patent, respecting <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> was indeed doubtful, as in that Case the Doubt would be concerning a Crown Grant, under which both Parties claim, no Construction could be given in Favour of one or the other Party, but such as would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Interest of the Crown.</p>
            <p>And thus your Memorialists Construction of the Words <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Patent, appears to be founded upon a firm Connection of preceding Facts, the united Voices of Reason and Law upon the Words of the Patent, and the Suffrages of Men of high

Character in Life, who all lived at the Time of the Grant, and put the same Construction upon it as your Memorialists do; and who, considering the Time of such their Construction, may be supposed, to have better understood what was really intended to pass by the Grant, than any Set of Men in the present Day.

            </p>
            <p>But if, notwithstanding the above related, so evident a Right in the Crown to confine the Boundaries of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> on <hi>Delaware, to the Head of</hi> Delaware BAY, it should still be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the Duke had a Right to extend his Grant to the Proprietors of <hi>New-Jersey up</hi> Delaware RIVER; thus much however is undoubtedly certain, that they cannot go beyond the Words of their Grant; which, as your Memorialists <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For Example, it cannot mean <hi>which Bay,</hi> or <hi>which Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> because neither the one nor the other lies in that Latitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> besides, in such Case, the Words <hi>as far as the Northermost Branch,</hi> would be senseless, for the Branch is beyond the Bay and River: and therefore in that Sense, would be beyond the Latitude.

And thus your Memorialists conceive it is evident, that the Latitude cannot be <hi>limitive,</hi> even by straining the Words to their utmost Extent; which Method, if indeed it could work the Effect, would be contrary to the second abovementioned Rule in Law, which directs, <hi>That Words in a Grant shall be construed according to a reasonable and easy Sense, and not strained to Things unlikely and unusual.</hi> From all which, your Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists conclude, that the Words <hi>which is in the Lat. of</hi> 41°, 40′, are <hi>descriptive,</hi> and not <hi>limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore the Latitude is not <hi>limitive,</hi> but only <hi>descriptive,</hi> and as the <hi>East</hi> Branch is for the present, supposed to be the <hi>Northermost</hi> Branch, your Memorialists conceive, for Clearness and Perspicuity Sake, the Latitude may for a While be rejected, and then the Words will be, <hi>And to the Northward as far as the Northermost Branch of the said Bay or River.</hi> Upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The proper Answer to this Question, your Memorialists conceive to be clearly this, That the FORKS of <hi>Delaware,</hi> or MOUTH of the <hi>East</hi> Branch, is in such Case the <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> or <hi>utmost</hi> Extent of the Boundaries of <hi>New-Jersey, on Delaware</hi>; and that for the following Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> The Words, <hi>as far as, are comparative Terms,</hi> used generally either in describing simple comparative Distances; as for Example, How far is it from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Paris?

               </gap> 
               <hi>as far as,</hi> in the Grant to BERKLEY and CARTARET, are used. And therefore, they necessarily suppose two Stations, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Locus a quo,</hi> or the Place where the Progression be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the <hi>Locus ad quem,</hi> or Place where the Progression ends.</p>
            <p>But the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> not only suppose two Stations, they also require both a Subject and an Object of Comparison; which Object is either at a Distance from the <hi>Locus a quo,</hi> or begins the Progression at that Place, in Conjunction with the Subject of Comparison: If the former is the Case, then the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> mean, <hi>as far as to,</hi> and suppose the Progression to end <hi>at</hi> the Object of Comparison; if the latter, then the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> intend, <hi>as far as the Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icktonk,</hi> because the Words are express, and could not be satisfied by any other Construction: Or (rather to use an Example taken from the Boundaries themselves) the Southern Extent of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> is there declared to be <hi>to the Ocean as far as</hi> Cape-May, at the Mouth of <hi>Delaware-Bay</hi>; in which Case, the Words <hi>to the Ocean,</hi> and the Words <hi>at the Mouth of</hi> Delaware-Bay, would explain in what Sense the Words <hi>as far as</hi> Cape-May ought to be understood, did not the Word <hi>Cape</hi> alone explain the Matter, which means the very extreme Point of a Promontory, or Body of high Land, stretching itself into the Sea; and therefore, that Point having no Extent, the Progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion can only be <hi>to</hi> it, and not <hi>along with it.</hi> Therefore, instead of the <hi>Cape,</hi> supposing (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make the Example more applicable) the Word <hi>Promontory</hi> had been inserted, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the Words would have been, <hi>to the Ocean, as far as the Promontory at the Mouth of</hi> Delaware-Bay. In this Case, the Terms of the Boundary could not be complied with, but by an Extension to the extreme Point of the Promontory; any Thing short of that not being sufficient to satisfy the Words, <hi>to the Ocean at the Mouth of</hi> Delaware-Bay. But were those latter Words omitted, as in that Case it would be, <hi>and to the Southward as far as the Promontory</hi>; the Southern Extent must necessarily be limited to the Place where the Promontory unites with the Main-Body of the Continent; and so with Respect to the Northern Extension, it must be limitted to the <hi>Beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your Memorialists observe, that in such Case, unless that were express'd, which there is no Evidence to prove, is implied in the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> viz. <hi>from the utmost Extent of the Northerly Branch</hi>; the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> in such Reversion of the Courses, being turned into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ain, that in such Reversion, the Words <hi>as far as</hi> the Northermost Branch, could not be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into any other Phrase or Mode of Expression, than <hi>from the Northermost Branch,</hi> without adding something, which is far from being implied in the Terms <hi>as far as,</hi> viz. <hi>the utmost Extent of such Branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, your Memorialists conceive it appears clearly, that the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> &amp;c. in their plain, natural, easy, common and grammatical Sense, do mean, <hi>as far as</hi> TO <hi>the Northermost Branch,</hi> that is, <hi>to the Mouth or Beginning of that Branch,</hi> and therefore cannot be construed to intend the utmost Extent of that <hi>Branch</hi>: Such Construction being undeniably <hi>strained,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the 2d Rule of Law abovementioned. Nor indeed could such Construction as would carry the Boundary to the utmost Extent of the Branch, take Place, even were the Meaning of the Words doubtful; because, tho they are Part of a Grant from Subject to Subject, yet, as the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Right, by his Letters Patent, is now vested in the Crown, your Memorialists conceive, that the same Rule should now take Place in the Construction of his Grant to BERKLEY and CARTARET, (the Dispute being at present between them and the Crown) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if they had held immediately under the Crown; and therefore, that the Words, <hi>as far as,</hi> even were the Meaning doubtful, ought to be construed, <hi>as far as to the Mouth,</hi> or Beginning of the Northermost Branch; seeing that such Construction would be most in Favour of the Crown, which is now vested of this Colony.</p>
            <p>Whence your Memorialists conceive, that the Reasons in Favour of such Construction may be reduced to the following syllogistic Form, in order to shew their Force in a more pointed Light, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Boundaries of the Grant to BERKELEY and CARTARET, on <hi>Delaware,</hi> are to extend <hi>to the Northward, as far as</hi> the Northermost Branch of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay or River, which is in Lat. 41°, 40′.</p>
            <p>But the East Branch is the Northermost Branch; therefore those Boundaries are to extend <hi>as far as</hi> the said East Branch, which is in Lat. 41°, 40′.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p>As those Boundaries are to extend <hi>as far as</hi> the East Branch, which is in Lat. 41°, 40′, they are to extend either to the <hi>Mouth</hi> of that Branch, or to the Lat. of 41°, 40, on that Branch, or to its <hi>utmost</hi> Extent.</p>
            <p>But for the Reasons abovementioned, the Latitude is not <hi>limitive,</hi> or expressive of the <hi>Locus ad quem,</hi> but only designates the Branch; and the Words <hi>as far as,</hi> do not, for Reasons above alledged, intend <hi>as far as the Branch extends,</hi> but only mean, <hi>as far as to</hi> the Branch.</p>

            <p>Wherefore, upon the Whole of the above Matters, your Memorialists beg Leave to draw the following Inferences, in Support of the first Point above advanced, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> That the true Boundary between <hi>this Colony</hi> and <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> must be a Line either from the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That the true Boundary of the said Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> and the other Patents ranging with them, between <hi>Hudson</hi>'s and <hi>Delaware</hi> Rivers, must be a Line from the <hi>lower End</hi> of the said <hi>Minisink</hi> Island, to the Latitude of 41°, on <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That therefore the Claim of this Colony, in Behalf of the Crown, and the Right of the Owners of the said Patents are entirely distinct, and that a vast Tract of Crown Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Colony, lies between the <hi>Southern</hi> Boundaries of the said Patents, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Boundaries of <hi>New-Jersey.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> That therefore the Controversy concerning those Boundaries, is, properly, between the Crown, and the Proprietors of <hi>New-Jersey</hi>; and that for this Reason, the Expences which may accrue on the Part of <hi>this Colony,</hi> in settling the said Boundaries, ought, <hi>wholly,</hi> to be borne <hi>by the Publick,</hi> and no Part thereof by the Owners of the said Patents, notwithstanding, that the <hi>idle</hi> Construction which the Proprietors of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> give their Boundaries, partly affects the said Patents: It being clear, that upon any reasonable Construction of those Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, they cannot be extended as far Northward as to the said Patents.

            <p>In Proof of the 4th Point, your Memorialists beg Leave, briefly, to mention the public Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that have arisen in process of Time, from the unsettled State of the Jurisdiction of the two Colonies, to the Disadvantage of his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Interest in Breach of his Peace, and to the manifest Injury of <hi>this Colony</hi> in general.

Which, as your Memorialists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, are chargeable to the Account of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> as arising from their Infringement of the Settlement of 1686, and their Encroachments on the ancient Jurisdiction of this Colony, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colour of one <hi>erroneous</hi> Station, fix'd at <hi>Cashickt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck</hi> aforesaid not warranted by the said Acts of Assembly, and rejected by the Government of this Colony. And this is the fifth Abuse.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> That, in order the better to countenance the unjustifiable Claims of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> and in manifest Opposition to the very Spirit and Design of the above related Report of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of this Colony, the said tripartite Indenture, so long after its Date as in the Year 1744, appears on the public Records of this Colony; the Hand-writing of which Entry, were it necessary, could be very easily proved; as well as the Interests, Connections, and Relations in Life of the Person who wrote it. Thus much however is certain, that it was neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the proper Officer, nor warranted by any Act of Government; and is, therefore, a Record, which must necessarily be disown'd by the Government of this Colony, as being an evident Piece of Forgery. Your Memorialists, indeed, conceive it dishonourable, to the highest Degree, even to cite such a Record as Evidence; and yet, the Proprietors of <hi>East New-Jersey,</hi> have not been ashamed to do it in their Memorial to Governor BELCHER. And this concludes the sixth Abuse.</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> That, not even content with this, the Proprietors of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> in 1747-8, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Act of that Colony, for giving a Sanction to the aforementioned Abuses, by running a Line <hi>Exparte,</hi> if this Colony should not think proper to acquiesce in their unreasonable Proposals: And therefore, upon their not meeting with the Concurrence of the Legislature of this Colony, they sent home the Act for his Majesty's Royal Assent. And such was the seventh Abuse. The Fate of the said Act, however, at the Board of Trade, is well known to this <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>urable</hi> House; and is now fully determined by his Majesty's said Instruction: Whereby, it is plain, that the Crown intends to settle the Boundaries between the two Colonies, by Commission.</p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly.</hi> That, in Consequence of the said erroneous Station at <hi>Cashicktonk,</hi> and in Contempt of the ancient Jurisdiction of this Colony, the Government of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> taking Advantage of the Necessity to which both Colonies are reduced of fortifying their Frontiers along <hi>Delaware,</hi> against the Irruptions of the savage and perfidious Indians; have, as your Memorialists are informed, made an Offer of extending their Chain of Block-Houses, as far as <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>shicktonk</hi>; and generously leaving a smaller Extent of Country to be fortified by this Colony. A plausible Pretext this, to oust the Government of this Colony of its ancient Jurisdiction; and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably designed, as a colourable Reason, for a Determination of the Controversy in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; upon a Supposition, that those who will resolutely defend the Lands in Controversy, in a Time of general Danger, are best intituled to reap the happy Fruits of their own Valour! But your Memorialists have the utmost Reason to rest assured, that a Disguise so thin, will be easily penetrated, by the Wisdom of this Honourable House. And this evinces the eighth Abuse. The further to demonstrate which, your Memorialists beg Leave to mention a single
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007978_0016_102E0C8D1E339528"/>
Fact, of which they are informed, by one of the Members of this Honourable House, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Richard Gardner,</hi> the principal Agent for the Proprietors of <hi>East New-Jersey,</hi> in their Encroachments on this Colony, and who lives in the very Heart of the Controversy, on a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation formerly held under, and lately wrested from this Colony, not more than 7 or 8 Miles from <hi>Goshen,</hi> and about 20 Miles from the Frontiers of the two Colonies on <hi>Delaware</hi>; having, some Time ago, met with a Party of <hi>Jersey</hi> Men, who were sent to garrison the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> did, in Virtue of an Order of Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> direct the said Party to return to his House, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e employed them in fortifying, by incircling it with Stockadoes, at the public Expence of that Colony. Which Fortification, by Reason of its distant Situation from the Frontiers, and its being in the Heart of the Controversy, is, probably, designed principally, to support the Encroachments of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> on this Province; especially, if it be considered, that the Command of it is given to the chief Agent of the Proprietors of <hi>East New-Jersey</hi>; to whom they are greatly indebted for their late unjustifiable Acquisitions.</p>
            <p>From all these Matters adduced in Support of the fourth Point, your Memorialists conceive, that, for the Want of a Settlement of the Jurisdiction of the two Colonies, agreable to the Stations of 1686, His <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Interest, the Honour of his Government of this Colony, the Jurisdiction and public Peace and Tranquility thereof, and the Rights of its Inhabitants, have been, in many Instances, unlawfully invaded and trampled upon, even by the Government of <hi>New-Jersey</hi>; and that upon the most idle Pretences.</p>
            <p>These are Evils of a public Nature; to repel which, demands the unite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fforts of the whole Colony: Wherefore, as it is necessary for the public Weal, that the Jurisdiction of this Colony should be properly ascertained; so also, as it is a Matter of general Concern, your Memorial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists do humbly conceive, it ought to be at the general Expence. That altho' some particular Persons, unfortunately feel the evil Effects of the Encroachments of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> on the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of this Colony, more immediately than any other Members of the Community; yet, as the Matter concerns the Honour of this Government, all those who enjoy the happy Consequences of its Care and Protection, ought to contribute to its Support, by asserting and maintaining its rightful Jurisdiction. And therefore, that altho' by determining the Line of Jurisdiction, the Question of Property, will, consequentially, be determined; yet the public, and not the private Owners of the controverted Lands, ought equitably to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Burthen.</p>
            <p>In Support of the fifth Point, your Memorialists beg Leave to observe, that if upon a final Determination of the Boundary between the two Colonies, <hi>New-Jersey</hi> should be confined by a Line from the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay, or from the Forks of <hi>Delaware</hi> to the Lat. of 41°, on <hi>Hudson</hi>'s River; yet those Patents in this Colony, that range along a Line from the lower End of <hi>Great Minisink</hi> Island to that Latitude, (which was formerly supposed to be the Boundary) will have no greater Extent of Land, than what they purchased of the native <hi>Indian</hi> Proprietors, and for which they obtained those Patents: And how much soever the Crown, or the Public, may be Gainers by the vacant Lands, in such Case, the Owners of those Patents being confin'd by the last mentioned Line, will have no more than is really their own: Besides, as the Government of this Colony conceived, and by the said Patents, did, in Effect, declare, the Lands granted by them, to be within this Colony; if that should actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appear to be Truth, upon a final Settlement, your Memorialists conceive, the Owners of the said Patents, are clearly intituled to hold them, without any further Charge, than what accrued on the obtaining of those Patents. And, on the contrary, should the Station on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware,</hi> be extended to <hi>Cashicktonk,</hi> they must necessarily be great Losers. In which Case, as they settled the said Lands under the Government of this Colony, it will be a sufficient Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for them to be deprived of Part of those Lands, without being obliged to pay One-half, or any other great Proportion of the Expence of a final Settlement, out of their own Pockets. So that, seeing they cannot be benefited, but may possibly be prejudiced, by a final Settlement, and seeing that the Controversy is public in its Nature, the whole Burthen of it ought, as your Memorialists conceive, to be born by the Colony in general, and no Part of it by the Owners of those Patents in particular.</p>
            <p>To what Difficulties the Owners of the Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda</hi> have already been reduced, by the lawless Encroachments of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> is well known, and fully insisted on, in the abovementioned Report of the Committee of this Honourable House. To support their Possessions against Encroachments, back'd by the Authority of the Government of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> was a Task too severe for any Persons in their private Capacity to undertake; and yet, heavy as it was, they have been obliged, for many Years, to submit to it, as the only Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient left, to prevent the Proprietors of <hi>East New-Jersey,</hi> from seizing whatever they thought proper to claim. In Consequence of which, many of them have been taken by Violence, thrust into <hi>New-Jersey</hi> Goals, and loaded with excessive Costs, arising both from those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, and their own Defence against them. While<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others have been obliged to abandon the Improvement of their Lands, to the utter Ruin of themselves and their Families; and that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007978_0017_102E0C8F825941E0"/>
barely for defending what they held under the Government of this Colony. Means therefore being necessary to defray the Expences arising from those Encroachments, and the only Means whereby those Expences can be defrayed, consisting in the Sale of some of the unlocated Lands within those Patents, to raise a Sum of Money sufficient to answer the Purpose; your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists have for this Reason, procured a Bill to be brought in to this Honourable House, to warrant such Sale. As, therefore, it was absolutely necessary, to oppose the unjustifiable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of <hi>New-Jersey</hi>; as such Opposition could not be made without very great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and as the Owners of those Patents have never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ued for any Assistance from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic on this Head; but on the Contrary, have, by applying for an Act to warrant such Sale as aforesaid, chearfully submitted the uncontroverted Parts of their Lands, to the Expence of defending themselves, in the lawful Possession of such Part as is claimed by <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> and that against Foreign Encroachments, which concern the whole Community; your Memoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists humbly conceive, it would be adding too much to the Weight of their Misfortunes, to subject them to the Expences to accrue on the Part of this Colony, in the final Settlement of the Controversy, (which principally concerns the Crown, and this Community) beyond the Amount of their Proportion, of a general Tax, or Contribution for that Purpose. Thus much in Maintenance of the sixth Point.</p>
            <p>Nor do your Memorialists conceive it possible, to lay the Owners of the Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> (which are principally affected by the Controversy) under an equitable and proportionate Contribution, for defraying any Part of the Expence of a final Settlement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Property of those Patents, in Virtue of which they would be compelled to such Contribution, does, in many Instances, consist in undivided Rights: Some of which, as also great Part of the located Lands, do belong to Feme Coverts, Infants, and Persons beyond Sea; and the whole State of Property, in general, is so complicated, that till each Person's Right is adjusted, and clearly settled, it would be impossible, in a Method of this Kind, to do equal Justice to all Parties. Besides, many Rights may be, and, doubtless, are controverted: Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which Reason, also, it would be impracticable to determine, where the Burthen ought, in such Cases, to be laid. And this Supports the seventh Point.</p>
            <p>To shew the Reasonableness of the eighth Point; even should it, in the Wisdom of this Honourable House, be thought proper, to raise a Sum by Sale of unlocated Lands, your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialists doubt not, but that it will be found, upon a strict Enquiry, that if the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Bill be passed into a Law of this Colony, it will be difficult to find a sufficient Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of unlocated Lands, in the Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> to answer the Ends of that Act. For tho' there are some Rights, to which no adequate Locations have been made, yet many Persons having taken up much greater Quantities of Land than their Rights could possibly entitle them to, have left those unlocated Rights, to be located on the Lands in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy: And therefore, there is very little Land, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> your Memorialists conceive, left unlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and clear of Dispute, in the said Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda</hi>: Which Patents are principally involved in the Controversy. And therefore, as it is absolutely reasonable, that the Expences which have accrued to some particular Persons, in opposing the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> should, by a Sale of Lands, be proportionably imposed on all Parties interested; there will, as your Memorialists conceive, be no Room for a Provision by a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sale of Lands, in those two Patents, to defray any Part of the Charges of a final Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But your Memorialists humbly conceive, that an Elucidation of the last Point, will further shew the Hardship, of submitting the Owners of those Patents, to any Part of such Expence as aforesaid. The Patents of <hi>Minisink</hi> and <hi>Wawayanda,</hi> (which are the Patents most consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably affected by the extravagant Claims of <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> are beset with Encroachments, arising from the Patents that surround them, within this Colony. By which Means, the Owners of those Patents are kept out of the Possession of many Thousand Acres of Land, which they think do justly belong to them. In order, therefore, to procure Justice to themselves, in this Instance, they will be obliged to resort to the Courts of Law within this Colony. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, considering the Number of Possession<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> gained against them, will necessarily create a Multiplicity of Suits; the Prosecution of which, will subject them to vast Charge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. And in this Case, your Memorialists conceive, they cannot expect the least Assistance from the Public; because those Controversies are of a private Nature, and one Party would have an equal Right with the other, to claim such Assistance. And therefore, the Owners of those two Patents, must either cede what they conceive to be their Right, or defend it at a great Expence; which disables them to support any Part of the public Controversy with <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> beyond their Quotas of a public Tax.</p>
            <p>If after all those Reasons, the Authority of a Precedent may be admitted to be urged, your Memorialists beg Leave, humbly, to remind this Honourable House, that the Charge that has already accrued on the Part of this Colony, for settling the Controversy between this Colony
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007978_0018_102E0C92DDAF9048"/>
and the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay,</hi> has by the Legislature of this Colony, been laid on the Publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Wherefore, as your Memorialists conceive, they cannot expect nothing less, from the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Candour, and Impartiality of this Honourable House, than an equal Distribution of its Favours, to all its Constituents; they are induced to hope, that in this Controversy, as well as in the other, the Provision to be made on the Part of this Colony, will be raised at the public Charge: To which your Memorialists, and those whom they represent in the Premises, will, as Members of this Community, chearfully contribute their respective Proportions.</p>
            <p>However, as your Memorialists dare not presume to determine, what Weight the Reasons above alledged, against submitting the Owners of the said Patents to any considerable Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Expence of a final Settlement of the Controversy, may, in the Wisdom of this Honourable House, be thought to merit: Therefore, lest they should be deemed insufficient to answer the Purpose for which they are adduced, (the Contrary of which, however, your Memorialists earnestly hope for) your Memorialists humbly intreat, that, even if they, and those whom they represent in the Premises, should be obliged to bear any great Part of that Expence, it may be imposed on them in such Manner, as will be the most easy and tolerable: And in such Case, do humbly propose, that as, for the Reasons above urged, an immediate Subsidy cannot be levied, (either by subjecting the Parties interested to a proportionate Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, or by Sale of Lands) sufficient for the Purpose, that a Sum may be raised, out of some or other of the public Funds, to be replaced by a future Tax, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the whole Lands included between the Claims of the two Colonies; or, on so much thereof, as shall, upon a final Settlement, be included within this Colony: Or, that a Sum, proportionate to what may be thought to be the Interest of the Owners of the Patents of <hi>Wawayanda</hi> and <hi>Minisink,</hi> out of the Sum intended to be raised by each of the said Patents, by the abovementioned Bill, now before this Honourable House, may, by a Clause in the said Bill, be applied towards the Charges of a final Settlement.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding what has been urged by your Memorialists, to shew, that the Crown and the Public are more concerned in the Event of the Controversy, than the Owners of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Patents within this Colony; yet, the latter are so much affected thereby, as to induce your Memorialists, humbly to lay before this Honourable House, their Sentiments concerning the Manner of settling the Boundaries between the two Colonies; which your Memorialists humbly conceive, may be done most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to Law and Equity, by his Majesty's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some Persons of eminent Character and Capacities in <hi>England,</hi> to determine the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there. This Method will not only admit of a Nomination of Persons in the highest Rank of Importance, (which the Nature of the Contrversy seems to require) but will, in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, be attended with no Inconveniences; seeing that a Settlement of the Controversy, must be founded on a proper Construction, of the Patent to the <hi>Duke of York,</hi> and his Grant to Lord BERKLEY, and Sir GEORGE CARTARET; which may as well be made in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>America.</hi> After which, it will require no great Skill; neither will there be much Danger of Error or Partiality, in running a simple direct Line between two Stations, agreeable to such Determination. Besides which, should Commissioners be appointed in <hi>England,</hi> and sent over to settle the Controversy, it may reasonably be supposed, that they will not be Persons of so distinguished an Eminence, as some who might be appointed to settle the Matter there: And moreover, the Expences of such a Commission, would be prodigiously aggravated, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Charges, attending the Removal of Men of considerable Character, from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> and their Stay in this Part of the World, until the compleat Execution of their Commission. Neither would there be the highest Security, of a Decision perfectly agreeable to the true Merits of the Controversy, from such an Appointment. And should Commissioners be nominated in the Colonies, your Memorialists humbly apprehend, there might be Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a partial Judgment, as well on account of the Disputes between this Colony, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Colonies on the Continent, concerning their Boundaries, as the Acquaintance and Connections between Persons in the other Colonies, and the Parties to the Controversy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, upon the Whole, your Memorialists humbly supplicate this Honourable House, that the Methods to be taken, for providing for the Expence of a final Settlement, may be made as easy to Your Memorialists, and those whom they represent in the Premises, as the Nature of the Case can possibly admit of; and that this Honourable House, would be pleased to use its Interest, in procuring such Settlement, in a Manner most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Justice, and the Rights of all the Parties interested in the Event of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy: And also, that, as your Memorialists, and those whom they represent in the Premises, labour under great Disadvantages, by Reason of the Power of the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>East New-Jersey,</hi> and their Enjoyment of most of the Posts, of the highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> and in particular, by the great Authority of JAMES ALEXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, <abbr>Esq</abbr> a principal Proprietor in <hi>East New-Jersey,</hi> and of his Majesty's Council in
