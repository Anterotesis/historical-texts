            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE patriotiſm which Citizen Genet has ſhewn in the different employments entruſted to him, and his known attachment for the cauſe of liberty and equality, have determined the Executive Council to no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This proof of confidence is the more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering for Citizen Genet, as the French nation ſet a high value upon the ties which unite them to the American people, ties which the National Aſſembly has, on the ad June, 1791, ſhewn the deſire to draw ſtill cloſer; and the legiſlature has, moreover, expreſsly ordered the Executive Power to negociate with the United States a new treaty of commerce, which may increaſe, between the two nations, thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections mutually advantageous both to the one and to the other of them. Struck with the grandeur and importance of this negociation, the Executive Council preſcribes to Citizen Genet to exert himſelf to ſtrengthen the Americans in the principles which led them to unite themſelves to France; to make them perceive, that they have no ally

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>more natural or more diſpoſed to treat them as brethren; that theſe ſentiments are engraven on the hearts of all Frenchmen enlightened upon the true intereſts of their own country; and, if the two nations have not yet reaped the advantage, it has been the fault of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have juſt overthrown; it is through the reaſon of the cabinet of Verſailles. This truth is this day revealed. The Executive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has called for the inſtructions given to Citizen Genet's predeceſſors in America, and has ſeen in them, with indignation, that at the very time the good people of America expreſſed their gratitude to us in the moſt feeling manner, and gave us every proof of their friendſhip, Vergeenns and Montmorin thought, that it was right for France to hinder the United States from taking that political ſtability of which they were capable, becauſe they would ſoon acquire a ſtrength, which, it was probable, they would be eager to abuſe. They, in conſequence, directed both the one and the other of theſe Miniſters of Louis XVI. to the Congreſs, to preſerve the moſt paſſive conduct, and to ſpeak only of the Prince's perſonal wiſhes for the proſperity of the United States. The ſame Machiavelian principle influenced the operations of the war for independence; the ſame duplicity reigned over the negociations for peace. The deputies from Congreſs expreſſed the deſire, that the cabinet of Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ailles would aſſiſt in the conqueſt of the two Floridas, of Canada, and of Nova Scotia; but Louis and his miniſters conſtantly refuſed, looking upon the poſſeſſion of theſe countries by Spain and England, as a uſeful principle of uneaſineſs and vigilance for the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans after the peace. This uſeleſs jealouſy turned into contempt; the people for whom they pretended to have taken up arms, became an object of diſdain; for the court neglected to correſpond with them, and by that criminal conduct they gave the power, whoſe influence in America we ought to have extingniſhed, arms to combat and deſtroy our own.</p>
               <p>It is thus the miniſters, under the old ſyſtem, blindly laboured with all their exertions to ſtifle liberty, after having been compelled by the general voice of the nation to aſſiſt its birth in the new world; 'tis thus they cooled the zeal; 'tis thus they looſened the bands of the two people; 'tis thus that by their infamous policy they diſguſted the Americans with the French alliance, and ſtrengthened, themſelves, that of the Engliſh. The republicans who have diſplaced theſe vile ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of deſpotiſm, are eager to mark out for Citizen Genet, a path diametrically oppoſite to the crooked windings by which his predeceſſors were entangled. The Executive Council, faithful to its duties, and obedient to the will of the French people, authorized Citizen Genet to declare with freedom and ſincerity, to the miniſters of Congreſs, that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047056_0004_1022980F14F44DB8"/>thoſe of the French republic, throwing far from them every thing appertaining to the old embaſſy, the revenue ſyſtem, the cautious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and all thoſe impediments to the riches and proſperity of the nations, have highly approved the overtures made to Citizen Ternant, as well by General Waſhington as by Mr. Jefferſon, upon the means of renewing and conſolidating our commercial ties, in placing them on the principles of truth itſelf; that the Executive Council are diſpoſed to ſet on foot a negociation upon thoſe foundations, and that they do not know but that ſuch a treaty admits a latitude ſtill more extenſive in becoming a national agreement, in which two great people ſhall ſuſpend their commercial and political intereſts, and eſtabliſh a mutual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to befriend the empire of liberty, wherever it can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, to guarantee the ſovereignty of the people, and puniſh thoſe powers who ſtill keep up an excluſive colonial and commercial ſyſtem, by declaring that their veſſels ſhall not be received in the ports of the contracting parties. Such a pact which the people of France will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with all the energy which diſtinguiſhes them, and of which they have already given ſo many proofs, will quickly contribute to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral emancipation of the new world. However vaſt this project may be, it will not be difficult to execute, if the Americans determine on it, and it is to convince them of its practicability that Citizen Genet muſt direct all his attention: for, beſides the advantages which humanity in general will draw from the ſucceſs of ſuch a negociation, we have at this moment a particular intereſt in taking ſteps to act efficaciouſly againſt England and Spain, if, as every thing announces, theſe powers attack us from hatred to our principles; if the Engliſh miniſters, inſtead of ſharing in the glory of France, inſtead of conſidering that our liberty, as well as that of thoſe people whoſe chains we have broken, for ever eſtabliſhes that of their own country, ſuffer themſelves to be influenced by our enemies, and by thoſe to the liberty of mankind, and embark with every tyrant againſt that cauſe which we are defending. The military preparations making in Great Britain become every day more and more ſerious, and have an intimate connection with thoſe of Spain. The friendſhip which reigns between the miniſters of the laſt power and thoſe of St. James's proves it; and in this ſituation of affairs we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, by all poſſible means, the zeal of the Americans, who are as much intereſted as ourſelves, in diſcerning the deſtructive projects of George the Third, in which they are probably an object. Their own ſafety f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll depends on ours, and if we fail, they will ſooner or later fall under the iron rod of Great Britain.—The executive Council has room to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe reaſons, in addition to the great commercial advantages which we are diſpoſed to concede to the United States, will determine
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:047056_0005_10229811057585A0"/>their government to adhere to all that Citizen Genet ſhall propoſe to them on our part. And it is poſſible, however, that the falſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations which have been made to Congreſs, of the ſituation of our internal affairs, of the ſtate of our maritime force, of our finances, and eſpecially of the ſtorms with which we are threatened, may make her miniſters, in the negociations which Citizen Genet is intruſted to open, adopt a timid and wavering conduct, the Executive Council charges him, in expectation that the American government will finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to make a common cauſe with us, to take ſuch ſteps as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him exigencies may require, to ſerve the cauſe of liberty and the freedom of the people. Citizen Genet will lend the aſſiſtance of his good offices to all the French citizens who ſhall have recourſe to him, and whoſe conduct ſhall be unexceptionable. But the Executive Council underſtands that this protection ſhall in no caſe contravene the laws of the country, and ſhall not extend to people of doubtful character, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from their country, or to citizens whoſe conduct ſhall be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. Citizen Genet will avoid as much as he can thoſe ridiculous diſputes about etiquette, which ſo much occupied the old diplomacy. The repreſentatives of other powers are not, however, to be ſuffered to attempt to deprive France, become free, of that precedence it enjoyed under its ancient forms. The Executive Council informs Citizen Genet, for his regulation of the conduct which they wiſh to be followed by the miniſters of the French Republic, if diſputes ſhould ariſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremony and the precedence between them and the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of other powers.</p>
               <p>The intention of the council is, that the miniſters of the nation ſhould declare without reſerve, that the French people ſee in all other people their brethren and their equals, and that they deſire to remove every idea of ſuperiority or precedence; but that if any ſtate, miſtaking the generoſity of theſe principles, pretends to any particular diſtinction, and endeavours to obtain it by any ſteps direct or indirect, the miniſters of the French people ſhall then inſiſt on all the prerogatives the French power has at any time enjoyed; the nation determining that in that caſe its miniſters ſhould defend thoſe rights, being certain that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will make them reſpected.</p>
               <p>As to the ceremonies of his firſt audience, the delivery of his creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, and his communications with the Federal government, Citizen Genet will conform himſelf to thoſe rules which the Congreſs ſhall have eſtabliſhed for all the diplomatic corps in this reſpect; exceptions only offend; general rules wound no one.</p>
               <p>Such are the political objects truſted to the zeal of Citizen Genet; the Executive Council will give him particular inſtructions upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047056_0006_10229814BB11F6A8"/>affairs with which he will be charged, upon the negociation rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the liquidation of the debt of the United States, upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for the Colonies, upon thoſe which the marine and war depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments call for, and upon the negociations which Citizen Ternant was charged to ſet on foot with the United Sates to induce them to furniſh corn, flour, and ſalt proviſions on account of their debt.</p>
               <p>With the miniſter for foreign affairs Citizen Genet will correſpond upon theſe different objects, and it is from him that he will receive the nation's orders.

               <head>Extract from a ſupplement to the inſtructions given to <hi>CITIZEN GENET,</hi> Miniſter and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the United States of America.</head>
               <p>THE Executive Council wiſh that a new treaty, founded upon a baſis more liberal and more fraternal than that of 1778, may be concluded as ſoon as poſſible. As, however, they cannot conceal that in the actual ſtate of Europe a negociation of this kind may be ſubject to many impediments, whether brought about by ſecret manoeuvres of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh miniſter and his partiſans at Philadelphia, by the timidity of certain members of the federal government, who, notwithſtanding their known patriotiſm, have always ſhewn the ſtrongeſt averſion to every meaſure which might be unpleaſant to England, they think it right for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that Citizen Genet ſhould draw every advantage which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the ſubſiſting treaty ſecure to the Republic, until a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact has more clearly and fully defined and enlarged them.</p>
               <p>In this view, whichexiſting circumſtances render particularly important, Citizen Genet is expreſsly enjoined to make himſelf thoroughly maſter of the ſenſe of the treaty of 1778, and to be watchful in the execution of the articles which are favourable to the commerce and navigation of the French Republic, and he will endeavour to ſatisfy the Americans, that the engagements which may appear burthenſome to them, are the juſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047056_0007_102298181DF7F770"/>price of that Independence which the French nation contributed to acquire for them.</p>
               <p>In the probable caſe of a maritime war, Citizen Genet will employ all the means in his power to procure a religious obſervance of the 17th, 21ſt, and 22d articles of the treaty of commerce, by which the contracting parties engage freely to admit the prizes made by either of the parties from his enemies, and have renounced the right of permitting their citizens to ſerve under the flag of a foreigner againſt the veſſels of their reſpective <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the United States and the proviſions with which they abound. It would be moreover to be feared that the fitting out in American ports Engliſh armaments, or ſuch as were pretended to be ſo, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a number of individuals of the northern ſtates, remarkable for their boldneſs and activity, to accept of Engliſh commiſſions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and injure our commerce. Without doubt neither the Congreſs or the Executive power of the United Sates would approve a conduct ſo little conformable to the ties of friendſhip and good underſtanding which ſubſiſt between the two nations; but the great extent of the Engliſh commerce in America now become free, the prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its factors and of the emiſſaries of George the IIId. the means of corruption, which their ſituation and their local acquaintance give them, would render theſe expeditions the more frequent, as it would be ſo eaſy to deceive the vigilance of government by concealed equipments. Citizen Genet is therefore particularly enjoined to watch, by the conſuls and commercial agents, the conduct of the Engliſh in the different ports, to inſiſt rigorouſly upon the execution of the 17th, 21ſt, and 22d articles of the treaty of 1778, and to prevent in the American ports all equipments, unleſs upon account of the French nation, and the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any prize, except thoſe which ſhall have been made by the veſſels of the republic. He will take care to explain himſelf upon this object with the dignity and energy of the repreſentative of a great people, who, in faithfully fulfilling their engagements, know how to make their right reſpected.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as circumſtances permit efficacious negociations concerning a new treaty of commerce, Citizen Genet will not loſe ſight of ſtipulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſitively and without reſerve for a reciprocal exemption from the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047056_0008_1022981ACD49CB60"/>duty on tonnage, avoided under different pretences, from many years paſt by the American government, though expreſsly granted by the 5th article of the preſent treaty.</p>
               <p>The mutual naturalization of French and American citizens, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial reſpects, propoſed by Mr. Jefferſon and approved of by the Executive Council, will render this exemption from the duty on ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage leſs offenſive for the powers claiming a participation of the ſame favour by virtue of their treaties, for the caſus federis will be entirely changed with reſpect to them.</p>
               <p>The reciprocal guarantee of the poſſeſſions of the two nations ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the 11th article of the treaty of 1778, can be eſtabliſhed upon generous principles, which have been already pointed out, and ſhall equally be an eſſential clauſe in the new treaty which will be propoſed. The Executive Council in conſequence recommend, eſpecially to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen Genet, to ſound early the diſpoſition of the American government, and to make it a condition ſine qua non, of their free commerce with the Weſt Indies ſo eſſential to the United States. It nearly concerns the peace and proſperity of the French nation, that a people whoſe reſources increaſe beyond all calculation, and whom nature hath placed ſo near our rich colonies, ſhould become intereſted, by their own engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the preſervation of theſe iſlands. Citizen Genet will find the leſs difficulty in making this propoſition reliſhed in the United Sates, as the great trade which will be the reward of it, will indemnify them ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately for the ſacrifices which they may make at the outſet; and the Americans cannot be ignorant of the great diſproportion between their reſources and thoſe of the French Republic, and that for a very long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the guarantee aſked of them will be little elſe than nominal for them, while that on our part will be real, and we ſhall immediately put ourſelves in a ſtate to fulfil it, in ſending to the American ports a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent force to put them beyond inſult and to facilitate their communication with the iſlands and with France. Fully to inſure the ſucceſs of theſe negociations, and to render nugatory in the United States thoſe ſcandalous inſinuations ſo clandeſtinely ſpread through Europe by the enemies of the Republic, the Executive Council ſpecially direct Citizen Genet to adhere to the forms eſtabliſhed for official communications with the United States, between the government and foreign agents, and not to permit himſelf to take any ſtep, or make any overture, which can give umbrage to the Americans in regard to the conſtitution which they have choſen, and which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tlers in many points from the principles eſtabliſhed in France.</p>
               <p>The emiſſaries and partiſans of George III. the emigrants, and the Hiſpaniola refugees, who are found in great numbers in the principal
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047056_0009_1022981DB127E490"/>cities of the United States, and who have already infected them with their falſehoods, will not fail to watch the miniſter of the Republic, and to give all his meaſures the moſt malicious conſtruction. An open and patriotic conduct can alone put him beyond the reach of calumny and miſconſtruction. The Executive Council relies, in this reſpect, with an entire confidence upon the prudence and known moderation of Citizen Genet.</p>
               <p>In order that nothing may delay the concluſion of the negociations of Citizen Genet with the Americans, and that he may have in his own power all the means which can aſſiſt the pains he will take in the cauſe of liberty, the Executive Council has given him the full powers annexed. The Miniſter of the Marine Department will tranſmit to him a certain number of blank letters of marque, which he will deliver to ſuch French or American owners as ſhall apply for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter at War ſhall likewiſe deliver to Citizen Genet, officer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
