            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Boſton, January 21, 1768.</head>
               <p>I Found it neceſſary to call the Aſſembly ſooner than I intended, and they accordingly met on December 30th. I deferred giving your Lordſhip any Account of their Proceedings till they ſhould become intereſting enough to deſerve your Lordſhip's Notice. The firſt 18 Days were ſpent in preparing Remonſtrances againſt the Act for impoſing new Duties, and directing the Application of them for the Support of the Adminiſtration of Juſtice &amp; the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A few Days before the Meeting of the Aſſembly the Speaker of the Houſe was with me, and in the Courſe of Converſation informed me that it was intended to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt the late Acts, and aſked my Opinion upon it. I told him that if they were determined upon that Step, I would adviſe them to do it in ſuch a Manner that the Terms of their Remonſtrance might not neceſſarily come before Parliament; for I knew that however cautiouſly it might be worded, it could not be free from a Claim of a Right to an Exemption from Acts of this kind, and I was well aſſured that however favourable the Parliament had been to them heretofore, it was at preſent by no Means diſpoſed to bear with a farther Diſpute of their Authority ſo ſoon after it had been ſo ſolemnly declared to be inherent in them, and eſpecially in the preſent Caſe, which was of Port Duties which had heretofore been admitted to belong to Parliament, and now were to be taken away by a Refinement which however it might read in American News-Papers, would never be heard in the two Houſes; which allowed of no Diſtinctions in what they ſhould think fit to enact for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. I added, that if they ſhould think proper to addreſs his Majeſty's Secretary of State upon this Occaſion, it was my official Buſineſs to take the Charge of it, and I ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011176_0003_0F862BCEDBDE2F90"/>
faithfully remit it, whatever the Contents were; and if they put it into other Hands, I ſhould remonſtrate againſt it as being irregular and unconſtitutional for any Addreſſes to paſs from an Aſſembly (where the King has a Repreſentative preſiding) to his Majeſty, either directly or indirectly, except thro' the Mediation of his Repreſentative.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Aſſembly met, the Houſe ordered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, which was regiſtered in the Secretary's Office, to be brought in and read, and then appointed a Committee to conſider the State of the Province and report. This Committee reported a Letter to Mr. DeBerdt their Agent, and another to your Lordſhip: theſe being very long, they took many Days Conſideration, in which many offenſive Paſſages were ſtruck out; tho' I am told there ſtilll remain, at leaſt in the Letter to Mr. DeBerdt, ſeveral bold Expreſſions. Theſe two Letters took up 18 Days, after which the Committee reported an Addreſs to the King, which was concluded and agreed upon in 4 or 5 Days more. When the two firſt Letters were finiſhed, I directed the Secretary to aſk the Speaker to let me have a Sight of them, as I had been always uſed to do in like Caſes, without ever being refuſed. The Speaker ſaid he muſt adviſe about it, and afterwards told the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary that there was an Order of the Houſe that no Copies ſhould be taken, and therefore he could not let me have them. The Secretary replied that that was no Objection to my ſeeing them, for that I did not want any Copy, and would give him any Aſſurance that no Copy ſhould be taken, whilſt in my Hands; and adviſed him to ſee me. The Speaker came to me and repeating his Difficulties, offered to take the Opinion of the Houſe. I told him he ſhould new move the Houſe in my Name, for I would not put it in their Power to refuſe me this; that I had already waited five Days for a Sight of thoſe Papers; and if he would not let me have it now, I ſhould take it as a Refuſal, and ſhould acquaint the Secretary of State with it; he ſtill ſaid that he would endeavour to get Leave to ſhew them to me, but nothing has been done. I muſt add, that I by no Means apprehend this to be an Affront to my Perſon, but my Office; for at this Time the Speaker himſelf ſeemed uncommonly deſirous by ſome other Means to perſuade me of his Reſpect; and the Houſe, from the Time of the opening the Seſſion to this Day, has ſhewn their Diſpoſition to avoid all Diſpute with me, every Thing having paſſed with as much good
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011176_0003_0F862BCEDBDE2F90"/>
Humour as I could deſire, except only their continuing to act in addreſſing the King, remonſtrating to the Secretary of State, and employing a ſeparate Agent, as if they were the States General of the Province, without a Governor or a King's Council.</p>
               <p>It is the Importance of this Innovation, without any Wilfulneſs of my own, which induces me to make this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance to your Lordſhip, at a Time when I have a fair Proſpect of having in all other Buſineſs nothing but Good to ſay of the Proceedings of this Houſe, I mean ſo far as their Diſpoſition has hitherto appeared.</p>

               <head>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Boſton 30th January 1768.</head>
               <p>I Received your Lordſhip's Letter No. 11, by the Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Mail, which arrived here this Day Se'nnight, the October Mail which has other Letters of your Lordſhip for me, is not arrived here, tho' by the Accounts we have it is daily expected; I have therefore at preſent only to ſay, that I ſhall regard the Letter now received rather for my own Inſtruction, than a Direction to others. The Time is not yet come when the Houſe is to be moved againſt popular Printers, however proflgiate and flagitious. But if there was a View of Succeſs, I ſhould by no Means think is proper to make ſuch an Attempt now when the Houſe ſhows ſo good a Diſpoſition to a Reconciliation to Government, of which they have given good Proof, ſince the Date of my former Letter. They have acted in all Things, even in their Remonſtrance (as far as I who have not been allowed a Sight of it can learn) with Temper and Moderation: They have avoided ſome Subjects of Diſpute, and have laid a Foundation for removing ſome Cauſes of former Alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I ſpeak this only from private Report, nothing of this Kind very material having as yet come up to me.</p>
               <p>But in one Thing the Houſe has ſhown itſelf contra-agent to the Faction, who want again to embroil America. There is no doubt but the principal Deſign in forming theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances was to ſet an Example to the Reſt of America, and produce a general Clamour from every other Aſſembly againſt the late Acts. This was partly defeated by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to call the Aſſembly before the uſual Time; and again by the Houſe reſolving to form their Remonſtrance
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011176_0004_0F862BCF823212A0"/>
in ſuch a Manner that it ſhould not of Neceſſity be made public; but tho' this laſt Intention was quite inconſiſtent with the Purpoſe of communicating the Subſtance of their Remonſtrance to the other Aſſemblies, yet it did not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Party from attempting it; the Houſe was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly moved that a Day be aſſigned to take into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Propriety of informing the other Governments with their Proceedings againſt the late Acts, that, if they thought fit, they might join therein. Upon the Day this was ſtrongly oppoſed and fully debated; it was ſaid by the Oppoſers of the Motion, that this would be conſidered at Home as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing another Congreſs, and perhaps the former was not yet forgot. Upon the cloſe of the Debate, it was carried in the Negative by at leaſt 2 to 1. No one Tranſaction in the Houſe has given me ſo great Hopes that they are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a right Senſe of their Duty and their true Intereſt, as this has done; and I hope it will make ſome Atonement for their Remonſtrances.</p>

               <head>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Boſton, February 18, 1768.</head>
               <p>BY my Letter No. 2, I informed your Lordſhip that a Motion in the Houſe for circulating a Copy of their Proceedings againſt the late Acts of Parliament to all the Aſſemblies on the Continent had been rejected by above 2 to 1; and that I formed promiſing Concluſions from this Defeat of the factious Party; but I was too haſty in my Approbation of the Conduct of the Houſe. This was too great a Point to be given up, the Party therefore reſolved to make another Effort, and having prepared the Way by privately tampering with, and influencing Particulars, they moved that all the former Proceedings upon this Buſineſs ſhould be obliterated out of the Journal, which being agreed to, the Way became clear for another Motion that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſhould be appointed to prepare a circular Letter to the ſeveral Speakers of the Aſſemblies upon the Continent, containing an Abſtract of their Remonſtrances againſt the late Acts, and a deſire that the other Aſſemblies <hi>would join</hi> with them; a Letter was preſently reported and agreed to by the Houſe.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I knew that this was paſt, I got the Speaker to come to me, and in the Preſence of the Secretary required a Copy of the Circular Letter that I might tranſmit it to your Lordſhip, to whom I ſaid I ſhould be obliged to ſend an Account of this extraordinary Proceeding, which I feared would be thought ſimilar to the Congreſs in 1765. He ſaid that he did not doubt but that it would be eaſily obtained, with the Leave of the Houſe. He accordingly asked the Leave of the Houſe the next Day, which he not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the Copy in Queſtion, but alſo for the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of which he had refuſed me the Sight ſome Time before.</p>
               <p>I now ſend your Lordſhip a Copy of this Circular Letter, which I would animadvert upon, if the Time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; at preſent I will only make two Obſervations, 1ſt. That this preſent Undertaking is calculated to inflame the whole Continent, and engage them to join together in another Diſpute with the Parliament about the Authority of the latter; altho' the preſent Subject Matter was profeſſedly allowed by the Americans themſelves to be within the Bounds of the Power of Parliament at the Time of the former Diſpute. 2dly, That the Diſtinctions, by Means of which they now transfer the Matters contained in the late Act of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011176_0005_0F862BD026157B30"/>
Parliament, from the Range of what they Before conceded to Parliament, to that of what they before denied, is equally concluſive of all Acts of Parliament impoſing Duties in any of the American Ports, and conſequently if the laſt Act ſhould be given up to thoſe Pretentions, all other Acts of American Revenue muſt follow. I ſhall write fully to your Lordſhip upon this Subject when I have Leiſure to review the Proceedings of this Seſſion.</p>

               <p>YESTERDAY I prorogued the General Aſſembly, after a Seſſion of above nine Weeks, the greateſt Part of which was ſpent in animadverting upon, and counterworking the late Acts of Parliament concerning the Revenue, ſo that there was not Time eno' to do the Provincial Buſineſs, nor even all of that which I recommended to them at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seſſion, ſome of the Productions of theſe Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions will come to your Lordſhip directly from the Speaker of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Circular Letter to the Reſt of the Colonies, I have already ſent to your Lordſhip; there is a Letter I am told from the Houſe to the Lords of the Treaſury, but there is no Occaſion for my communicating that; I now ſend a Copy of the Reſolves of the Houſe upon Importations and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; it is ſo decently and cautiouſly worded, that at another Time it would ſcarce have given Offence: but they boaſt of it, as it was meant to be a Confirmation of the Boſton Reſolves.</p>
               <p>On February 28th appeared in the Boſton Gazette a viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Libel againſt me—I had never before taken any Notice of the Libels publiſhed in the Boſton Gazette; but this was attended with ſo many Circumſtances of Flagitiouſneſs that I did not think I could with Safety to the Government paſs it by unnoticed; I therefore next Morning laid it before the Council at a very full Board, there being 20 preſent, which is the whole Number but 3. It was received with general Deteſtation; moſt of the Gentlemen ſpoke to teſtify their Abhorrence of it, and it was remarkable that ſome of thoſe who heretofore had been inclined to the popular Side, were moſt loud in their Reſentments of this Outrage. In the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011176_0005_0F862BD026157B30"/>
End they unanimouſly adviſed me to lay it before the two Houſes of the General Court, that is, themſelves in their Legiſlative Capacity, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives. This I did by a Meſſage to each, in the Terms incloſed which are the ſame except in the proper Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>The Board appointed a Committee to prepare an Anſwer to my Meſſage, which was reported and agreed upon una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly by the ſame Number as before mentioned: In the Houſe which was grown thin and evacuated by the Friends of government in greater Proportion than the Opponents. It had not the ſame Succeſs. They labour'd with all their Might to prevent the Paper being cenſured. It was debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a whole Afternoon, and adjourned to the next Morning, during which Interval all the uſual Practices of tampering with the Members were employed, and the next Day upon a Vote the Conſideration of the Libel was diſmiſſed. The chief Argument uſed for this Purpoſe was that as there was no Name uſed, it was not a Libel in Law, and would not be conſidered ſo in a Court of Juſtice, it was finally agreed that the Meſſage as incloſed ſhould be ſent to me. The Faction carried their Points by ſmall Majorities; upon the laſt Queſtion the Numbers were 39 to 30, the greater of which is about one third Part of the whole Houſe; upon this Occaſion—behaved in the Houſe like a Madman; he abuſed every one in Authority, and eſpecially the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in the groſſeſt Terms.</p>
               <p>The next Morning he came into the Council Chamber, before the Board met, and having read the Council's Addreſs, he with Oaths and Imprecations vowed Vengeance upon the whole Council at the next Election, and told one Councellor who happened to be there, that he never ſhould ſit at that Board after his Year was out. This is the Man who makes ſuch a Diſturbance about my uſing my Negative in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Councellors; the annual Election of whom is the Canker Worm of the Conſtitution of this Government.</p>
               <p>It may be expected that after ſuch ſtrong Declarations againſt this Libel, the Council would have joined with me in the Proſecution of the Printers, but that could not be brought about; it was known that I intended to move that Buſineſs, and therefore one of the Board in the Name of ſome of my Friends was ſent to me to adviſe the contrary. It was ſuggeſted it would be better to leave the Matter where it ſtood, with a continued Unanimity of the (almoſt) whole Council, than by proceeding farther to divide them,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011176_0006_0F862BD0EF9F44D8"/>
eſpecially as it was thought probable that a Vote for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution might not be obtained. It was ſatisfied with theſe Reaſons, and declined making any further Motion. This is one of the Conſequences of that fatal Ingredient in this Conſtitution, the Election of the Council, which will always weaken this Government, ſo that the beſt Management will never make it's Weight capable of being put in the Scales againſt that of the People, tho' the late Act of Parliament will do much toward it. However, I ordered the Attorney General to procure Informations, ſo that if a Proſecution may hereafter be thought adviſeable, it may be practicable. But after all, theſe Printers are anſwerable to Great-Britain, an Hundred Times more than they are to this; and while that Debt remains unſatisfied, we ought not to complain that it is not paid here.</p>
               <p>I had intended when I prorogued the General Court to have made a ſhort Speech to the Houſe in Anſwer to their laſt Meſſage on your Lordſhip's Letter; but their publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Meſſage in one of their Papers, and that virulent Libel in the next, ſhewed ſuch a determined Deſign to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent me to the People, that I was obliged to enter more fully into my Juſtification than I intended to have done at firſt; and accordingly I delivered the Speech incloſed: I Approbation it has received from all Parties in this Town; it is intended to open the Eyes of the People, to the Wickedneſs of this factious Junto, though perhaps they will not ſee it clearly 'till they feel ſome of the Effects of it's Machinations, which cannot fail of coming upon them in ſome Shape or other, as they are now going on.</p>

               <head>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Boſton, March 12, 1768.</head>
               <p>SINCE I wrote my laſt the Superior Court has been opened at Boſton, upon which Occaſion the Chief Juſtice (Lieutenant-Governor) made a long and forcible Charge to the Grand Jury upon the Subject of the Libels publiſhed in the Boſton Gazette, and particularly that which has been lately animadverted upon by the Council. This ſo ſenſibly affected the Grand Jury and all the Hearers of it, that it left no Doubt in the Mind of any one preſent, that the Grand Jury would find a Bill againſt the Printers. And
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011176_0006_0F862BD0EF9F44D8"/>
they themſelves had ſo little Doubt of it, that as ſoon as they came out Court they ſent for the Attorney General, and directed him to prepare a Bill againſt the next Morning.</p>
               <p>But in the Interval, the Faction who conducts that Paper, was indefatigable in tampering with the Jury, ſo that when the Buſineſs was reſumed the next Day, that Bill was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo effectually that it paſſed in the Negative by a ſmall Majority, ſome ſay of one only. Upon this Occaſion the Managers of the Paper were ſeen publickly, to haunt the Grand Jury-men wherever they went.</p>
               <p>Senſible People who have a Regard for their Country are much concerned at this Defeat of Juſtice. They ſay that it is a Symptom of ſuch extreme Weakneſs in the Government, that it affords little Hopes of its Recovery. And indeed I do not expect the Government will ever recover its Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aid from ſuperior Powers. If the Oppoſition was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected only againſt Perſons and Meaſures, a Reconciliation might and would ſoon take Place, and all might be well again. But Men and Meaſures are only nominal Defendants, the Authority of the King, the Supremacy of Parliament, the Superiority of Government, are the real Objects of the Attack, and a general levelling of all the Powers of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reducing it into the Hands of the whole People, is what is aimed at, and will, at leaſt in ſome Degree, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, without ſome external Aſſiſtance. The Council which formerly uſed to be revered by the People, has loſt its Weight, and notwithſtanding their late ſpirited Exertion, is in general timid and irreſolute, eſpecially when the annual Election draws near. That fatal Ingredient in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this Conſtitution is the Bane of the whole, and never will the Royal Scale be balanced with that of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple till the Weight of the Council is wholly put into the former. The making the Council independent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (even tho' they ſhould ſtill receive their original Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them) would go far to cure all the Diſorders which this Government is ſubject to. But my Lord, whilſt I am treating of the Conſtitutional Imbecility of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, I muſt not forget my Promiſe that I would repreſent to his Majeſty the public-ſpirited Conduct of the Council during this laſt Seſſion. I muſt therefore beg Leave to aſſure your Lordſhip, that in many Tranſactions in this laſt Seſſion, the Council have in general ſhown great Attention to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Government and the Welfare of the People, and have upon many Occaſions ſhewn a Reſolution and Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011176_0007_0F862BD1A6A82DE0"/>
in promoting his Majeſty's Service, which would have done Honour to his Majeſty's Appointment if they had wholly held their Places under it, which makes it more to be lamented that ſuch Men ſhould be ſubjected to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually threatned to be turned out of their Places, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they exerciſe the Dictates of their own Judgments in Contravention to the Fury of a ſeditious Demagogue.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit to do Juſtice to the ſpirited Conduct of the Lieutenant Governor, in his Function of Chief Juſtice. It gives me great Pleaſure to ſay, that I can depend upon his Reſolution and Steadineſs as much as I can upon my own; and am aſſured that there will be no want of a due Enforcement of the Laws to the Correction of the preſent Abuſes. Where there is a Failure of this Exertion, it will ariſe either from the Defaults of Juries, or from the Controul which in this defenceleſs Government the common People ſometimes exerciſe over of Laws, eſpecially the Laws of Great-Britain. The Chief Juſtice has been much preſt to print his Charge; but has hitherto declined it. However, he has reduced it to writing, that if it ſhould be miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Boſton Gazette (as from the great Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which reigns here is very probable) he may be able to juſtify himſelf. In the mean Time, as he has begun with theſe Printers, he will I dare ſay, purſue his Purpoſe; and as the Publication of this Paper is a Crime committed in every County in the Province; it is probable, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grand Jury may not be ſo regardleſs of their Oath and their Duty to their Country, as this has been.</p>

               <p>I Expected that the Appointment of Commiſſioners of Cuſtoms, in America, would have made it unneceſſary for me to have troubled your Lordſhip with any Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the Subject of the Cuſtoms. But I ſee ſuch an Oppoſition to the Commiſſioners and their Officers, and ſuch a Defiance to the Authority by which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed continually growing, that I can no longer excuſe my informing your Lordſhip of the Detail of Facts from whence the moſt dangerous Conſequences are to be expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011176_0007_0F862BD1A6A82DE0"/>
It is ſome Time ſince there have been frequently Reports of Inſurrections intended, in which it has been ſaid the Houſes of one or more of the Commiſſioners and their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would be pulled down; two were more particularly fixed upon. Upon one of theſe Nights a Number of Lads about 100, paraded the Town with a Drum and Horns, paſſed by the Council Chamber whilſt I was ſitting there in Council, aſſembled before Mr. Paxton's (a Commiſſioner's) Houſe, and Huzza'd, and to the Number of at leaſt 60 juſty Fellows (as I am aſſured) inveſted Mr. Burch's (another Commiſſioner's Houſe) for ſome Time, ſo that his Lady and Children were obliged to go out of the back Door to avoid the Danger which was threatened. This Kind of Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance was kept up all the Evening, and after all was treated at the Diverſion of a few Boys a Matter of no Conſequence. This was I think on March the 4th.</p>
               <p>After this it was reported that the Inſurrection was poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned till March 18th, which was the Anniverſary of the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, upon which Day Effigies were to be exhibited, and two Perſons, Mr. Paxton a Commiſſioner, and Mr. Williams one of the Inſpectors General, were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as devoted to the Reſentment of the Mob. I took all the Pains I could to diſcover the Truth of this Report, but could get no other Anſwer, but Aſſurances that no ſuch Thing would be done or ſuffered. On the very Day before I ſpoke with the moſt knowing Men I could procure, who were very poſitive that no Effiges would be hung up, and yet late that Evening I had certain Advice that Effigies were prepared, but it was too late to do any Thing, and my Information was of that Nature I could not make uſe of it in Public.</p>
               <p>Early the next Morning the Sheriff came to me to inform me that the Effigies of Mr. Paxton and Mr. Williams were hanging upon Liberty-Tree. I had the Day before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Council to meet, and I now ſent round to get them together as ſoon as poſſible it might be. Before I went to Council I learned that the Effigies had been taken down by ſome of the Neighbours without any Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>At Council I ſet forth in ſtrong Terms the Atrociouſneſs of this Inſult, the Danger of it's being followed by actual Violence, and the Neceſſity there was of providing for the Preſervation of the Peace of the Town. But all I could ſay made no Impreſſion upon the Council, they perſevered in treating the Affair as of no Conſequence, and aſſuring
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011176_0008_0F862BD26EACE5F8"/>
me that there was no Danger of any Commotion. After they had given their Opinion as in the incloſed Copy of the Minutes, I received a Letter from the Commiſſioners, ſetting forth the Inſult they had received, the Danger they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and deſiring the Protection of the Government. I communicated this to the Council, and propoſed that they ſhould reconſider this Buſineſs, but finding them not inclined to depart from their Opinion as before given; I adjourned the reconſideration till the Afternoon. In the Afternoon upon the Queſtion being put to them again they adhered to their former Opinion.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have mentioned before, that under all theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances I had, that there would be no Diſturbances, it was never underſtood that the Day, the Anniverſary of the Repeal of the Stamp-Act ſhould not be celebrated; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at break of Day there were beating of Drums, and firing of Guns heard, and the whole Town was adorned with Ships Colours, and to add to the Celebration the Feaſt of Saint Patrick being the Day before was poſtponed to this Day.</p>
               <p>However, great Pains were taken by the Selectmen of the Town, and ſome other Gentlemen, that the Feſtivity ſhould not produce a Riot in the Evening, and ſo far it ſucceeded that it produced Terror only, and not actual Miſchief.</p>
               <p>There was a Number of Gentlemen dined at two Taverns near the Town Houſe, upon the Occaſion of the Day. Theſe broke up in good Time; after which many of the ſame and other Gentlemen kept together at the Coffee-Houſe (one of the Taverns) all the Evening. Theſe prevented the lighting a Bonfire in that Street, which was ſeveral Times attempted, and would probably have been a Prelude to Action. But the aſſembling a great Number of People of all Kinds, Sexes and Ages, many of which ſhewed a great Diſpoſition to the utmoſt Diſorder, could not be prevented. There were many Hundreds of them paraded the Streets with Yells and Outcries which were quite terrible. I had in my Houſe Mr. Burch one of the Commiſſioners and his Lady and Children, who had the Day before moved to our Houſe for Safety.</p>
               <p>I had alſo with me the Lieutenant-Governor and Sheriff of the County. But I had taken no Steps to fortify my Houſe, not being willing to ſhow an Apprehenſion of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to myſelf. But at one Time there was ſo terrible a Yell from the Mob going by, that it was apprehended that they were breaking in, but it was not ſo. However, it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011176_0008_0F862BD26EACE5F8"/>
cauſed the ſame Terror as if it had been ſo; and the Lady, a Stranger to this Country, who choſe our Houſe for an Aſylum, has not recovered it as yet. They went on and inveſted Mr. Williams's Houſe, but he ſhewed himſelf at a Window, and told them that he was ready for their Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they went off, and either did not intend or dared not to attack his Houſe. They alſo at two different Times about Midnight made Outcries about Mr. Paxton's Houſe, out of mere Wantonneſs to terrify his Family. The whole made it a very terrible Night to thoſe who thought themſelves Objects of the popular Fury; and yet if I ſhould complain of it, I ſhould be told that it was nothing but the common Effects of Feſtivity and Rejoicing, and there was no Harm intended.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip will perhaps aſk what I have been doing all this while, that this Spirit of Diſorder is got to ſuch a Pitch; I anſwer, every Thing in my Power to prevent it; ſince firſt theſe Tumults were apprehended, the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with whom (I mean 4 of the 5) I am upon the moſt intimate Terms, have often aſked me, what Support to their Office, or Protection for themſelves, I can afford: I anſwer, none in the World. For tho' I am allowed to proceed in the Ordinary Buſineſs of the Government without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the Buſineſs of a popular Oppoſition to the Laws of Great-Britain founded upon the Pretentions of Rights and Priviledges, I have not the Shadow of Authority or Power. I am juſt now in the Situation I was in about two Years ago, ſure to be made obnoxious to the Madneſs of the People, by the Teſtimony I am obliged to bear againſt it, and yet left expoſed to their Reſentment without any poſſible Reſort of Protection. I am then aſked why I don't apply for Troops as well to ſupport the King's Government as to protect the Perſons of his Officers. I anſwer, becauſe I don't think it proper or prudent to make ſuch Application upon my own Opinion only.</p>
               <p>All the King's Governors are directed to take the Advice of the Council in Military Movements; and in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the Governor is in a more peculiar Manner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to have the Advice of the Council for almoſt every Thing he does, it would be dangerous to act in ſuch an important Buſineſs without ſuch Advice. And it is in vain to put ſuch a Queſtion to the Council, for, conſidering the Influence they are under from their being Creatures of the People, and the perſonal Danger they wou'd by ſubject to in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011176_0009_0F862BD324FB7BC8"/>
aſſiſting in the reſtraining them, it is not probable that the utmoſt Extremity of Miſchief and Danger would induce them to adviſe ſuch a Meaſure. I have once before tried the Experiment when the Danger was more urgent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate than is now; and the Succeſs then fully convinced me that it is to no Purpoſe ever again to repeat the Queſtion. His Majeſty's Miniſters have within theſe three Years been fully acquainted with the Defenceleſs State of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore I truſt that I ſhall be excuſed leaving it entirely to the Adminiſtration to determine upon a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which they are much more able to judge of, and be anſwerable for, than I can be. I ſhall have Danger and Trouble enough when ſuch Orders arrive, tho' I keep ever ſo clear of adviſing or promoting them. Theſe, my Lord, are the Anſwers I have given to the Commiſſioners in the Courſe of Converſation which I have thought proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate in this Place for my own Vindication if it ſhould be needful. I ſhould have mentioned before, but for not interrupting the Narrative, that in the Debate at the Council one Gentleman ſaid that there were Aſſociations formed for preſerving the Peace of the Town; I ſaid that I had not been made acquainted with them, that if there were any ſuch they ought to have been formed with my Privity, and confirmed by my Authority. That if a general Aſſociation for ſupporting the Authority of the Government and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Peace of the Town could be brought about, it would be of great Service, and I ſhould be glad to ſee it ſet about immediately. Upon this a Councellor got up with Vehemence, and ſaid, that ſuch a Subſcription was illegal and unconſtitutional, and he ſhould proteſt againſt it, as tending to bring an Approbium on the Town. I ſaid that at a Time when a Subſcription was handed about the Town in direct Oppoſition to the Parliament and People of Great-Britain, and was every Day enforced by Menaces, and other unfair Methods, it was very extraordinary at that Board to hear a Subſcription for the Support of Government and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Peace called illegal. That I ſhould not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſs a Meaſure which would derive its chief Efficacy from being voluntary, but I feared they would ſee the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of ſuch a Meaſure when it was to late. From this and the generality of the Aſſurances that no Miſchief would be done, I am to underſtand that the Preſervation of the Peace of this Town is to depend upon thoſe who have the Command of the Mob, and can reſtrain them (and of courſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011176_0009_0F862BD324FB7BC8"/>
let them looſe) when they pleaſe, and Civil Authority is not to interpoſe in this Buſineſs; and indeed I have with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerved that all the Aſſurances that no Miſchief was intended at preſent, are founded upon the Impropriety of uſing Violence at a Time when they were applying to the Government and Parliament of Great-Britain for Redreſs. But it is inferred, and ſometimes expreſly declared, that when they have Advice that the Redreſs which they expect is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, they will immediately proceed to do themſelves Juſtice. And it is now become common Talk that they will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Duties impoſed by Parliament, not only thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the late Acts, but all others which raiſe a Revenue. This is public Talk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the ſanguine Expectations which the Faction, from whoſe Cabinet all theſe Troubles have ariſen, has formed for comptrolling and triumphing over Great-Britain; I dare not repeat what I have heard till their Purpoſes become more apparent.</p>
               <p>In this Narrative I have taken no Notice of the Town Meetings, Meetings of Merchants, Subſcriptions for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Engliſh Goods, Propoſals for Manufactures, &amp;c. which have been carrying on before and during the whole aforementioned Time. I intend to make a ſeperate Letter upon theſe Subjects, which poſſibly may accompany this, as I am not at preſent apprized of a Conveyance ſafe enough to truſt this by.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011176_0010_0F862BD4273D5D48"/>
Office) expecting a Schooner laden with Fyal Wines to come in, aſked an Officer of the Cuſtoms, what Indulgence he might expect in regard to the Duties. The Officer anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, none at all; he muſt pay the whole Duties; Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com replied, he was glad to know what he had to truſt to. Some days after the Schooner came in, and was ordered to anchor among the Iſlands 5 Miles below the Town. From thence the Cargo, conſiſting as is ſaid, of above 60 Pipes of Wine was landed in the Night, and carried in Drays to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Cellars, each Load being guarded by a Party of Men with Clubs. This buſineſs employed a number of men the greateſt part of the night, and was as notorious, by the noiſe it occaſioned for many Hours together, as if it had been done at noonday. The Lading of the Schooner was alſo public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known &amp; talked of long before ſhe arrived. She appeared plainly when ſhe came up to Town by well-known Marks to have been lightened a yard or more, and was evidently too light to bear the Sea. Nevertheleſs the Maſter went to the Cuſtom Houſe, and Swore that ſhe came from Suranam in Ballaſt, and had landed nothing ſince ſhe left that Port.</p>
               <p>Two or three Days after, this Malcom procured a Meeting of ſome Merchants and Traders at which he preſided. Their Deliberations were Sanguine, and full of high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; but nothing was determined upon, but to call a general Meeting of the Merchants on Friday March 4th. This may be ſaid, to be the firſt movement of the Merchants againſt the Acts of Parliament: all the proceedings before were carried on at Town Meetings, and were rather upon Refinements of Policy than concern for Trade. There ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was leſs Reaſon for the Merchants to complain of the Regulations of Trade than at preſent; there never was a greater Plenty of Money, or a more apparent Balance of Trade in their Favour, of which the State of Exchange with London, which now is, and for a long time, has been at Par, is an irrefragable Evidence. However, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are at length dragged into the Cauſe, their Intercourſe and Connections with the Politicians, and the ſear of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Stream of the People, have at length brought it about againſt the Senſe of an undoubted Majority both of Numbers, Property and Weight. Accordingly the Reſult of this Meeting was, that a Subſcription for not importing any Engliſh Goods, except for the Fiſhery for 18 Months, ſhould be prepared and carried round the Town, and a Committee was appointed for that purpoſe. This was the ſame night
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011176_0010_0F862BD4273D5D48"/>
that the little Mob with the Drum paſſed by the Town-Houſe.</p>
               <p>Upon the Subſcription Paper firſt going round the Town, it met with no great ſucceſs; A great many declined it as indeed it cannot fail being ruinous to the Generality of Traders. Upon this, all Engines were ſet to Work to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Subſcription; ſome were told they would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the lower ſort of people; others were threatened with the reſentment of the higher: Some were made afraid for their Perſons and Houſes; others for their Trade and Credit. By ſuch means the ſubſcription has been filled by numbers, who if at Liberty would proteſt againſt the force put upon them, and neither intend nor can comply with the Terms, and there are ſtill remaining enough of the moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable Merchants in the Town, Non-Subſcribers, to defeat this Scheme, even if the Subſcribers were to keep to their promiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it never can be carried into execution without the interpoſition of the Mob. But it is ſcarce a Secret with any of them, that the chief Intent of this Subſcription is to raiſe an Alarm among the Merchants and Traders of Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate the foregoing Narrative, I ſend your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their own Account of the Meeting on the 18th, with a Liſt of the Toaſts as uſual. There is alſo in the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a piece containing a Sneer upon the late Proceedings of Parliament; the whole Wit of which ariſes from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aſſertion, that the Parliament has no Right to impoſe Duties in the American Colonies—no more than they have in Portugal. In the ſame is alſo the Letter to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Addreſs to the King is in another of the ſame Papers, and in others. This ſhews that the chief uſe of theſe Letters is to inflame the other Colonies: for unleſs they preferred this Service to the obtaining Redreſs from Home, they could not be ſo deficient in Duty, Reſpect and even common Civility, as to publiſh in America an Addreſs to the King, and a Letter to his Miniſter of State; before they could have come to hand in England. Heretofore even a complimentary Addreſs to the King never uſed to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in America, till it appeared there in the Gazette. In ſhort, your Lordſhip may depend upon it, that nothing leſs than the Abolition of all the Acts impoſing Duties is propoſed. When that is done, the Tranſition to all other Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will be very ſhort and eaſy.</p>

               <p>I AM ſorry to inform your Lordſhip that a great Riot has happened in this Town laſt Evening, which had very bad Conſequences, tho' happily there were no Lives loſt. The Collector and Comptroller of this Port ſeized a Sloop for openly and forcibly landing a Cargo of Wines without paying Duty, and by Means of Aſſiſtance from the Romney Man of War ſecured her. Upon their Return Home they were attacked by a Mob with Clubs, Stones and Brickbats; Mr. Harriſon the Collector was much bruiſed, particularly in the Breaſt, but kept his Legs ſo as to eſcape thro' an Alley. Mr. Hallowell, the Comptroller, <hi>was knocked down and left on the Ground covered with Blood.</hi> He has many Wounds and Bruiſes, but none dangerous to Life. Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon's Son, a young Gentleman not in any Office, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Father, was knocked down and dragged by the Hair of his Head, and would have been killed, if he had not been got into a Houſe by ſome Standers by. In another Part of the Town Mr. Irvine, under the Board of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, was attacked by another Mob, very much beat and abuſed, and would probably have been killed if he had not been reſcued by two of the Mob, and enabled to eſcape thro' an Houſe. This Gentleman was no Ways concerned in the Seizure.</p>
               <p>After this they went to Mr. Hallowell's Houſe, and began to break the Windows and force an Entry, but were divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefrom by Aſſurances that Mr. Hallowell was almoſt killed, and was not at Home. They then went to Mr. Harriſon's and broke his Windows: but he not being at Home, and the Owner of the Houſe entreating them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part they left it. Then they went to Mr. Williams's Houſe, one of the Inſpectors general, who was then at a Diſtance from Boſton, and broke near an hundred Panes, and did other Damage to the Houſe, but upon Mrs. Williams ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and aſſuring them, that he was abſent, and only ſhe was at Home they departed. Happily they did not break into any Houſe, for if they had got at a Cellar, the Miſchiefs would have been greater and more extenſive.</p>
               <p>After this they went to a Wharf were lay a Pleaſure Boat belonging to Mr. Harriſon, built by himſelf in a particular and elegant Manner. This they took out of the Water,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011176_0011_0F862BD69CFDAD38"/>
and carried it into the Common and burnt it. By this Time there were about 500, ſome ſay, 1,000 Men gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whilſt the Boat was burning. Some Gentlemen, who had an influence over them, perſuaded them to depart: this was debated and put to the Vote, whereupon Proclamation was made, "each Man to his Tent." Before this they were harangued by a Leader, who among others, uſed theſe Words as they have been reported to me. "We will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Liberties, depending upon the ſtrength of our own Arms and God." Whilſt they were upon the Common, they got ſome Rum, and attempted to get more: if they had procured it in Quantity, God knows where this Fury would have ended. And now the Terror of the Night is over, it is ſaid to be only a Prelude to further Miſcheifs, the Threats againſt the Commmiſſioners and all the Officers of the Board being renewed with as great Malice as ever.</p>
               <p>This Morning I got the Council together as ſoon as I could, and laid this Affair before them; after a long Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation about what ſhould be done, in which appeared a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to meddle with it as little as poſſible, it was adviſed and ordered that ſuch of the Council as were Juſtices of the Peace ſhould aſſiſt me in aſcertaining the Facts by the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Witneſſes: and Monday Morning at 9 o'Clock is appointed for proceeding upon this Buſineſs. When this is done, I ſhall be able to give your Lordſhip a more full and particular Account of this Affair. At preſent what I ſend is only the Heads of it, which I dare ſay will not vary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially from the moſt authentic Narrative. And I write this at preſent in Order to ſend it by the Poſt to New-York, to take the Chance of the Packet, which it will probably juſt hit the Time of.</p>

                  <p>P. S. June 13. This Morning early I received a Letter from the Commiſſioners, informing me of ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars from whence they concluded that they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately expoſed to further Violences, and therefore they on Saturday Evening took Sheltor on Board the Romney Man of War. That it being neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their further Security, they deſire that their Families and Officers may be received, accommodated and protected at the Caſtle, I immediately anſwered this, by incloſing an Order to the Captain of the Caſtle to receive them accordingly.</p>

This Morning a Paper was found ſtuck upon Liberty-Tree, inviting all the Sons of Liberty to meet at 6 o'-Clock, to clear the Land of the Vermin, which are come to devour them, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have been in Council all this Morning to conſider of preventing an Inſurrection To night; no Reſolution has or will be taken before I ſend away this. Perhaps the Commiſſioners retiring may aſſiſt our Purpoſes.</p>

               <p>BY my Letter No. 5, I informed your Lordſhip of a Riot which happen'd on the 10th of June in the Evening, and that upon my laying the Matter before the Council, they adviſed that ſuch of the Board as were Juſtices of the Peace ſhould aſſiſt me to aſcertain the Facts, after which the whole ſhould be taken into Conſideration. I ſhould have added, that there was then no Apprehenſion in the Council that there would be a Repetition of theſe Violences, nor indeed did any ſuch immediate Danger appear to me whilſt I ſtaid in Boſton which was till Sunſet, when I went to my Country Houſe about 4 Miles from Boſton.</p>
               <p>The next Day being Sunday, I heard ſome looſe Reports that there was to be another Riſing. Early in the Afternoon the Son of Mr. Harriſon, the Collector, came to me and ſaid that his Father apprehended that his Life would be in Danger if he ſtaid in Boſton, and deſired I would give an Order that he ſhould be received at the Caſtle I accordingly gave him ſuch an Order. The next Morning being Monday the 13th, a little after 5 o'Clock, I received a Letter from the Commiſſioners, which is mentioned in the P. S. of my laſt; a Copy of which, together with my Anſwer, and my Order to the Commander of the Caſtle, I herewith incloſe; immediately after, I went to Town, and ordered the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to be ſummoned to meet at Nine o'Clock. Before I went to Council, the Sheriff came to inform me that there was a moſt violent and virulent Paper ſtuck up upon Liberty Tree, containing an Invitation to the Sons of Liberty to riſe that Night to clear the County of the Commiſſioners and their
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011176_0012_0F862BD739680F68"/>
Officers, to avenge themſelves of the Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe, one of which was by Name devoted to Death; there were alſo ſome indecent Threats againſt the Governor, if he did not procure the Releaſe of the Sloop which was ſeized. Afternoon as I came to the Town-Houſe where the Council Chamber is, I found ſeveral HandBills which have been cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated round the Town, ſtuck up there; an exact Copy of which follows.</p>

               <p>When I got into the Council Chamber in the Morning after waiting for a full Board, I told them that there was no Time to enquire of the Particulars of the former Riot which was accidental, when we were immediately threaten'd with new Diſturbances premeditated; I therefore laid before them the Informations I had received, and deſired that they would take into Conſideration the Neceſſity of providing for the Peace of the Town, and the proper Means of doing it: But notwithſtanding all, I could not bring them to any Concluſion, or even to ſtate a Queſtion. All that was done in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to cenſure an Expreſſion in the Commiſſioners Letter, which obliged me to write the Letter the ſecond of that Date. About One o'Clock they deſired me to adjourn the Council 'till 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, that in the mean Time they might inform themſelves of the Probability of new Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances ariſing.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon the Printed Paper was laid before the Council; but it was not conſidered as an Implication of Danger; neither was the Impropriety of the Sons of Liberty appointing a Meeting to ſecure the Peace of the Town, when the Governor and Council were ſitting upon that Buſineſs and ſeemingly to little Purpoſe, taken much Notice of. I laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Letter of the Commiſſioners of that Day; but a Diſpoſition to cenſure it rather than to anſwer it appearing I poſtponed the Conſideration of that Letter 'till after the Determination of the main Queſtion. Freſh Attempts were made to get rid of the Buſineſs, and it was again propoſed,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011176_0013_0F862BD88D78F598"/>
as it had been in the Morning, that I ſhould lay the Buſineſs before the General Court by a Meſſage to both Houſes. I called for the Journal of the Houſe, and ſhewed them that when I purſued this Method (upon the Stamp-Act Riots) with the Advice of the Council, I was told by the Houſe that it was the Buſineſs of the Executive Government to quell Riots, and the Legiſlature had no Right to interpoſe, unleſs new Laws were wanted. That there was as much Reaſon for them to give the ſame Anſwer now; and I did not care to receive it twice. But the Bias ſtill running this Way, I was obliged to give it up, and leave it to the Council to raiſe a Committee of both Houſes to conſider of this Buſineſs, altho' I had many Objections to this Meaſure: But I could not help myſelf.</p>
               <p>In the Courſe of theſe Debates, I told them that if this had been the firſt Buſineſs of the Kind, I ſhould have aſked their Advice, Whether I ſhould not ſend to the General for Troops? But having tried it at a Time when there was at leaſt as much Danger as now, and found them utterly averſe to it, let the Danger be ever ſo great and imminent, it would be in vain to repeat the Queſtion; however, I was ready to do it, if any one Gentleman would propoſe it. I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they did not deſire to be knocked on the Head: I ſaid that I did not deſire that they or I ſhould; but I was ready to take my Share of the Danger if they would join with me, tho' I could not alone in ſo unpopular a Meaſure, for if I did, I muſt quit the Government at leaſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: I added, that tho' I was well aſſured, that if I put this Queſtion every Gentleman would anſwer in the Negative, yet I doubted not but every one would be glad to ſee the Peace of the Town reſtored by this Method, if it ſhould appear to be the only one left. No Anſwer was given.</p>
               <p>By the removing this Buſineſs into the General Court, it is taken out of my Hands any further than the final Conſent or Diſſent to what ſhall be ſent up to me. It is not with my Approbation, nor entirely to my Diſſatisfaction; for as I cannot conduct the Buſineſs as it ought to be, it may be beſt for me to have little Hand in it.</p>

               <p>I Come now to give your Lordſhip an Account of the Meeting at Liberty-Tree in Purſuance of the printed Notice, a Copy of which I inſerted in my laſt. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt know that Liberty-Tree is a large Old Elm in the High Street, upon which the Effigies were hung in the Time of the Stamp-Act, and from whence the Mobs at that Time made their Parades. It had ſince been adorned with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and has obtained the Name of Liberty-Tree, as the Ground under it has that of Liberty-Hall. In Auguſt laſt, juſt, before the Commencement of the preſent Troubles, they erected a Flag-Staff, which went through the Tree, and a good deal above the Top of the Tree. Upon this they hoiſt a Flag as a Signal for the Sons of Liberty, as they are called; I gave my Lord Shelburne an Account of this Erection at the Time it was made. This Tree has often put me in Mind of Jack Cade's Oak of Reformation.</p>
               <p>Upon this Staff the Flag was flying early in the Morning on Tueſday; at the Time appointed there were aſſembled they ſay at leaſt 4,000 Men, many having come out of the Country for that Purpoſe; ſome of the principal Gentleman of the Town attended in order to engage the lower People to concur in Meaſures for Peace and Quiet. One of the Select-Men was choſen Moderator or Chairman, when it was found that they could not do Buſineſs there, they adjourned to the Town-Hall. Here it was objected that they were not a legal Meeting; to obviate this, they adjourned to the Afternoon, that in the mean Time the Select-Men might call a Town-Meeting to legaliſe the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon they met in a large Meeting Houſe, the Town-Hall being not large enough for the Company, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011176_0014_0F862BD981D6F668"/>
Mr. Otis was choſen Moderator. Many wild and violent Propoſals were made, but warded off. Among theſe were, <q>that every Captain of a Man of War that came into this Harbour, ſhould be under the Command of the General Court:</q> Another was, <q>that if any Perſon ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote or aſſiſt the bringing troops here, he ſhould be deemed a Diſturber of the Peace, and a Traitor to his Country,</q> but nothing was done finally but to paſs a Petition to the Governor, and to appoint a Committee of 21 Perſons to Reſort to his Country Houſe (where I then was) and preſent it to him; and to appoint a Committee to prepare Inſtructions for their Repreſentatives, and a Letter to Mr. DeBerdt, as their Agent, after which they Adjourned to the next Day.</p>
               <p>The ſame Evening the Committee which was in general very reſpectable, attended me in a Train of 11 Chaiſes: I received them with all poſſible Civility, and having heard their Petition, I talked very freely with them upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but poſtponed giving a formal Anſwer till the next Day, as it ſhould be in Writing. I then had Wine handed round, and they left me highly pleaſed with their reception, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that part of them which had not been uſed to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with me. The next Day Mr. Otis having received my Anſwer in Writing, reported the whole, took Notice of the polite Treatment they had received from me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he really believed that I was a well wiſher to the Province: this from him was uncommon and extraordinary. The Anſwer was univerſally approved, ſo that juſt at this Time I am popular: Whenever my Duty obliges me to do any Thing which they don't like, there's an end of my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, and therefore I do not expect to enjoy it a Week. I ſhould here mention that I am not ſure that the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Committee for preparing Inſtructions, &amp;c. which I have mentioned to have been done on the firſt Day, was not on the ſecond, but it is not material. They then Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to Friday next in the Afternoon. There was but one Thing mentioned in the Petition that I could do: And that I had promiſed the Select Men 2 Days before that I would do: this was to ſettle with Capt. Corner, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Romney, a Regulation for impreſſing Men, ſo that it might not hurt the Town. And this I had ſettled long before; only there happened to be one ſingle Breach of it by an inferior Officer againſt his Orders. And indeed the Mob of the Town had lately uſed him and his Officers ſo very ill, that he was diſengaged from any Promiſe he had
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011176_0014_0F862BD981D6F668"/>
made, if he had deſired it. I accordingly went on Board the Romney, attended by three of the Council, and had a full Conference with the Captain, in which he acted with the utmoſt Candor and good Nature, and after recapitulating the Injuries he and his Officers had received, renewed the Engagement concerning preſſing, and profeſſed a Deſire of making that Service agreeable to the Town. In the Afternoon I went to the Council, and having ſent for the Select Men, I reported to them what had paſſed with the Captain, and after having ſhown them how much it was the Intereſt of the Town to cultivate a good Underſtanding with the Commanders of the King's Ships, I exhorted them to uſe their Influence over the Common People, ſo as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to treat the Captain, his Officers and Men, in ſuch a Manner as might procure his favour, at leaſt avert his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment: And one of the Gentlemen who accompanied me, engaged to attend the Town Meeting and Report what had paſſed at this Interview as of his own Accord, it being not thought proper that the Governor and Council ſhould appear to have any Correſpondence with a Meeting ſo originated and compoſed as this was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 18<hi>th,</hi> 1768.</p>
               <p>I am able now to proceed in my Narrative of the Town Meeting. Yeſterday in the Afternoon they met according to their Adjournment. The Gentleman of the Council who had engaged to report our proceedings with Capt. Corner, did it in ſuch a manner as gave great Satisfaction both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to me and the Captain. But no Meſſage was voted either to me or Captain Corner; to me it was needleſs, but to him requiſite, as they have in a manner interdicted him and his Officers of the Town. All they did was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Repreſentatives; the only Inſtruction I hear of is, to enquire if any Perſons have been Writing for the King's Ships or Troops to come here, and who? that they might be diſtinguiſhed as Enemies to their Country. They broke up quietly, and there is an End of the Meeting.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners and their Families, and Officers are ſtill on Board the Romney, where they proceed in their Buſineſs. The Town won't hear of their return to Boſton; and it is much better that they ſhould not until the Queſtion is determined. I hear that they are to fix their Reſidence at the Caſtle next Monday. The Romney is fell down and now <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

the other ſide the Caſtle, will complete the command of all the approaches to the Caſtle, there are alſo other Ships of War expected in, ſo that the retreat of the Commiſſioners has been very timely and very well circumſtanced, and their ſecurity is now effectually provided for. Your Lordſhip may wonder at my dwelling upon this: but if there is not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, the Leaders of the Sons of Liberty muſt falſify their Words, and change their Purpoſes. For my Part, when I conſider the defenceleſs State of this Town, I cannot think they will be ſo mad as to attempt to defend it againſt the King's Forces: But the Lengths they have gone alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are ſcarce ſhort of Madneſs. I ſend you Copies of Papers ſtuck upon the Town-Houſe, they may be the Works of a few Individuals.</p>

               <p>I HAVE the Honor to receive your Lordſhip's Letters No. 6 &amp; 7, together with the Duplicates, &amp;c. incloſed in the Cover of the firſt. Upon the Receipt of them I conſulted the Lieutenant-Governor and the Secretary about the beſt Manner of excepting the Orders contained in No. 7, and we all agreed that it would be beſt to ſtay till the Town-Meetings, continued by Adjournments, were over, and the People a little compoſed. I therefore ſhall not be able to communicate to the Houſe his Majeſty's Requiſition until

Tueſday or Wedneſday next, according as the Houſe fills, there being always a thin Houſe on Saturday and Monday.</p>
               <p>I cannot foreſee what will be done upon this Occaſion, whether Prudence will get the better of Faction, or not, I know not how to hope that they will comply; if they do not your Lordſhip may depend upon it I will obey my Orders. It happens very lucky that I am at preſent ſeen in a very favourable Light by the People, and that may prevent my being charged as the Author or Adviſer of this Meaſure, as at other Times I ſhould certainly be. I have lately cauſed it to be hinted that the Faction is likely to have Diſputes eno' upon their Hands without quarrelling with me; and therefore they had beſt reſerve me for a Mediator, as they will certainly want one: I believe ſome of them have liſtened to this.</p>
               <p>However, I ſhan't put too great Confidence in them: I ſhall act with all proper Caution; and if I find myſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Diſſolve the Aſſembly, I ſhall end the Seſſion by Prorogation, and Diſſolve them by Proclamation. By theſe Means the Shock will become gradual; and I ſhall be able to ſtep out of the Way 'till the Wonder is over.

               <p>BY my Letter No. 8, I informed your Lordſhip of the Reaſons why I deferred communicating his Majeſty's Requiſition to the Houſe unto Tueſday following, being the 21ſt Inſtant. On that Day in the Forenoon I ſent a Meſſage to the Houſe, a Copy of which I incloſe, together with a Copy of the 2d, 3d &amp; 4th Paragraphs of your Lordſhip's Letter. I did not ſend a Copy of the 5th and 6th Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, becauſe I knew that the Faction would make uſe of them to inſinuate that the Houſe was treated with Threats and Menaces in the firſt Inſtance, before their Minds were known, and were not allowed Freedom of Debate concerning
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011176_0016_0F862BDC95088198"/>
what was required of them; if I had ſent no Extracts at all, but incorporated the Subſtance of your Lordſhip's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into my Meſſage, they then would have called for the Letter itſelf, and not proceeded till I had given a Copy of it. As it was, I ſteered this Buſineſs in the right Way.</p>
               <p>In the Afternoon when the Meſſages, &amp;c. were read a ſecond Time,—made a Speech near two Hours long, of the moſt violent and virulent Nature. He abuſed all Perſons in Authority both here and at Home; he indeed excepted the King's Perſon, but traduced his Government with all the Bitterneſs of Words. He ſaid that the King appointed none but Boys for his Miniſters; that they had no Education but travelling through France, from whence they returned full of the ſlaviſh Principles of that Country; that they knew nothing of Buſineſs when they came into their Offices, and did not ſtay long enough in them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that little Knowlege which is gained from Experience; that all Buſineſs was really done by the Clerks, and even they were too frequently changed to underſtand what they were about; that the People in England did not know what the Rights of Engliſhmen were; that there was not a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in England capable of compoſing ſo elegant, ſo pure, and ſo nervous a Writing as the Petition to the King which paſſed the laſt Seſſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I give your Lordſhip a Specimen of this Rhapſody; and it was remarked that in his general Cenſure of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the King's Government, no Exception was made of the Miniſters who favoured America by the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, and by other Indulgencies, by the Abuſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this very Faction has roſe to this Head: all were involved in one common Obloquy. I quote theſe Sayings from the Months of thoſe who heard them delivered in the Houſe, which was laid quite open, both Doors and Gallery upon this Occaſion, but neither they nor I can pretend to Exactneſs of Words, but the Subſtance. I dare ſay, does not vary materially. In another Part of his Speech, he paſſed an Encomium on Oliver Cromwell, and extolled the Times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding his Advancement, and particularly the Murder of the King. The Reſult was the appointing a Committee to take the Meſſage, &amp;c. into Conſideration, which Committee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted intirely of the moſt violent of the Heads of the Faction, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Repreſentativeſ of the Town of Boſton, and three of thoſe whom I had reſiſted to admit into the Council upon Account of their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> by their ſomenting
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011176_0016_0F862BDC95088198"/>
the Troubles of the Government, with two others: thus the Houſe ſeemed to prejudge this Buſineſs in the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Committee; and indeed the Appointment of a Committee at all ſhewed a Diſpoſition rather to agree than ſubmit.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday Morning June 23d, upon an Application from the Committee, a Meſſage was ſent to me deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Copies of my Inſtructions upon this Occaſion,<note place="margin">II.</note> of your Lordſhip's Letter (of which I had given an Extract) and of a Letter of your Lordſhip's No. 6, which I had communicated to the Council, and Copies of my Letters to your Lordſhip upon the Subject. The next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (June 24) I returned an Anſwer with a Copy of the 5th and 6th Paragraphs of the Letter,<note place="margin">III.</note> which concluded the whole. In my Anſwer I caution them to provide for the Tax Bill; I had a Hint given me that they intended to omit that Buſineſs, on Purpoſe to oblige me, in Caſe I diſſolved this Aſſembly, by popular Clamour and real Inconvenience, to call another Aſſembly immediately after, which I by no Means think proper, nor myſelf to be at Liberty ſo to do. I therefore thought proper to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work this Intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>SINCE the former Date I have been obliged to keep Watch upon the Proceedings of the Houſe, having been told that the very Reverſe of diſavowing the Proceedings of the late Houſe is preparing. They have been much elated within theſe 3 or 4 Days by ſome Letters they have received in Anſwer to the circular Letter. I ſhall incloſe printed Copies of what have been publiſhed in the Papers here. I am told that there is alſo a circular Letter from the Aſſembly of Virginia arrived; I had it from a Gentleman who ſaid he ſaw it at Rhode-Iſland. If it is other than the Letter from Virginia now publiſhed, they keep it ſecret here, but I ſhall ſoon have a Copy of it. I keep a Look-out in the Houſe, that if upon the Report of the Committee they ſhould move for another Congreſs (as—in his Speech ſaid, he hoped would ſoon take Place) or another circular Letter, or any Thing that contravenes his Majeſty's Requiſition, I ſhall immediately put a Stop to their Proceedings without waiting for an Anſwer in Form. For which purpoſe to bring this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Criſis as ſoon as may be, after having watched their Motions all this Morning. I put a Meſſage in the Secretary's Hands to be delivered to them this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,<note place="margin">IV.</note> as in the incloſed Copy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:011176_0017_0F862BDD275FA2B8"/>
                  <hi>July</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>On the next Day,<note place="margin">V.</note> June 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Houſe ſent me a Meſſage, deſiring me to grant them a Receſs, that they might conſult their Conſtituents reſpecting the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. I knew that ſuch an Indulgence would be liable to great Abuſe; but if I had thought it could have produced any good Effect, which I had not any Reaſon to expect, I did not think myſelf at Liberty to poſtpone the Conſideration of this important Queſtion. I therefore returned an immediate Anſwer,<note place="margin">VI.</note> that I could not conſiſtently, with my Senſe of my Duty, prorogue or adjourn the Court until I had received an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The next Morning I went early to the Council to watch the Proceedings of the Houſe, having been informed that they intended to originate an Invitation for another Congreſs: in which Caſe the Moment I got Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it, intended to Diſſolve them. The Houſe kept themſelves locked up all the Morning, the beſt Part of which was ſpent in preparing a Letter to your Lordſhip, which I am told is very lengthy; but as I have not ſeen it, and probably ſhall not be allowed a Sight of it 'till it is printed in the News-Papers, I will ſay no more of it than that I am told that it is in the old Strain, complaining that they have been miſrepreſented; though the preſent Cenſure ariſes from an Act of theirs, which they have had circulated throughout his Majeſty's Dominions. They then put the Queſtion, "Reſcind or not Reſcind," which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Negative, 91 to 17: Among the Majority were many Members who were ſcarce ever known upon any other Occaſion to vote againſt the Government-ſide of a Queſtion, ſo greatly has Infatuation and Intimidation gained ground. They then ſettled the Anſwer to be given to me, and appointed a Committee to deliver it. After this, a Motion was made to appoint a Committee to prepare an Addreſs to his Majeſty, to deſire him to remove the Governor, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point another <hi>more agreeable</hi> to the People: This was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Majority of 5, and with this ended the Buſineſs of the Morning.</p>
               <p>I had ſome Doubts with myſelf, whether I ought not to diſmiſs the Aſſembly, immediately after I knew for certain that the Houſe had paſſed a Vote againſt Reſcinding. But upon a little Recollection, I thought it beſt to wait 'till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Anſwer, as I was not obliged to take Notice of this Vote, 'till it was notified to me in Form. In this I was
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011176_0017_0F862BDD275FFA2B8"/>
influenced by a Conſideration reſpecting myſelf: The Houſe had appointed a Committee to prepare an Addreſs to get me removed: If I had diſmiſſed them in a haſty unformal Way, whilſt this Buſineſs was on the Carpet, it would have been ſaid that I was afraid of the Enquiry. Whereas this is the third Time the Faction has moved to impeach me; the two former Times they had been obliged to give it up for want of Materials; and I was ſure that they had acquired none ſince their laſt Attempt of this Kind. And this Motion ended in the ſame Manner as the two former; after having endeavoured for two Hours together in the Afternoon to cook up ſomething to found this Application on, and finding that I would not interrupt them in it, as I believe they expected and deſired that I ſhould, they were obliged to give it up themſelves.<note place="margin">VII.</note> Upon this the Anſwer which had all this while been detained, was ſent up to the Council Chamber, where I received it. Immediately after which I ſent up for the Houſe, and Prorogued the General Court, intending to Diſſolve it by Proclamation.</p>
               <p>Upon this Occaſion there happened a Fracas in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſudden and unforeſeen, but what probably will be improved by the Faction for their own Purpoſes. It ſeems that the Evening before the Council had appointed a Committee to conſider the State of the Province; which Committee had prepared an Addreſs to his Majeſty concerning the late Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be reported to the Board. I had all along declared that I ſhould diſmiſs the General Court immediately upon receiving the Anſwer from the Houſe; I knew nothing of any Buſineſs being undone, not being acquainted with this; I had ordered the Secretary to prepare for the Prorogation by laying the Acts which had paſſed that Seſſion on the Table, their Titles being to be read in the Preſence of the whole Court as has been my Uſage; and the Acts were accordingly laid in Order. Whilſt I was thus waiting to receive the Anſwer of the Houſe, the Committee of the Board introduced this Addreſs: I teſtified my Surprize upon the Occaſion, and obſerved that they could not expect to go through that Buſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at that Time. Preſently after the Committee from the Houſe attended; they were admitted and delivered their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. As ſoon as that was done, I ordered the Secretary to call up the Houſe; as ſoon as the Houſe entered, one of the Committee of the Council expoſtulated with me upon my call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Houſe whilſt the Council was proceeding on the Addreſs, and was ſo indecent as to appeal to the Houſe. I
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011176_0018_0F882BDDF4C7D7O"/>
ſilenced him: Another Gentleman interpoſed; I ſtopt him alſo, and proceeded to the Prorogation.</p>
               <p>When the Houſe was gone out of the Council Chamber, I expoſtulated with theſe Gentlemen upon the Interruption they had given me, in the Preſence of the Houſe, in executing his Majeſty's poſitive Commands. I told them that I ſhould have thought myſelf blameable, if I had ſuffered 5 Minutes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene between receiving the Anſwer and diſmiſſing the Houſe; for I ſhould have made myſelf anſwerable for all they did in the Interval. This Proceeding could not be juſtified and was really condemned by ſome other of the Council, and was in ſome Meaſure apologized for; but it will not be in the Power of the Apologizers to prevent an ill Uſe being made of it. I then informed the Council that I had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſtop any Repreſentation which they wanted to make to the King, if it was conceived in decent and reſpectful Terms, as it ſeemed to me, from hearing it read, this was. I therefore would let them introduce this into the privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and if it appeared to be inoffenſive, I would lay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty, though I ſhould not agree with them in Opinion as to all their Aſſertions, as I pointed out ſome, where I ſhould not. But this was not enough: It ſeems that when the Addreſs was paſt, there was a Petition to the Houſe of Lords, and another to the Houſe of Commons to be bro't in. I told them I could have nothing to do with them; I could not pretend to commnnicate with thoſe great Bodies; my Correſpondence went no higher than his Majeſty's Miniſters. After ſome Altercation, they ſubmitted to this, and were content with the Addreſs being brought into the privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, after it had received my Approbation. This compromiſe was very expedient to obviate the Miſrepreſentations, which this Buſineſs would otherwiſe be ſubject to.</p>
               <p>Having carried my Narrative to this Length, I muſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend my Reflections upon theſe Events unto a farther Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. I will however here obſerve that it may be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that I have not conducted this Buſineſs with Spirit; but it muſt be obſerved to what a Weakneſs this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reduced, which makes the moſt gentle Way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Buſineſs the moſt adviseable. I never intended to depart from his Majeſty's Orders in the leaſt; but upon many Accounts I thought it beſt to diſſolve by Proclamation; and ſuch Proclamation is already ſigned, and bears Date the Day after the Prorogation. It was ſaid, that it was well that I diſmiſſed them by Prorogation, and not by Diſſolution;

why, I don't know: But if any Triumph ariſes from it, it will be but ſhort-lived; for the Diſſolution will be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Papers at the ſame Time with the Prorogation.</p>

               <p>SINCE the firſt beginning of the Troubles of this Town to the preſent Time, I have frequently repreſented to your Lordſhip's Office the Impracticability of my applying for Troops, either for the Support of the Authority of the Government, or the Power of the Magiſtracy; both of which have been continually inſulted and made contemptible for near three years paſt. The great Difficulty, which has attended this Meaſure, has been, that I could by no Means get the Council to adviſe or concur in it, and neither by the due Conſideration of my Inſtructions and the Rules of other Governments, nor by the Forms of this Government, where the Governor is more connected with, and reſtrained by the Council, than in the Governments which are merely royal, did I think myſelf authorized to introduce Troops into a Town not uſed to them, upon my own Opinion only, and contrary to that of the Council, who I am directed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and adviſe with in all Matters of Importance. And I have never imagined, that it would be expected of me that I ſhould ſeperate myſelf from the Council upon this Occaſion, and make myſelf ſolely anſwerable for the Conſequences of the introducing Troops here, or the not introducing them, eſpecially as I have always underſtood that, ſince the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, the Intention of the Adminiſtration was, that all Appearance of forcible and compulſive Meaſures ſhould be avoided; and as I have conſtantly ſent Home Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of all Occurrences which could Influence this Queſtion. I have concluded that a Change of Meaſures muſt originate at Weſtminſter, and that the firſt Orders for quartering Troops at Boſton would come from thence.</p>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I treat this Subject particularly as it relates to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011176_0019_0F862BDE84D365B8"/>
the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms. In my Letter to your Lordſhip, No. 6, which gives an Account of the Riot on June 10th, and the Commiſſioners leaving the Town. I inform of what paſſed between me and the Council concerning ſending for Troops, from which it will appear to what little Purpoſe it is to put a Queſtion upon that Subject to the Council. However, this Buſineſs is now brought to ſuch a Criſis, that I could no longer avoid putting ſuch Queſtion in Form: It has become neceſſary to my own Juſtification, and acquitting me of the Conſequences, if any Bad ſhould ariſe of this Town remaining deſtitute of Troops, and to give an Account of this Tranſaction is the Buſineſs of this Letter.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of July I received a Letter from General Gage, with two Packets for Col. Dalrymple at Halifax incloſed, informing me that he had received an Account of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults at Boſton, and had ſent an Order to the Commanding Officer at Halifax for Troops, if they were wanted at Boſton. I ſent both Letters away, and wrote to General Gage, ſetting forth the Reaſons why I could not apply for Troops, but that I had ſent the Letters forward; for tho 'I thought it improper for me to require Troops, it was full as improper for me to prevent their coming if they were otherwiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. In Anſwer to this the General has ſent me a Copy of the Letter to Col. Dalrymple, by which I am informed that the Orders to him are only to collect the Troops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not to embark them till they are required by me. I have thereupon wrote to the General, that if the Troops are not to move from Halifax till I require them, they are like to continue there. For I cannot think it proper for me to make ſuch a Requiſition, without the Advice of Council, and there was no Probability of my obtaining ſuch Advice; however, I would lay it before the Council. I have been leſs explicit on theſe Letters, as I ſhall incloſe Copies of them.</p>
               <p>On Saturday July 23d I held a Council, where having in Part opened the Matters I had for their Conſideration, they adviſed, that in Regard to the Importance of the Buſineſs I would order all of the Council who lived within a Days Journey of Boſton, to be ſummoned to meet on the Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, and the Council to be adjourned till then. On Wedneſday the 27th there were fourteen met; and we proceeded to Buſineſs that Day and Friday following. As the Minutes of the Council are extended more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they will be ſufficient to explain, what was done: There
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011176_0019_0F862BDE84D365B8"/>
was ſome Altercation that was ſcarce worth remembring, but I am obliged to take Notice that I obſerved with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, that the popular Spirit upon this Occaſion ſhewed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf higher in the Council than I had known it heretofore, and my endeavouring to moderate it, ſubjected me to Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment different from what I have been uſed of late to receive from that Board. But theſe Conſiderations are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for another Time and Place.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inform General Gage of the Reſult of this Council, by which all Expectation of Troops coming to Boſton until Orders arrive from England is over. Perhaps if no great Miſchief is done in the mean Time it may be much better for them to be ordered from England than to be brought here by the Order or Requiſition of any one in America, as they will be introduced in a Manner much more authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For my Part, I have acted herein for the beſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Judgment. I could not require Troops againſt the Opinion of the Council, without making myſelf an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of popular Reſentment, which would probably, if it had produced no worſe Effects, have obliged me to quit the Government. Now, my Lord, as I have no Leave of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to juſtify my Departure, I muſt have ſtay'd till I was drove out by Force or apparent Danger. And if ſuch an Event had happened, how could I have juſtified myſelf in doing an Act with a Doubt of the Regularity of it, and a Foreſight of it's ill Conſequences, which ſhould produce ſuch a Convulſion in the State as obliging a Governor to quit his Poſt?</p>

It ſeemed to be the general Opinion, that it was quite Impracticable for them to return, and be protected in the Execution of their Office.

               <head>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Hillſborough, dated Boſton, 9th July, 1768.</head>
               <p>I Gave your Lordſhip a full account of the iſſue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings upon His Majeſty's requiſition, together with Copies of all Papers relating thereto. I ſent the original by a returned Expreſs to General Gage, to be forwarded by the Packet. The Duplicates I put into the hands of Capt. Smith, of the Brig—, which ſailed laſt Monday for Glaſgow. As there are other Ships now preparing to ſail, I ſhall incloſe ſome printed Copies of the Papers from the News-Papers, ſome of which may come to your Lordſhip's hands before either of my Letters. From theſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will ſee that I diſmiſſed the General Court by Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Diſſolved them the next Day by Proclamation. This form of Proceeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' immaterial in the Effect, made this Buſineſs paſs more eaſily than I expected.</p>
               <p>The Sons of Liberty keep up their Spirits ſtill: on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Evening laſt paſt, a number of them between 50 and 60, went out of Boſton at the cloſe of the Day, and having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves into two Parties, met on each ſide of an Houſe in Roxbury, about three Miles from Boſton, which Mr. Robinſon, one of the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms has lately hired, with an intention, as is ſuppoſed from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noevre they practiced, to ſurprize him there and prevent his eſcape. But he being at the Caſtle, where he had reſided ſince the Commiſſioners have been driven thither for ſafety, they did nothing but plunder his Fruit Trees, and break off the Branches thereof, and break down ſome of the Fences, and trample down the Garden, and did not, that I can learn, break into the Houſe. After this, about Midnight, they went back to Boſton in a Body huzzaing all the Way. This is called a Frolick of a few Boys to Eat ſome Cherries.</p>
               <p>Laſt Night about 30 Men came on Board a Schooner ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Wharf, which had been ſeized for having Thirty Hogſheads of uncuſtomed Molaſſes on Board, and was then in the Cuſtody of two Cuſtom-Houſe Officers, and having confined the two Officers to the Cabbin, carried off all the Molaſſes. When the Sloop was ſeized which occaſioned the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011176_0020_0F862BDFC9136128"/>
Riot in which the Cuſtom-houſe Officers were ill treated, &amp; in Conſequence of which the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms were obliged to leave the Town, the greateſt part of the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was expreſſed againſt carrying the Sloop from the Wharf and putting her under the Care of the Man of War. This, they ſaid, was an affront to the Town, as it contained an inſinuation that the Sloop would not have been ſafe if it had been left at the Wharf in the Cuſtody of a Cuſtom-Houſe Officer. Therefore when this Schooner was ſeized, it was left at the Wharf under no other guard but 2 Cuſtom-Houſe Officers. It would have been very eaſily ſecured by laying it in the Stream, and putting a Guard on Board, either from the Romney or the Caſtle; but I ſuppoſe it was tho't beſt to try the Experiment. As every Seizure made or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be made on Land at Boſton, for three Years paſt, before theſe two Inſtances, has been violently reſcued or prevented, it was eaſy to ſee what would be the Event of this, and I foretold it was certain. However, the Experiment has been made.</p>
               <p>I have not received any Requeſt from the Commiſſioners upon this Occaſion, nor do I expect it: for they know I can do nothing. Your Lordſhip has obſerved in my Letters No. 5 &amp; 6, that I conſulted the Council upon the great Riot on June 10th, and after having, upon repeated Adjournments, endeavoured to bring them to ſome Reſolution, the whole Buſineſs was avoided by referring it to the General Court. After this a Committee of both Houſes was appointed under the ſpecious Title "To take the State of the Province into Conſideration," when after ſeveral Meetings, as the two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had different Purpoſes to ſerve, they could come to no Concluſion. And ſo this Matter reſts: And I have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to revive it again; as, in the preſent State of Things, the Advice of the Council will be timid, and the Executive Power of the Governor is perfectly impotent.</p>
               <p>In Regard to the Anſwer of the Houſe, ſo far as it relates to me, I will make but one Obſervation upon it: It is Felo de ſe of its own Purport; it pretends to be the Voice of the People, and gives Evidence itſelf that is the Voice of a Faction. It charges the Governor with miſrepreſenting the Generality of the People, by aſſerting that the blameable Conduct of the Houſe is to be imputed to a Faction prevailing there, and not to the People in general. Now if this is not true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the Injury the Governor has done the People, is by ſetting them in a more favourable Light than they deſerved
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011176_0021_0F862BDFE7E0CD20"/>
and therefore if the People wore to take Notice of it, there would be no Occaſion for Paſſion or Reſentment. But it is otherwiſe with the Faction: if they are charged with more than belongs to them, it is natural that they ſhould reſent it: and therefore Paſſion, Malice and Abuſe become them, and are ſuitable to their Character and the Occaſion. From this Criterion, one may ſafely pronounce that this Anſwer is the violent Overflowing of a Faction, and not the cool Voice of a People. And yet my Lord, I do not intend to give up my Opinion of the Faction or the People, notwithſtanding the high Pitch to which the Wickedneſs of the former has raiſed the Inflamation and Infatuation of a great Part of the latter.</p>
               <p>I have been under ſome Concern for the Safety of the Caſtle ſince the Commiſſioners retired thither, not upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any Intelligence I had of an Intention to attack it, (for that at moſt amounted but to idle Rumours) as from a Conſideration of the Weakneſs of the Garriſon, and the Eaſe with which it might be ſurprized. But I am relieved in this by the Care of Commodore Hood, who has ſo well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied us with Naval Force, that there are now about the Caſtle one Fifty Gun Ship, two Sloops of 16 Guns, and two Cutters armed with Swivel Guns; ſo that I am under no Concern for that Place. Beſides I have lately received by Expreſs from General Gage ſome Diſpatches for Colonel Dalrymple at Halifax, which I forwarded by one of the King's Cutters, and I am miſtaken if there is not among them an Order for at leaſt one Regiment to come here; altho' General Gage, who knows my Situation, where Death is publickly denounced againſt thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in bringing Troops here, is ſo kind as to conceal the Contents of the Diſpatches from Me. One Regiment will ſecure the Caſtle, but will not be ſufficient to awe the Town. This very Morning the Select Men of the Town ordered the Magazine of Arms belonging to the Town to be brought out to be cleaned, when they were expoſed for ſome Hours at the Town-Houſe. They were expoſtulated with for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent act; they excuſed themſelves by ſaying, that thoſe Arms were ordered to be cleaned <hi>two</hi> Months ago. I have been much preſſed to go to the Caſtle, when Troops ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive here. I do not chooſe to ſhew a want of Reſolution as I don't feel the firmneſs of my Mind to fail, but I ſhall not unneceſſarily expoſe myſelf to Danger where I can foreſee it.

               <p>I FIND myſelf obliged to add a Supplement to my Letter No. 10. which I ſent away To-day, by a Brig for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool, the Duplicate whereof will be incloſed with this. I had there informed your Lordſhip that 30 Hogſheads of Molaſſes which had been ſeized for illicit Trade, together with the Schooner it was in, had been taken from thence out of the Cuſtody of the Cuſtom-houſe Officers who had the Care of it. This very Molaſſes was on the next Day return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put on Board the Schooner again. The Account I have of this Affair is this: The People of the Town were diſſatisfied, that the Aſſurances which they had made, that the Sloop which had been ſeized before this, and put in the Cuſtody of the Man of War, would have been ſafe if ſhe had been left at the Wharf in the Care of a Cuſtom-Houſe Officer, ſhould be ſo ſoon falſified. The Selectmen of the Town therefore ſent for the Maſter of this Schooner, and upon his denying that he knew any Thing of the Molaſſes, told him that would not paſs: For Nobody would take away his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes without his Privity; they thereupon ordered him to return the Molaſſes directly, under Pain of the Diſpleaſure of the Town; which was immediately done. I dare ſay, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cuſtom-houſe Officers, nor the Judge of the Admiralty, nor the Chief Juſtice, nor the Governor, could have prevailed upon any one to run the Riſk of informing where this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes was conveyed, or to aſſiſt in recovering it, if it had been againſt the Houmour of the People. But to ſerve a Purpoſe of the People, the Select-Men in a ſummary Way can do this Buſineſs in a Trice. So we are not without a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only it is in the Hands of the People of the Town, and not of thoſe deputed by the King or under his Authority.</p>

               <p>BY My Letter, No. 9, I informed your Lordſhip that at the Time I diſmiſſed the Aſſembly, the Council was beginning to proceed upon a Petition to his Majeſty, which Proceeding was interrupted by the Prorogation of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that to take away all Pretence to charge me with intending to ſtop any Repreſentation which they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make to the King, I gave them Leave to proceed in this Buſineſs in the privy Council; and if the Petition was conceived in decent and reſpectful Terms, I promiſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame to be laid before his Majeſty, altho' I ſhould not entirely agree with them upon the Subject-Matter.</p>
               <p>I have now the Honour to tranſmit the Petition incloſed to your Lordſhip, and deſire the favour that you would be pleaſed to lay the ſame before His Majeſty for His moſt gracious Conſideration. I am not a Party in it, nor could I think it proper that I ſhould be: and therefore this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is not quite regular in Point of Form. But your Lordſhip will conſider the Circumſtances before-mentioned, that it originated in the Legiſlative Council, altho' it was not compleated there, and will receive it as an Act of that Body to which the Concurrence of the Governor is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>

I have been always tender in expreſſing my Diſapprobation of Acts of Parliament, and was ſo eſpecially in a Caſe where I thought the Act had better have been ſpared. But I can readily recommend that Part of the Petition which prays Relief againſt ſuch Acts as are made for the Purpoſe of drawing a Revenue from the Colonies. For they are ſo little able to bear the drawing

               <p>I HAVE now an Opportunity of ſending your Lordſhip a printed Copy of the Letter of the Houſe to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the Diſpute concerning publiſhing it having only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed it for a Week. As it is profeſſedly intended for the People more than for your Lordſhip, ſo it is accompanied with Comments much more calculated to prepare the People to reſent the Diſallowance of their Pretenſions than to induce your Lordſhip to endeavour to procure an Allowance of them.</p>
               <p>I never ſaw this Letter 'till it was in print: I find nothing in it that requires my Anſwer. I am abuſed upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of my having miſrepreſented them in the Buſineſs of the circular Letter: I have looked over my Letters upon this Subject, and find nothing in them which is not admitted in the Letter to your Lordſhip. I never ſaid that there was a thiner Houſe when the Circular Letter paſſed than when it was rejected. I ſaid that the Way was prepared for this ſecond Vote by tampering with &amp; influencing Particulars; this was as notorious as that there was a Houſe. There was another Reaſon for this contradictory Vote, which I did not aſſign, that although the Number of the Houſe was the ſame, yet it conſiſted of many different Perſons, which as the Number was leſs than two Thirds of the whole, and there was a Fortnight intervening between the two Votes, may be eaſily conceived. The higheſt Charge againſt them, the eraſing the Journals of the Houſe to ſerve this Purpoſe, they admit: this ſurely is a very <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>juſtifiable Proceeding.</p>
               <p>The general Charge againſt me for Miſrepreſenting them is falſe, and has not been ſupported by any one Inſtance. It has been my Miſfortune to be Governor of this Province during a Time, when the moſt favourable Repreſentation of the Proceedings of the Aſſemblies, and the Doings of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011176_0023_0F862BE168203780"/>
the People muſt occaſion his Majeſty's Diſpleaſure. Before this Time I ſcarce ever met the Aſſembly without receiving from them Teſtimonials of their Approbation of my Conduct. For theſe three Years paſt it has been impoſſible to reconcile the Duty of the Governor with pleaſing the People; and it would have been ſo, if a Man of greater Ability than I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, had been in my Place. Nothing leſs than a general Sacrifice of the Rights of the Sovereign State can make a Governor popular in this Place at this Time.</p>
               <p>I ſhall continue writing to your Lordſhip until I have communicated all I think neceſſary for your Lordſhip's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. When that will be, God knows. My Ideas are become too numerous and extenſive for writing, and are fitter for a Conferrence than a Series of Letters. My Letter, as intended upon the Subject of calling another Aſſembly, will be lengthy, comprehenſive and important, but it does not require Haſte as yet. The News-Papers which I incloſe contain a Variety of Sedition and Calumny, beſides that which the Letter diſpenſes.</p>

               <p>THE dangerous State which this Government is in, makes it neceſſary for me to acquaint your Lordſhip of every little Diſturbance which happens here, as one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not foreſee the Tendency of any of the Movements of the Sons of Liberty, and muſt expect the worſt Conſequences from each of them.</p>
               <p>I ſent your Lordſhip a Copy of a Paper ſtuck up in the Town Houſe, inviting the Sons of Liberty upon Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams (one of the Inſpectors of the Cuſtoms) his return to Town, to make him reſign his Office or quit the Town. Mr. Williams returned from the Circuit about the Middle of laſt Week. On Friday laſt an Attack upon his Houſe was planned: and to effect it, according to a preconcerted ſignal, they rung the Fire-Bells, and cried out Fire; and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the People to Mr. Williams's Houſe, a Mob ſoon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled there, and began to break into the Court-Yard; Mr. Williams kept in the Houſe upon the Defenſive with
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011176_0023_0F862BE168203780"/>
Fire Arms, and afterwards went into the Court and there parlied with them. The Mob demanded that he ſhould meet them at Liberty-Tree the next Day at Noon and there reſign his Commiſſion: He refuſed to do either; but ſaid he would be upon 'Change next Day at Noon, and would there be ready to give an Anſwer to any Thing that ſhould be Objected to him. By this Time ſome of the Magiſtrates and other Gentlemen of the Town had got to the Place, and they perſuaded the Mob to accept of the Offer and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe.</p>
               <p>The next Day Mr. Williams attended by ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, among whom were ſome of the Council; went about Noon into the Council-Chamber. There were about 1500 People aſſembled about the Town Houſe: Mr. Williams went into the Balcony of the Council-Chamber, and told the People he was come according to his Promiſe, to Anſwer any Objections which were urged againſt him. Nothing was offered: after a Quarter of an Hour's interval, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his Propoſal again; nothing was ſaid except by an Ignorant Fellow, whoſe Abſurdity created laughter. After a little Stay, they all departed in ſeeming good Humour, and Mr. Williams returned to his Houſe, accompanied by the Gentlemen who had attended him, in Peace and Quiet.</p>
               <p>This tranſaction has flung great Diſgrace upon, and given great Chagrin to the Faction; and I am told they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to retrieve it.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, the directors of the Mob, durſt not ſhew their Faces at this Place, and upon this Occaſion, left they ſhould thereby acknowledge that they had ſpirited them up to the laſt Night's Work. They now gloſs it over by giving out that the Mob of that Night were not the true Sons of Liberty, and acted without Authority, and an Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is publiſhed in the Boſton-Gazette, ſigned by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Secretary of the Sons of Liberty, diſclaiming the requiring Mr. Williams to appear upon Change, and threatning the Printer who ſhould make Uſe of the Name of the Sons of Liberty, <hi>without an authentic Order.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be done and ſoon to recover the Spirit of the Sons of Liberty. I am told that ſome of the Chiefs of them are this Day to go to Mr. Williams and adviſe him as a Friend if he will not reſign his Commiſſion, to retire to the Caſtle; if he does not his Houſe will be deſtroyed, and himſelf killed. What will be the End of this we muſt wait to know.</p>

               <p>Since I wrote the foregoing, I have ſeen Mr. Williams. He confirms this Account, and adds that the Mob expreſſed great diſſatisfaction that thoſe who ſet them on did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to talk for them. Several of the Mob, and particularly the Captain, a noted Mob leader have declared their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Mr. Williams's Conduct, and that they will defend him againſt any other Attack. On the other Hand great Pains are taken to drive him out by intimidation: private Letters have been ſent to him; without a Name; and one of the Chiefs of the Faction declared publickly againſt his fool hardineſs in ſtaying in this Town, But Mr. Williams declares he will not go out of the Town, unleſs he is drove out by Force. He tells me he fears no Danger: And I am inclined to think he will ſucceed in his Defiance of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their Tools. If he does he may do good Service in leſſening the Terror which the Troops of the Faction have occaſioned here.</p>

               <p>YOUR Lordſhip will obſerve from my Letter No. 9, and its Incloſures, that I ſignified to the Houſe that, if I ſhould be obliged to diſſolve the Aſſembly, I ſhould not think myſelf at Liberty to call another until I received His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Orders; therefore I was aſked in Council, whether I had received a ſpecial Order for that Purpoſe, or whether I drew it by Implication from any Part of your Lordſhip's Letter: I anſwered that I drew it from two Paſſages in your Lordſhip's Letter; Firſt, I am ordered if I diſſolve the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſend an Account of their Proceedings, that his Majeſty may lay the ſame before his Parliament, to prevent ſuch Conduct for the future. Now if I was to call another Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011176_0024_0F862BE22B614150"/>
without Order, it might not be in the Power of the King, or the Parliament, to prevent ſuch Conduct for the future; for it would probably be repealed before any Proviſion could be made againſt it. 2dly. Your Lordſhip ſignifies to me that if the Diſſolution ſhould operate to the Diſcontinuance of any neceſſary Eſtabliſhments, Care will be taken for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Government.—By this it is plain, that your Lordſhip does not expect, that I ſhould call a new Aſſembly; for in ſuch Caſe your Lordſhip would have directed me to call upon the new Aſſembly to renew the diſcontinued Eſtabliſhments.</p>
               <p>But if your Lordſhip's Intention had not appeared ſo plain, my own Diſcretion would have directed me, not to have called another Aſſembly ſoon after the Diſſolution of the former.—Such a Proceeding has ſcarce ever ſailed to produce bad Conſequences; in the preſent Caſe it would have the worſt. The chief Alteration in the Houſe would be in the Excluſion of thoſe few Members, or a great Part of them who, in the late Queſtion, dared to ſide with the King, and have ſince been held up in the public Papers, as Objects of the Reſentment of the People. It were to be wiſhed, that a new Aſſembly might not be called untill the People had got into a better Temper, and had gained truer Notions of their Rights and Intereſt, than they have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: When that Time will come, God knows; it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend more upon what is done at Weſtminſter, than upon any Meaſures that can be purſued here. I can therefore only ſtate to your Lordſhip, the Inconveniencies which will attend the not calling the Aſſembly, until the next General Election, and wait your Lordſhip's Orders.</p>
               <p>The uſual Time for the Aſſembly's Meeting for the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seſſion, has of late been about the Middle of January.—The Seſſion has uſually laſted about two Months; great Part of which has been lately ſpent in political Squabbles, rather than in real Buſineſs. The ordinary Buſineſs of this Seſſion has been to elect Officers, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Treaſurer, Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Impoſt-Officer, and ſome leſſer of no great Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance, to grant Salaries to the Judges, and other Officers, and to the Preſident and Profeſſors of the College, &amp;c. and to paſs the Act of Tonnage and Impoſt. The Election of Officers may be poſtponed; for in ſuch Caſe, they would continue in their Offices by their former Appointment; and the Election is nothing more but the Continuance of the ſame Officers. The Grants of Salaries may be poſtponed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Inconvenience than a Delay of Payment for
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011176_0025_0F862BE2E6A68418"/>
about three Months. The not renewing the Impoſt-Bill, would, I believe diſcontinue that Revenue for about two Months, but I can't be certain of it, as I have not the Bill by me. Theſe are the principal ordinary Inconveniencies which would ariſe from the not calling another Aſſembly before next May; they muſt be balanced by the Advantages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Suſpenſion; and the whole will be governed by the Meaſures which are taken for the Reſtoration of the Government. And I muſt beg your Lordſhip's Favor, that I may receive Orders, whether I am, or am not, to call the Aſſembly; for when the uſual Time ſhall come, it will be quite neceſſary, that the Governor ſhould be able to vouch poſitive Orders for his not calling the Aſſembly, if he is not to do it.—In Regard to the calling the new Aſſembly in May, it will require much Conſideration; but there is Time eno' for that as yet.</p>
               <p>There is another Matter for Conſideration in calling a new Aſſembly, which I cannot overlook, becauſe it is a common Subject of Reflection; and yet I muſt own I dare not give my Advice in it with that Freedom, with which I could wiſh to act in all publick Buſineſs; it is, whether, when a new Aſſembly is called, it ought to meet at Boſton, or at ſome other Town. People imagine, that the principal Part, which Boſton (diſtinguiſhed from other Towns) has taken in raiſing and ſomenting the preſent Troubles of the Province and the Continent, will probably incur, and deſerve the Cenſure of having the Government removed from it; others ſay, that, if Boſton is ſubjected, and brought into order, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which the Government now feels, by being ſeated there, would be removed. For my own part, I could ſpeak upon this Subject, where I could explain myſelf occaſionally, but I know not how to write upon it; all that I can now ſay is, that, if the prevailing Faction ſhould be effectually checked, and the terror of the Mobs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it might be better to keep the Government here; but undoubtedly, for theſe three Years laſt. Government has ſuffered very much by its being ſeated here. There are no two Towns on the Continent more contraſted, in regard to Reſpect, and Duty to the King's Government both at Home and here, than Boſton and (the ſecond Town in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince) Salem.—And yet I could not recommend the removing the Government to Salem, otherwiſe than as a temporary Cenſure; but this is a ſubject too delicate for public letters.</p>
               <p>Having gone thus far, I find a great Deficiency from the want of a proper Repreſentation of the preſent State of this
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011176_0025_0F862BE2E6A68418"/>
Government, which is brought ſo low, that it can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover itſelf by any internal Means, without a Sacrifice of the Rights of the imperial Power: This is a nice Taſk, and I wiſh I could do it in Perſon, if I cannot, I ſhall have much Difficulty to repreſent it in Writing, and will overcome it as well as I can.</p>

               <p>I THINK it proper to inform your Lordſhip, that for above a Week paſt there has been agitated among the Merchants of this Town a Subſcription againſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Engliſh Goods.—It was begun by two principal Merchants who have all along abetted the Purpoſes of the Faction; at firſt they met with very little Succeſs, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in it, and Ways and Means being uſed to puſh it on, it was laſt Night reported at their third Meeting, that there was a ſufficient Number of Subſcribers to carry the Matter into Execution, that there were forty who would not ſubſcribe, but would obſerve the Reſtriction, and thirty five who would neither ſubſcribe nor obſerve. The latter I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are to be brought to Reaſon by Mob-Law, otherwiſe thirty five Importers only, will defeat the Scheme.</p>
               <p>There was the like Subſcription ſet about at the beginning of March laſt, of which I gave an Account in my Letter to my Lord Shelburne, No. 9. That was defeated by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Philadelphia refuſing to concur in the Meaſure, and the Merchants of New-York thereupon declining it alſo, upon which thoſe of Boſton were obliged to give it up: but now I ſuppoſe they aſſure themſelves of better Succeſs at thoſe Places, and expect to raiſe a Combination formidable enough to alarm Great-Britain, at the Meeting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. But, my Lord, the Futility of this Threat will be expoſed by an Enquiry into the Quantity of Goods which have been lately ordered from Great-Britain, which has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011176_0026_0F862B3F5C2BDB8"/>
and anticipated the uſual Quantities and Times in Order to provide for an Abſtinence from Importation for a Year: This is profeſſed by ſome, and is undoubtedly true of others, who are too attentive to their own Intereſt to deſiſt from Importation without taking Care not to have Occaſion for it. But the Non-ſubſcribers, among which are ſome of the principal Importers of the Town, will effectually defeat this Scheme, if they are ſufficiently ſecured from Mobs, which it is ſuppoſed they and all others will be before the firſt of January next.</p>

Weeks, is not yet come here; by it I expect to receive the Original of No. 10.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip's Obſervation of the Intention of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to defeat all conciliating Meaſures, will be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, if it is not a ready. Their Influence over the Courts of Juſtice, eſpecially at Boſton, is carried to an enormous Length, of which there has been lately a moſt extraordinary Inſtance. On Monday Auguſt 22d, being the Day before the ſitting of the Superior Court, there came out in the Boſton-Gazette a moſt virulent Libel againſt the Chief Juſtice, in which he was threatned, that if he gave any more ſuch Charges as at the former Seſſion, his private Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſhould be expoſed in that Paper, by which he is to be rendered odious to the People. The next Day when the Court was opened the Grand Jury was found to have among them ſeveral of the Abettors of the Boſton Mobs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the famous is Capt. Malcolm, who having twice in a forcible Manner ſet the Laws of Trade at Defiance with Succeſs, has thereby raiſed himſelf to be a Mob Captain; and was actually the raiſer of the Mob which abuſed the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers on the 10th of June laſt. This Man was tho't a fit Perſon to be upon a Grand Jury before whom his own Riots were to be enquired into. To account for this your Lordſhip muſt know that in this Government, Juries, both, Grand and Petty, are not returned by and at the Election of the Sheriff, but by the Appointment of the ſeveral Towns and returned by the Conſtables.</p>
               <p>This being the Caſe, it was to no Purpoſe for the Chief Juſtice to enter into Particulars concerning the late Riots: He therefore made his Charge general, except only vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from an infamous Lie publiſhed in the Boſton-Gazette, aſſerting that he had received a Commiſſion from England appointing him Chief Juſtice. The Attorney-General had been ordered by me with the Advice of Council to proſecute the Rioters on the 10th of June. But when he came to lay it before the Grand Jury, no Evidence could be procured againſt any one Man. There had been 2 or 300 People who paraded and did great part of the Miſchief in the public Streets in the Day time; and yet no Man could be found who dared to Charge any of them, And it is no wonder whilſt the Head of the Mob ſat upon the Grand Jury ready to Mark thoſe who ſhould teſtify againſt his Mob, And I ſuppoſe the Attorney-General was not very earneſt in endeavouring to procure Evidence; as he muſt
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011176_0027_0F862BE46647FFB8"/>
ſee that before ſuch a Grand Jury there was no Probabilty of getting a Bill found.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry my Lord, that I cannot continue to give the Council that Credit, which I have done in former Letters, immediately after the Vote in the Houſe for not Reſcinding, &amp;c. The Council ſuffered ſo great a change that they don't appear to be the ſame Perſons. And I can no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, for that aſſiſtance, which I have been uſed to expect and often to receive of them, in ſupport of the Rights of the Crown. They ſeem to have caught the general Intimidation, to look upon the Cauſe of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be deſperate, and to think that it is high Time that they ſhould take Care of their Intereſts with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Party of the People. And yet I am convinced that theſe Gentlemen or the greateſt part of them are in their Hearts Friends to Government, and would chooſe to be numbered among them, if they were Independent of the People. But it is a <hi>melancholick</hi> Truth, that this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after a three Years War is <hi>a</hi> Length ſubdued, and in my Opinion will never recover itſelf, until ſome Amendment is made in the Conſtitution, eſpecially in the Appointment and Stability of the Council. I ſhall not produce Inſtances in ſupport of theſe aſſertions now, they will be fully explained hereafter.</p>

               <p>IN the Boſton Gazette of the 5th Inſtant, appeared a Paper, containing a Syſtem of Politicks, exceeding all former Exceedings. Some took it for the caſual Eaiſings of an occaſional Enthuſiaſt. But I perſuaded myſelf it came out of the Cabinet of the Faction, and was preparatory to ſome actual Operations againſt the Government. In this Verſwaſion I conſidered that if the Troops from Halifax were to come here of a ſudden, there would be no avoiding an Inſurrection, which would at leaſt fall upon the Crown Officers, if it did not amount to an Oppoſition to the Troops. I therefore thought it would be beſt that the Expectation of the Troops ſhould be gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally communicated, that the Heads, of the Faction might have Time to conſider well what they were about, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Men Opportunity to interpoſe their Advice. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011176_0027_0F862BE46617FFB8"/>
took an Occaſion to mention to one of the Council, in the Way of Diſcourſe, that I had private Advice that Troops were ordered hither, but I had no public Orders about it myſelf. This was on the 8th Inſtant, and before Night it was thoroughly circulated all over the Town.</p>
               <p>The Faction immediately took the Alarm; and at firſt nothing was to be heard among them but Declarations that the Troops ſhould not enter the Town. But nothing was done in Public, but appointing a Town-Meeting on Monday following. In private there were, as I am told two Meetings, the one a large one on Friday Night (the 9th) where it was the general Opinion that they ſhould raiſe the Country, and oppoſe the Troops. The other Meeting as I am informed, was very ſmall and private on Saturday Night at the Houſe of one of the Chiefs, and there it was reſolved to ſurprize and take the Caſtle on the Monday Night following. I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late theſe Accounts as certain Facts, but only as reported and believed. On Saturday Night an empty Turpentine Barrel was put up upon the Poll of the Beacon (which had been lately erected anew in a great Hurry by the Select Men without conſulting me). This gave a great Alarm the next Day, and the Council ſent to me on Sunday Afternoon to deſire I would order a Council, which I held at a Gentleman's Houſe half Way between me and Boſton. Here it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated what Means ſhould be uſed to take the Barrel down; and it was reſolved that the Selectmen ſhould be deſired to take it down, but they would not do it.</p>
               <p>On the Monday at the Hall the Faction appeared ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all its Forces. There were very few of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Gentlemen there; ſuch as were, appeared only as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and perhaps anxious Spectators; the Meeting was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with Speeches much to the ſame Purpoſe as the Paper encloſed and firſt mentioned. Nothing was then reſolved but to put two Queſtions to me, which your Lordſhip will ſee in the printed Account; and to appoint a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to conſider and report. The next Day the Reports were made, upon which followed a Set of Speeches by the Chiefs of the Faction and no one elſe; which followed one another in ſuch Order, and Method, that it appeared us if they were acting a Play, every Thing both as to Matter and Order, ſeeming to have been preconcerted before hand. As they have printed their own Account to circulate it round the Province, I ſhall only add to it, an Account of ſome of theſe Speeches, from the Tenor of which the general Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Tranſaction will be fully explained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:011176_0028_0F862BE750900D20"/>
I ſhould have mentioned before, that in the Middle of the Hall where they met, were depoſited in Cheſts the Town-Arms, amounting as it is ſaid to about 400. Theſe as I have before informed your Lordſhip, about 4 or 5 Months ago, were taken out of the Lumber Rooms, where they had lain for ſome Years paſt, to be cleaned; and have ſince been laid upon the Floor of the Town-Hall to remind the People of the Uſe of them. Theſe Arms were often the ſubject of diſcourſe, and were of ſingular Uſe to the Orators in the way of Action. As the ſubject of their Debates turned upon Arming the Town and Country againſt <hi>their Enemies,</hi> the Probability of a French War was mentioned as a Pretence for Arming the Town, and a Cover for the frequent Uſe of the Word <hi>Enemy.</hi> It was ſaid that the <hi>Enemy</hi> would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be here before the Convention met, that is within ten Days; it was moved that the Arms ſhould be now delivered out to oppoſe the <hi>Enemy;</hi> this was objected to, for that they might fall into Hands, who would not uſe them. But this flimſy Veil was not always kept on; it was often ſaid, that they had a Right to oppoſe with Arms a Military Force, which was ſent to oblige them to ſubmit to unconſtitutional Laws, and when it was required to be more explicit, the Chairman ſaid, that they underſtood one another very well, and pointing with his Hand, added there are the Arms; when an Attempt is made againſt your Liberties, they will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, our Declaration wants no Explication! And indeed it does not.</p>
               <p>When firſt it was moved that the Governor be deſired to call an Aſſembly, it was ſaid to be to provide for the Safety of the Province, and put it in a Poſture of Defence: It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, obſerved that that would make Troops neceſſary, and it was immediately ſtruck out: One cried out that they wanted a Head; this was over-ruled, for indeed it was too premature. Another an old Man, proteſted againſt every Thing but riſing immediately, and taking all Power into their own Hands. One Man very profligate and abandoned, argued for Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacring their Enemies, his Argument was ſhort,—Liberty is as precious as Life; if a Man attempts to take my Life, I have a Right to take his. Ergo, If a Man attempts to take away my Liberty, I have a Right to take his Life. He alſo argued that when a People's Liberties were threatened, they were in a State of War, and had a Right to deſend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And he carried theſe Arguments ſo far, that his own Party were obliged to ſilence him.</p>

                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:011176_0028_0F862BE750900D20"/>
I will now make one Obſervation on one Paſſage in the printed Declaration, to ſhew to what Length is capable of being carried, a Pretenſion to an Exemption from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Great-Britain. It has been heretofore argued that the Parliament has no Authority over the American Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, becauſe they are not repreſented in the Parliament of Great-Britain; and in Conſequence that the provincial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are to all Intents and Purpoſes the Parliament in Regard to the Subjects of the reſpective Colonies. This has been heretofore applied only to the raiſing and diſpoſing of public Money, and now obſerve a large Stride to a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Buſineſs, becauſe it is declared in an Act of the firſt of William and Mary, that no Standing Army ſhall be kept up in the Kingdom in Time of Peace but by Conſent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, therefore the King ſhall not keep any Part of the Standing Army raiſed and ſupported by the Parliament in any American Province without the Conſent of the Provincial Aſſembly. And this Exemption is pleaded in Virtue of a Charter granted by King William, &amp;c. without the Authority of Parliament, and conſequently according to true Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Principles not to be pleaded againſt the Parliament, as according to ſuch Principles the King has no Power by his own Act only, to exempt any Subjects of Great-Britain from the Authority of Parliament.</p>
               <p>I herewith incloſe a Blank Copy of the Precept which the Selectmen of Boſton have uſed in calling together the Convention: Surely ſo daring an Aſſumption of the Royal Authority was never practiced by any City or Town in the Britiſh Dominions, even in the Times of greateſt Diſorder; not even by the City of London, when the great Rebellion was at the higheſt, and the Confuſion ariſing from thence moſt urgent for ſome extraordinary Meaſures. How large this Meeting will be, and what they will do, at preſent can only be gueſt at. But as they have hitherto purſued the Dictates of the Paper in the Boſton-Gazette, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they will go through with them, and exclude <hi>the Crown Officers,</hi> and reſume <hi>the firſt original Charter,</hi> which has no Ingredient of Royalty in it. It certainly will be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it is not prevented by Power from without: And I much doubt whether the Force already ordered by General Gage, <abbr>viz.</abbr> two Regiments, will be ſufficient. For my own Part, if I had any Place of Protection to reſort to, I would publiſh a Proclamation againſt the aſſembling the Convention. But I dare not take ſo ſpirited a Step without firſt ſecuring my Retreat.</p>

It is now a great Queſtion whether the King's Troops will be ſuffered to enter the Town or not: the general Opinion is in the Affirmative. The Deſign againſt the Caſtle is now ſo well known that it is probable that the very Names of the People who were enrolled for that Service to the Number of 500, or of the Chief of them will be diſcovered. The Chiefs of the Party now own that it will be impoſſible for them to hold the Caſtle or the Town, tho' they ſhould ſeize and Garriſon them for the preſent. They therefore, at leaſt ſome of them, ſeem content that the Troops ſhall ſtay here, till the Parliament has determined upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances; as they ſay the Troops cannot remain here for two Years, if the Parliament refuſes to do them Juſtice.</p>

               <p>UPON the Receipt of your Lordſhip's Letter No. 16. I ordered a Council to be called on the Morning of Monday laſt; at which Time I communicated the two firſt Paragraphs of your Lordſhip's Letter, and alſo a Letter from General Gage to me, wherein he writes, that, in Obedience to His Majeſty's Commands, he had ordered two Regiments from Halifax to Boſton, the one to be quartered at Boſton, the other at Caſtle William, and deſiring that Quarters might be provided for them.—The Council inſtantly reſorted to the Act of Parliament, and there it was read, that if there were no Barracks, the Troops ſhould be quartered in the Public Houſes, and if they were not ſufficient; then the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council, or in their Default, the Juſtices of Peace ſhould hire Barns, Out-Houſes, &amp;c. for them. They therefore ſaid, that as there were no Barracks, they had nothing to do with it; for it was the Buſineſs of the Conſtables to billet them in the Publick Houſes, and the Council had nothing to do till the Public Houſes were full. I anſwered, that they muſt be ſenſible, that this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (which ſeemed to be made only with a view to marching Troops) could not be carried into Execution in this Caſe; for if theſe Troops were to be quartered in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011176_0029_0F862BE8923DC8D8"/>
Houſes, and thereby mixt with the People, their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would be a perpetual Source of Affrays and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheds; and I was ſure, that no Commanding Officer would Conſent to having his Troops ſeparated into ſmall Parties in a Town, where there was ſo public and profeſſed a diſſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to His Majeſty's Britiſh Government; and as to hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Barns, Out-Houſes, &amp;c. it was mere trifling to apply that Clauſe to Winter Quarters in this Country, where the Men could not live but in Buildings with tight Walls and plenty of Fire Places; therefore the only Thing to be done was to provide Barracks, and to ſay, that there were none, was only true, that there was no Building built for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but there were many public Buildings, that might be fitted up for that purpoſe with no great Inconvenience. At laſt what I ſaid produced a Committee of Council, to confer with the Select-Men about providing Quarters for the Troops; and the Council was adjourned.</p>
               <p>I had no Opinion of this Reference, but could not avoid conſenting to it.—I conſidered that the Select-Men were the Tools of the Faction, and the Deſign of the latter was to embarraſs the Buſineſs of providing Quarters, ſo as to oblige the Officers to make good their own Quarters, and from thence, to ground an Inſurrection of the People againſt the Invaders of their Property.—I was told 2 or 3 Days before this Council met that—explained the plan at the Town-Meeting, (or at ſome other Meeting about the ſame Time, I forget which) in the following Manner. "There are no Barracks in the Town, and therefore by Act of Parliament they muſt be quartered in the public Houſes; but no one will keep a public Houſe on ſuch Terms, and there will be no public Houſes; then the Governor and Council muſt hire Barns, Out-Houſes, &amp;c. for them; but no Body is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to let them, no Body will let them, no Body will dare to let them. The Troops are forbid to quarter themſelves in any other Manner than according to the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under ſevere Penalties; but they can't quarter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to the Act, and therefore they muſt leave the Town, or ſeize on Quarters contrary to the Act. When they do this, when they invade Property, contrary to an Act of Parliament, we may reſiſt them with the law on our Side."—So here is a Syſtem to make an Act impracticable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then to oppoſe the King's Troops for not obſerving it! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Act is impracticable enough without all this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; but what is moſt ſurprizing is, that ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011176_0030_0F862BE9ABF612F8"/>
of Conſideration and Property ſhould join in ſupporting a Scheme, which, if it is carried into its full Execution, muſt involve this Town into univerſal Deſolation and Ruin, in Order to ſave a few deſperate and wicked Mem from being made anſwerable for their Crimes; and yet your Lordſhip will find the forementioned Syſtem of Reaſoning adopted by Men, from whom one could not expect to have heard it ſeriouſly mentioned.</p>
               <p>At the next Council, which was Yeſterday, the Committee reported, that the Selectmen had given for Anſwer, that there was an Act of Parliament for the quartering the Troops, and they had nothing to do with it; but give it for their Opinion, that it would be moſt for the Peace of the Town, that the two Regiments expected from Halifax ſhould be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at the Caſtle.—That in Regard to the Troops expected from Ireland, it was Time enough to think of them, as it would be a long Time before they would arrive, and moſt probably they would not come before Winter; for Mr. Hancock, one of the Selectmen, had told them, that he had Advice from London, that the Troops ordered from Ireland would not ſail till after the Parliament met; and—,the Gentleman who reported, ſaid, that if they were to ſail this Fall, it would be ſo late, that probably they would not get in theſe Seas till Winter was ſet in, and then they would be drove off the Coaſt.—In this Manner was your Lordſhip's poſitive Notice of the ordering theſe Troops to embark im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and his Majeſty's Orders thereupon, treated.</p>
               <p>After the Report was made, followed ſeveral Speeches, all tending to give Reaſons, why they could not provide Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks for the Reception of the Troops.—It was ſtrongly urged, that the Act of Parliament directed how to quarter the Troops, and they could not depart from it.—I reminded them, that at the laſt Council it was generally agreed, that it would never do to quarter the Troops in public Houſes; for it would produce the utmoſt Diſorder throughout the Town; and they muſt be ſenſible, that the Troops could not live in the Winter of this Country in Barns, Out-Houſes, &amp;c.—That I did not want them to act againſt the Act of Parliament, but to carry into Execution the firſt Part of it, which recommended the Troops being put into Barracks, as the moſt preferable Diſpoſition, and thereby avoid reſorting to the latter Parts of it, which had been admitted by them to be impracticable—They anſwered, that if they were to follow the Act of Parliament, the Barracks at the Caſtle,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011176_0030_0F862BE9ABF612F8"/>
which were in the Town of Boſton, muſt be filled, before they could demand other Quarters.—That the Barracks at the Caſtle would hold the whole of the two Regiments from Halifax.—I obſerved, that they confounded the Words Town and Townſhip; that the Caſtle was indeed in the Townſhip of Boſton, but was ſo far from being in the Town, that it was diſtant from it by Water three Miles, and by Land ſeven.—Beſides, in the General's Orders, there was an expreſs Diſtinction between the Town and the Caſtle, one Regiment being to be quartered in the Town, and the other at the Caſtle—That it could not thereby be intended, that both ſhould be quartered at the Caſtle—And in your Lordſhip's Orders, that the two Regiments from Ireland ſhould be landed at Boſton, it could not be conceived, that your Lordſhip imagined, that the Caſtle, which was known to ſtand upon an Iſland ſome Miles diſtant from Boſton, was in Boſton; and that in executing thoſe Orders, it would be ſufficient to land thoſe Regiments at the Caſtle. But it was inſiſted, that Town and Townſhip was the ſame, and that the Caſtle was in the Town of Boſton; and that as the Act had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Barracks to be firſt uſed, neither the General's Letter nor your Lordſhip's could alter the Law; and one Gentleman added, that if there had been other Barracks in the Province, tho' at 50 Miles diſtant, they muſt be filled, before any Quarters could be demanded at Boſton—I told them, that this fallacious Way of Reaſoning, however it might flatter them, would not paſs elſewhere; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they never would be able to perſwade the commanding Officers, who are ordered to land their Troops at Boſton, to land them at the Caſtle; and therefore, as the Officers would certainly bring their Troops into the Town, if no Barracks were provided for them, they would in their own Defence be obliged to take Poſſeſſion of ſome of the public Buildings, and make Barracks for themſelves.—I was then told by one Gentleman, as it was ſuppoſed that the Troops would be under my Command, if they ſhould come into Town, and take Quarters contrary to Laws, I ſhould be charged as the Author of it.—I replied, that whatever Power I might have over the Troops, I certainly ſhould not have that of requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to diſobey their Orders.—On the other Hand, I deſired them to conſider, what they would have to anſwer for, if, by refuſing to concur with me in providing Barracks for the Troops, they ſhould oblige them to provide their own Quarters, and thereby afford a Pretence for the Enemies
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011176_0031_0F862BEA6ADFDC50"/>
of the public Peace to draw the People into an Oppoſition to the King's Troops, which they had in vain attempted to bring about previous to their landing.—I then gave them the Account of the Declaration of—upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as mentioned in Pa. 2 &amp; 3, of this Letter; and I might have added, that it was long ago ſince I firſt heard, that it was the Intention of the Faction to embarraſs the Buſineſs of Quartering the Troops, and thereby ſet them and the People together by the Ears—In the Courſe of this Diſpute, it was frequently urged on the Side of the Council, that they had no Power to draw Money out of the Treaſury for building or fitting up Barracks.—This Argument was always ready at hand, when any Plan was propoſed for the Purpoſe—As I ſaw we were like to riſe without doing any Thing, I was reduced to make a Propoſal as my ultimate Effort. I obſerved, that Col. Dalrymple with the two Regiments from Halifax, were expected every Day: That the Barracks at the Caſtle, altho' they had held 1000 Men for a ſhort Time in the Summer, yet they would not hold much more than a Regiment with Convenience, and Col. Dalrymple certainly would not conſent to take leſs than a Regiment to Boſton; therefore Accommodations for one Regiment ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be provided—That there was the Manufactory-Houſe (a Brick Building belonging to the Province) now wholly unappropriated, and inhabited only by Self ſettlers, who are ready to go out at a Day's warning—This Building, with a ſmall Addition to it for Officers, would hold a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—I therefore deſired, that they would authorize me to fit up this Building, with the Addition, and I would aſſure them, that, if the Aſſembly ſhould refuſe to allow this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, I would engage to recommend it to the King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo that it ſhould be paid by the Crown, and they ſhould be indemnified from it.—When this was done, we ſhould have Time to conſider of providing for the two Regiments from Ireland.—If they refuſed this, I did not ſee how they could clear themſelves from being charged with a Deſign to embarraſs the Quartering the King's Troops, nor of the Conſequences, which might follow the obliging the Troops to make good their own Quarters. I ſpoke this ſo forcibly, that ſome of them were ſtaggered, and deſired further Time to conſider of it; I therefore adjourned the Council to this Day; and ſince, on Account of the Weather, To-morrow—I have ſince ſpoke with ſeveral of them, and they all tell me, that I ſhall never get a Vote for providing Barracks for

               <p>The bad Weather continuing, I am obliged to poſtpone the Council to another Day, as ſeveral of them come out of the Country, and would not attend on this Day; and as there are two Ships ready to ſail as ſoon as this Storm is over, I ſhall probably ſend away this Letter and its Dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, before I can bring this Buſineſs to a Concluſion.—I am ſorry I am obliged to give your Lordſhip a Detail ſo diſagreable to the Body which is the Subject of it, but it is neceſſary, as well to my Vindication, as to give your Lordſhip a true Idea of the preſent State of this Government; I ſhall purſue this Narrative till I have finiſhed it. In what I ſhall have to write upon other Parts of your Lordſhip's Letter. I ſhall have frequent Occaſion to obſerve, how impoſſible it will be for me to execute his Majeſty's Commands, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Expectation, until I have a Council more depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the King than the preſent is.</p>

               <p>I NOW ſend your Lordſhip a Copy of the Council's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to me concerning providing Barracks for the Troops, and what is extraordinary in Print; which ſhall be explained in Order. In the P. S. of my laſt, I informed your Lordſhip that the Council ſent to me on Saturday to deſire that I would meet them to receive their Anſwer to my Propoſal of fitting up the Manufactory-Houſe. At that Time there was a violent Storm of Wind &amp; Rain, and I was at my Country Houſe at Roxbury 5 Miles from Boſton. I thought by their being in ſuch an Hurry that they intended to do ſomething; and as there was no Time to be loſt, I determined not to regard the Weather, but ſet out immediately for Boſton; and I therefore was ſurprized to find that I was ſent for in ſuch a Storm meerly to receive a Refuſal, for I was not in the Secret then, and did not know that all this Hurry and Drawing me through the worſt Weather I almoſt ever tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in, was to get their Writings thro', ſo that they might put it in the public Papers on Monday.</p>
               <p>I mentioned to your Lordſhip that they had taken back their Anſwer to correct ſome Miſtakes; theſe Miſtakes were mentioning Sayings of mine which I never ſaid, and couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſinuations which I did not obſerve. Upon my explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe paſſages, it was ſaid that nothing was intended againſt me, and that they would alter the Paſſages to my Satisfaction; and they offered to do it directly. I told them that I had rather that they ſhould take it back and reconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole; for it ſeemed to me that it wanted Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their Account as well as mine. It was objected that it would cauſe the unneceſſary Trouble of calling ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Council; I anſwered that as there was nothing to be Adviſed or Ordered, I would Conſent that they ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Paper, when corrected, to the Secretary, without calling a Council in form.</p>
               <p>

They met early next Monday Morning in the Council Chamber, when they made ſome little Alterations to remove what I had excepted to, which however was not done fully. After which it was moved (neither myſelf nor the Secretary being preſent) that this Anſwer ſhould be printed in one of the Papers of that Day. This was oppoſed, and occaſioned ſome little Debate, when the Queſtion was put, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Affirmative 7 to 3; among the 7 was one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who rather acquieſced than approved; the other 6 being firm in this ſyſtem. In the Courſe of this Debate, and alſo in the firſt bringing in this Paper, one Gentleman argued againſt it, and proteſted againſt ſome Parts of it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> another took him aſide and ſaid, you had better not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh yourſelf in this Oppoſition; the Council are determined not to alter a Word in this Paper, they are reſolved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the people; the ſame laſt-mentioned Gentleman in arguing for the printing, ſaid, I have no immediate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with them (meaning the Sons of Liberty) but I know pretty well what is going on by my intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with many of the middling People. I ſay it again and again, and would have it well underſtood, that if we don't print the Anſwer to the Governor this Day, there will ſoon be no Government.</p>
               <p>Accordingly they immediately ſent for one of the Printers, of the Government Gazette, and ordered him to ſtop his Preſs, and gave the only Copy of the Anſwer to him, to ſet the Preſs by, immediately after it was finiſhed. I came into the Council Chamber a little after 11, and there I found one of the Council with the Printer correcting the Preſs, after which, and not before, the Paper was delivered to me. I told the Gentleman that I would immediately repreſent this to his Majeſty as the higheſt Inſult that ever was put upon a King's Governor. He anſwered that there was no Intention of affronting <hi>me.</hi> I replied that moſt probably there was not personally, for I had never deſerved to be ill uſed by them: but there was a great affront put upon the King in his Repreſentative, &amp; it was my Buſineſs to reſent that.</p>
               <p>To ſhew the high Nature of this Uſurpation, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Council except in this Legiſlative Capacity have no Activity of their own without the Governor; they are by Charter appointed to adviſe and aſſiſt the Governor, and therefore they cannot meet without the Governor, nor can act in any Buſineſs but what he propoſes. Indeed it has been uſual to appoint Committers to prepare Papers
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011176_0033_0F862BEBF5EC0BF0"/>
for the Council, but then ſuch Papers are reported to the Governor in Council, and have no Validity until they are confirmed there. But for a Council to meet without the Governor, to appoint a Committee, to meet again and receive the Report of the Committee, to admit a Motion for print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Proceedings, and put the Queſtion upon it, and to order the Proceedings to be printed without the Governor's Conſent or Knowledge, and even before it was reported to him, is altogether a Tranſaction never known or imagined before, and wholly illegal and unconſtitutional; there is but one Way to make it regular, and that is to conſider the Council as meeting in their Legiſlative Capacity; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will make all right, and they will form an upper Houſe to the Aſſembly of Repreſentatives now ſitting in Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then there will be nothing wanting to render it a complete General Court, but the Authority and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the King; if all this coming together does not operate ſo as to produce an Amendment (at leaſt) of the Charter, wiſe and good Men who want to ſee the Authority of the King's Government reſtored, or rather rebuilt upon a more firm Foundation, will be diſappointed. There is but one rational Way of accounting for theſe Proceedings of the Council, ſo contrary to their Conduct about ſeven Months ago, and this is, that they are deſirous to lend an Hand to the Convention, to bring about a Forfeiture of the Charter; which conſidering how they have heretofore been treated by their Conſtituents, they may well be ſuppoſed to deſire.</p>
               <p>As to the Anſwer, I have little to ſay about it, having fully explained the Syſtem it is founded upon in my Letter immediately preceeding. If it wants any Thing more I will add a Paragraph which one of the Council propoſed to be inſerted in their Anſwer to me, but it was rejected: this Paper has by chance fell into my Hands in the hand-writing of the Propoſer; and I will incloſe a Copy of it. It fully ſhews that there is an Intention of oppoſing the Troops by embarraſſing their Quarters and attaching them afterwards by Means of ſuch Embarraſſment, to juſtify which a formal Syſtem of Law is already prepared. As to what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have deſired for the printing a formal Anſwer to me, which I ſent a Copy of to your Lordſhip with my Letter No., your Lordſhip muſt underſtand that ſince the Council (I mean the Majority of them in and about the Town of Boſton) have gone over to the popular Party (the Day of which Revolt is preciſely fixed) they have been very fond in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011176_0033_0F862BEBF5EC0BF0"/>
Imitation of the Faction of the Houſe, to do Buſineſs by Writings calculated for the Preſs; the Paper referred to was plainly written for that purpoſe, but I prevented its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publiſhed hitherto, and ſhall, notwithſtanding this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Call added to many private. In regard to the preſent publication, upon the firſt opening this Buſineſs I charged their proceedings with Secrecy, and the only pretence to evade this Charge is that I did not renew that Charge at every Adjournment, tho' the ſame Buſineſs was continued.</p>
               <p>And now, my Lord, I conſider the Government as entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued, the Outworks have been taken by Degrees, the Citadel, the Council, however remained to the King until within theſe 3 Months, now that is ſurrendered, and the Garriſon has joined the Enemy, to ſpeak plain, now the Council co-operate with the Opponents of Government, and they whoſe Buſineſs it is to adviſe and aſſiſt me, do all they can to embarraſs me; they who ought to join with me in executing the King's Commands, are at the Head of thoſe who oppoſe them: What can I do, circumſtanced as this Government at preſent is? Ipſa Salus non poteſt Servare bane rempublicam. If the 3 Regiments ordered to Boſton were now quietly in their Quarters (which I don't ſee how they are like to be by the means of the Civil Power only) it would not follow that the Civil Government could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its Functions. It will take ſome time to recover that Intimidation and Lachere which has prevaded all Orders of Men. I ſhall write more particularly upon this Subject when I write in Anſwer to the other parts of your Lordſhip's Letter which the preſent Emergencies prevent.</p>

               <p>IN my Letter No. 22, I informed your Lordſhip of the Origination of calling an Aſſembly of Repreſentatives under the Name of a <hi>Committee of Convention,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011176_0034_0F862BECA7DA4928"/>
that is the Name of the Body, the Members alſo are all called Committees; ſo that for Diſtinction ſake, we muſt call the Body the Convention. This Convention is now ſitting, they met on Thurſday, and did nothing that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but chooſe a Chairman and a Clerk, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the late Speaker and the Clerk of the Houſe. The ſame Morning I prepared a Meſſage to this Convention, and left it with Mr. Oliver the Secretary to deliver in the Afternoon. I wrote it wholly in my Hand, and my Name ſo written was in the Title; but as it was not underſigned by me they refuſed to receive it. This was only to gain Time to ſend me a Meſſage before they acknowledged the Receipt of mine. As they print what they do, your Lordſhip will have their own Account of theſe Proceedings. The three Days laſt Week, they kept open Doors,—was then abſent. The two Days this Week they have kept the Doors ſhut;—is with them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever further tranſpires I will inform your Lordſhip of it.</p>
               <p>It is now made a great Queſtion in what Manner Great-Britain will reſent this Proceeding; for certainly, at the Fountainhead it was intended to provoke a Reſentment, the great Principle of the Faction being to raiſe and blow up Fire. Some ſay, and eſpecially in the Convention itſelf, that the Perſons aſſembling would be by Act of Parliament rendered incapable of ſerving in any public Office. But this ſeems to be at once too confined, and too general a Cenſure. The Towns who choſe theſe Deputies (next to that who iſſued the Summons) are anſwerable for this Convention; and if they are a Majority of the Towns who ſend Members, as their own Accounts at the loweſt aſſert, the Province is anſwerable. It is therefore concluded that the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſequence will be the Forfeiture of the Charter. If this is the worſt. It is an Event moſt devoutly to be deſired by every Well-wiſher to the Province.</p>

               <p>THE Day my laſt Packet went out of the Harbour, brought in the Fleet from Halifax, with two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on board under the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011176_0034_0F862BECA7DA4928"/>
Dalrymple. As ſoon as I was informed of it. I went to the Caſtle, and got there before the Ships got to Anchor. Soon after I ſaw Col. Dalrymple, and informed him of all the Proceedings of the Council concerning his Quarters, and the Difficulties he was to encounter. And it was agreed that I ſhould call a Council at the Caſtle the next Morning, and invite the Colonel and the Commanding Officer of the Fleet to attend the Council.</p>
               <p>The Council accordingly met at the Caſtle the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being Thurſday September 29th. The Commanding Officers likewiſe attended after the Buſineſs was opened, the Colonel acquainted them in a very genteel Manner that he was ordered to Quarter one of the Regiments at Boſton; That he hoped he was going among his Friends, and that his Men would on their Parts behave as ſuch; That he ſhould be glad if he could have Quarters in the Way of Barracks, where he could keep his Men under the Eyes of their Officers, and then he would engage that his Men ſhould be kept in good Order. He added ſeveral kind Expreſſions ſignifying his Deſire to conduct the Buſineſs in a Manner that ſhould be moſt eaſy and agreeable to the Town. He was anſwered, That they hoped he would obſerve the Act of Parliament; and if he did, he would put both his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Barracks at the Caſtle, which were in the Town of Boſton, and capable of holding two Regiments: That when the Barracks were full, the Council had nothing to do with Quartering Troops till the public Houſes were full. The Colonel ſaid he would not diſpute whether the Caſtle Iſland was in the Town or not, they certainly were diſtinct Places in his Orders: That he was not uſed to diſpute his Orders but obey them, and therefore ſhould moſt certainly march his Regiment in the Town; and if they aſſigned him Quarters in the public Houſes he ſhould take them: but then he could not anſwerable for the good Order of his Men, which it would be impoſſible to preſerve, if they were intermixed with the Town People and ſeperated from their Officers. I then interrupted and aſked whether as the Colonel had now told them, that he muſt and would march his Regiment into the Town, it would not be beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider my Propoſal for fitting up the Manufactory Houſe for a Barrack. It was obſerved that it was not regular to put a Queſtion until the Board was cleared: The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereupon withdrew.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:011176_0035_0F862BED66100C90"/>
I then deſired that in reconſidering my Propoſal for fitting up the Manufactory Houſe, they would let me know what Objection they had to it: The only Objection worth Notice was that they had no Power to draw the Money. I told them that there was an Appropriation in the Treaſury for contingent Services, which had much more Money upon it than would be wanted for this Buſineſs, which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Service. They ſtill declined it. I then told them that I would make one more Propoſal to them, which was, that if they would authorize me to fit up this Building, I would be anſwerable it ſhould be done at the Charge of the Crown. This alſo they refuſed in writing, refering to their former Anſwer. I then gave them to underſtand that thoſe Subterfuges would not diſappoint the Execution of the King's Commands; and that I by myſelf would aſſign the Houſe in Queſtion for a Barrack.</p>
               <p>The next Morning when I got to the Caſtle as uſual to hold a further Conſultation, Capt. Montreſor, an Engineer, arrived here, and brought Letters from General Gage, for me and the Colonel, wherein the General ſays, That by a Number of private <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from Boſton to New-York, and from the Narrative of the Proceedings of the Town Meeting at Boſton, it was reported and believed at New-York, that the People in and about Boſton had revolted, he therefore ſent Capt. Montreſor to aſſiſt the Forces as Engineer, and to enable them to recover and maintain the Caſtle, &amp; ſuch other Poſts as they could ſecure. As Things were not ſo bad as this came to, the Colonel thought proper upon the Authority of theſe new Orders, to alter his Plan, and land both Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Boſton, without Loſs of Time. I gave him a poſitive Order to take Poſſeſſion of the Manufactory Houſe for one; and the other Regiment was to be encamped. This being Reſolved, the Fleet was immediately put into Motion, and by the next Morning commanded the whole Town—And this Day at Noon the Troops began landing, and were all paraded on the Common by Four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, This was done not only without Oppoſition, but with tolerable good Humor.—Thus this Buſineſs has been effected for the preſent, which would have had none of theſe Difficulties, nor have occaſioned ſuch a Parade, if it had not been for the undutiful Behaviour of the Council.</p>

               <p>IN my Letter No. 25. I gave your Lordſhip an Account of the proceedings of the Convention, in this I propoſe to finiſh it. They ſat exactly a Week, and their laſt Act I hereby ſend your Lordſhip a printed Copy of, this and what I before ſent being all that has been printed. They have beſides, as I am told, prepared a Petition to the King in the ſame, or nearly the ſame Terms as the former, and have ſent it to Mr. DeBerdt, with a long Letter of Inſtructions, among which is, as is ſaid, a Direction to give it into the King's own Hands. But I am not certain of this, as all this Buſineſs was done with a kind of Secrecy, into which it is ſcarce worth while to pry.</p>
               <p>The chief Obſervation upon theſe Writings, is of their Moderation ſo very different from the Temper of thoſe who called this Meeting. This is accounted for many Ways: many of the Deputies came down with Inſtructions and Diſpoſition to prevent the Boſtoners involving the Province in the Conſequences of their own mad Devices: many of them were, from the Beginning ſenſible of the Impropriety and Danger of this proceeding, and were deſirous, by a moderate Conduct, to correct the One and ward off the other. My Meſſage (which was ſaid to be very high, tho' I hope not too high for the Occaſion) altho' it did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe them, had the good Effect to keep them in Awe. Hence it was that ….., when he joined them, was perfectly came; and his Colleague Adams when he attempted to launch out in the Language uſed in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, was preſently ſilenced. And now theſe People aſſume to themſelves the Merit of the Moderation of thoſe whom they called together for very different purpoſes.</p>
               <p>However therefore this temperate Conduct of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties may in ſome Meaſure apologize for the Towns who deputed them and for themſelves who aſſembled, it makes no Excuſe for thoſe who took upon themſelves to call them together. For whoever reads the Minutes of the Town-Meeting in which the ſummoning this Convention was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, will eaſily perceive that it was intended to have very different Effects from thoſe which it was iſſued in.</p>

               <p>THE Landing the two Regiments at Boſton on Saturday laſt with ſuch diſpatch and parade, which I informed Your Lordſhip of by No. 26, is like to have good Effects, and will at laſt, tho' it has not done it at preſent, produce Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the Troops. On the Monday following I called the Council together, and laid before them a Requiſition of Col. Dalrymple's for the uſual Allowances under the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Againſt this it was argued that they were ready on their parts to comply with the Act of Parliament if the Col. would on his. If therefore the Col. would remove both the Regiments to the Caſtle, they would provide the Allowances, otherwiſe not. This produced a good deal of Debate, after which I told them, that the Col. had deſired that if they were diſpoſed to refuſe, he might be heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Refuſal was made abſolute, and I accordingly ſent for the Colonel.</p>
               <p>He came with Capt. Smith, and I informed him of what was paſſing. He enforced his Requiſition in very ſtrong Words, not without ſome Hints of the King's Reſentment which would follow their Refuſal. He ſaid that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped one of the Regiments and was providing Barracks for the other, that they might be both conſidered to be in Barracks. If therefore they refuſed the Allowances becauſe they were not in the Barracks at the Caſtle, they took upon themſelves to determine upon the propriety of the King's ſtationing His Troops at this or that place, and to preſume to diſpenſe with an Act of Parliament, unleſs the Troops were ſtationed at ſuch Places as they thought fit; altho' ſuch propoſed ſtationing directly contradicted the Intention of the King's ordering the Troops to be ſtationed here at all. This was the Subſtance of the Colonel's and my own reaſoning upon the Occaſion, which had much Weight, ſo to induce the Council to deſire me to give them Time to conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it; which I did upon their aſſuring me that they would draw up no more Papers for Publication; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Council was adjourned to this Day.</p>
               <p>Upon this Day the Council met by themſelves in the Council Chamber, and two of the Council came to me to know if I could engage the Colonel to ſend one of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Caſtle, if they would provide for the other. I
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011176_0036_0F862BEED8EFAAC0"/>
ſaid, I could make no ſuch Terms with the Colonel, but as he happened then to come in, they might hear from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He ſaid that his Orders were to ſtation the two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Town, but if Things were quiet, and the Troops well received and accommodated, he made no Doubt but the General would allow one Regiment to go to Caſtle; for which Purpoſe he had already wrote. The Gentlemen returned to the Council, they continuing to ſit by themſelves at the Council Chamber; when after many Debates it was determined to ſupply the Troops by 8 againſt 5 in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil then aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Afternoon they came to me in a Body, and gave me an Anſwer in Writing, wherein they reſolved that I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Perſon to provide the Allowances, he undertaking <hi>"to run the Riſque</hi> of the Aſſembly paying the Charge of it." I told them that this Clauſe was diſabling as well as ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; for by inſerting ſuch a terrifying Proviſo, I ſhould not be able to get any one to undertake it. If they meant nothing but to indemnify themſelves from being perſonally anſwerable for this Charge, I would recommend this Clauſe "that ſuch Proviſion ſhould be made on the Credit of the Aſſembly, and not of the Particulars of the Perſons compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Governor and Council." Some Gentlemen approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this; but it was greatly oppoſed, and it was urged that as there really was a great Riſque that the Aſſembly would not pay this Money, it was fitting that the Undertaker ſhould know it; I aſked them if the Troops were Barracked at the Caſtle, whether they would have inſerted this Clauſe; they freely anſwered no, for then there would have been no doubt of the Legality of making ſuch Allowances, now there was. I then told them that it plainly appeared that this diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Clauſe was put in as a pre-judgment of what the Aſſembly had to do in providing for this Expence, and a Dictation to them not to diſcharge it: and ſo it would by all knowing of this Proceeding. However, I inſiſted upon the Queſtion of the Amendment I propoſed being put, and it paſſed in the Negative. Upon which upon the unamended Anſwer, I propoſed a Perſon for Commiſſary for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and he was approved. So here is a Subject for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute laid in Store againſt the next Meeting of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>

                  <hi>October</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>This Morning I had with me Colonel Dalrymple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Mr. Godthwait the Perſon I appointed to make Proviſion for the Troops. And being informed of the Terms upon which the Council had made this Appointment, Mr. Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwait, with the Advice and Approbation of the Colonel, declined undertaking this Buſineſs; and the Colonel told me that he thought it was to no Purpoſe for me to apply any more to the Council upon this or any other Proviſion for the Troops, for he ſaw that they were determined to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing. And I muſt add myſelf, that I am certain that the Proviſo was put in to defeat the whole Purpoſe. I am aſſured that at firſt they reſolved to make a poſitive Refuſal, and had drawn up near two Sheets of Paper of Arguments, to juſtify this Refuſal. But this Paper being much excepted to, and generally diſapproved, and a Vote being obtained to make a Proviſion, the Opponents hit upon this Expedient to annul the Vote and render it ineffectual, and the Affirmers of the Vote with their Eyes open into this Expedient.</p>

               <p>I FIND myſelf obliged to continue my Informations of the Council's Separation from and Oppoſition to the Governor in the Execution of his Majeſty's Commands. I ſhould have been glad to have been excuſed carrying the Account any further than where I have already laid it; but my Duty, and the Importance of the Subject, will not admit of my not proceeding.</p>
               <p>In my Letter No. 24, I informed your Lordſhip that I had prevented the Publication of the Proceedings of the Council on July 27 and 29, laſt, by ordering the Secretary to deliver no Copies, thereof; which I then thought was an effectual Means of Prevention. Alſo in my Letter No. 28, I inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I conſented to the Council's taking Time to conſider of my Propoſal for their providing the Allowances for the Troops, upon their aſſuring me that they would draw up no
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011176_0037_0F862BEEE4386660"/>
more Papers for Publication. And I might have added, that I expreſly ſtipulated that they ſhould deliver into the Secretary's Hands <hi>all Papers</hi> which they ſhould uſe upon this Occaſion, without keeping <hi>any Copies</hi> thereof. And this Stipulation was, as I underſtood, unanimouſly aſſented to before we parted.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs there appeared on Monday laſt October 10th, in three of the News-Papers of that Day, a Publication of all the Proceedings on July 27th and 29th, and alſo the entire Minutes of Council on October 3d &amp; 5th, which are the Subject of the Stipulation before-mentioned. Upon my enquiring of the Secretary how theſe Papers came to be publiſhed, he ſaid he underſtood that it was done <hi>by Order of the Council,</hi> but how they came by the Copies he did not know. He was ſure that no Copies came out of his Office; for he had kept the Originals in his own Cuſtody, and never ſuffered them to be out of his Sight when they were in Uſe.</p>
               <p>The next Council Day October 12, I took an Opportunity to obſerve upon this Publication, and reminded them of the Aſſurances they had given that no Papers or Copies of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhould be kept out of the Cuſtody of the Secretary; and I deſired to know from whom the Copies uſed for theſe Publications were procured, as they did not come from the Secretary, and who committed them to the Preſs? No An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was given for the preſent; but when the Buſineſs of the Council was over, and we had roſe from the Table, Mr. <hi>Bowdoin,</hi> who upon this Separation of the Council has been the perpetual Preſident, Chairman, Secretary, and Speaker of this new Council, addreſſing himſelf to me, ſaid that he was deſired by the Council to inform me, that they had cauſed this Publication, judging it neceſſary to quiet the Minds of the People. Upon my obſerving that they had promiſed to keep no Copies of the Papers they had uſed upon the laſt Occaſion, he anſwered, that the Publication was not from Copies, but the Originals, I anſwered that they had promiſed to deliver to the Secretary <hi>all</hi> Papers uſed in that Buſineſs; but that I was obliged to him for being ſo explicit; for their declaring that the Original Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of theſe Minutes of Council were with them, and that thoſe remaining with the Secretary were only Copies, was ſuch an Avowal of their being a Board ſeparate from and independant of the Governor, as I did not expect. But they were in the right to ſpeak out. I added that it might be doubted whether the Council by any ſeparate Act of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011176_0038_0F862BEFA8481A70"/>
their own, could create a Forſeiture of their Charter; but if they could, I ſhould have no Doubt, but that their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating themſelves from the Governor, and acting as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Body by themſelves, would amount to ſuch a Forfeiture. And I either added, or had it ſtrongly in my Mind (I cannot ſay which) that theſe their Proceedings would probably be joined with other extraordinary Proceedings on the Part of the People, to infer a general Departure from the Conſtitution of the Government, and an Invaſion of the Royal Rights contrary to the Tenor of the Charter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowdoin, in Juſtification of himſelf and his Aſſociates, ſaid that the People in their preſent Temper would not bear with the keeping the Proceedings in Council ſecret; for this Reaſon to quiet the People, they found themſelves obliged to make their Doings public, and could not ſubmit to an Injunction of Secrecy. I anſwered, that if they would ſhew me any civilized Government upon Earth that did or could ſupport itſelf under a continual and immediate Publication of the Reſults of its moſt intimate Councils, ſo that before any of its Orders could be carried into Execution, they ſhould be canvaſſed by Tavern Politicians, and cenſured by News Paper Libellers, I would ſubmit to their Preſcriptions. But as I knew that Government could not be carried on upon theſe Terms, I ſhould be obliged to deſire his Majeſty's Inſtructions how to conduct myſelf under theſe Difficulties.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have before obſerved that in opening this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil I ordered the Secretary to read the Oath of a Counſellor, Part of which is that <hi>they ſhall not reveal what ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them in Secrecy;</hi> and I added that what I was now going to commit to them was in Secrecy. I added that I was ſorry to obſerve that ſome Matters which I had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed to them in Secrecy, had not only tranſpired, but been publiſhed, with the Particulars, which could not have been known abroad, if a due Regard had been had to the Oath. Upon this Mr. Bowdoin ſaid that the Council were of Opinion that the Oath of Secrecy related only to ſuch Matters as <hi>they</hi> ſhould think and adviſe ought to be kept ſecret; and that the Governor had no Power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join them to Secrecy without their own Conſent. I told them that this their Reſolution, which I now heard the firſt of, was very extraordinary, for it argued, 1. That Matters committed <hi>to</hi> the Council in Secrecy ſhould be committed by themſelves, which was a Contradiction in Terms; 2. That if Secrecy was not to be enjoined 'till after the Matters had
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011176_0038_0F862BEFA8481A70"/>
been conſidered of and debated upon, they could not be <hi>committed</hi> in Secrecy; 3. That according to this, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor could not commit any Matter in Secrecy to the Council, though enjoined by the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Merits of the ſubject Matter, your Lordſhip will obſerve the extraordinary Circumſtance of a Counſellor denouncing to the Governor the Reſolution of the Council upon a Queſtion, or a Diſtinction of a Queſtion, which, though relative to the Conduct and Duty of the Council, was never moved or argued in Council before the Governor, and concerning which he has neither had an Opportunity to hear the Reaſons which induced the Council to be of that Opinion, or to offer his own Reaſons againſt it; and in Conſequence can make no Report of the Principles upon which ſuch Opinion was founded.</p>
               <p>Before I finiſh this Subject I muſt mention a Fact of their Treatment of Mr. Oliver the <hi>King'</hi>s Secretary. This new Council met in the Council Chamber by themſelves, and by their own Appointment, and ſent for the Secretary. When he came, they examined him concerning an Entry in the Minutes of the Council, which to my Knowlege was read and approved of before they parted, but which, upon Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, did not ſuit their Purpoſe, and therefore they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed.—During this Examination they kept him ſtanding at the End of the Table, and at laſt aſked him to ſit down at the Bottom of the Table, he ſaid, he knew of no Council where the Governor was not preſent, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver, by his Rank in the Liſt of Counſellors, and the Uſage of the Country, had a Right to take Place of much the greateſt Part of the Counſellors preſent, in all indifferent Places. But being full of their own ſelf-aſſumed Dignity, they treated this Gentleman with a Rudeneſs, which I ſhould have been aſhamed to have ſeen practiſed upon a Man of much leſs Rank and Merit, if I had been in the Chair.</p>
               <p>The Difficulties I meet with in carrying His Majeſty's Orders for Quartering the Troops into Execution, will, I foreſee, occaſion my being behind-hand in Letters due to your Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>If therefore you ſhould obſerve in me a want of Punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, you muſt not impute it to my Idleneſs; for I was never harder worked than I am at preſent.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſty's intentions Communicated to me in Your Lordſhip's Letter No. 12, reſpecting the Ship of War, which carries Lord Botetourt to his Government, and that which eſcorts the Tranſports to Boſton, has been made known to Commodore Hood, and I have acquainted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore with my Opinion that His Majeſty's Service did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe Ships to remain in the American Seas.

               <p>Every thing now has the Appearance of Peace and Quiet in this Place, and I find ſome Proſecutions are commenced in the Court of Admiralty againſt two of the moſt popular Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who dared to violate the Laws in a very daring and open Manner; and it is hoped this Example will encourage the Civil Officers of every Degree to do their Duty without Fear, and to curb effectually the licentious and ſeditious Spirit which has ſo long prevailed in this Place. Your Lordſhip will ſee that the Preſence of the Troops has already produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome good Effects; and it appears very neceſſary for his Majeſty's Service, that both his Land and Sea Forces ſhould be ſtrong in North America, for ſome Time to come; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly 'till the Affairs of America have been laid before Parliament, and the Reſolutions concerning the Colonies ſhall be made known.</p>

               <p>I Have this Day received and laid before the King your Diſpatches from Boſton, dated the 31ſt of October, and 3d &amp; 8th of November, numbered 18, 19 &amp; 20.</p>
               <p>The Account contained in theſe Diſpatches of the Conduct and Proceedings of the Council, and of the Inferior Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates at Boſton, upon the repeated Applications made to them for quartering his Majeſty's Troops purſuant to the Act of Parliament, is a farther Teſtimony of the weak and diſordered State of Government in the Province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Bay, and of the Diſpoſition that prevails in almoſt all Ranks of the People to obſtruct and embarraſs the King's Service, in a Caſe in which His Majeſty has ſhewn ſo great a Regard to the Peace and Security of a Town, where Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had been ſo repeatedly inſulted, and ſet at Defiance.</p>
               <p>As every Circumſtance relative to the State of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Maſſachuſets-Bay is now before Parliament, I have only to expreſs to you his Majeſty's Approbation of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you have taken, in Concert with Governor Bernard, for providing for the Reception and Accommodation of the Troops during the Winter, and of the Caution you have uſed to execute this Service in ſuch a Manner as to avoid all Grounds of reaſonable Diſcontent, and to ſecure his Majeſty's
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011176_0040_0F862BF3FA08A4C8"/>
Officers from the Hazard to which the Uncertainty and want of Preciſion in the Law might expoſe them in a Place where every Effect of Malice ſeems to be exerted to enſnare and diſtreſs them.</p>
               <p>For my own Part, I ſhall not fail to ſubmit your Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Mutiny-Act to the Conſideration of the reſt of His Majeſty's Servants, and ſhall be very happy if any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration can be made therein, which without giving up the Principle, may render it more eaſy in the Execution, and leſs hazardous to the Officers.</p>
               <p>As you appear to think that there is no Probability that any Inconveniency will ariſe from allowing the Provincial Garriſon to keep poſſeſſion of Caſtle-William; the King is ſatisfied with the Reaſons you give for permitting them to remain in it for the preſent. What may be neceſſary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Reſpect to this Fortreſs, as well as to what you ſuggeſt of building Barracks upon, and fortifying the Eminence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Boſton, muſt depend upon the future Conduct of that Town.</p>
               <p>It has given great Pleaſure to the King to find by your Letter No. 19, that the Meaſure of ſending Troops to Boſton, has been ſo fully juſtified by the Effects of it, which His Majeſty hopes from the preſent Appearances, will finally produce that Spirit of Order and Obedience to lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon which the Happineſs and Security of Society depend.</p>

               <p>I Deſired you would acquaint my Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty of my Arrival here the 15th, by a Veſſel juſt then about to ſail, Duplicate of which accompanies this.</p>
               <p>Governor Bernard ſent me a Letter Yeſterday from Capt. Thompſon, acquainting me of his Arrival in Hampton-Road in Virginia the 25th of laſt Month, with his Majeſty's Ship Rippon under his Command, and that Lord Botetourt was landed the next Morning, and incloſing their Lordſhip's Order of the 25th of Auguſt, directing me, if the King's Service ſhall in my Opinion require it, to take the ſaid Ship under my Command, and employ her in ſuch a Manner as I ſhall judge beſt in the Execution of the Services intruſted to my Care; but if Circumſtances of Affairs, ſhall be ſuch as to render her Aſſiſtance unneceſſary, to direct her Captain to repair without Loſs of Time to Spithead, and to ſend an Account of her Arrival to you: At preſent Things here are very quiet, and I flatter myſelf will remain ſo, till the Reſolutions of Parliament are known, what turn they will then take, is uncertain. The Spirit of Oppoſition to the Acts of Parliament of Great-Britain, is as high as ever, and general throughout the Colonies; it therefore ſeems very prudent and neceſſary to be as ſtrong in all Parts, and in all Reſpects as poſſible; and there is no ſaying now, how far the Rippon may be eſſentially ſerviceable in the Spring. The preſent Seaſon is ſuch as to render any Movements at Sea, of the King's Ships, very hazardous; and as the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011176_0042_0F862BF5A4FD44D0"/>
in Virginia and other Provinces to the Southward of this, are as great as they well can be, without actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. I have judged it right, upon conſulting with Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Gage, to direct Captain Thompſon to remain in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Road till further Orders, holding the Ship under his Command, in as great Readineſs for Service, as is conſiſtent with her Safety; for if Troops ſhould be required to be carried from this Province to any other, or from any other to this, it is a Service not to be effected but in his Majeſty's Ships, as Tranſport Veſſels cannot be hired. Theſe are my Reaſons for detaining the Rippon in America, which I hope will prove ſatisfactory to their Lordſhips; and if the Winter Reſolutions at Home (upon which the Obedience of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies wholly depends) ſhould reſtore Affairs here to any Degree of Order, I ſhall immediately ſend Capt. Thompſon to England; and in the mean Time, if I ſee no Cauſe to the contrary, I ſhall direct him to join me here, as ſoon as the Severity of the Winter is over, by which he will be able to return Home with the greater Expedition, as the Poſt is five and twenty Days at ſooneſt from this to Virginia, and very precarious from Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The Huſſar and two Tranſports are ſtill miſſing; I begin to be in Pain about them, as the Weather has been very tempeſtuous for many Days paſt.</p>
               <p>I propoſe to remain here the Winter, keeping with me the Romney, Mermaid, two Sloops, and two Schooners; I have ordered the Glaſgow to Winter at Halifax, and a Schooner at Louiſbourg, a Sloop at Rhode-Iſland, and the Deal-Caſtle and a Schooner at New-York, where I ſhall alſo ſend another Frigate if the Huſſar ſhould not arrive there; from the laſt Account of her, ſhe was without a Bowſprit, and from the Winds that have ſince prevailed, I do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſhe can reach this Port. She was ſpoke with ſtanding in for Sandy-Hook about ten Days ſince, ſo that I expect to hear of her Arrival by To-morrow's Poſt.</p>
               <p>The Raven Tranſport which has Colonel Mackay on board, has been ſpoke with in Latitude 38. Longitude 66, with her Foremaſt and Maintopmaſt gone, and it is ſuppoſed ſhe is gone to the Southward.</p>

She has alſo received other Damage, and has a Leak ſeven Feet under Water, which makes 12 Inches every four Hours; and from the Report of the Survey ſent to me of the Ship, ſhe requires to be caulked before ſhe can proceed to Sea. I have directed Capt. Parker to get His Majeſty's Ship under his Command in a Condition for Service as ſoon as poſſible, and to draw upon the Navy-Board for ſuch Stores as ſhe is under a Neceſſity of taking, as well as for the Workmanſhip neceſſary to be done, and have recommended it to him, in the ſtrongeſt Manner, to have no more Stores, or Works done, than are abſolutely unavoidable; and have directed him to remain at New-York 'till farther Orders.

               <p>I HAVE had the Honour of writing to you very frequently of late, but as Affairs of this Country have been and ſtill are very intereſting at Home, it muſt be ſatisfactory to their Lordſhips to hear often how they go; I beg now to acquaint you, that the People here are perfectly Quiet, and I am pretty ſure they will remain ſo till the Reſolutions of Parliament are known, which I am in Hopes will reſtore Order and make it laſting. There does not appear to me the leaſt Probability of the People's taking Arms. I think it cannot happen. Indeed ſome few of the Convention took Pains to bring the Ignorant and lower Claſs into that Mind, and poſſibly might have ſucceed had not the Troops arrived as they did; but thoſe few are now alarmed, and expect nothing leſs, than a Voyage to England againſt their Ineli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. The Council are now ſitting without the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and preparing Addreſſes, &amp;c. to England; His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency has told them how unconſtitutional they act, but they ſtill go on. No account has yet been received of the Arrival of the Raven Tranſport with Colonel' Mackay on Board.</p>

               <p>IN our former Memorials to your Lordſhips, we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Diſaffection of the People here to the Revenue Laws, and from the many treaſonable Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications that had been ſpread through all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Correſpondence carried on by the ſeveral Aſſemblies, we were perſuaded there had been a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed and extenſive Plan of Reſiſtance to the Authority of Great-Britain; and we believe, that the Seizure referred to in the incloſed Papers, has haſtened the People of Boſton to the Commiſſion of actual Violence ſooner than was intended.</p>
               <p>From their outrageous Behaviour towards our Officers, and their repeated Threats of immediate Violence to our own Perſons, we found it abſolutely neceſſary in Order to ſave His Majeſty's Commiſſion from further Inſult, and to preſerve our Lives, to take ſhelter on Board His Majeſty's Ship the Romney in Boſton-Harbour, from whence we are removed into Caſtle-William to carry on the Buſineſs of the Revenue; till we can receive ſuch protection as will enable us to act in Safety at Boſton.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Copy No. 2.</note>PRESENT Mr. Robinſon, Mr. Burch, Mr. Paxton, and Mr. Temple.</p>
               <p>MR. Harriſon, Collector of this Port, having laid before the Board on the 16th Inſtant, an Information taken on Oath, ſetting forth that the Tideſman placed on Board the Sloop Liberty, which arrived from Madeira on the 9th Day of May, had been forcibly confined on Board the ſaid Veſſel, during which Time Part of the Cargo had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden, before Entry thereof had been made at the Cuſtom-Houſe or Naval-Office, the Commiſſioners referred the Matter to the Conſideration of the Sollicitor; and in the Evening the Collector and Comptroller made Seizure of the ſaid Veſſel, and delivered her into the Charge of the Maſter of his Majeſty's Ship Romney, which lay near the Wharff where the Seizure was made, who immediately carried her along Side the ſaid Ship, as there was a Mob aſſembled, who attempted to reſcue her.</p>
               <p>The Collector and Comptroller, with the Son of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, on their Return from the Wharff into Town, were attacked by a numerous and outrageous Mob, Mr. Irving, Inſpector of Imports and Exports, who happened to be paſſing the ſame Way in his Return from the Wharff was likewiſe attacked by the Mob, who cried out, he is a Commiſſioner, Kill him, Kill him; Theſe ſeveral Perſons were groſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and much bruiſed, and eſcaped with the utmoſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their Lives, the Collector having been confined to his Bed and in great Danger from a Blow he received on his Breaſt with a Stone or Brick-bat thrown at him, and the Comptroller having been likewiſe confined to his Houſe under the Care-of a Surgeon, from the Wounds and Bruiſes he received; after theſe Violences committed on the Perſons
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011176_0044_0F862BF738A8A768"/>
of the Officers, the Mob proceeded to the Houſes of the Collector and Comptroller, broke their Windows and thoſe of Mr. Williams Inſpector General, and they concluded the Night with dragging the Collector's Boat from the Wharff through the Town to the Common, where they burnt it.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Outrages were committing, the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had every Reaſon to expect they ſhould meet with the like Inſults, and therefore retired from their Houſes, taking Shelter 'till after Midnight with their Families in the Houſes of ſome Perſons in their Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Early on the next Day, the Governor acquainted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners that the Council would meet on the Affair of the Riot of the preceding Evening, and deſired if the Board had any Thing to communicate to them thereon, that it might be laid before them; upon which the Chairman ſummoned the Commiſſioners to meet, it not being a Board Day,<note place="margin">Copy 3.4.5.6</note> when they wrote a Letter to Governor Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard and the Collector, Comptroller, Mr. Irving and young Mr. Harriſon having ſent to the Board their Affidavits on this Affair, the Commiſſioners immediately directed the Secretary to lay them before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in Council.<note place="margin">—7.</note>—The Board received a Letter from Mr. Oliver Secretary of the Province, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that the Enquiry into the Affair of the Riot was referred to a Committee of the Council to be reported on Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 11. During this Day the Commiſſioners received fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Informations that further Riots were intended. And in the Afternoon a verbal Meſſage was brought to them at Mr. Paxton's, where four of them dined in Company with the Governor, that the Town was in a great Ferment, and that Mr. Hancock the Owner of the Sloop, deſired ſhe might be reſtored upon his giving Bond to anſwer the Proſecution that might be commenced againſt her, in order to quiet the Town, the Commiſſioners told the Perſon that they could give no Anſwer to verbal Meſſages, that if the Owner had any Application to make to them, he muſt do it in Writing, to be laid before the Board.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners, conſidering this Application as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and finding no Meaſures had been taken by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council for ſecuring the Peace of the Town, and the Governor having repeatedly told the Commiſſioners that he could give them no Protection, and that he would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to General Gage for Troops, unleſs the Council adviſed

               <p>CONSIDERING myſelf in ſome Reſpects under your Protection, I beg Leave to lay before you the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort Account of an Attack made upon my Perſon laſt Night.</p>
               <p>Returning by myſelf from the End of the Long Wharff in the Evening about nine o'Clock, I was attacked by a conſiderable Number of diſorderly People, who, after laying violent Hands on me, demanded if I belonged to the Man of War? To which I anſwered I did not. Their next Queſtion was, whether I belonged to the Board of
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011176_0048_0F862BFB03E7C950"/>
Commiſſioners, which I anſwered in the Affirmative. They then began to beat me with Clubs, Sticks, &amp;c. but ſome of the Ringleaders interpoſing, and aſſuring me of their Protection, I walked pretty quietly up amongſt them to that Part of the Wharff adjoining King-Street, where the Mob returning with me was joined by another of much ſuperior Numbers. This Mob after dragging me from amongſt my former Friends, ſeized me by the Hair, Arms, &amp;c. whilſt others were beating me upon the Head with Clubs, calling out to murder or kill me. In this diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Situation two Men meanly dreſſed took Compaſſion upon me, and with great Difficulty pulling me from amongſt the Croud, got me conveyed through a Houſe into a back Yard, and from thence into another Houſe, where I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the Mob moved me to ſome other Part of the Town. My Sword I have got broke to Pieces, and received a few flight Wounds.</p>
               <p>Thus, honorable Sirs, you have the Particulars of this Affair, as nearly as I can recollect; at the ſame Time humbly craving the State of this Caſe may be laid before his Majeſty's Miniſters, whoſe Protection, as a Subject, and a Servant of the Crown, I flatter myſelf I am intitled to.</p>

               <p>The Subſtance of the ſeveral Informations we have had reſpecting the Stipulations in Behalf of the Mob, is, that a Deſign was formed, and concerted for a general Inſurrection or Aſſembly laſt Night, and in Conſequence thereof large Numbers of People were actually gathered together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly formed into Parties under their reſpective Leaders in ſeveral Parts of the Town. That the Reaſon given for this Proceeding was to oblige by Force thoſe concerned in the Seizure to return the Sloop Liberty to the Wharff from whence ſhe had been taken. As the Conſequence of that Attempt might have been a general Outrage, or perhaps a Pillage of every Perſon concerned in the Cuſtoms, and of thoſe who are accounted their Friends and Abettors; it has alarmed ſeveral Gentlemen of the Town, and induced them to make the Propoſal abovementioned for returning the Sloop to Mr. Hancock's Wharff, and to give Time for a Negociation to that Purpoſe, it was ſtipulated with the principal Leaders and Managers of the Mob, that no farther Outrages ſhould be committed, but that the People ſhould remain quiet till Monday Night, which was the longeſt Term that could be obtained of them.</p>
               <p>It appears evident to us, that a Plan for an Inſurrection, of a very dangerous and extenſive Nature, has long been in Agitation, and now brought nearly to a Criſis; and that to put it in Execution, there was only wanting ſome Step to be taken by the Officers of the Cuſtoms, that might be made a Handle of to Inflame the Minds of the People, which this Seizure has furniſhed them with.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole we can only obſerve, that as the Powers of Government in this Country, are in ſo weak and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated a State, and the Mob, by what we can learn, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon their point, we ſhould conſider it as a Meaſure
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011176_0050_0F862C01037C6520"/>
of Policy in the preſent Dilemma to take Mr. Hancock's Security, and releaſe the Sloop for the Preſervation of the Officers, and Tranquility of the Town, which we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe would otherwiſe be greatly endangered.</p>

               <p>THE Depoſitions, which we laid before your Honours, on the 11th Inſtant, concerning the outrageous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which we were attacked, and treated on the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evening, after making Seizure of the Sloop Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mr. Hancock, will beſt deſcribe what happened on that Occaſion, and by our Letter of the 12th your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours will have obſerved the inflamed Temper of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Stipulations that were demanded for a Truce until the Monday; after which Period they ſeemed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take their own Meaſures for Redreſs; the Event however has manifeſted that the Peace and Tranquility of the Town was not the Object they meant to ſeek after; for no Aſſurance was ſent on the Part of Mr. Hancock, either verbally or in writing, that he would agree to any Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the re-delivery of the Sloop; and we are of Opinion, that it was no Part of their Deſign to let go this Plea for breaking out into open Violence.</p>
               <p>After the ruffian Treatment we had experienced on the Friday Evening, merely for executing our Duty, the Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation broke thro', knowing the preverſeneſs of the People, and the Temper of the Times, our Lives threatned, and hearing that even your Honours had been obliged to ſeek Refuge on Board His Majeſty's Ship in the Harbour, our own Safety's became a Conſideration of a very ſerious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Collector has had an Intimation, that he would be laid hold of by way of Reprizals and the Inveteracy againſt the Comptroller is ſo general and confirmed, that they have both been obliged to leave the Town, and ſeek for any Aſylum from the Fury of a diſtracted and enraged Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>The Buſineſs of the Collector is left in charge of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Mr. Sheaffe, and the Comptroller's with his Clerk, both capable of duly executing their reſpective Offices, ſo long as any Officer belonging to the Cuſtoms ſhall be ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this Place. But it is with deep Concern that we acquaint your Honors, of what we hear repeatedly from all Quarters, which is, that a general Spirit of Inſurrection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, not only in the Town, but throughout the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;

               <p>AT Three Clock this Afternoon there was a very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Meeting of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boſton at Faneuil-Hall, when James Otis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was choſen Moderator. But before he came to the Hall, a Motion was made to exclude the Tide Waiters from being preſent, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them being then in the Meeting, but 'twas objected to, as having no Right to ſuch a Proceeding, and that it would be beſt, every one ſhould hear what was to be offered. When the Moderator came, he was uſhered into the Hall by an almoſt univerſal Clap of Hands. By this Time the Hall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite full, and a great number being Outſide, the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was adjourned from the Hall to Dr. Sewall's Meeting-Houſe, as being much larger for that Purpoſe. The Doors of the Meeting-Houſe were ſoon opened, and the People crowded in, when Silence being called, a Motion was made, that a Paper in the Hands of one of the Select-Men might be read, which was a Petition of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boſton to His Excellency Governor Bernard, in which was repreſented the Difficulties and Burthens the Town la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under; in particular with Regard to His Majeſty's Ship Romney, now in our Harbour, and praying his Excellency would cauſe the ſaid Ship to be removed; and a Committee of 21 Perſons was choſen to wait on his Excellency the Governor immediately at his Seat at Roxbury with the aforeſaid Petition, and the ſaid Committee are gone accordingly. In the ſaid Petition Complaint was alſo made of the unlimited Power of the Board of Commiſſioners, and other Grievances; notwithſtanding little elſe was ſaid about the Board of Commiſſioners, or the Riot that happened laſt Friday Evening. A Motion was then made, that the Meeting be adjourned till to-morrow Afternoon 4 o'Clock, which was agreed to by a large Majority, the Moderator firſt making a Speech to the Inhabitants, ſtrongly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace and good Order, and the Grievance the People labour under might in Time be removed; if not, and we were called on to defend our Liberties and Privileges, he hoped and believed we ſhould one and all reſiſt even unto Blood; but, at the ſame Time, prayed Almighty God it might never ſo happen. After the Meeting People's Minds ſeemed ſomewhat eaſy.

                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>MR.—this Morning delivered your kind Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; I am ſincerely ſorry for the III-behaviour of the People, which muſt terminate in their Ruin and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—There certainly is, among ſome of the moſt wicked and abondoned, a ſettled Scheme to oppoſe even the King's Troops landing, if that ſhould be attempted, and they are endeavouring to get the Country to join in that moſt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and vile Undertaking; however, I think it is beyond all Doubt, but thoſe of Property, and the better Sort of People among us, will diſcountenance ſuch intolerable Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and will, notwithſtanding the malicious and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Efforts of a few, loſt to all Senſe of Gratitude to their Mother Country, deſperate in their Fortunes, and in ſhort devoid of all Principles except ſuch as are peculiar to Devils, exert themſelves againſt ſuch a Meaſure, as ſoon as they dare act in Conformity to their own Judgment.</p>
               <p>It is my Opinion, that the Promoters of the preſent Evils are ready to unmaſk, and openly diſcover their long and latent Deſign to rebel, and, if poſſible, to involve this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Country in Blood and Horror. Heaven avert the Evil! to commit to Writing the various Methods, by which they delude the ignorant and perſuade the vicious, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tedious; but in general, nothing is left undone to accompliſh both.</p>
               <p>One of their grand Objects is to ſpread the Infection, and thereby bring all the Colonies to the very verge of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral revolt; if they are diſappointed in this, their Projects will drop of Courſe.</p>

                  <signed>I ſtill am, and will continue to be, Dear Sir, Your ſincere Friend, and moſt obedient Servant.</signed>

               <p>IT is with the utmoſt Concern, that I obſerve a great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs and unuſual Sourneſs in the Minds of the People in general; have much Grieved at the publick Abuſes of ſome great Perſonages among us, who, to ſay no more, have merited very different Treatment. Much might be ſaid on that Head; but to purſue what was more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in my Mind; I don't know, but fear, that the uproar of Friday Night is but a prelude of greater Diſturbances. And, Sir, as my regards for you are unfeigned, I would juſt hint what I have noticed from the ſeveral Quarters, &amp;c. The People, as a People, are exceedingly averſe to the Gentlemen of the Honorable Board of Commiſſioners.—I have heard your Name ofteneſt mentioned.—I have obviated many Things, and anticipated others, to the utmoſt of my poor Abilities.—I know that theſe convulſions among theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt give you Uneaſineſs: but rouſe your Philoſophy.—I fear there will be more confuſion, tho' I do but gueſs, for I am in no Secret; yet at the ſame Time he that runs may read, that without ſome ſpeedy Interpoſition a great Storm will ariſe; which God avert.</p>

Accordingly it became a Rule, that the whole ſhould ſign whatever was ſo agreed on, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Diſſent of any Individual. This (it is ſaid) was very reluctantly complied with by one of them, who immediately applied to the Treaſury to be inſtructed whether ſuch ſigning was indiſpenſibly neceſſary.

               <p>I AM ſincerely concerned to learn by Your Letter of the 15th Inſtant, delivered to me by Mr. Elliot, Collector of this Port, that the Turbulent State of Affairs in the City of Boſton has laid you under the Neceſſity to take Shelter at Caſtle-William, and to have Occaſion for the Aid of His Majeſty's Forces.</p>
               <p>My Inclination would lead me to Order Troops to march immediately for your Protection; but you muſt be ſenſible that it would be highly improper in me to Order Troops into a Province for the Purpoſe of quelling Riots, unleſs Application ſhould be firſt made to that End by the Civil Power.</p>
               <p>I have yet heard nothing on this Subject from Governor Bernard, who muſt be beſt acquainted with the Situation of Affairs in his Province, and the propereſt Judge how far ſuch a Meaſure would be expedient and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Moment he applies to me for the Aid of the King's Forces to ſupport His Majeſty's Government on this or any other Occaſion, they ſhall move to his Aſſiſtance with as much Diſpatch as it ſhall be poſſible for them to do, and as many of them as he can in Reaſon demand.</p>
