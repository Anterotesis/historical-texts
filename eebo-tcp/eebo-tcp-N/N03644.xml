            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Brethren in Chriſt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Chap. x. 23. Exhorts them <hi>to hold faſt the Profeſſion of their Faith without wavering;</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds, as a moſt effectual means for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſo deſirable an end, <hi>Let us conſider one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to provoke unto Love and good Works, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Aſſembling of ourſelves together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Chriſtianity was not then the National Religion, I ſuppoſe by Aſſembling themſelves together, the Apoſtle does not underſtand open Aſſemblies, ſuch as our publick Congregations, but rather little and private Societies, as was the Cuſtom of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, who we are told <hi>continued in Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Apoſtle's Exhortation to the Chriſtians of thoſe Times, and I am fully perſwaded there was never more occaſion for renewing it than in the Age wherein we live: For nothing has of late more alarmed the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, than the Zeal which God has ſtirred up in the Hearts of many, to put in Practice this Apoſtolical Injunction.—Balls, Plays, Horſe-Races and ſuch
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004455_0003_100DA076C8E18B58"/>
like Diabolical Entertainments are countenanced and ſupported by publick Authority.</p>
            <p>Few if any (publickly at leaſt) now dare to ſpeak, preach, or write for Suppreſſing them ſo explicitly as they ought. But if the Children of God meet, as they are required, to build up each other in their moſt holy Faith, almoſt every one's Mouth is opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Nay (with grief, God is my Judge, I ſpeak it) even moſt of our Maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ought to be Patterns and Promoters of every good Word and Work, are not content with Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the ſinful Diverſions and polite Aſſemblies of the Age by their Preſence and Approbation, but are generally moſt bitter in their Invectives againſt Religious Societies, continually crying them down (eſpecially if any life or divine Power appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) as Schiſmatical and Seditious, and as Meetings which have a tendency to weaken the preſent eſtabliſhed Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>For theſe, and many ſuch like Reaſons, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with you in Spirit, tho' abſent in Body, I thought it my Duty to put you in mind zealouſly to perſiſt in Practiſing the 'forementioned Injunction once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints, and ſo much the more as in all probability the Day of Perſecution nearer and nearer approaches.</p>
            <p>There has been a gathering, undoubtedly a winnowing Time will come.—God's Fan is already in his Hand, yet a little while, and if the Work lately begun be carried on, I am perſuaded he will thoroughly purge his Floor. The Shepherds firſt muſt be ſmitten; next endeavours exerted to ſcatter the Sheep. The Religious Societies, Satan no
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004455_0004_100DA07950FE1CE8"/>
doubt has deſired to have, that he may ſift them as Wheat. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> Watch and Pray, that you may be counted worthy to ſtand in ſuch an Hour of Temptation.</p>
            <p>Religious Society is of a Divine Extraction. As God firſt made Man, ſo God firſt ſaid, <hi>It is not good that Man ſhould be alone,</hi> I <hi>will make a help meet for him.</hi>—Meet, as I take it, not meerly for his Body (Man had but few Corporal wants in Paradiſe) but chiefly and primarily for his better Part, the Soul, viz. <hi>that he might have one to converſe with of his own Species, Bone of his Bone and Fleſh of his Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's true, Man is now a fallen, but yet a ſocial Creature. And as the End of his coming into this World, was to prepare himſelf for a better, ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the chief End of Society in general, and Religious Society in particular is, that we may be helps meet for each other, in the great Work of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>Upon this account, the firſt Chriſtians ſo frequently Aſſembled themſelves together, tho' oblig'd to ſhut the Doors for fear of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in Fellowſhip with each other, was one main Reaſon why they continued ſteadfaſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine.—No doubt they went up to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the Hour of Prayer, whilſt the Temple ſtood, but then they thought that no excuſe for their meeting from Houſe to Houſe to edify each other in Love.</p>
            <p>The Societies of which you are Members, I hope, are of this Nature. Take then, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004455_0005_100DA07AE13910E0"/>
Primitive Chriſtians for your Enſamples. Their Practices were Recorded for our Learning. No Power on Earth can lawfully diſanul or prevent out imitating them.—In all ſuch Caſes we muſt obey God rather than Man. Otherwiſe we ſo far deny our holy Profeſſion, and are Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, and tho' becauſe you are got a little out of the uſual formal way, ſome blind Zealots may brand you as Schiſmatical and Seditious, yet if you fear God, truly Honour the King, and are of the Number of thoſe who are quiet in the Land, there's no one Reaſon can be urged againſt your Societies, which will not equally hold good againſt all the Societies in the two great Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Reſpect a private Prelate has no more Authority than a private Presbyter. If it be lawful for more than five to meet in a private Veſtry, it is equally lawful to meet in a private Houſe, as is the Practice of ſome of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Societies who are under the Government of the Twelve Stewards. If they ask you by what Authority you ſometimes uſe Extempore free Prayer? You may ask them again, by what Authority they uſe the Church forms any where but in the Church? If they reply they uſe Dr. <hi>Woodward'</hi>s Form. You may anſwer them with this Queſtion, what difference is there between a Perſons reading a Form which few knew before they heard it, or a Perſons praying Extempore as the Holy Spirit give him utterance? If they laugh at all Pretenſions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Praying by the Spirit, Brethren, I hope you know better. Stand faſt therefore in the Liberty where with Jeſus Chriſt hath made you free. The Church of <hi>England</hi> confines none to forms but in the Houſe of God. In private Aſſemblies, ſuch as yours, all are leſt to their Liberty. Whoever make it their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004455_0006_100DA07D49339F10"/>
Buſineſs to prevent you, diſcover a Spirit too like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old. They are Strangers to the Liberties of the Goſpel themſelves, and thoſe that are Partakers of them they hinder.</p>
            <p>Many trifling Objections were made againſt your Conduct in this particular when I was laſt in <hi>England.</hi> But they were generally urged with ſo much Bigotry and Paſſion, and were ſo weak in themſelves, that I ſeldom thought they deſerved an Anſwer. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſhewed my contempt of them by ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all about them.</p>
            <p>But I truſt, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> you have not built your Houſe upon ſo Sandy a Foundation, as to ſuffer it to be thrown down by a few high ſwelling Words of Vanity. I am perſuaded you think it meet, right, and your bounden Duty, not only to Aſſemble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, but alſo to make uſe of your Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian freedom, and not again to be entangled in a Yoak of Bondage, for God hath called you to Liberty.</p>
            <p>How to improve your Meetings ſo as beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote God's Glory and the Good of your own Souls, ought to be your conſtant and chief Concern. For as Chriſtians in general, ſo Members of Religious Societies in particular, are as Cities built upon a Hill, and therefore it more highly Concerns them, <hi>ſo to let their Light ſhine before Men, that they ſeeing their Good Works, may glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that a perfect Communion of Saints is to be expected here on Earth; or that you ought to be immediately offended, if ſome of your Brethren
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004455_0007_100DA080609C1948"/>
ſhould be over taken with a fault. In this World Tares will be always Springing up amongſt the Wheat. Many that are firſt will be laſt and the laſt firſt. Nay it is well, if ſome, <hi>Judas</hi> like, do not at length lay aſide their Profeſſion and openly betray their Maſter. In all ſuch Caſes, every one that ſtandeth ſhould take heed loſt he fall, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding jealous of his own Heart, and not ſay, <hi>Lord is it my Brother;</hi> but, <hi>is it I that ſhall deny thee next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent ſuch fatal miſcarriages, you ought to be very Cautious, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> whom you admit into Fellowſhip with you.—Examine them again and again whether they be in the Faith. Set them upon proving their ownſelves, and by no Means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into your Brotherhood, unleſs they can produce ſufficient Proofs of their having taſted the good Word of Life, and felt the Powers of the World to come in a ſpecial and ſaving Manner. This ſome may object is not a very good way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply you as to Number: But it is the beſt way my Brethren, to encreaſe Piety amongſt thoſe that you have. And a Society conſiſting of a few ſolid Chriſtians, is far preferable to one that is filled with a great Number of ſuch who do not <hi>bring forth Fruit unto Holineſs, but have only the Fig-leaves of an outward Profeſſion.</hi> Formal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites will do you more harm than good; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may endure for a while and receive the Word with Joy, yet having no Root in themſelves, in time of Temptation they will ſhamefully fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.—<hi>From all ſuch, Good Lord, deliver thy Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004455_0008_100DA08283F3B030"/>
Next to your Care about admitting others, I think it highly concerns you whenever you do aſſemble, to remember the End of your Meeting, and then to uſe the Words of the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> on another Occaſion, you will never do amiſs. Now the End of your Meetings, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> is not that you may think yourſelves more Holy than your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, much leſs to form a Party, or promote a Schiſm or Sedition in the Church or State. No! ſuch Thoughts I truſt are far from you: For they are Earthly, Senſual, Deviliſh! And if ever any ſuch Deſigns ſhould be ſet on foot, I earneſtly pray God, the Abettors of them may be immediately detected, and all their Schemes, tho' ever ſo plauſibly concerted, fall to the Ground. The only End I hope you all propoſe by your Religious Aſſemblies, is the ſame for which you were Created, viz. <hi>The renewing of your depraved Natures and promoting the hidden Life of Jeſus Chriſt in your Souls.</hi> Theſe Terms howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may ſeem fooliſhneſs to others, I truſt, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> are not ſo to you.—I take it for granted, you not only are deſirous of, but already, in ſome meaſure, are bleſſed with a ſaving, experimental Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt in your Hearts. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Man be born again from above and is made a partaker of the Indwelling of God's Holy Spirit, he ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of God.—Whoever denies this to be true in the moſt literal, real, and abſolute Senſe of the Words, knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet as he ought to know.—For it is grounded on a ſelf-evident Truth, viz. <hi>That we are all fallen from God in</hi> Adam, <hi>and muſt be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, ere we can be reſtored to a bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Communion with him again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004455_0009_100DA085C915FD20"/>
The only way to this is <hi>Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—Faith, in Contra-diſtinction to, tho' neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Good Works. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, Whoſoever believeth on me, tho' he were dead</hi> (as we all are by Nature) <hi>yet ſhall be live,</hi> ſays Chriſt himſelf.—And I think it my bounden Duty to exhort you to contend earneſtly for the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, becauſe ſo many blind Guides are lately gone out into the World.—It is much to be feared, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our preſent Preachers are no better than Doctrinal Papiſts.—And however this, to thoſe who having Eyes, ſee not, may be judged an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Cenſure, yet ſurely they cannot juſtly blame me for want of Candour, if they conſider how one of the moſt Orthodox Prelates in the Kingdom in a late Paſtoral Letter, adviſes his Clergy <hi>ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Doctrine of Juſtification in the ſight of God, by Faith alone, as to make Good Works a neceſſary Condition of our Juſtification.</hi> Such Advice from a <hi>Roman Cardinal</hi> would be no more than we might expect, but coming from a Biſhop of the <hi>Church of England</hi> is ſurprizing and much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.!</p>
            <p>God forbid, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> that you ſhould ſo learn Chriſt.—If the Scriptures be true, ſuch Doctrine is abſolutely falſe. The lively Oracles of God no where declare, <hi>Good Works to be a neceſſary Condition of our Juſtification in the Sight of God.</hi> On the contrary, they every where affirm, <hi>that Salvation is the free Gift of God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>—<hi>that we are ſaved by Grace thro' Faith</hi>—<hi>that it is not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould Boaſt.</hi>—No! <hi>my Brethren,</hi> in the great Scheme of Mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt, Boaſting is entirely excluded.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004455_0010_100DA08818E7CB20"/>
We muſt not expect to be ſaved, or any ways to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend ourſelves to God's Favour, by any or all the Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, or ſhall, or can do.—<hi>The Lord Chriſt is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>—His muſt be imputed to us inſtead of our own.—<hi>We are compleat in him,</hi> ſays the Scripture—<hi>We are accounted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith,</hi> ſays the Eleventh Article of our Church. And if ſo, how are Good Works, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our being Juſtified in the Sight of God? If this was to be the Caſe, no Man living ever was or ever will be Juſtified in the Sight of God.—The Law indeed ſays, <hi>Do and Live.</hi>—But the Goſpel brings us the Glad Tydings, <hi>that Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth.</hi>—Chriſt by his Obedience has every Way fulfilled the Law for us,—and God will not deſire to be paid twice.—Chriſt bought our Juſtification. It comes to us free, without any regard to works, paſt, preſent, or to come.—<hi>That we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that which is freely given us of God.</hi> Wherefore to uſe the Words of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Article, <hi>that we are juſtifyed by Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is a moſt wholeſome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve my Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By or through, and not for Faith.—For Faith is only the Mean or Inſtrument whereby the whole Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is apply'd to the Sinners Soul. And whoſoever does thus believe in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> may be aſſured their Pardon is ſealed in Heaven, notwithſtanding they may have lived in an open Breach of God's Commandments all the Time
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004455_0011_100DA089AF8BEBB8"/>
before their Conviction. <hi>Believe,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle to the trembling Jaylor, <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that this Faith if True will be Dead, Idle or Inactive.—For it is not a Faith of the Head <q>An aſſenting to things Credible as Credible, as 'tis commonly defined.</q> The Devils thus Believe and Tremble.—But it is a Faith of the <hi>Heart,</hi> a living Principle wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God, applying that inwardly which was wrought out for him outwardly by Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, and continually exciting the Poſſeſſor of it, <hi>to ſhow it forth by his Works,</hi> not as neceſſary Conditions of his Juſtification, but as Proofs of his having a living Faith, and as ſo many tokens of his Gratitude and Love for what God has done for his Soul. This is what the Apoſtle ſtiles <hi>a Faith working by Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot conclude this better than in the Words of a truly Evangelical Writer now by me.—<hi>The Law</hi> (ſayeſt thou) <hi>muſt be obeyed. I anſwer, Chriſt Jeſus hath done that in his own Perſon, and Juſtified me thereby; and for my own part, I will not labour now to fulfil the Law for Juſtification, leſt I ſhould undervalue the Merits of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and what he hath done without me; and yet will I labour to fulfil, if it were poſſible, ten thouſand Laws, if there were ſo many: And Oh! let it be out of Love to my ſweet Lord Jeſus</hi>—<hi>For the Love of Chriſt conſtrains me.</hi>

Letter ſent over a Sermon on this important Subject, entituled, <hi>What think ye of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed.—A Catholick Spirit of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Love, is what I would earneſtly recommend as worthy the Name whereby you are called. Why ſhould Bigotry or Party Zeal be ſo much as once named amongſt the Followers of Jeſus Chriſt? Our Lord was a Stranger to it. <hi>Whoever did the Will of his Father, the ſame was his Brother, his Siſter and his Mother.</hi> Wherever he ſaw the Marks of a true Faith tho' in a <hi>Centurion,</hi> a <hi>Syrophenician, Aliens</hi> to the common Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Strangers to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> how did he publiſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it? Be followers then of him my Brethren as dear Children, and love all (however in every thing they follow not with us) who love our Lord Jeſus in ſincerity and Truth. Thus it will be in Heaven. Why ſhould not our Heaven begin on Earth? <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> and <hi>Saducees</hi> the <hi>Self-Righteous</hi> and <hi>Free-Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of this Generation, all the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil whether rich or poor, high or low, however different in other reſpects yet agree in this one Thing, <hi>viz. To conſpire againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt.</hi> Why ſhould not the Children of God, notwithſtanding their little Differences unite in one common Intereſt againſt the Powers of Darkneſs. Oh that all that call themſelves Chriſtians were thus minded! How ſhould we ſee the Kingdom of Chriſt come with Power, and Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven. From the beginning it has been his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to divide Profeſſors into Sects and Parties, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby not only to weaken their Intereſt, but to make them believe Religion wholly conſiſted in being of this or that particular Communion.</p>
            <p>

And his ſerpentine Subtiety has ſo prevailed that tho' we all profeſs to hold one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, yet numbers look upon all that differ from them almoſt as Creatures of another Species, and forbid us with ſuch even to Eat. This was once the State of the Jewiſh, as it is now of the Chriſtian Church, but God ſhewed his diſlike of ſuch a Temper, by telling <hi>Peter</hi> in a miraculous Manner, <hi>That he was henceforward to call nothing that God had cleanſed common or unclean, but freely to converſe with all who feared him and worked Righteouſneſs for ſuch were accepted of him. My Brethren</hi> be not you diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to this Heavenly Viſion—For ourſakes no doubt it was written, many hereby will call your Conduct in queſtion (as the Brethren did <hi>Peter</hi>) when they ſpy out your free Converſation in Chriſt—But <hi>Peter</hi> has furniſhed You with an Anſwer. <hi>For as much as God has given them the like Gift as to us, who believed on Jeſus, what are we that we ſhould withſtand God? How dare we make a difference when God has made none? How dare we not freely converſe with thoſe, who have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> content not your ſelves with reading, ſinging, and praying together, but ſet ſome time apart to confeſs your Faults and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Experiences to one another. For want of this (which I take to be one chief Deſign of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings) moſt of the <hi>London</hi> Societies I fear are ſunk into a dead Formality, and have only a Name to live. They meet on a Sunday Evening, read a Chapter, ſing a Pſalm, but ſeldom if ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteach other with the Operations of Gods Spirit upon their Souls. Hence it is that they have only

               </gap> utter Strangers to the State of one anothers Hearts. How little Love or Power of Religion may be kept up by ſuch a low ſuperficial Way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not difficult to ſuppoſe. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> do not you go on in ſuch a Formal round of Duties, but frankly and freely tell one another what God has done for your Souls—For this End you would do well to form yourſelves into little Bands, and without reſerve tell each other what is in your Hearts. None but thoſe that have Experience can tell the unſpeakable Advantages of ſuch an union of Souls—By this Means, brotherly Love will be excited and kept up amongſt you; and you will learn to watch over one another for Good: This will teach you the better, how to pray for each other in your private retirements, and put off, if not totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many Snares of the Devil: For Satan loves ſolitary Virtue, but cares not to tempt him, who he knows will diſcover his Devices to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Beſides, this is a moſt effectual Means for each to try the ſincerity of his own Heart, as well as anothers. No one I think that truly loves his Soul and his Brethren will be ſhy of opening his Heart, in order to have their Advice, Reproof, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and Prayers as his Occaſions require. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Perſon will eſteem it one of the greateſt Bleſſings; nor do I know a better Means in the World to keep Hypocrites out from among you. <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Unbelievers</hi> will pray, read and ſing Pſalms, but none ſave an <hi>Iſrealite</hi> indeed, will endure to have his Heart ſearched. <hi>He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> expect a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: For Chriſts Servants were always the World's

Fools—As for this <hi>Sect,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Paul, we know it is every where ſpoken againſt.</hi> And again, <hi>Paul</hi> had Authority from the chief Prieſts to bring as many as he found of <hi>this Way</hi>—Thus were the Diſciples of the Lord treated in the infancy of the Church; and as it was formerly, ſo it is now in our Days. To be a true Chriſtian, is realy to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous: If you were of the World, the World would love its own, but if you are not of the World, and are in the Number of thoſe whom Chriſt has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the World, <hi>My Brethren</hi> the World will hate you: However it may ſeem a Paradox to the natural Man, yet there was never a true <hi>Saint</hi> who was not accounted a mad Perſon; and they that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt to the End of Time ſuffer Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But God forbid, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> that a little, nay that all the contempt in the World, ſhould any Ways move you from your Profeſſion of the Goſpel. Our Lord was deſpiſed before us; and you know the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt not be above his Maſter. No, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if he be as his Maſter, made perfect by Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings like unto him—Be ſtedfaſt therefore, <hi>My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> quit yourſelves like Men, be ſtrong, be not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt; but follow your-Maſter without the Camp, bearing his reproach. When you are reviled, revile not again, bleſs my <hi>Brethren</hi> but curſe not, be true Followers of the meek and dear Lamb of God, never entertain the leaſt Thought of reſiſting the higher Powers upon any pretence whatever: The Powers that be, are ordain'd of God; whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power; eſpecially becauſe he will not patiently ſuffer

for the Truth ſake, juſtly receives Condemnation to himſelf. <hi>Brethren</hi> I am jealous over you, with a Godly jealouſy. In troubleſome Times many that make a fair ſhew of Religion in the Fleſh, are apt to turn Religion into Faction. I beſeech you by the Mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of all ſuch who would turn Religion into a Party. O let me once more entreat you never ſuffer any ſuch thing to ſubſiſt amongſt you, ſhew that you truly fear God by paying all due honour, tribute and obedience to the King as Supreme, and to Governors, as to ſuch who are ſent by him, remember again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that our Weapons are not Carnal—And that they who take the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword. Chriſtians are to expect Sufferings, and tho' they muſt obey God rather than Man, yet they are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently if need be to ſuffer for ſo doing, but not to reſiſt in any wiſe. <hi>May God make you all thus mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then the Spirit of Chriſt and of Glory will reſt upon your Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> out of the fulneſs of my Heart, I have wrote unto you. Many of you I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſaw, and perhaps never may ſee in the Fleſh. However I love you in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, and heartily beſeech God to bleſs what his Spirit has enabled me to ſend unto you.</p>
            <p>You ſee, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> I have confined my ſelf only to ſuch Things which chiefly concern you as Members of <hi>Societies.</hi> I take it for granted you will take heed to your Ways in common Life and never give the Adverſary room juſtly to ſpeak reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of your Conduct. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> the Eyes of all Men are upon you—Indeed it highly concerns you

to walk exceeding circumſpectly to thoſe that are without—I am ſure you will not be oftended, if out of Love I remind you to perform all relative Duties to Men, with the utmoſt chearfulneſs, and a ſingle Eye to the Glory of God. Let your Obedience, be conſtant univerſal, and uniform, founded on a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith in Chriſt Jeſus your Saviour, that by well doing ye may put to ſilence the Slanders of evil Men—Let your Speech and every Thing you do betray whoſe Diſciples you are. Confeſs your Lord publickly before Men, and be not afraid to tell thoſe that have Ears to hear what God has done for your Souls. It is good to keep cloſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of a King, but it is honourable to reveal the the Works of God—Above all Things, <hi>My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> have fervent Charity among yourſelves—Bear ye one anothers Burdens and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt—Be pitiful, be courteous, be tender hearted, and when a Brother is overtaken with a Fault, ſhew that you are ſpiritual by reſtoring him in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſs.
