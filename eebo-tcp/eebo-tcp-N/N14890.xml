            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The following is the account that ALEXANDER WHITE gave of himſelf to a perſon who viſited him, a ſhort time before his death.</head>
            <p>THAT he was born in Ireland; had not been favoured with a religious education. —That he early gave himſelf up to a ſea-faring life.—Had never been guilty of any vices but ſuch as are common to ſailors.—That he had enjoyed a good degree of reputation, and had been employed both as a mate and maſter of a veſſel; in which ſtations he had conducted himſelf in ſuch a manner, as to obtain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his employers.—That he had fallen in love with a young woman of ſome family and property (whoſe name he prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſe to conceal) but that whenever he thought of his own poverty, he felt mortified. —That in his PRIDE, the horrid temptation that proved his diſgrace and ruin, and that coſt an innocent man his life, took riſe.—That he had the promiſe of a mate's birth on board a veſſel then gone to the Weſt-Indies:—And that as her time of arrival was uncertain, he concluded to ſtep on board the ſchooner in which he committed the murder, that he might paſs away the time, and do ſome little matter for himſelf.—That when he was off Long-Iſland, and never before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did the temptation
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018886_0003_0FA82DC64668B388"/>
to kill the Captain and a paſſenger, ſeize him. He thought with himſelf that if he could kill thoſe two men, who were all the people on board, himſelf excepted, and poſſeſs their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, he ſhould be able to look the young woman and her friends in the face.—He was aſked, Whether he was not ſhocked at the idea of murder?—No, replied he, I was as fixed and determined as it was poſſible to be, 'till I had done it.—How did you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it? With a ſigh and tears in his eyes he anſwered, I knocked him over board.— Did you kill him with the blow, or did he drown? I believe he drowned, ſaid he.— —How did you feel when you had killed him? —My determination was, replied he, to kill the paſſenger, and then poſſeſs the veſſel.— What prevented you putting your purpoſe into execution?—As ſoon as the paſſenger began to ſtruggle with me, I found myſelf, ſaid he, as feeble as a child, and he bound me with eaſe.—What were your feelings after you found yourſelf confined?—I feared, ſaid he, that I ſhould loſe my life for it: but I formed a ſtory that would have ſaved me, provided I had abode by it: which was this that the man who bound me was the murderer: and as there were but two of us on board who could ſay it was not ſo?—Why ſhould the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's word be taken before mine?—How could a jury on the trial, determine which of us was guilty?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:018886_0004_0FA82DC7063A6BE0"/>In this ſtate of mind he was when he firſt arrived in Plymouth goal; as appears by the following extract of a letter written by the Rev. Mr. Robbins of Plymouth to the Rev. Mr. Stillman.—"With reſpect to White's ſtate of mind when he firſt arrived here, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be extremely ſtupid; obſtinately, and with great pertinacity denying the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the murder, with wicked and frequent appeals to heaven. I perceived no traces of knowledge, or the ſenſe of the things of God and religion in him.—I verily think he was exceedingly ignorant, and which alſo accords with his account of his manner of education."</p>
            <p>In this ignorant and ſtupid condition he confeſſed that he remained, 'till a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon viſited him, and put ſome plain and moſt important queſtions to him; which God was pleaſed ſo to impreſs on his mind, that he became alarmed with a ſenſe of his ſins in general, and the crime of murder in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to ſuch a degree, that he could no longer reſt in his then preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>The following is the account of his views and exerciſes of mind, written by himſelf during his impriſonment, and tranſcribed from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts by the gentleman, whoſe name you will find at the end. Theſe extracts contain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the converſation which the perſon mentioned in the introduction, had with him in the goal at Cambridge.</p>

            <head>An extract from Alexander White's papers, written by himſelf, while impriſoned in Plymouth goal, on a charge of Murder, Sept. 5, 1784. Taken from the originals, as follows.</head>
            <p>"I Will proceed to aſſure you, that all that is ſet forth here, is the truth, and nothing but the truth, and what I have experienced of late.</p>
            <p>"Some days after I came to Plymouth, there came a particular perſon to me, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the ſtate of my ſoul, and whether I thought I was fit to depart this life or not. I anſwered, that I could not tell, but I hoped that I was, and if I was not, that God would prepare me for it, and in particular aſked if I had paſſed the great change of converſion? I did not underſtand what the meaning of that was. But when I came to conſider the words that our Savior had expreſſed to Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, John iii. chapter, 3d and 5th verſes. "Verily, I ſay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God," theſe words pierced my very heart, and I could not get over it. I ſtrove many times to baniſh thoſe thoughts from troubling my mind, but it was all in vain; I could not help thinking of my danger of hell. It was almoſt as bitter as death to me to think that I was ſo near hell. But God opened my eyes to ſee there was no doubt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018886_0006_0FA82DC8852473B8"/>
that muſt be my reward, if I died in the ſtate I was in. I made it my buſineſs to look over the law of God, and I found that it required perfect obedience upon pain of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This increaſed my miſery, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to wiſh I never had been born. I found my heart was hardened in ſin, and I could not forſake it. Then I made it my ſtudy to ſearch into my heart—but, alas, the more I ſaw of it, the more it encreaſed my miſery. I found there was nothing in my heart but hypocriſy and deceitfulneſs. O! is this my heart! that I once thought was true to God and man!— I was affraid to look into it any further. I was affraid to truſt in my heart. Oh how I felt! I have many times prayed to God to give me a new heart. But alas, I found that my prayers were all from a deceitful and from a bad heart. I often went to God with the Bible in my hand, and pointing my finger to the words where he promiſed to take away the ſtony heart, and give a heart of fleſh, I begged that he would make his word good to me.— But what grieved me was, I could not be EAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEST in prayer to God. I was expecting every day, I ſhould grow better. But alas, the longer I lived I grew the worſe, and more hardened. It was remarked in Mr. Wilſon's writings, that if I ſlighted the free offer of Chriſt, how Turks, Jews and Pagans would unbraid me forever. This wounded my very heart and ſoul, to think I ſhould be on the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018886_0007_0FA82DCAD3542E60"/>
ſame claſs with thoſe folks. I found many times I was ready to ſtart back to my old hope, and that I had as good die with a falſe hope, as to die in deſpair. O, I felt the heart of an infidel, and was affraid to look up to heaven, for fear that God ſhould pour out his wrath, and conſume me in a moment. For ſometimes I thought that the law of God was too ſtrict for any creature to abound in all things in it. It requires perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all things. How can this be? I was born in ſin, and muſt I be puniſhed with everlaſting damnation for that ſin? Can this be right? But when I come to think, that the Son of God died to anſwer the demands of this law, I was greatly ſhocked and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I thought it muſt be right, or not believe the ſcriptures. I ſeemed as if I was loſt. I knew not what to do. It ſeemed to give me a little comfort to think that others had been in the ſame extremity, and got relief. Though I had but little thought that I ſhould get any relief or deſerved any. I found I was weak and feeble, in fleſh and ſpirit. My thoughts was [were] always wandering. I knew not what to do. I really found myſelf on the brink of that diſmal and dark pit of deſtruction, that there was nothing that was good in me, nor ever to be expected of me. But when I come to think of the words of our Saviour, that "<hi>he came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi>" but I feared I was not one of his flock. O
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018886_0008_0FA82DCBABD38738"/>
this fear terrified my very heart and ſoul.— On a certain night as I lay on my bed, bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my miſerable condition, I was ready to yield that all the laws of God was [were] right and juſt. But I found an inclination to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with God for charging me with original ſin, which I thought I was not guilty of. But I thought, that if <hi>all</hi> the law was right, that this muſt be alſo right. Oh how I felt, when I found I was condemned by the law of God, ſelf-condemned, and my mouth ſtopped in all things, and I become guilty before an angry Judge. I ſeemed as if I was loſt in a barren wilderneſs in a dark, ſtormy night, and had tried many paths, but could not find the right. I ſeemed helpleſs, heart broken, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing myſelf helpleſs, without the leaſt ſpark of merit in all my life, I found, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt cauſe me to yield myſelf into the hands of God, and wait for his pleaſure. If he pleaſed to have mercy on me, that it was more than I deſerved. I had not long yielded myſelf into the hands of God, when I had a glorious view of the excellency of the divine perfections of a moſt holy and merciful God. Next came in view the moſt glorious ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's perſon and his unſpeakable love towards human ſouls. And the heavenly ſweetneſs of the love my ſoul bore towards him and to all his perfections, that ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed the ſoul with the moſt perfect joy and pleaſure imaginable, that I remained
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018886_0009_0FA82DCC4B0BF508"/>
powerleſs for ſome time, in this glorious ſweetneſs of ſoul, that ſo over come me with joy, that I ſtretched forth my arms to receive my Savior into my heart, and ſeemed as if the heavenly beams of glorious light ſhined upon my ſoul with ſuch ſweetneſs, that it is too much for me to attempt to mention. Next, came in view, a clear ſenſe of the holineſs and amiableneſs of the goſpel, and all its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the infinite juſtice and glory that proceeded from it, in every degree. The divine perfection, holineſs, juſtice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the divine law of God—it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for my heart and ſoul to avoid loving it in every degree. O I thought, if I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by it, I wiſhed for all heaven and all the earth to praiſe and adore it forever and ever. If I am deſtroyed, it is juſt, by the law of God. When I come to ſee that Chriſt ſtood with open arms to receive the vileſt and chiefeſt breakers of this holy law, Oh how it increaſed my love! The ſoul being ſtrongly drawn to God and to Chriſt, and to the holineſs of their perfections, that it ſeemed as if the ſoul would depart from the body and aſcend into heaven. When I thought the object that I loved ſo much, died for my ſake, O how it increaſed my love! And when I looked back to my former ſinful life, and ſee how I had abuſed his free gift of grace, I mortally abhorred my proceedings, and reflected on my abominable ſpent life in miſery and darkneſs of ſoul.</p>

            <p>"I will inform you of ſome of the moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of my feelings, ſince I paſſed through thoſe glorious tokens of the workings of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power in this deceitful heart, and this immortal ſoul.—I have mentioned to you the exerciſes of joys, when my ſoul was illu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minated with that marvellous light which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the brighteſt beams imaginable in my heart; and which ſet the whole ſpirit and even body in a kind of heavenly tranſport, with the effects of that conſolation, whilſt I enjoyed that happineſs of ſoul—which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ſeveral hours—and indeed for ſome days, but not to ſuch a great degree. My tongue could not find expreſſions to glorify the great Worker of this excellent, precious and glorious work in ſuch a wicked ſinner. It ſeemed to me, as if I could ſcarcely wiſh to enjoy ſuch a happineſs, when I came to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on my abominable ſpent life, and ſee the evil nature of ſin, and the ſovereign, great Being it is committed againſt. I cannot ſay that it was on account of the puniſhment that was threatened againſt it, ſo much but what grieved me was—ſeeing I had ſo much abuſed all the offers of the goſpel, and ſlighted all the works of his divine power—and that I had been an enemy to him—hated him and all his ways. The devil can do no more than he has power
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018886_0011_0FA82DCE0ECC3540"/>
to do, and I have done all that lay in my power; yea I exerted all my ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with the greateſt vigor againſt heaven, and did the greateſt piece of ſervice to ſatan, that lay in my power, and if I had more power, I ſhould not have been backward to exert it. Which cauſed me to think, that it was almoſt too much for me to expect ſuch a favour from my enemy, whom I have abuſed ſo much, and befriended his adverſary. It cauſed me to think, that I had no right to any bleſſing, that he could beſtow on ſuch an unworthy member of ſatan's diabolical, rebellious, bloodthirſty train.—Oh, if Chriſt had not interceeded, could ever my eyes have looked to heaven for mercy, or ever expected any thing but the puniſhment that the wrath of God could iſſue againſt ſuch an offender and breaker of his holy law!—</p>
            <p>Whilſt I enjoyed theſe heavenly bleſſings, I ſhould have been rejoiced to ſee the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God come, and ſay, <hi>Prepare for death!</hi> I ſhould made anſwer, <hi>I was all ready</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his demand.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, great fears entered my mind, knowing the deceitfulneſs of my heart. I found a great darkneſs of mind and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpirits, which cauſed great thoughts of unbelief to riſe from my wicked heart, and cauſed a great many ſinful thoughts in my mind. Sometimes I would reflect on myſelf for having any doubt of the works of God,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018886_0012_0FA82DD1E1449618"/>
which I found ſo clearly performed in my ſoul. But all this would not ſatisfy my diſconſolate mind, in any reſpect. All this diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed different from what I had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced before. For now, I enjoyed ſtrong hope in Jeſus Chriſt, and I am convinced now that he is both able and willing to ſave the chiefeſt of ſinners, if they are willing to be ſaved and to accept of him as a Savior. Thoſe thoughts cauſed me to be more attentive to prayer than I ever had been before. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continuing ſometime in this ſad condition, I found that God gave me a more clear view of his excellency, in a great many things than I ever had before. And confirmed the truth of all his ſupreme power, and the freeneſs of his divine grace and mercy towards rebellious ſinners—which gave me a full aſſurance that he had beſtowed his bleſſing on me, without any manner of doubt—which cauſed great conſolation in my ſoul, and ſpiritually ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened me, and increaſed my love towards Jeſus Chriſt and all his perfections, when I had ſeen his kindneſs towards me, who had been ſuch a faithful ſervant of the devil and ſuch an enemy to God and all his holy laws. —Job was a man of great patience. But what was that when compared to the patience of God? For had he not unſpeakable patience, would he not conſume us in our wickedneſs, and deſtroy us without mercy! Would he not pour out his wrath and ſink us into eternal
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018886_0013_0FA82DD2E92F7500"/>
damnation and unredeemable miſery?—But bleſſed be his holy name, he waits with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, while we are running our race of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then he convinces us of his ability to ſave—and of our own inability. He ſhows us that we are helpleſs and hopeleſs, and unleſs he interpoſes, we are miſerable and undone forever.—Oftentimes it has cauſed me to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how preſumptuous ſinners dare have the aſſurance to affront and abuſe him before his eyes, who ſeeth all things and knoweth the ſecrets of all hearts. How can we expect to eſcape his righteous judgment—and if not found in Chriſt, his eternal puniſhment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.—If any ſinner is doubtful of the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power of God, and of his obligation to him, how juſt and right would it be for him to ſhow his ability, and make him know his power by puniſhing of him. Our thoughts will be but a poor excuſe before God at that great day that is a coming.</p>

which I have committed againſt God and my own ſoul. I do not reflect on my conduct (in confeſſing the crime) bleſſed be God that my hope is grounded on the ſure foundation that is laid in Zion. My anchor is within the veil, and 'tis utterly impoſſible for it to be removed by the hands of man, or the ingenuity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils—Nothing can remove my hope. Altho' the time draws near and death approaches me, God alſo draws near, and ſtifles the pangs of death and gives me an over coming triumph over the grave. Bleſſed be God, I have the privilege of going to meeting, and have the advice of ſundry faithful miniſters of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And bleſſed be God that I am very well ſupplied with the neceſſaries of life.—I have not time nor opportunity to write to all my friends with you, now—the time draws near that I am to be no more—yet what remains of my heart that is not engaged with God, I leave with them, and I hope they have but a ſmall ſhare.</p>

            <p>☞ BY the preceding papers the reader is informed what the ſtate of <hi>White</hi>'s mind was when he was firſt impriſoned at Plymouth, viz. <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God and religion</hi>:—The means that God made uſe of to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his attention to his eternal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, viz. The converſation of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who viſited him from a tender concern for his ſalvation.—The view he had of his ſinful condition, which reduced him for many days nearly to a ſtate of deſpair—The manner in which he was delivered from his fears of deſerved wrath, viz. By a manifeſtation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, and of the grace of the goſpel to the chief of ſinners, through Jeſus Chriſt; which was followed with the warmeſt expreſſions of love
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018886_0019_0FA82DD6D31BD498"/>
to God, to Chriſt and the divine law. To which may be added, That his tempers and life ever after his profeſſed acquaintance with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were ſuch as became the goſpel. For the truth of which an appeal may ſafely be made to all who knew him in his confinement both at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth and Cambridge.</p>
            <p>The Honourable the Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he was arraigned know with what humility and frankneſs he behaved on his trial. At once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his horrid crime, and refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have any one to plead for him; ſaying, That he was the murderer, that he deſerved to die, and was willing to die. And though brought forth the ſecond day before the Court
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018886_0020_0FA82DD7910C2A90"/>
he declared his guilt as before, and condemned himſelf, becauſe, ſaid he, I dare not tell a lie to ſave my life, knowing that I ſhould thereby of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God.</p>
            <p>He maintained a ſurpriſing tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind to the laſt minute, and took his leave of the Reverend Gentleman who kindly attended him to the place of execution, with a countenance that beſpoke his inward peace in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, though unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably horrid was his crime, may he not charitably be viewed as a brand plucked out of the burning? or as a monument of free and ſovereign grace? Let that God be magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and plenteous in pardon!</p>
