            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE LIFE and DYING CONFESSION of <hi>RICHARD BARRICK,</hi> HIGH-WAY ROBBER.</head>
               <p>I <hi>RICHARD BARRICK,</hi> was born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the month of February, in the year 1763, and brought up in the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Hoſpital: I never could read nor write. At ten years of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018324_0005_0FA5CDFDB860BD40"/>
age I went as apprentice to <hi>James Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> a Silk-weaver in <hi>Spittlefield</hi> Pariſh, lived with my maſter about three years, but he ſtarved and froze me almoſt to death, for which I left him, and roved through the ſtreets, and frequently ſtole ſmall things from ſhop-windows.</p>
               <p>I WENT to <hi>Salt-petre Bank</hi> and joined a gang of thieves. We ſtole from many people for the ſpace of a year; when I was taken up for ſtealing a handkerchief, and carried before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who ſent me to goal. I was tried and found not <hi>innocent;</hi> was complimented with thirteen ſtripes, <hi>which is Continental colours,</hi> ſignifying, that I ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in <hi>America</hi> with the <hi>Hibernian</hi> coat of arms, i. e. two ſticks <hi>rampant,</hi> one couchant, a ſtring <hi>pendant,</hi> and an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> at the end of it.</p>
               <p>I JOINED my old gang again, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued picking pockets for one year, and then was taken up and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goal, and lay there eleven weeks for trial; then tried and found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018324_0006_0FA5CDFE5DF39270"/>
They told me they would pardon me if I would enter on board one of his Majeſty's ſhips; this I conſented to, but made my eſcape before I got to the ſhip. I returned back to <hi>Salt-petre Bank,</hi> where I joined my old companions in iniquity; went on picking pockets for ſix months, and was apprehended on ſuſpicion of robbery, and was ſent on board a veſſel in which I came to <hi>New-York</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEN I deſerted and went to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and lived with Mr. <hi>Volentine Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams;</hi> I left him and lived with Mr. <hi>Kirk,</hi> fifteen months, intending to learn Paper-Making. <hi>During this time I was as honeſt as the times would allow.</hi> I left Mr. <hi>Kirk,</hi> and went to <hi>Horſe-Neck,</hi> intending to return to the place from whence I came, and follow my old trade of <hi>Baſket-Making.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOON after this, I and my comrades went to <hi>Long Iſland,</hi> with an intent to rob <hi>James Ulits;</hi> but the weather being very ſevere, we turned back. On our return, we met with a <hi>Britiſh</hi> veſſel which we boarded, and carried her into <hi>Stanford.</hi> We then went
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018324_0007_0FA5CDFF4C2705E0"/>
back to Mr. <hi>Ulit's</hi> in the night, and told him he muſt get up, for his brother's child was very ſick—He ſuppoſing us to be robbers, call'd for his firelock: We then forced in at the windows, and demanded his money. He ſaid he had none; but his wife aſked us how much we wanted? I anſwered one hundred pounds, Mr. <hi>Ulit</hi> went down cellar with a light in his hand, and we followed him; he took a horn from under a hogſhead, which contained one hundred and ninety odd guineas. He then attempted to count out our hundred pound which we demanded; but we told him that as he made ſome reſiſtance at firſt, we would take all he had. He then gave us another horn, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained about forty guineas: Then he gave us a number of dollars. We went out of the houſe, but ſoon concluded that if he had ſo many guineas, it was more than probable he had ſome other ſort of gold; therefore we went back and demanded the remainder. Then he gave us another horn, containing thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two half joes. We alſo took his plate and cloathing, to the value of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018324_0008_0FA5CE0348E6C730"/>
dollars. We ordered him to give us ſome liqour; he obeyed us. Then we went back to our boat unmoleſted, and gave the man who took care of the boat two guineas.</p>
               <p>AFTER this we went to <hi>Copt-Iſland,</hi> where we divided our booty.</p>
               <p>FROM thence we went to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and tarried there until our money grew ſhort: Then we went over to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> to the houſe of one <hi>Allberſon</hi> where we knocked at the door and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a light: We then demanded his money: He gave us money and plate to the amount of two hundred dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: We eat and drank in his houſe, and then ordered him to keep the matter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for three weeks, which I have reaſon to think he was fool enough comply with. After dividing the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I returned to <hi>Stanford,</hi> and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there until my money grew ſhort.</p>
               <p>I AND my comrades went to <hi>Long-
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018324_0009_0FA5CE03D9C26410"/>
Iſland,</hi> and order'd one <hi>Peter Sniffing</hi> to open his door, which he did; we then made a civil demand upon him, which was, <hi>Give us all your money;</hi> he ſaid he had none. (Take notice that as <hi>Sniffing</hi> knew me, I did not enter the houſe:) After his refuſal one of our gang came out to me for advice: I told him to flaſh a piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol in <hi>Sniffing's</hi> face, and then he would comply; but this had not the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effect; for <hi>Sniffing</hi> had two piſtols and other weapons: However, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and robbed him of money and cloathing.</p>
               <p>WE went from there to <hi>Cow-Neck,</hi> and attacked the houſe of Mr. <hi>John Mitchel;</hi> his wife ſaw us coming, upon which ſhe blew out the candles and bar'd the doors: We ordered him to open the door, which he refuſed; then we burſt the door open with a ſtone. One of <hi>Mitchel's</hi> family fired at us and wounded one of our gang. <hi>Mitchel</hi> fell upon the wounded man who cried for mercy. We retired a little way and held conſultation: Our leader ſaid that one man was wounded
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018324_0010_0FA5CE048D7E6820"/>
and ſhould not be left behind; then we made the ſecond attack upon the houſe, but was obliged to retreat again; then we made the third attack, upon which they left the room: We then brought off the wounded man, who (like a true chriſtian) begged us to retaliate upon <hi>Mitchel,</hi> as he was unable to do it himſelf. All we took from the houſe was the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms: Then we went to our boat; one of our party ſaid he wanted ſome retaliation; that one returned back and met <hi>Mitchel's</hi> ſon at the door, whom he inſtantly ſhot dead. After he had ſhot the young man he ſaid he had got ſatisfaction in behalf of his wounded partner. We made the beſt of our way to the boat and went to <hi>New-Rochel,</hi> where we was hailed by the guard: We told them we had a man wounded by the Refugees. We ran away from the guard, leaving our boat and all behind except our fire-arms.</p>
               <p>WE went to <hi>Greenwich</hi> and gave relief to our wounded partner; there I parted with my comrades. From thence I went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> intending to get
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018324_0011_0FA5CE082C91FD08"/>
ſome employment. I got no work there, and went to <hi>Norwich</hi>—No employment there, I returned to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where I met with the wounded man, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with a well man. The well man went with me to <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> We intended to rob the houſe of Mr. <hi>Titus;</hi> but a guard being kept at his houſe, we hid in a ſwamp, and went from thence to <hi>Sand's-Point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER this I and others broke open the houſe of Mr. <hi>James Mots,</hi> and took from him fifty guineas, beſides plate and cloathing, to the amount of two hundred pounds. We went to <hi>Greenwich</hi> and divided the booty: Then we parted and met again in a fortnight. Then we went to the houſe of Mr. <hi>John Sands</hi> on <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> let us in, I demanded his money: He denied having any. I made ſearch and ſound fourteen dollars, one ſilver ſpoon, twenty-three guineas and one half joe, together with cloathing and plate, to the amount of ten pounds. Then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018324_0012_0FA5CE08592FA5A8"/>
reſcued him; but the purſuers preſſed ſo hard upon us, that they took two more of our party, and brought them to trial; but they availed themſelves of a ſtratagem, and told a falſe ſtory; for they told the purſuers that they were not in our gang; but were endeavouring to take us priſoners. I eſcaped myſelf and kept concealed ſome time. I hid in a hollow rock. After this I went to <hi>Hog-Iſland,</hi> in company with other ſinners: We rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Mr. <hi>Ledlow</hi> of ſix dollars and a watch, and a quantity of cloathing. We returned to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> from thence to <hi>Heton's-Neck;</hi> There we broke open a houſe and robbed the maſter of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty dollars, and cloathing to the amount of thirty dollars.</p>
               <p>AFTER that we went to <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich;</hi> and from thence to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and broke open Mr. <hi>Allberſon's</hi> houſe, and robbed him of twenty-four dollars. (It may not be amiſs to notice here, that I had robbed this man once before.) The next night we went into the houſe of one Mr. Parſons, and demanded his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018324_0013_0FA5CE098F6884E0"/>
money; but there being fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen folks in the houſe, we could not collect them all together. The man of the houſe went on the roof and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an alarm. We went into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and found an iron cheſt, but could not break it open, nor get it cut of the room: The neighbours raiſed a party who fired upon us; but we made our eſcape.</p>
               <p>AFTER this we went to <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> and were diſcovered; therefore we hid our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeveral days. Then we went with an intent to rob one <hi>Henry Poſt,</hi> but were diſcovered, and ran into the woods. We went to a houſe that right and demanded a ſupper; they gave us one.</p>
               <p>SOON after this we ſet out for <hi>New-York,</hi> but were taken and carried before a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonel and examined; they aſked my name, and told me they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to catch <hi>Barrick:</hi> (They did not know I was the man.) I told them my name was <hi>Richard Willis.</hi> The Colonel ordered a party to eſcort me out of the lines; but unluckily for me we met with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018324_0014_0FA5CE09B4F39E48"/>
a party of about twenty. They aſked our party if they had got <hi>Barrick?</hi> The anſwer was, They, had not: but one of their party knew me and called me by my right name, and ſays, <hi>Now we have you we will keep you.</hi> Then they bound me and kept me in that ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almoſt five weeks.</p>
               <p>THE people I had robbed came to ſee me, to know whether, they could ſwear to me out of the whole gang. There were but two of the ſpectators could ſwear to me, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

               <p>CRIME I. I inliſted as a ſoldier in the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018324_0018_0FA5CE0D6A7B32C8"/>
                  <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſervice in the year 1777, and took five pounds bounty; the Captain's name was <hi>Thomas,</hi> of the thirty-ſixth regiment. Went to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in order to join the army, but deſerted.</p>
               <p>CRIME 2. Went to <hi>Wales</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to inliſt the ſecond time, but alter'd my mind and enter'd on board the <hi>Saris</hi> fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, in the King's ſervice, bound to <hi>New-York:</hi> I ſtaid on board <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ar three weeks, and then deſerted. I went to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and there was preſs'd on board a veſſel, ſtaid on board eleven weeks and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
               <p>CRIME 3. I enter'd on board a ſloop bound to <hi>New-York,</hi> but hawl'sd in at <hi>Lovd's-Neck:</hi> When I landed I was diſcover'd and purſued by the Doctor of my former veſſel; he was on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and drove me into the water, but was obliged to come on ſhore and ſurrender; I then received thirty-nine laſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:018324_0019_0FA5CE0E24E7EFE0"/>
CRIME 4. The ſame night I deſerted and ſwam to another veſſel commanded by one <hi>Kelley:</hi> The maſter and I combined together, and ſtole the veſſel, carried her into <hi>Stonington</hi> and ſold her: I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about three hundred dollars for my ſhare.</p>
               <p>CRIME 5. From <hi>Stonington</hi> I went to <hi>New-London,</hi> and entered on board a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer <hi>John Buckley</hi> commander: tarried on board three months; took ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes. I then entered on board another privateer, commanded by <hi>James Woodworth;</hi> after a months cruiſe was taken by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and carried into <hi>New-York,</hi> and put on board the guardſhip, where remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three days, and then was put on board the Leſophe, where I remained 11 weeks: I came to <hi>Staten-Iſland</hi> where I deſerted. I went from thence to <hi>Marrineck</hi> where I was hailed by a ſmall party, and ordered to ſtand: I had a firelock with me and fired on them, but they took me pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and carried me to <hi>Horſe-Neck,</hi> where Col. <hi>Camfield</hi> commanded; the Colonel exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me and gave me a paſs to go to

                  <hi>Stanford,</hi> where I became acquainted with <hi>Barrick,</hi> who is condemned to die with me.</p>
               <p>CRIME 6. In Auguſt one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty two, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in company with a young lad; he and I laid down to take reſt. After he got to ſleep I ſearched his pockets and ſtole one guinea and one crown. After this I entered on board a whale-boat with the perſon I ſtole the money from, we went a cruiſe and came into <hi>Stoning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where I was accuſed of ſtealing the guinea and crown, but denied it: They ſearched me and found the money tied up in the tail of my ſhirt; they cut off my ſhirt-tail and left me. I went to Col. <hi>Davenport</hi> and he gave me a paſs to go to <hi>New-London:</hi> I there entered on board a privateer commanded by <hi>Iſaac Wherar.</hi> We went about eight days cruiſe, and by diſtreſs of weather got diſmaſted: Our veſſel being a wreck and unable to defend ourſelves, we were taken by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> veſſel and carried to <hi>Bermudas.</hi> I then engaged with the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018324_0021_0FA5CE0FDCB3B3B8"/>
Captain who took me priſoner to go to ſea with him. I took twenty dollars bounty. I never went on board after I received the money and cloaths; but rode off on my ten toes and left them.</p>
               <p>CRIME 7. I went about ſeven miles to a place called <hi>Cole-Lane,</hi> and engaged to go on board a privateer, took twenty-four dollars from the Captain and then bid them good night. I next went to St. <hi>Georges;</hi> there I enter'd on board ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privateer, Capt. <hi>Hall</hi> commander, and took twenty-four dollars bounty: We went five weeks cruiſe and returned to <hi>Bermudas.</hi> Being deſtitute of all things, I endeavoured to help myſelf to that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays <hi>will anſwer all things;</hi> and knowing that one <hi>Gutheridge</hi> kept a ſtore there, I took a partner with me and broke open his ſtore, where we found a barrel of dollars; we took our pockets and hats full, then went to a place called <hi>Salt-Kittles</hi> and changed the ſilver for gold.</p>
               <p>CRIME 8. Three weeks after this. I entered on board Capt. <hi>Vezey,</hi> bound to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018324_0022_0FA5CE105CC27128"/>
                  <hi>St. Thomas's:</hi> Peace being proclaimed I went to <hi>North Carolina.</hi> I went from thence to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where I went to work three weeks: Then I and my part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner broke open a ſtore in the day-time and took out twenty-four half-joes an ſome ſilver; my comrade was taken up on ſuſpicion and carried before a Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but made his eſcape; and as was not ſuſpected, was ſent to catch him. I followed on until I overtook him, and he and I contrived the matter between us, ſo that he gave me his ſhoes and buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to carry, and tell the injured people, that I purſued him ſo cloſe that he was obliged to drop his ſhoes and buckles and for this piece of villainy they reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (what they falſely called) my fidelity with two dollars.</p>
               <p>CRIME 9. I then went to <hi>Baltimore</hi> and entered on board a pilot-boat and went to <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> Then went from thence to <hi>New-York.</hi> I then entered myſelf on board a tranſport bound to <hi>Scotland</hi> I ſuſpected there was money on board, nor was my ſuſpicion groundleſs,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018324_0023_0FA5CE13686E5B68"/>
for I and one more found a cheſt, and breaking it open took out forty pounds: Then made our eſcape to <hi>New-York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CRIME 9. Soon after this I got a new comrade, and we broke open a ſhop and took out the value of a hundred pounds in money and watches. I then went to <hi>Newbury-Port,</hi> where I entered on board Capt. <hi>Wheelwright</hi> bound for the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> When I arrived there I went into a trader's ſhop and took to the value of forty pounds, in goods. Soon after this I took another comrade and walking out we met a man in the road: We told him we wanted ſome money, and ſome we would have; the man gave us three crowns. After this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CRIME 10. On Friday night before Commencement, <hi>Barrick</hi> and I went to <hi>Roxbury</hi> with an intent to rob any perſon, but we were diſappointed. The next Monday night we went upon the old er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand but no booty. Soon after this we
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018324_0024_0FA5CE14E2768A50"/>
went to <hi>Winter-Hill,</hi> and there we fell in with one Mr. <hi>Baldwin. Barrack,</hi> and I ſtopt ſaid <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and rob'd him of his watch and money. I took the watch out of <hi>Baldwin's</hi> pocket, but <hi>Poor</hi> was the man that abuſed and gave him heavy blows. For this laſt crime I am to ſuffer death.—Theſe are the moſt capital crimes I have committed, and I ſincerely wiſh that others may avoid the rock I have ſplit upon.</p>

               <p>THIS is to give ſatisfaction to all enquiring Friends, that I <hi>ALEXANDER WHITE,</hi> was born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred and ſixty-two, and was brought up in ſaid place, and got what education my Parents thought neceſſary.

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018324_0026_0FA5CE175D58B5E8"/>
will. I took my departure from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and went to <hi>England</hi> and bound myſelf apprentice to learn the Mariner's art, and ſerved my Maſter faithfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it pleaſed him to give up my inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>I STILL followed the occupation of a Mariner, and improved my education 'till I thought myſelf fit to take the command of a veſſel. I have been through many ſcenes of life, and always endeavoured to ſupport the character of an honeſt man, and I believe I was harmleſs to any body but myſelf. It is needleſs for me to give an account how I ſpent my life; for I have been in many parts of the world, but never did any thing that would cauſe me to bluſh or be aſhamed before I tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this heinous crime that I am to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for.</p>
               <p>If you are deſirous to know what this temptation did ariſe from; with ſhame I will endeavour to inform you: At firſt when I met with Capt. <hi>White</hi> it was in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> My money being

almoſt ſpent I agreed to go to <hi>Nova-Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> with him. Accordingly we purſued our intended voyage as far as <hi>New-York,</hi> and there we took on board our cargo, and came to a place called <hi>Cow-Harbour,</hi> in <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and there tarried ſome days and took on board the paſſenger <hi>John Vail,</hi> and ſailed quickly from thence.</p>
               <p>MY mind being very uneaſy on account of a young lady who I propoſed to marry, and only the want of money prevented our being married. Being below her degree, and being aſhamed to own my neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, prolonged our being joined in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock. But Love began to burn my poor and wounded heart; and being reſolved to go through any difficulty that might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede us, I intended to take the life of my fellow-creature; one evening ſeeing a good opportunity, I took up an ax, and with it ſtruck Capt. <hi>White</hi> over board, and attempted to murder the paſſenger alſo; but when I found I could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my purpoſe, ſurrendered myſelf a priſoner.</p>

                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018324_0028_0FA5CE198CAF8348"/>
I WAS confined for ſome time. Towards morning we fell in with a veſſel, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me into <hi>Plymouth</hi> as a priſoner, and remained there for a conſiderable time, which I ſpent in anguiſh, imploring mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from GOD, for the crime I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
