            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I have therefore Declined that Queſtion, and endeavoured (ſo far as I am able to Diſcern) to keep unto clear Scripture Revelation, in what I have delivered; and ſo to ſpeak, as that the moſt ordinary Capacities might Underſtand and be Edified.

He alſo dreamed that Sir <hi>James Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> whom he had cauſed to be Executed, came to him with a Drawn Sword, and therewith cut off both his Arms, whilſt he was muſing what ſhould be the meaning of that Dream, News was brought him of the Death of both his Sons. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories report, that the Lord <hi>Stanly,</hi> had a Dream, in which it ſeemed to him, that a Boar Gored him, and the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi>; and becauſe the D. of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> gave the Boar for his Arms or Cognizance, it made a dreadful Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon his Spirit, that miſchief was by him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly intended ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="unknown:000756_0009_0FAA4916C279DD88"/>
Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> was Murthered by the Bloody Treachery of that Boar, the D. of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was afterwards K. <hi>Richard</hi> 3. And we know from the Scripture, that an Evil Angel foretold, the Fall of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and the Great Mutations, which ſhould then happen, in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Jewiſh Commentators ſay, that the Reaſon, why <hi>Saul</hi> cut off the Witches throughout the Land, was, becauſe they Foretold that <hi>David</hi> ſhould be King. I Remember, that once in Diſcourſe with the Learned Doctor <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> concerning his Book of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, he ſaid to me, that his Judgment was, <hi>That the Evil Angels had</hi> Praenotions <hi>of many Future Things, and did accordingly give ſtrange</hi> Premoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of them.</hi> No doubt it is often ſo, and yet as <hi>Lavater, Schottus,</hi> and others have noted, there are ſometimes Things ſignified by <hi>Angels,</hi> which it is not eaſy to determine of what ſort thoſe <hi>Genii</hi> are. What ſhall be thought of the <hi>Phantom,</hi> which appeared to General <hi>Veſſelini,</hi> aſſuring him that he might take the City of <hi>Muran,</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of a Widow which Lived in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſtrangely came to paſs accordingly, in the Year 1644. There comes to my mind a very Unaccountable Thing, which happened at <hi>London</hi> above Thirty Years ago. It was this, One Mr. <hi>Cutty</hi> (an honeſt Citizen) paſſing between <hi>Milk-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Wood ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> 1664. took up a Letter Sealed. The Superſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof was theſe words following; <hi>From
<pb facs="unknown:000756_0010_0FAA49175FB03690"/>
Geneva, to a Friend.</hi> Within the Letter theſe words were Written.
<q>This is to give both timely and ſpeedy Notice, that in the Year 1665. in the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> ſhall begin a Plague, and hold very Hot, till the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> and then ceaſe, but not quite; and then go on, till the latter end of the Spring the next Year. And in 1665 and 66. putting both together, ſhall not only happen a Plague, but great Sea Fights, ſuch as the like was ſcarce ever heard of; and this ſhall not be all, but in the Year 1666. on the Second of <hi>September,</hi> ſhall happen a Fire, that ſhall Burn down One of the Eminenteſt Cities in the World.</q>
Mr. <hi>Cutty</hi> carried the Letter to the then Lord Mayor. A Reverend Divine in <hi>London,</hi> who was of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, had a Copy of it, before the ſad Things here Praedicted came to paſs; and at my laſt being at <hi>London,</hi> was pleaſed to favour me with it, as 'tis here Related. This Account bing certainly true, and very ſurprizing, I thought it not unworthy the Publication.</p>
                  <p>As for the annexed Diſcourſe, concerning <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Apparitions,</hi> more Inſtances than one or two, here in <hi>New-England,</hi> of Appearing Pretended Angels, have made it neceſſary, that ſomething ſhould be Written to prevent the Deception of ſeveral that have been, and of others, that were in Eminent Danger of being Impoſed upon. Some may think it Extraordinary, That ſuch Things ſhould happen in a Place, where the Light of

Some Good men have Credited ſtrange Relations about <hi>Apparitions of Saints Departed,</hi> as well as of Angels. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, (<hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) reports that <hi>Potamiaena,</hi> three days after her Martyrdom, appeared to <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and cauſed him to turn a Chriſtian; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to many in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> on whom the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the like Effect. Fabulous Relations (and ſuch I take thoſe of <hi>Euſebius</hi> to be) are more like to Confirm Infidels, than to make Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I have reaſon to believe, that it has been a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercy to this Country, that the pretended Angels have been ſuſpected to be no better than <hi>Satan transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light.</hi> Nor is it at all to be wondred at, that the Spirits of Darkneſs ſhould be able to Deceive mens Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; making them believe that they ſee that which is not. A man that is Skilled in Opticks, may Impoſe on the Senſes of others, as did <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> when he cauſed Admiration in his Friend <hi>Braſſieus</hi> by Repreſenting to him a Company of Souldiers, marching in his Chamber; but this proceeded from the ſmall Figures of Souldiers which he concealed, and by a Glaſs brought ſuch multiplied without doors. And who, that has Read <hi>Porta, Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Zimara, Weckerus,</hi> or ſuch like Writers, knows not that by Natural, without Superſtitious Magic,
<pb facs="unknown:000756_0012_0FAA4918A0BA0188"/>
Things of this Nature may be done? How eaſy then is it for <hi>Daemons,</hi> who have a perfect Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in <hi>Opticks,</hi> and in the Power of Nature to deceive the Eyes, and delude the Imaginations of Silly Mortals?</p>
                  <p>It was in my thoughts to have Written ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning that Power, which by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Righteous Judgment of God, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Angels have over the ſinful, miſerable Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.

But the Scriptures aſſures us, that <hi>Balak</hi> ſent for that Infamous Southſayer <hi>Balaam,</hi> to Curſe his Enemies, which he would never have do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>hat <hi>Balaam</hi> could by his Charms do ſuch things. And the reaſon of his being no more affrighted when his Aſs ſpoke to him, was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs becauſe he did not at firſt think that it was a Good Angel that ſpoke, but rather one of thoſe Evil Spirits with whom he had maintained a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Converſation. Nor can it be denyed, but that there are curſed Books in the World, which Inſtruct men what Ceremonies they muſt uſe, and what Words they muſt utter, that ſo when the <hi>Signals</hi> which are of the Devils <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> are obſerved, he may do what his Worſhippers deſire of him, ſo far as the moſt High ſhall give him

Leave, without whoſe Permiſſion he cannot ſo much as enter into any man's Swine. The Superſtitious Gentiles of Old, ſet a very High Price on ſuch DIABOLLICAL-BOOKS. The Converted <hi>Epheſians</hi> burnt thoſe Books, and they counted the Price of them, and found it to be Fifty thouſand Pieces of Silver, which amounts to One Thouſand Five Hundred Sixty Two Pounds, Ten Shillings, Engliſh Money, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19. Becauſe the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were notorious for doing Miſchief by Magical Spells [<hi>EPHESIA GRAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATA</hi>] became a Proverb. That ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Satan cannot always hurt whom they would is moſt certain. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a famous Miniſter and Martyr) found it to be ſo, when he made the Attempt. It is Related in the Life of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that Magicians did in vain ſeek to do him Hurt. One that many years ſince was Executed at <hi>Hartford,</hi> in <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi>-Colony, on the Account of Witchcraft, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that ſhe had Employed Evil Spirits to be Revenged on ſeveral; but that when ſhe would have had them do the like to Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> (the Eminent Teacher of the Church there) they told her, they had not leave to do it: Nor is this to be Evaded by ſaying ſome Perſons (as of late in <hi>New England</hi>) have falſly accuſed themſelves, for this Perſon was upon Rational Grounds, thought to be a true Penitent, before her death. We cannot argue, that becauſe ſome have failed in their curſed Attempts, that therefore never

any Succeeded. But the known Succeſs of many was that which Emboldned others to Endeavour the like. Some of the Indian <hi>Pawaws (i. e.</hi> Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards) in this Country, having received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and given Good Evidence of a True Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God in Chriſt, have, with much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Heart, declared how they had, whilſt in their <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> by the hands of Evil Angels Murdered their Neighbours. There are, who, by <hi>Spells</hi> or Muttering a few words, have cauſed Diſeaſes to be Removed from thoſe, that have applyed themſelves to them. It is Impudence to Deny this, ſince the Perſons are Extant among us, concerning whom it is to be Averred. But if the <hi>Charms</hi> of Impious <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> will cauſe Inviſible Agents, to heal Diſeaſes, Reaſon ſays, they may as well have Power to Inflict them. Theſe are plain, clear Arguments, and it is more eaſy to Slight and Ridicule them, than to give a Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. But of this, no more, nor have I mentioned Theſe Things, as expecting that <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> or <hi>Semiſadduces,</hi> who are Judicially harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Error, will be Convinced and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (for no Arguments in the World will ever do that) Nevertheleſs, others will be Confirmed in the Truth thereby.</p>
                  <p>We ought to Admire the Grace of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us Sinful Creatures, in that, He has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed His Holy Angels to Guard us againſt the Miſchiefs deſigned by Wicked Spirits, who are
<pb facs="unknown:000756_0015_0FAA491BF0CEFEC0"/>
alwayes Intending our Hurt, both as to our Bodies and Souls. After the Pſalmeſt had ſaid, <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that Fear Him, and delivereth them,</hi> he adds immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately O! <hi>Taſt and ſee that the Lord is Good</hi>; herein <hi>Good,</hi> in beſtowing ſuch a <hi>Guard</hi> upon us. It was (as that Great Divine Doctor <hi>Arrowſmith</hi> well obſerves) an Act of Royal Benignity towards <hi>Mordecai,</hi> in King <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> to make the chief Favourite in the Court his Attendant; but how much Greater is this Kindneſs? That the Bleſſed Angels, thoſe Fevourites in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhould be Miniſtring Spirits for them, that ſhall be Heirs of Salvation! Although they are Miniſtring Spirits, we may not ſuppoſe them to be our Servants, no more than the Shepherd is the Servant of the Sheep, whom his Maſter Commands him to look after. They are in themſelves far more Noble Creatures than we are, Nevertheleſs, out of Obedience to GOD Their Father, and Our's, and out of Love to us, their Younger Brethren, of whom they have a moſt tender Care, they do, without Grudging, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Charge committed to them, as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> expreſſes it: The <hi>Natives</hi> of Heaven grudge not to Guard Thoſe who are only <hi>Free Denizens</hi> thereof.

And indeed, reaſon doth dictate no leſs unto men; for it is evident, that there are Evil Angels: Men cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that. And it was manifeſt from the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Gentiles of old; the Evil Angels did ſpeak in them. This alſo is ſadly evident from Bodily Poſſeſſions, of which every Age gives inſtances to the World. Now then, if there are Evil Angels, reaſon ſaith, they were once good: they are not originally Evil. The Creator, who is Perfect, Infinite, Goodneſs, did not make them Evil: they muſt needs come Holy out of His Hands. And if the Evil Angels were once good, we may rationally conclude, that there are ſome who are as originally they were Holy Spirits. Hence the Gentiles, who had not the Light of Scripture to inform them; nevertheleſs believed, that there were good, as well as evil Spirits. They have ſaid of God, that He is [<hi>PATER AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRONTE THEONTE</hi>] the Father of Spirits, as well as the Father of Men.</p>

That there is a diſtinction among the Angels, in reſpect of Office, and that ſome are Superior to others, is clear from that Scripture, in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking concerning the Creatures in the Inviſible World, doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them into <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers.</hi> Now Thrones are Superiour to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; Dominions to Principalities; and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities to Powers: The words allude to Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governments.

When <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to Preach the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Family, it was an Angel that did direct him unto them. When <hi>Paul</hi> and other Miniſters Preached the Goſpel to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> an Angel of Heaven by Divine Appointment, cauſed them to do it, <hi>Acts.</hi> 16.9. Paul had a Viſion, there ſtood a man of Macedonia, and Prayed him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Come over into Macedonia, and help us</hi>: h. e. He ſaw an Angel habited like a Macedonian, who ſpake thoſe Words to him, whence he and others with him concluded, that they were called to Preach the Goſpel in Macedonia, and that God and his Angels would be with them there. Towns and Cities in which there are Churches of Saints Worſhipping God in Chriſt, have no doubt their peculiar Angels to watch over them. When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was beſieged by the Aſſyrians, it is ſaid the Angel of the Lord <hi>went out</hi> and ſmote the Camp of the Aſſyrians, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35.

The Angels are thoſe <hi>Holy Ones,</hi> that Watch the World: They are the great Intelligencers of Heaven, whom the Lord Chriſt ſends throughout the Earth, to obſerve, and give him an account, how the Affairs thereof are.

Hence it is ſaid, that the <hi>Living Creatures,</hi> (Angels I told you are meant by the Living Creatures) <hi>ran and returned, as the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Flaſh of Lightning.</hi> Ezek. 1.14.

They are unto ſuch as fear God, as a Lamp, to direct and light them: but they are unto wicked men, as Coals of Fire to conſume them. This we ſee deſcribed at large in the 6<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Zachary,</hi> from the firſt to the ninth verſe; where we read of four Chariots, that is to ſay, the Angels of God, ſent forth into the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the World, North, South, Eaſt &amp; Weſt: and the Horſes that repreſent the Angels, appear in ſeveral Colours: there was <hi>Red Horſes,</hi> noting bloody Judgments, Deſolations by War, and this by the Miniſtry of Angels; <hi>Black Horſes,</hi> ſignifying the Peſtilence and Famine, and the like Judgments coming upon the World; and <hi>White Horſes,</hi> intimating Victory and Mercy to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; and there were <hi>Griſled Horſes,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematically ſetting forth mixed Diſpenſations of Divine Providence: and all by the Miniſtry of Angels: Of theſe the Lord ſayes, <hi>They have qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted my Spirit in the North Country.</hi> The Angels were ſent into the North-Country, namely to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to Execute Judgment there; and then the Holy Spirit of God was ſatisfied, when He ſaw, that Juſtice was done by his Angels, on his and his People's Enemies. <hi>David</hi> Prayed that Judgment might be Executed on his Enemies, by the hands of Angels. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.5, 6. <hi>Let the Angel of the Lord chaſe them, and let the Angel of the Lord Perſecute them.</hi> It is true, that no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs, the Lord is not wont to Execute Judgment upon men, by His own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand, but by the Miniſtry of Angels: When it is done by men, yet Angels have an hand therein. Sometimes indeed by the Hands of Evil Angels, whom the Lord lets Looſe, and puniſhes a wicked World by them; but many times by the Hands of His Holy Angels. Thus, when <hi>Sodom</hi> was Deſtroyed, they were the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven, that did that terrible and glorious work of Juſtice, on provoking Sinners.

And we find in the Scriptures, that the Fearers of the Lord have been excited unto and directed in, that which hath been their duty, by the Angels of Heaven. Thus <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife, were directed by an Angel, after what manner they ſhould Educate their Son. Thus when <hi>Elijah</hi> was in a ſtrait, whether to ſhew himſelf to the King or no, <hi>An Angel of the Lord ſaid to him, go and be not afraid, and he aroſe, and went to the King.</hi> 2 King. 1.15. Thus again, an Angel ſpoke to the Apoſtles, and bid them go, and Preach the Word of Life in the Temple. <hi>Act</hi> 5.19. It was an Angel that directed <hi>Philip,</hi> to go to the place, where he met with a Great man, whom he inſtructed in the Principles of Religion: and by means of that man, was a whole Kingdom Enlightned in the Knowledge of Chriſt. The Angels, like faithful Tutors, and Monitors, do ſometimes correct and diſcipline the Children of God, when they have offended.

They that Fear God are the Family on Earth: the Angels of the Lord are of the Family in Heaven: it is meet that there ſhould be a Communion between thoſe that are of the ſame Family.

And therefore the Love of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels unto the Children of God, is confirmed and increaſed: Love is increaſed by kind offices: we ſee, that Nurſes have a ſpecial affection, to the Children that have been foſtred by them. So

have the Angels of God unto His Children, that have been under their Care and Education; thoſe Heirs of Salvation, whom from their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle unto their Graves, they have been foſtring and taking care of, they muſt needs have a great affection for. Holy Angels, and all ſuch as truly fear God, ſhall live together in the ſame Heaven, World without End.

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Miniſtry of Angels is limited by the Holy Pleaſure of God.</hi> Pſal. 103.21. <hi>The Angels that do His Pleaſure.</hi> And therefore ſo far as it is the Pleaſure of God, to have them to ſecure, or to deliver his Children from outward Evils, they

of it is not, that the Angels of the Lord are not able to prevent the Calamity, or that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way invigilant or negligent in that which is their Charge; they always do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, as in the Pſalm but now, <hi>Ye his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that do His Commandments.</hi> They know, what the Pleaſure of God is, and act accordingly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It is poſſible, that ſuch as belong to God, may, (and too often they do) give way to Sin and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſo deprive themſelves of the Protection of God, and His Angels.</hi> By Sinning againſt God, they provoke him to countermand and ſuſpend the wonted Protection of His Holy Angels.

It is indeed, a bleſſed truth, that God will not utterly depart from any of his Faithful Servants; he will not utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them; for ſo his Covenant is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Nevertheleſs, he may for a time, and he may in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure forſake them, in caſe they ſin againſt him: As it was with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> though he did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it at the firſt: <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.20. <hi>He wiſt not, that the Lord was departed from him.

True Believers may grieve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and grieve him away from them, ſo as that the Comforter, that ſhould relieve their Souls, ſhall be far from them. When any of Gods Children doe behave themſelves, ſo as to grieve his Spirit, the Angels are alſo grieved: and if the Spirit of God goes from them, the Angels of God go from them too; for they are perfectly directed and acted by the Eternal Spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.20.

The Glory of that Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to God, and not to them, when He was pleaſed to effect it by their Agency and Miniſtry. They have all their power from the Lord. What ſtrength they have, it is God that hath given it to them: and their Commiſſions are granted to them by the Lord. The Charge that they have, it is God that gives them that Charge: <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge. Pſal.</hi> 91.11. And therefore they don't act, till they have order from God. When they have done one work, that they are ſet about, before they enter upon another, they muſt have a new Commiſſion, and new Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, new Orders from that God, who is the Lord of Angels.

                     <p>Inference 1. <hi>Hence, although Angelical Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not to be expected in theſe days; nevertheleſs, the Miniſtry of Holy Angels, doth continue ſtill.</hi> Their <hi>Appearings</hi> are in a great meaſure ceaſed, but their <hi>Working</hi> is not ceaſed, but continues as in former times. Indeed, there is not need now, as in the Dayes of the Old Teſtament, for Angels to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear viſibly unto men, becauſe the Scripture is now perfected, there muſt be no Addition made unto the Written Word of God, which now is ſufficient to direct men in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that may concern their Salvation and Conſolation. There was need for an Angel to appear to <hi>Daniel</hi> viſibly, to inſtruct him, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhould befal the People of God: and of an Angel to appear to the laſt Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> to inform him, what ſhould befal the Church in all future times. There is no need of that now: we muſt look into what <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> have written; and there we may ſee, as much as is meet for us to be acquainted with. So that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Apparitions</hi> are not frequent in theſe Days: Only Evil Angels do appear more often than
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000756_0080_0FAA495F23487C68"/>
good Ones. No wonder, becauſe they are of more Earthly Inclinations, than thoſe Spirits, that dwell above. Evil Angels do often appear; very true, and ſometimes pretending to be good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels too. The Apoſtle ſaith, 2 Cor. 11.14. That <hi>Satan doth tranſform himſelf into an Angel of Light.</hi> He cometh to men, and appears viſibly to them, and pretends to be an Angel of Light, and will give them good counſel, will pretend to be for Truth, and for Holineſs, although he doth intend nothing leſs. I could mention to you inſtances reſpecting this. There was about four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago, in a place belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark's</hi> Dominions, a Young man, that a <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> appeared to, on a Lord's-day, in white ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Garments, and gave him excellent good counſel, telling him, that he muſt not ſin, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had done; and that he muſt call upon others to amend their ways, to leave their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; Swearing, &amp; other Sins; &amp; that he ſhould pray to God every day three times; &amp; he would joyn with him in ſinging a Pſalm too. And yet this <hi>Daemon</hi> did at laſt appear to be an Angel of Darkneſs. There was in <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Son of a Senator there, that was miſerably impoſed upon, by a <hi>Daemon,</hi> pretending to be a good Angel; that would complain of the Unbelief of ſome, who would not (though many did) look upon him as an Angel, that was ſent from Heaven. And yet this <hi>Daemon,</hi> that appeared in a glorious manner, was at laſt diſcovered to be an Unclean
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000756_0081_0FAA495FEF34CEF0"/>
Devil. I do the rather mention theſe things, becauſe I underſtand, that ſomething of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath lately happened in <hi>New-England,</hi> which I am perſwaded, will in the iſſue appear to be a Deluſion of the Evil One, that pretends to he an Angel of Light. Wherefore it is an unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a very dangerous thing, for men to wiſh, that they might ſee, and that they might converſe with Angels. I could tell you of ſome, that have done ſo, &amp; God hath been provoked with them for their curioſity and preſumption, and hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Devils to come to them, pretending to be good Angels, whereby they have been deceived and undone. But I ſay, although Angelical <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions</hi> are not to be expected; nevertheleſs, their Miniſtry is ſtill continued, and it ſhall be ſo: As long as there ſhall be any Fearers of God upon the Earth, ſo long ſhall there be Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Encamp round about them: That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. doth belong unto Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, even to the End of the World; that God will ſend his Angels, and give them Charge over them, to keep them in all their ways, and to hold them up in their Arms, that they may not daſh themſelves againſt a ſtone. Yea, as long as there ſhall be any of the Elect of God in the World, ſo long ſhall there be the continuation of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Holy Angels <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not ſent forth to be Miniſtring Spirits, to them that ſhall be Heirs of Salvation?</hi> They then that are Heirs of Salvation, in all Ages of the World, are

priviledged with this Miniſtry of the Angels.</p>
                     <p>Inference 2. <hi>For men to deſpiſe and abuſe them that fear the Lord, muſt needs be an evil and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing.</hi> For they have Angels to guard them. The Angels of Heaven are far from deſpiſing them. There are no Nurſes in the World, that do ſo tender the Children Educated by them, as the Angels do the meaneſt Saint on Earth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Care: Saith Chriſt, <hi>Deſpiſe not one of my little ones</hi>: Deſpiſe them not, ſaith He, <hi>For I ſay unto you, that in Heaven their Angels do alwayes behold the Face of my Father, that is in Heaven.</hi> Math. 18.10.

There is not a Monarch upon Earth, that hath ſuch a guard about him, as every one that truly fears God, hath round about him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. The Souldiers of Heaven do attend him, where ever he goes. If the eyes of wicked men were enlightned (as once the Eyes of the Prophet's Servant) they would not deſpiſe Holy men.

his Maſter, the Prophet prayed, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, open his Eyes</hi>: and preſently he ſaw the Mountain full of Horſes and Chariots of Fire: his Maſter's Houſe was all ſurrounded with Angels. Did men ſee this, they would not caſt contempt upon thoſe that fear God. To abuſe them, is a dangerous thing: One of thoſe Angels, that they have a whole guard of, is able to deſtroy all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they have in the whole World.

So if the Angels of God, are by his appointment for us, we need not fear, though we ſhould be in as eminent danger, as <hi>David</hi> was in, when amongſt the Philiſtines in <hi>Gath.</hi> Angels are able to defend us, and will do ſo, ſo far as a gracious God and Father ſhall ſee it meet for them to do. We have more for us, then are againſt us, if we have Angels to be for us, as the Prophet ſaid unto his Servant, when they were ſurrounded with enemies: the Servant was afraid; <hi>Alas Maſter, how ſhall we do?</hi> ſaid he: <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſays the Prophet, for <hi>there are more with us,</hi> than are with our enemies. And God opened the eyes of the young man, and he ſaw the mountain was full of Chariots and Horſes of fire, round about <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 King. 6.17. <hi>viz.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that did ſo appear at that time. What tho' men are in danger; if they have a ſtrong convoy, they do not fear. This is the caſe of Gods Children, whilſt in this World: they are in danger; they are like men at Sea, &amp; in the midſt of enemies: the Pirates of Hell are ſeeking to lay hands on them: But they have a ſtrong convoy; they have Angels of Heaven to be a guard unto them: &amp; therefore need not be afraid of what their Enemies can do
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000756_0085_0FAA49655D992218"/>
unto them. They that fear the Lord, may be above the fear of danger, when they go to Sea; only let them look to their call; let them look to it, that they are in Gods way; then He will ſend his Angels to look after them. So in great and hazardous Journies by land, they need not fear, but they ſhall go forth; and return in ſafety: If it be good for them to be preſerved and protected, it ſhall be ſo, notwithſtanding what ever evils may attend them in their way. Angels are more able to defend them, than all their enemies are able any way to hurt them. It was ſaid concerning the Egyptians, Iſa. 31-3. <hi>They are Fleſh and not Spirit</hi>; they are poor weak Creatures. But now the Angels are Spirit and not Fleſh: why then ſhould they that fear God, be afraid of what their enemies can do unto them, who are fleſh, and not ſpirit, when they have thoſe to be their Guardians and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that are ſpirit and not fleſh? And they need not fear ſickneſs and diſeaſes; God will ſend his Angel to deliver them, if preſervation from ſuch a diſtemper ſhall be beſt for them. Pſal. 91.10. <hi>There ſhall no evil befall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</hi> How ſo? It follows in the next verſe, <hi>for he ſhall give His Angels charge over thee.</hi> So he doth wonderfully ſometimes. I remember a Lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

there, and make the Town deſolate: He took the warning, and ſo eſcaped the danger. God hath ſtrange wayes, by his Angels to deliver his Servants in times of ſickneſs and common danger, when it ſhall be moſt for his glory. And they need not fear, what evil Angels can do unto them. The Lord for holy ends may ſuffer you to fall into the hands of thoſe cruel Creatures: but if you fear God, there are Holy Angels by, that will not forſake you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will inable you to endure, whatever God ſhall ſee mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, to ſuffer you to be tempted and afflicted with. And therefore be not afraid: only fear God, and truſt in Him. And then, ſuppoſe the worſt that can be ſuppoſed; ſuppoſe the Lord ſhould give leave to thoſe enemies to kill your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſuch a thing may, and ſometimes has happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the dear Servants of God: nevertheleſs, their Souls are ſafe, as being in the hands of Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.

That the fearers of the Lord may and ought to be above the fear of outward evils, from the conſideration of the Miniſtry and Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianſhip of the Holy Angels, is evident from ſeveral things; which we may take notice of &amp; conſider. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They are of all Creatures the moſt powerful</hi>: they are wonderful in ſtrength, Pſal. 103.20. <hi>Ye his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that do excel in strength.</hi> They are not only

men: it is a joy to them, when good happens to them that fear God, their Lord and ours, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11, 13. You ſee here, how glad the Angels were, when there was good tidings for us men: The Angel ſaid unto the Shepherds, <hi>I bring you glad tidings of great joy, unto you a Saviour, Chriſt the Lord, is born. And there was with the Angel a multitude of the Heavenly hoſt, Praiſing God and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth Peace, good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men.</hi> When God did manifeſt his good will toward men, the Angels were glad, and did break forth into holy Praiſes, becauſe there is by Chriſt Peace made between Heaven and Earth. Thus alſo they rejoyce at the Converſion of the Elect of God. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>There is joy in Heaven over a ſinner that doth repent,</hi> Luk. 15.7. And how joy in Heaven? in Verſe 10. It is explained by ſaying, <hi>There is joy among the Angels</hi> over a ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth: They rejoyce to ſee, that there are Souls <hi>New born,</hi> to fill up thoſe places, which the Apoſtate Angels have left Vacant in Heaven.

So that when once Grace is wrought in his Soul, he may be ſure, that the Angel of the Lord Encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth round about him: But before that, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the comfort of this Truth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is certain, that the Angels do not delight in thoſe that fear not God.</hi> They don't care to be in their Company.

If holy men cannot do it, Angels who are holier than they, can never do it.

                  <p>THere were in the Primitive Times (as there are in theſe days) men, who altho' they did call themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, had apoſtatized from the great Truths of the Goſpel, imbracing Fundamental Errors in Religion. The Apoſtle in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter, ſhews, that ſuch cannot Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Deſtroying Judgments of Heaven, which would unavoidably come upon them.

of what had befallen other Sinners. There are three exceeding awful Inſtances here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.

                     </gap> that were Condemned by an Eternal Overthrow. When they ſinned againſt God, he puniſht them with the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Eternal Fire. The words at preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, fall under the firſt of theſe Examples, namely, that <hi>Of the Angels which ſinned.</hi> I have ſpoken many things to you concerning the Holy Angels, who never ſinned againſt God.

                  <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> therefore to be inſiſted on, is,
<hi>That the Holy God hath made the Angels which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Examples of Judgment without mercy.</hi>

                  <p>There are divers things contained in this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That all the Angels were once without Sin.</hi> As for the Angels that ſinned, there was a time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>They were in the Truth,</hi> as it is ſaid of them, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.44. Their Firſt Eſtate was a State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. They were once adorned with the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Image of God: and on that account they were <hi>The Sons of God,</hi> Job 38.7. the Sons of God, in reſpect of their being like unto him, and made after his Image in their Firſt Eſtate. They did not come ſinful out of Gods Hands: that could not poſſibly be, for then God ſhould be the Author of Sin, which 'tis impoſſible that he ſhould, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> proves. <hi>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man: Every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> Jam. 1.13, 17. All good is from God, ſaith the Apoſtle: and therefore evil, moral evil, ſin, cannot be from him; for then he ſhould be variable and ſubject to change, as Creatures are, which the Bleſſed God is not: and therefore He is not the Author

of ſin. The Angels then that ſinned, were pure and ſpotleſs, as they came out of His Hands: Thoſe very Angels, which are now in Hell, were once in Heaven. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>That they left their own Habitation.</hi> Jude 6. Heaven was their proper place and habitation, their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as we may ſo ſpeak. Thoſe Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels who are now blaſpheming in Hell, there was a time, when they were praiſing God in Heaven. When the Foundation of the Earth was laid, <hi>All the Sons of God ſang and ſhouted for joy</hi>: all the Angels; thoſe that are now Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of him, were then ſhouting for joy, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at the Wiſdom and Power of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, whom they did then behold laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Earth. Thoſe Angels that are now <hi>evil,</hi> were once <hi>good,</hi> and they continued to be ſo for a few dayes. For on the ſixth day <hi>God ſaw every thing that He had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> Gen. 1.31. If all the Works that God had made, were good on the ſixth day after the Creation began, the Angels that have ſinned, were then good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Rebrobate Angels did not continue in their Sinleſs ſtate, for any long time.</hi> For, although they were moſt excellent and glorious Creatures, yet they were but Creatures; and being Creatures, they were <hi>Mutable,</hi> and becauſe mutable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peccable,</hi> that is, in a poſſibility of ſinning and falling from God.

but God alone. Mal. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> It cannot be ſaid of any beſides the Lord, that he cannot change. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gave a judicious Anſwer to that enquiry, <hi>How could Angels, that were ſuch excellent and glorious Creatures in their firſt estate, not having any one to tempt them as man had, how could they ſin, and looſe their happineſs</hi>?

The Angels are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable with folly in this reſpect. It is a Scripture Expreſſion, <hi>Wiſe as an Angel of God.</hi> Nevertheleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wiſe Angels are and alwayes were the Subjects of <hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>mparative folly</hi>: compared with the only wiſe God, they are fooliſh things. And when once they ſinned, they were to be charged with infinite folly. For them to offend and fall out with their Omnipotent Creator, and by looſing his favour to looſe their own happineſs, was ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous folly in the fallen Angels. As for the particular ſin, which the Apoſtate Angels were guilty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, the Scripture is not ſo clear in revealing what it was; and therefore it is not for us to be poſitive in the determination of it.

of the Angels, by ſome poſitive Precept. It is alſo a probable conjecture, that the Lord told them (and Commanded them) that they ſhould all be Miniſtring Spirits for man, and that this they would not ſtoop unto, man being far their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. To be ſure there was pride in the ſin which the Angels became guilty of, as indeed there is in every ſin. Hence it is ſaid, that a <hi>Biſhop muſt n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Devil was condemned to eternal fire, becauſe of the ſin of pride. But how, and in what particular that pride diſcovered it ſelf, the Scripture hath not declared unto us. This notwithſtanding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things are certain from the Scripture. It is certain, that the Angels, ſome of them, did ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: So the Apoſtle expreſly declares here. And by the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> it is ſaid, that they <hi>kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation.</hi> And hence the Scripture ſpeaks not only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Good Angels,</hi> but concerning <hi>Evil Spirits.</hi> We read in the Goſpel of certain Women, who had been healed of <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> and infirmities.

excite wretched men unto unclean luſts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves are defiled with ſin. They are polluted, and have made themſelves hateful &amp; abominable in the ſight of the holy God, againſt whom they have ſinned. And it is moreover certain, that theſe Apoſtate Angels did early cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves. It was within a ſhort time after the world began. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Devil ſinned from the beginning,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8.

                     </gap>ave Conjectured that the fallen Angels ſinned on <hi>the ſecond day</hi> after the Creation began; and they ſuppoſe that to be the reaſon why there is no divine approbation men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning the work of that day, as there is of the other. But there is no ſolidity in that conjecture. For what is ſpoken <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.10. relates to the work of the ſecond, and not of the third day only. It ſeems clear from the Scripture, that there was no ſin in the world for ſix dayes after the beginning. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. Nevertheleſs, It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Angels fell before man did, for it was the Devil, that did tempt man to diſobey the Commandment of God, which could not have been, if he had not himſelf ſinned againſt God before that. It is yet further clear and evident from the Scripture, that more then a few of the Angels ſinned. There were vast multitudes of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000756_0127_0FAA47F62CC21970"/>
them that fell down from Heaven to Hell. No doubt but one was the Ringleader in that rebellion, whom the Scripture calls by the name of, <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and by the name of <hi>Satan,</hi> and whom the Jews were wont by way of contempt to call by the name of <hi>Belzebub</hi>: That <hi>Lucifer,</hi> (as he uſeth though not ſo properly to be called) who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Monarch of Hell, did not fall alone, nor periſh alone in his iniquity, there were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty numbers of them that did joyn with the great Devil, in the conſpiracy againſt the moſt High. Hence the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>the Devil and His Angels,</hi> Mat. 25.41. <hi>His Angels.</hi> So that there were many of them, that were concerned in that firſt Tranſgreſſion and Rebellion againſt the Lord. It is ſaid, Epheſ. 2.3. That the Devil is <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air.</hi> So that there is a <hi>Power,</hi> an <hi>Hoſt,</hi> a vaſt <hi>Army</hi> of thoſe Evil Spirits, that did joyn with the Devil, in ſetting themſelves againſt the Great God. How many, is not for us to ſay, the Written Word of God not ſpeaking any thing as to the quantity of their number: only it is manifeſt from the Scripture, that there are far more Angels that have ſinned, far more Devils then there are men in all the World. There is not a man in the whole world, but there are Devils to tempt him continually. And if ſo, they muſt needs be more in number than men are. We read in the Goſpel of no leſs than a Legion of Devils in one poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man. Luk. 8.30. You read there of a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

man, and Chriſt demanded of the Evil Spirit, what his name was: The chief Devil among them made anſwer, <hi>It is Legion, for we are many.</hi> A Legion is ſix thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty ſix. Now then, if the Devil has ſuch vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Infernal Spirits under him; if he has ſuch troops of them, as that he can ſpare no leſs than a Legion to afflict, and as it were to keep Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in one poor miſerable man: what prodigious numbers of Evil Angels muſt there needs be.</p>

They have loſt their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever, and did ſo, from the very moment, when they firſt ſinned againſt God; they were immediately excluded out of Heaven, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Gates were ſhut upon them. I do not ſay, nor do I believe, that the Angels did ſin in the higheſt Heaven: for it is ſaid of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. That it is <hi>Undefiled</hi>: whereas if the Angels had ſinned there, they would have defiled the very Heavens.

As ſoon as ever they ſinned, they were caſt away from the Preſence of God for ever; and they are Excommunicated from the Society of thoſe Holy Angels, that once they had an happy Fellowſhip with.

And they are ſaid to be made <hi>Priſoners,</hi> and to be <hi>Caſt into Hell,</hi> and to be <hi>in Chains</hi> there: <hi>They are delivered into Chains of Darkneſs.</hi> Thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> alluding to what is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among men. A Malefactor who is a great Criminal, is committed to Priſon, and is there to lye in Chains, until the <hi>Seſſions</hi> comes. So hath the Great God dealt by the Angels that ſinned againſt Him, He hath committed them to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and hath ordered them to lye in Chains there, until the Judgment of the Great Day ſhall come. They are not only under a Chain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the reſtraining Power and Providence of God, which does hamper the Evil Angels, that they cannot go where they would, nor can they
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000756_0130_0FAA47F8DDCDCA90"/>
do many things, that fain they would do, which is a torment to them. But there is the chain of a guilty Conſcience, which is a dark chain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in reſpect whereof the Devils carry Hell up and down the World with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Angels that ſinned, ſhall ere long be in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſery then at preſent they are ſubject unto.</hi> They are Priſoners, and have been ſo from the day of their fall: nevertheleſs, they are Priſoners at large, and the Devil hath a long chain allowed to him for the preſent: Therefore when it was ſaid to him, <hi>Whence comeſt thou?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</hi> Job 1.7. So that he hath leave to go from one end of the earth to the other. <hi>He walks about ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. For the preſent he is permitted to range up and down the World, to ſee if he can prevail over miſerable Creatures, and make a prey of the precious Souls of the children of men. But there is a day a coming, when he ſhall be made a <hi>cloſe Priſoner.</hi> Satan is to be caſt into the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, and ſhut up there. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. He cannot then wander up and down as now he doth. Although the Devils now feel ſomething of torment in their guilty Conſciences, and there are doubtleſs ſome Laws which they are under, being (as ſome have judiciouſly obſerved) awed by a ſuperiour power, and which they are as much afraid of acting againſt, as a Malefactor is afraid of going againſt the Laws of men, leſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhould be ſcourged for his ſo doing: Hence the Devil, though he had a natural power to hurt <hi>Job,</hi> was afraid to do it without leave. Yet there is a time coming, that they will be in more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable torment by far, than what they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indure. Hence when the Devils ſaw the Lord Jeſus Chriſt approaching, they cryed out, What have we to do with thee? <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time.</hi> Mat. 8.28. So that there is a time yet to come, wherein the Devils ſhall be ſubject unto greater torment, than as yet they are made ſenſible of. And that time will be at the Day of Judgment: <hi>Do ye not know, that the Saints ſhall Judge the World? Know ye not, that we ſhall judge Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.2, 3. that is to ſay, the Angels that ſinned. At the Great Day, all reprobate men, and not only ſo, but all the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Angels ſhall be brought into Judgment, and ſhall then have a ſentence of Eternal Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſſed upon them. Therefore it is, that the thought of the Day of Judgment is exceeding terrible unto all the Devils in Hell; they all tremble, when ever they think of the Judgment to come. <hi>The Devils believe, that there is one God, and they tremble.</hi> Jam. 1.19. So they believe, that there is a Day of Judgment, that will be here ere long, and they tremble at the fore thought of it. We read in the Goſpel of a Devil in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed man, who ſaid to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</hi> q. d. God has given us leave, as yet to be out of the

place of Torment, where we muſt at laſt be. Therefore I adjure thee by him not to ſend me thither. So that the Devils have a fearful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of that Day of Wrath. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The ruine of the Angels that ſinned is irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal.</hi> Therefore is it ſaid, that <hi>God hath not ſpared them,</hi> becauſe they are without all hopes of ever being reſtored to their bleſſed State. They are caſt down to Hell: they are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves. They are fallen down ſo deep into that Dungeon of Darkneſs, which Sin hath brought them into, that they can never riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by any power of their own. The Chains which they are in, the mighty Devils cannot break them: and the Holy God will not recover them.

The Chains which the Devils are ſaid to be in, are called, <hi>Everlaſting Chains,</hi> Jude 6. The Fire of the Wrath of God, that they are condemned to endure, is called <hi>an Everlaſting Fire.

It will be ſaid to the Wicked at the laſt day, <hi>Depart with the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into Everlaſting Fire.</hi> So that the Angels that ſinned are condemned to Everlaſting Fire.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Their ſin was exceeding hainous.</hi> The Devils were the firſt that ever ſinned. And God uſes to leave a mark of his indignation on thoſe that are the firſt Tranſgreſſors in any kind. And they ſinned without a Tempter; they ſinned of themſelves: <hi>They left their own Habitation</hi>; left it of themſelves: Their wills were deeply engaged in their ſinning againſt God: and the more of the will there is in any ſin, the more Evil is in it. They ſinned, I ſay, and were not tempted by any one to do it: As for man, when he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he was tempted, beguiled and deceived by the Devil: And probably <hi>Adam</hi> knew nothing of the Fall of the Angels, but might think when the Devil ſpoke to him, that it was a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and therefore might be the more eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Man thus ſinning through temptation, was an object of pitty, more than the Devils, that had none to tempt them; alſo the Angels ſinned againſt clear light and knowledge. Their Sin was yet further aggravated, in that God had done more for them, than for any Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. God had advanced them above all the Creatures in the World: Their ſin therefore was e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

It is ſaid of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>that there is no truth in him.</hi> Joh. 8.44. There is no goodneſs in him: he hath not ſo much of common goodneſs, ſo much of the relicks of the Image of God, as the ſinful children of men have: and therefore he doth not ſcruple any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſs, let it be never ſo great. There are ſome very wicked men in the World, that as for ſome ſins, they are afraid of them. Natural Conſcience has that power in them, that as for ſome ſins, they ſeem ſo atrocious and horrid, as that they are afraid to commit them. But now the Devil doth not ſtick at any wickedneſs, let it be never ſo great and hainous. The greater any ſin is, the more pleaſing it is to the Devil: He is always ſinning himſelf, and endeavouring to make others ſin to the utmoſt of his power. He is not only a <hi>Tempter,</hi> but <hi>the Tempter:</hi> That is his curſed Trade. Blaſphemy is the greateſt ſin:
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:000756_0135_0FAA4802A2AC3880"/>
now that the Devil is continually guilty of. It was Satan that made <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife ſay, <hi>Blaſpheme God and dye.</hi> And thoſe ſins which they cannot commit, becauſe of their being ſpiritual natures, yet they ſtir up others to them: ſuch as Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and Uncleanneſs, they ſtir up wicked men to live in ſuch abominations: And all this they do out of deſpight againſt Heaven, becauſe they know that ſuch things do offend and grieve the bleſſed God. Out of their deſperate hatred of the Glorious and Holy God, againſt whom they have ſinned, they do all they can to cauſe His Name to be diſhonoured: and therefore it is that the Devils do hate thoſe moſt, that are moſt like to God, and who above others do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for His Name, the Evil Angels do in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner ſet themſelves againſt, and are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all the rage of Hell againſt ſuch as thoſe are. The Devil is full of wrath and rage, but againſt whom? againſt thoſe eſpecially, which <hi>Keep the Commandments of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> Rev. 12.17. againſt ſuch is his malice, his wrath and rage in a peculiar manner bent. His malice is greater than his policy, though he is a great Politician. The Devil hath a great wit, he hath wonderful parts, as to underſtanding and memory: yet his malice is greater than his wiſdom. He knows well enough he ſhall get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by ſetting himſelf to do miſchief to thoſe that belong to God: He knows that he ſhall but hurt himſelf, and ſhall receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Damnation for it at the laſt day. He knows this, and yet will go on, becauſe his malice is greater than his underſtanding. And the Devil, and ſo all his Evil Angels are come to that height of wickedneſs, that they would not have the Bleſſed God to have a Church in the Earth: They would not have Chriſt to have a Servant in the World. If they could have their wills, the Glorious God ſhould not be worſhiped. They hate that which is good: they hate Prayer, and Preaching, and good Books, that have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to promote the Salvation of the Souls of men. The Devils in a ſpecial manner hate ſuch Books as thoſe are: They hate this bleſſed Bible, more than any Book in the World: They hate the Lords day. Becauſe of their malice againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they tempt the children of men on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, more than on any day in the week, becauſe they know, that if men ſin on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, they will then become doubly guilty in the ſight of God. The Devil is the oldeſt Sinner, and the moſt curſed Creature in all the World. It is ſaid, Iſa. 65.20. <hi>That the Sinner of an Hundred Years ſhall be accurſed.</hi> But then what ſhall the Sinner be, that is more than five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years old? The Devil and and all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that ſinned with him, are Sinners of above five thouſand years old, and will therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt accurſed and damned Creatures in the whole univerſe at the Great Day.</p>

He has manifeſted more Grace to them then he did to the Angels that ſinned, for whom he did not provide a Saviour. God did not ſend his Son into the World to take the Nature of Angels, and unite that Nature unto his own Sacred Eternal Perſon. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>He took not to him the nature of Angels,</hi> it is ſaid, but that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo of other men.

God did not ſend Angels from Heaven to Preach a Jeſus to the Angels that ſinned, no, he never did ſend any ſuch meſſage from Heaven to them, as unto men he has. Nor did the Lord wait on the Angels that ſinned, to ſee if they would return to him, and repent, and humble themſelves before him as he has waited on men. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. <hi>The Long ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah.</hi> And how long doth God wait upon many Sinners?

And when the Angels ſinned <hi>but once,</hi> as ſoon as ever they had but once tranſgreſſed, <hi>He ſpared them not.</hi> But now though men have ſinned a million times over, God ſpares them; although they continue ſinning from one year to another, God not only ſpares them out of Hell, but tells them of a Heaven, and ſends his Goſpel to them, to aſſure them, that all their ſins ſhall be pardoned, and their Souls ſaved, if they obey the Goſpel: Here now is wonderful Grace, that we may be aſtoniſhed to conſider of.

But Oh! the Holineſs of the bleſſed God, that when the reprobate Angels did once become Lyars, they might not dwell in Gods houſe, nor tarry in his ſight one moment longer. Such is his Holineſs, that he cannot look upon ſin with approbation of it. Hab. 1.13. <hi>He is of purer eyes, than to behold evil: he cannot look upon iniquity</hi> without deteſtation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 'Tis not only true that he will not, but that he cannot. God can no more approve of ſin, then he can ceaſe to be God. Thus glorious is he in Holineſs And we ſee before our eyes a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and dreadful demonſtration of the Juſtice of God, in that he does puniſh ſinners whoever they be. The truth is, He never ſpared any ſin, there was never any ſin committed in the World, nor
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:000756_0140_0FAA480AA10F39F0"/>
never ſhall be, but God hath puniſhed it, or will puniſh it. As for the Angels that ſinned, they are condemned to eternal fire and flames: not any one of them all can eſcape the ſtroke of Divine Juſtice. And as for reprobate men, although God bears with them a long time, and is pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe infinite Patience towards them, yet they will at laſt find, that all their ſins ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Vengeance, Rom. 9.22. <hi>What, if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering the Veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi> At laſt Gods wrath, his Juſtice will be made to appear in puniſhing them for all their Tranſgreſſions, Ay, and he will make known his infinite Power at the ſame time. The infinite Power of God is ſeen in making one that hath been a ſinner, capable of enduring ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That a poor Creature ſhould be filled with the wrath of God, and yet be capable, or in a poſſibility, to indure it to all eternity, this makes known his power as well as his wrath. Thus doth he ſhew his wrath and make his Power known. And as for the Elect of God, he hath not ſpared their ſins, as appears in that his own Son was not ſpared, when he became a ſurety on their behalf, Rom. 8.32. <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> The Son of God who never ſinned nor could ſin, yet was not ſpared, when he became a Mediator undertaking to anſwer for ſinners. That is the higheſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, that
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:000756_0141_0FAA480B83DA4460"/>
can be thought of. As ſome Divines have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it, <hi>If a man would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that we ſee glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, and of his infinite hatred of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Inference. 3. <hi>Sin makes men to become like unto the Apoſtate Angels.</hi> It turns men into Devils. There are wicked men who are Devils incarnate. And therefore ſinners are ſaid to be <hi>the Children of the Devil, and to be of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. Namely as Children are of their Father. He is called their Father, Joh. 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the luſts of your Father ye will do,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: Ye do juſt as the Devil doth, and juſt as the Devil would have you do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye are his Children, and he is your father. There are Children in reſpect of <hi>Imitation</hi>: Sinners imitate the Devil: Yea, they have his Image, the very ſame evil nature, the ſame wicked diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and ſinful inclinations which are in the heart of the Devil, are in their hearts and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:000756_0142_0FAA480C2177DF00"/>
Eſpecially, there are ſome ſins that make men exceeding like the Devil, and his Children indeed. As now, that ſin of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from good beginnings: The Devil was the firſt Apoſtate. Hence when men have begun to do well, and after that turn from the good ways of God, they make themſelves like the Devil. As for the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels, they have left off all Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Piety. There was a time, when the Devil and his Evil Angels did pray and worſhip God; when they did joyn with the Holy Angels in praiſing the great Creator of the World. But they have left praying and praiſing, and forſaken the Company of Holy Angels. Ah! Lord God, are there not ſuch in this Aſſembly this day! are there not ſuch here before the Lord this day, who have manifeſted themſelves to be the Devils Children? There was a time when they would pray, and joyn with others the Fearers of the Lord in ſerving him: but they have forſaken him, they ſerve him not, neither do they pray unto him: And they have forſaken the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe Fearers of the Lord with whom they did once joyn in Religious Exerciſes. This is to be and to do juſt like the Devils: ſuch are his Children, as like him as it is poſſible for Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be out of Hell: So <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers are like the ſinful Angels. Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil.</hi> Joh. 6.70. That was <hi>Judas.</hi> Why was <hi>Judas</hi> a <hi>Devil?</hi> but becauſe he was an
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:000756_0143_0FAA481044975E88"/>
                     <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> one that pretend to that in Religion and Devotion which was never in him; one that did ſeem to be an Angel of light, when he was not ſo; one that did betray Chriſt with a kiſs, pretending to be his friend, when he was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and falſe to him and to his Intereſt. Such men there are in the world, as will out of reſpect to carnal ends and deſigns make pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Religion: They are like the Devil. There is in the Field of Chriſt, (in his Church in the World) not only Wheat but Tares, there are not only ſincere Profeſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, but Hypocrites. <hi>They are the Children of the Wicked One.</hi> Mat. 13.38. and all <hi>Lyars</hi> are ſo. The Devil is <hi>a Lyar, and the Father of it,</hi> becauſe he is the Father of them that are ſo. Lyars joyn with the Devil in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and as they partake with him in ſinning, ſo ſhall they have the Devils puniſhment. What is the Devils puniſhment? It is an excluſion out of Heaven: And what is the puniſhment of all Lyars? They ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Heavenly Jeruſalem. They ſhall ba excluded, as the Devil their Father is. What is the Devils puniſhment? It is ſaid, He ſhall be caſt into <hi>the Lake of Fire and Brimstone. Rev.</hi> 20.10. and the very ſame is ſaid concerning all <hi>Lyars,</hi> that they ſhall have their part in <hi>the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the Second Death.</hi> Rev. 21.8.</p>
                  <p>Inference. 4. <hi>This informs us of the Evil which is in Sinning againſt God.</hi> We ſee what an evil
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:000756_0144_0FAA481175AA8A68"/>
ſin is, that it is the worſt of evils, and that which of all evils men have the greateſt cauſe to dread. For it doth provoke God: Therefore it is of all evils the moſt formidable. It was well replied by one of the Antients, when the greateſt Perſon in the Empire ſent him a threatning meſſage, Go (ſaid he) carry back this anſwer, that <hi>I am afraid of nothing, but to ſin againſt God.</hi> Sin is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive evil to the Creature. No eminency or priviledge can ſave ſinning Creatures from the ſtrokes or Divine Juſtice. It brings remedileſs ruin on thoſe that ſhall become guilty of it. Angels are eminent ones: <hi>If I ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) intimating, that Angels were of all Creatures the moſt excellent and glorious, and yet when they ſinned, we ſee what became of them, of ſo many of them, as ſinned againſt God. <hi>They are reſerved under darkneſs for the Judgement of the great day.</hi> Then moſt certainly there is no eminency in men, that can ſecure them from the Vengeance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if they ſin: no eminency of Power. <hi>Angels</hi> are <hi>greater in power and might</hi> than men are, yet when they ſinned, they muſt go into Everlaſting Chains. It is not any Eminency of Parts and Wiſdom, that can ſave ſinful Creatures from the killing ſtrokes of revenging Juſtice. It was ſaid of the King of <hi>Tyrus, Thou art full of wiſdom, and perfect in beauty: thou haſt been in Eden the Garden of God.</hi> Ezek. 28.12. For all this he muſt down to the pit. Wilt thou yet ſay before him that

Men that have the Word of God Preached to them, and who hear Sermons wherein Chriſt and Salvation by him, is offered to them, and yet for all that continue in unbelief, they ſin at ſuch a rate, as the Devils never ſinned. Oh! what a Condemnation will they bring upon themſelves? Judgment without Mercy, or any hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; becauſe they have ſinned againſt the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Blood and Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, which the Angels that ſinned have not done.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let me conclude with <hi>Exhorting</hi> you <hi>to get your Souls clear of the guilt of ſin.</hi> They that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is not a man in the whole world whom this Word of the Lord concerneth not, for that all men have ſinned. Indeed, all the Angels have not ſinned; there are innumerable Holy Angels that never ſinned againſt God; but as for men, they have all ſinned. <hi>The Scripture</hi> (God in his Word) <hi>has concluded all under ſin, Gal.</hi> 3.22. without excepting ſo much as one. <hi>The whole world is become guilty before God:</hi> And therefore all men are concerned to conſider of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:000756_0147_0FAA481439F4F5B8"/>
this. Know then, that there is a way for men, though not for Angels, to become clear of ſin. If a man ſhall by Faith have the Blood of Chriſt ſprinkled on his Soul, he is clear of ſin: They that have that Blood ſprinkled upon their Souls, are pure from ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence <hi>David</hi> prayed, ſaying, <hi>Purge me with hyſop, and I ſhall be whiter than the Snow.</hi> Pſal. 51.7. <hi>David</hi> had by ſin made himſelf blacker than Hell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When there is true Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and unfeigned Faith in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, his Blood is ſprinkled on the Soul. You read in the Goſpel of one that had been a notorious infamous Sinner, a vile creature, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an Harlot, a Strumpet, whoſe wickedneſs was known all the Town over. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37.

Sect. 8. has mentioned ſome of them. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations publiſhed by <hi>Gregorius Magnus</hi> concerning the Apparitions of Angels to Saints in thoſe times, were either fabulous or ſatanical illuſions. In my opinion, Mr. <hi>Iſaac Ambroſe</hi> has wronged his Treatiſe of Angels (which is otherwiſe a good and uſeful Book) by quoting ſo many paſſages out of him, which may occaſion his Readers to think, that the other Hiſtorical Narrations in his Book, are of no more credit than thoſe of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories.</hi> Theſe things notwithſtanding, we may not run into the other extream, or conclude, that all reports concerning Appearing Angels have no reality of truth in them. <hi>Luther</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. and Gen. 40. declares, that he was very much moved and offended <hi>at the infinite multitude of Satanical Illuſions, with which the World was horribly deceived for a long time under the Papacy</hi>; and that for his own part he did <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly pray to God,</hi> that he would not reveal any thing to him by Dreams or Viſions, but by his Written Word; and <hi>that He would not ſend An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to appear to him,</hi> knowing that when he was meditating on the Scriptures, God and His Holy Angels were near to him, who could inſtill irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations on his mind without any viſible Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yet, he does acknowledge that ſome may have that which he never did nor deſired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. <hi>Sint dona ſed quae ego nec curo nec deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> ſays he. And the Truth is, that Authors worthy of Credit have given us an account of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000756_0156_0FAA482042C7A798"/>
very remarkable and memorable Inſtances here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. The Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in an Epiſtle directed to the Church in <hi>Philomilium,</hi> ſay, that it was revealed to <hi>Polycarp</hi> their Paſtor by a Dream, that he ſhould be burnt alive for the Name of Chriſt, that when he came to Dye, he gave thanks to God, not only for honouring him with ſuch a Death, but in that he had been pleaſed before it came to paſs to reveal unto him that he ſhould Dye in that manner.

It is related concerning one Mr. <hi>Laremouth,</hi> who was Chaplain to the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> that being on account of the Goſpel Committed to Priſon,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000756_0158_0FAA4821E85CFA30"/>
he heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe and go thy way</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which he gave no heed the firſt time, until he heard the ſame words again, upon which he went to Prayer, half an hour after which he heard the ſame voice again, immediately upon which part of the Priſon Wall fell down, ſo that he went out at the breach, and meeting with a Beggar, changed his coat with him, and coming to the Sea found a Veſſel ready to Sail, by which means he eſcaped the hands of his Perſecutors. In the year 1629. one <hi>Adam Po,</hi> a <hi>Sileſian</hi> in the City of <hi>Sprottavia,</hi> had his nerves and ſinews ſo ſhrunk, that he could make no uſe of his legs, but for half a year together was confined to his Bed.

He called for his cloaths, which he had not done for half a year before; found that he was able to dreſs himſelf and to walk, and did that day go on foot eight miles Of this <hi>Commenius</hi> giveth an account in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Bohemian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> or pretended Prophets. In <hi>April</hi> 1659. <hi>Samuel Wallis</hi> of <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> having been ſick thirteen years, and given over by the Phyſitians, a perſon having a venerable Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance came to him on a Lord's Day (he not being able to attend the Publick Worſhip of God,

ſpent his time at home as religiouſly as he could) told him the power of God would reſtore him to health and ſtrength again, charging him above all things to fear God and ſerve him: directed him to no other means for his health, beſides the uſe of <hi>Blood wort</hi> and <hi>Red Sage,</hi> ſteeped in ſmall Beer. The report of this famous oure being noiſed abroad, ſeveral Miniſters met at <hi>Stamford</hi> to conſider and conſult about it, and concluded, that it was effected by the Miniſtry of a good Angel.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000756_0160_0FAA4823695B0558"/>
perſon was reputed a very good Woman, &amp; that he believed there was no fraud at all in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This Apparition then muſt needs be either of a good or of an evil Angel. I ſee no reaſon to aſcribe it to the latter. To proceed. <hi>Amyraldus</hi> relates a remarkable paſſage concerning the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler of <hi>Navar,</hi> which he had from <hi>Cameron,</hi> who received it from the Chancellers own mouth. He being in a Town belonging to <hi>Bern,</hi> one night as he was a ſleep, heard a voice calling him by his name <hi>Calignon,</hi> whereupon awaking, he ſoon fell aſleep again: a little while after, he heard the ſame voice, calling to him a ſecond time, which made a greater impreſſion on him, yet fell aſleep again. The voice awakened him the third time, then adviſing him to retire ſpeedily out of the Town, ſaying, that within a few days the Plague would be there and rage dreadfully: He follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the advice given him, whereby himſelf and Family were delivered; for within few dayes the Plague began, and a great part of the Town was ſwept away thereby: <hi>Amyrald</hi> concludes that this voce was from a good Angel. A decad of Years are not paſt, ſince inviſible <hi>Pſalmodiſts</hi> have been heard Singing in the Air, and making moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious and raviſhing melody there, as has been affirmed by not a few witneſſes, of which M. <hi>Jurieu</hi> in his Paſtoral Letters has given a well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted account to the World: What ever thoſe voices might be, they put me in mind of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumiſts</hi> Expoſition of <hi>the ſtill voice,</hi> 1 King. 19.12.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000756_0161_0FAA482423D77210"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> that it was <hi>the voice of Angels, Praiſing God in a gentle Harmony.</hi> I have elſe-where (in my <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> about <hi>the Prevalency of Prayer,</hi> p. 16, 17.) mentioned a memorable paſſage concerning Mr. <hi>Patrick Simpſon,</hi> an Eminent Miniſter at <hi>Sterling</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> unto whom, after he had ſpent a day alone in Prayer with Faſting, Angels came, and gave him an anſwer concerning the thing which he had all the day been praying about, of which he never ſpoke one word to any one, excepting only to one perſon, who hapned to over-hear ſomething, whom he ſolemnly obteſted, not to ſay ought of it, until after his Death, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf, <hi>What am I duſt and aſhes, that the Holy Ministring Spirits ſhould be ſent by the Lord to deliver a Meſſage to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe things conſidered, I conclude, that it is not impoſſible, but that Holy Angels may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſome perſons. And in caſe it ſhould be really ſo, it would be a daring and dangerous boldneſs to entertain them with contempt. We ſhould rather ſay as the Phariſees (who in that had the truth on their ſide) <hi>Act.</hi> 23.9. <hi>If a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or an Angel has ſpoken to him, let us not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</hi> If this be taken with what follows, our having conceded thus far will do us no harm.</p>
                  <p>Concluſion II. <hi>Some Circumſtances attending ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Apparitions pretended to be Angelical, have demonſtrated them to be Diabolical, others have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them juſtly ſuſpicious.</hi> Let the Appearing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000756_0162_0FAA4824F0342DF0"/>
pretend never ſo much to be good Angels; if they ſuggeſt any thing which is contrary to right reaſon, or the light of nature, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Devils. Hence <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Angel, from whom he pretended to receive his new Religion was a Devil: For in the <hi>Alcoron</hi> there are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and therefore falſhoods which cannot proceed from a good Spirit: No good Angel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver told a lye. Hence that Spirit which ſhall be once found in a Lye, comes not from Heaven. If he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſay, ſuch a thing ſhall happen, which yet does not come to paſs at the time prefixed, or that he will do or not do ſuch a thing, and yet ſhall act contrary, or ſhall in any thing falſify, to be ſure that is no good Angel. Or, if it does perſwade to any diſhoneſt thing, it is an Evil Spirit. By this it was manifeſt, that the Spirits which Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Killet</hi> were ſo familiar with, ſuppoſing them to be good Angels, were unclean Devils: for although thoſe Spirits did for a long time pretend to great Sanctity, they did at laſt adviſe to filthy <hi>Nicolaitiſm.</hi> Or, if the ſeeming Angels ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh any notions in Religion not grounded on the Scripture, they are not from Heaven. This ſheweth, that the Apparitions ſo frequent and ſo much boaſted of amongſt the Papiſts, were in truth Diabolical Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions: For the deſign of them was to confirm the notion of Purgatory, the worſhiping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, praying for the Dead, and ſuch like Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, which the Scripture condemns: Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000756_0163_0FAA4825C28BBFA8"/>
to be Angels, made way for the groſſeſt Idolatries, by exhorting men unto a ſinful venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Croſs, the Relicks of Martyrs, and the like Superſtitions. Or, if they ſhall ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which is not grave and weighty, it is eaſy to judge what Spirits they are. It is beneath the majeſty of an Angel to ſpeak or do any thing which is trivial, mean, or little. Or, if they ſhall interrupt or divert the perſons unto whom they appear, from a due attendance to the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: Such things as theſe are infallible demonſtrations, that the Appearing Angels are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Ones. There are other things which render the caſe very ſuſpicious: To inſtance. If the Apparitions are frequent, and the Spirits that come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſe familiar converſe, it is much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they are not from Heaven, but from Hell. For if we ſearch the Scriptures, we ſhall find, that when Holy Angels appeared, they ſoon delivered the Meſſage which they were ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and then diſappeared, and came no more. The ſame Angel ſeldome came more than two or three times (moſt commonly but once) to the ſame perſon. Twice did the Angel appear to <hi>Manoah's</hi> Wife, <hi>but the Angel of the Lord did no more appear to</hi> Manoah, <hi>and to his Wife.</hi> Judg. 13.21. When therefore Angels ſhall be daily Viſitants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and continue ſo to be from one week, and from one month to another, the perſons concerned have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that they are impoſed on by deceitful <hi>Daemons,</hi> pretending to be Angels of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000756_0164_0FAA4826666744B0"/>
light. Where is there an inſtance in all the Bible of a good Angel that became a Familiar to any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Again, if what the Spirits reveal, does admit of a double &amp; doubtful interpretation, it is a ſign, that they are Spirits of the ſame nature with thoſe that ſpoke in the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> of old This amongſt other things gave juſt ground to ſuſpect, that the pious young Woman <hi>Chriſtina Poniatovia</hi> (of whom we ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak more afterwards) was deluded by Satan, when ſhe thought her ſelf favoured with Angelical and Divine Revelations. The Spirit told her, that King <hi>F.</hi> ſhould be exalted, and <hi>F.</hi> be made low.

If therefore the Spirits that appear under the notion of Angels from Heaven, ſhall leave thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Reſolution of their doubts from them, juſt as wiſe as they found them, it is much to be doubted that they are deceiving Spirits. Again, <hi>Ecſtaſies</hi> attended with abreptions of mind, give juſt cauſe to ſuſpect the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Revelations. The followers of <hi>Montanus,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to propheſy, but when the ſpirit of Propheſy came upon ehem they would be in <hi>Ecſtaſies.</hi> Now both <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> mention that as a ſign of their being no Prophets divinely inſpired. It is (ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) the property of a <hi>Diviner</hi> to be <hi>Ecſtatical,</hi> but its otherwiſe with a true Prophet, his underſtanding is awake and his mind in a ſober orderly Temper. No doubt but that ſome of rhe falſe Prophets amongſt the Jews were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by <hi>Daemons.</hi> They thought that they had Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Divine Revelations, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.24. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.8.

that which is falſe</hi>? Nor do they give any ſatisfactory Reſolution concerning it: only they ſay, that all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy makes it ſelf known to the Prophet by the ſtrength &amp; vigour of the perception. And that falſe Propheſy do's proceed from the too great force of the Imaginative power, and the Imbecillity of the rational. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Spirit does never alienate the mind, ſince it ſeats it ſelf in the rational as well as in the ſenſitive power. Again, If theſe <hi>White Angels</hi> appear to Females only, who are the weaker Sex, and more eaſy to be impoſed on, that renders the caſe yet the more ſuſpicious.

He was in tranſports of joy, not doubting but that thouſands would be Converted by his Revelations. Nor could he bear it, that any ſhould call his Revelations into queſtion, which he was certain (as he thought) that they were of Divine Inſpiration.

Learned man in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> in his time the Oracle of that part of the World. But a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Muliercula</hi> (as <hi>Acoſta's</hi> phraſe is) there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to a converſation with Angels who did frequently viſit her, and in her extaſies would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her of ſome ſecret things relating to this perſon, and told her of great future matters, in which he was to be concerned; he was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched as to believe all that ſhe ſaid; and at laſt fancied, that an Angel came to himſelf alſo, of whom he learned whatſoever he deſired.

It ſeems the Angel that appeared to him, aſſured him, that when he came to the place intended for his Execution, fire would come down from Heaven, and conſume his Adverſaries, whereby he ſhould be delivered: but he found to his coſt, that lying Apparitions had deceived and ruined him. Whether his Judges would not have done

better to have ſent him to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and to have adminiſtred <hi>Hellebore</hi> rather than Fire as a more proper Remedy for his <hi>ſober diſtraction,</hi> is not my work at preſent to diſpute. To proceed. It ſeems <hi>Jerom</hi> had viſions of Spirits and ſometimes of Angels as he thought. One of which did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chaſtize him for his delighting to read <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero's</hi> Works: but another Angel interceded for mercy to him conſidering his youth. Now what can we impute this to, but melancholly, and the diſtempered imagination of a contemplative man that was always in his cell. The like I ſuppoſe concerning a later <hi>Hierom,</hi> viz. <hi>Savanarola,</hi> whom the Papiſts burnt to Death at <hi>Florence,</hi> in the year 1498. for his freedom and faithfulneſs in teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſome of the evils of thoſe times: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Books diſcover him to be a man of great Learning; and ſome of them manifeſt a pious Spirit. <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaith of his Books <hi>concerning the ſimplicity of a Chriſtian Life,</hi> that they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be read of every Chriſtian man.

him. For <hi>Felinus</hi> the Paſtor of the Church of Exiles in <hi>Puchow</hi> wrote a Book, endeavouring to prove that the Viſions of <hi>Drabicius</hi> were an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> no better than Satanical Deluſions, and that therefore the Proteſtant Churches ſhould be careful how they gave any heed to them.

Whereupon ſhe worſhipped him, and was reſtored to Life, &amp; to full vigor, health, and ſtrength in that very moment.

For which reaſon they ought to be very cautious and careful, how they hearken to them, leaſt haply they be deceived as <hi>Eve</hi> was, when ſhe converſed with the Devil in the Serpent, whom probably (as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and others have obſerved) ſhe took to be a good Angel, and was thence the more eaſily ſeduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Error.</p>

There are many things mentioned by <hi>Carthuſianus, Gerſon, Tyraeus, Malderus,</hi> &amp; others, by which they ſuppoſe that Angelical Apparitions may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thoſe that are Diabolical. But I have met with no marks to judge by, either in them or in any other Authors, that are infallible. To inſtance here in ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some ſay, That the Devil cannot appear without ſome deformity or other. That as he could not appear in the ſhape of a man before man had ſinned, and therefore came to our Firſt Parents in the ſhape of a Serpent; ſo now though he can put on <hi>Humane Shape,</hi> yet that it muſt be with ſome defect or other, a cloven foot, an ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance, or the like.

But the notion of Evil Angels always appearing with ſome deformity in their ſhape is a <hi>vulgar error</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture, which ſays expreſly, that Satan can transform himſelf into an Angel of light. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. That he can appear like a venerable <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was an honourable man of God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.6. &amp; 28.12.

with a Divine Majeſty &amp; Brightneſs: he appeared like <hi>Elohim.</hi> This opinion has been often confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by experience. What were thoſe <hi>Nymphes</hi> that the Gentiles of old were deceived with, but Devils appearing in a beautiful form? Do not Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers tell us of his appearing to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolius,</hi> and to St. <hi>Martin</hi> in moſt glorious array? That inſtance of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> a Mr. of Art of <hi>Trin Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> is remarkable. He had been a Magician &amp; a Conjurer: But God gave him repentance, and after he was reclaimed from the error of his way, he declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Daemon</hi> whom he had been wont to converſe with, always appeared to him in the form of a man of good faſhion: nor did he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. It has been ſaid, that Good Angels are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at their firſt appearance, but not at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, whenas evil Angels do not appear fright fully at firſt but at laſt. This is no infallible rule to judge by; nor does it agree with the Scripture. When three Angels appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; two came to <hi>Lot,</hi> they were not at firſt terrifyed with the ſight of them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.3. &amp; 19.1, 2.

When the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to the Mother of our Lord, ſhe was at firſt at a loſs about what was ſpoken to her: <hi>She was troubled at his ſaying, &amp; caſt in her mind, what manner of Salutation this ſhould be.</hi> Luk. 1.29. As for the holy Prophets, they it is true neither did nor could doubt whether they were divinely inſpired. For that Divine light which was implanted in their underſtandings, did ſhine with that power as made them certain that God ſpoke to them. There was an <hi>IDIOTES ARRETOS,</hi> an <hi>inexpreſſible peculiarity</hi> in them. No man that was a ſubject of that Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, could be ignorant of it: nor could any

perſons be deceived beſides ſuch as had it not: which is more than can be affirmed of all Viſions or Apparitions of Angels.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No infallible Judgment can be made by the words which they ſpeak, or the counſel which they give, whether the appearing Spirits are good or evil Angels. <hi>Jacobus Vitriacus</hi> ſpeaks of one who was frequently viſited in his ſleep by a <hi>Daemon,</hi> that did reprehend him for ſome of his faults, and alſo excite him to acts of piety &amp; devotion: but the <hi>Daemon</hi> uſed this fraud with a deſign to inſtill ſome poyſonous notions into his mind. <hi>Delrio</hi> writes of a Monk unto whom the Devil appeared in the likeneſs of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> exhorting him to read the Scriptures. The <hi>Daemon</hi> that acted <hi>Robert Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (a deluded <hi>Quaker</hi> at <hi>Balſham</hi> in Cambridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, whom the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to Convert from the error of his way) told him, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was true, and that God had an Elect People; that thoſe whom the Father had Elected, the Son had Redeemed, and whom Chriſt Redeems, the holy Spirit Sanctifies; and directed him to go to a Miniſter for further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Have not curſed Magicians pretended, that the Caeleſtial Spirits would communicate their ſecrets to none but Sanctified ones? That men who would have a familiar converſation with thoſe Spirits to reveal ſecrets to them, muſt be careful to keep themſelves from enormous ſins, and pray daily to the moſt High, v. <hi>Boiſſard de ſecretis Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae</hi> Cap. 1. p. 30.
