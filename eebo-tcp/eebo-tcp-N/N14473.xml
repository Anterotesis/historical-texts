            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE powers of thinking and choice are ſo eſſential to all rational ſpirits, that without them no idea can be formed of their exiſtence. A deſire of the knowledge and enjoyment of the beſt good, alſo appears eſſential to their nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as finite knowledge is limited, finite ſpirits would ever be liable to err, if they had not ſome ſufficient guard againſt it. And the beſt guard we can conceive of, is a clear fixed perſuaſion in the heart, that God is the only fountain of all good; and that every deſirable good is to be obtained and enjoyed in the way of obedience to his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will, and nowhere elſe.</p>
            <p>THAT he is the abſolute proprietor, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign ruler of the worlds he has made, is a truth too evident for any but madmen to deny. All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been forced to appeal to him, to avenge injuſtice and perjury, in order to eſtabliſh any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among themſelves: Yet how far have they been from a willingneſs to be governed entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him! <hi>He made man upright; but they have ſought out many inventions.</hi> Objects of worſhip, and forms of worſhip, even without number, have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by mankind; the folly whereof God has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in all his diſpenſations: Yet ſelf-conceit, ſelf-ſeeking, and ſelf-dependence, are ſtill the ruining errors of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018336_0003_0FA5D3715D0DCE20"/>
HIS deſign in all his diſpenſations, in every age and every country, is undoubtedly the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that declared to Iſrael, in the paſſage which adorns our title page. Three things deſerve particular notice therein.
<list>
                  <item>1. That it is the Lord who leads his people through all the changing ſcenes of life, in this wilderneſs world. At differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times and places their circumſtances vary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; yet he orders or over-rules in all, ſo that a ſparrow cannot fall to the ground, nor an hair from their head, without him.</item>
                  <item>2. All his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are calculated in infinite wiſdom, for their trial and humiliation; to diſcover what is in their hearts, whether they will keep HIS commandments, or not. Therefore,</item>
                  <item>3. He requires them to <hi>remember</hi> all the way wherein he leads them, for this end.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY, the only true religion, has its name from CHRIST, the foundation, lawgiver, and only head of his church. And one of the greateſt hiſtorians of our age gives us the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its primitive order and government. Says he, "The rites inſtituted by Chriſt were only two in number, and theſe deſigned to continue to the end of the church here below, without any varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe were baptiſm and the holy ſupper; which were not to be conſidered as mere ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, nor yet as ſymbolical repreſentations only, but alſo as ordinances, accompanied with ſanctifying influence upon the heart and affections of true Chriſtians." Of thoſe who heard and believed the preaching of John the Baptiſt, he ſays, "They were initiated into the kingdom of the Redeemer, by the ceremony of <hi>immerſion</hi> or <hi>baptiſm.</hi>" And during the firſt century, he ſays, "The ſacrament of baptiſm was adminiſtered without the public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:018336_0004_0FA5D372180B9038"/>in places appointed and prepared for that purpoſe, and was performed by <hi>immerſion</hi> of the whole body<note n="*" place="bottom">Moſheim's eccl. hiſt. vol. 1, p. 32, 91, 96. Dublin edition</note>." This was the primitive way of admiſſion into the Chriſtian church; and of its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment our author ſays, "The people were, undoubtedly, the firſt in authority; for the apoſtles ſhewed by their example, that nothing of moment was to be carried on or determined without the conſent of the aſſembly, Acts i. 15, vi. 3, xv. 4 xxi. 22.—A biſhop, during the firſt and ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, was a perſon who had the care of one Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aſſembly, which, at that time, was, generally ſpeaking, ſmall enough to be contained in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe. In this aſſembly he acted not ſo much with the authority of a <hi>maſter,</hi> as with the zeal and diligence of a faithful <hi>ſervant.</hi>" And he aſſures us, that until about the middle of the ſecond century, "The churches were entirely <hi>independent;</hi> none of them ſubject to any foreign juriſdiction, but each one governed by its own rulers, and its own laws." And that an alteration was then made, by induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly propagating the opinion, that Chriſtian miniſters ſucceeded to the rights and privileges of the Jewiſh prieſthood<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 70, 76, 77, 139.</note> Heathen philoſophy was alſo called in to interpret the ſcriptures by; from whence teachers adopted this maxim, viz. "That it was an act of virtue to <hi>deceive and lie,</hi> when by that means the <hi>intereſts</hi> of the church might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted." To which they added, in the fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, under Conſtantine, the uſe of <hi>temporal penal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and <hi>corporal tortures,</hi> for the ſame end<note n="¶" place="bottom">Page 155, 314.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IN the mean time a controverſy aroſe about bringing infants to baptiſm. In the beginning of
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018336_0005_0FA5D372F26E56E0"/>the third century, Tertullian, who is the firſt writer that mentions it, oppoſed it, ſaying, "What need is there that the <hi>god-fathers</hi> ſhould be brought into danger? becauſe they may either fail of their promiſes by death, or they may be miſtaken by a child's proving of a wicked diſpoſition." But not long after Origen appeared for the practice, and ſaid, "Let it be conſidered what is the reaſon, that whereas the baptiſm of the church is given for the forgiveneſs of ſins, infants alſo are, <hi>by the uſage of the church,</hi> baptized.—It is for that reaſon, becauſe by the ſacrament of baptiſm the <hi>pollution of our birth is taken away,</hi> that infants are baptized<note n="*" place="bottom">Clark againſt Gill upon baptiſm, p. 105, 111.</note>." Origen is the firſt man that any have produced, who plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for infant baptiſm; and he alſo held that the torments of the damned will have an end; and that Chriſt will be crucified in the next world to ſave the devils<note n="†" place="bottom">Moſheim, vol. 1, p. 476.</note> Now when heathen philoſophy was ſet up as a rule to interpret ſcripture by; when the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the old teſtament were taken to draw a veil over the truth, and church order deſcribed in the goſpel, and teachers pretended to confer renewing grace by their adminiſtrations, before the ſubjects were taught or believed; and alſo called in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular arm to enforce their meaſures by temporal penalties and corporal tortures, what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected but the Antichriſtian apoſtaſy! Oh, how dark was the night that followed!</p>
            <p>YET God did not leave himſelf without witneſſes in the darkeſt times, ſome of whom I will name. Peter de Bruys, during a miniſtry of twenty years, made the moſt laudable attempts to reform abuſes, and to remove the ſuperſtitions that disfigured the
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:018336_0006_0FA5D373B4CEE7D8"/>beautiful ſimplicity of the goſpel, and had a great number of followers, in Languedoc and Provence in France; and he was burnt therefor at St. Giles, in the year 1130. His diſciples were called Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trobuſcians; and a leading article of their faith was, "That no perſons whatever were to be baptized before they came to the full uſe of their reaſon." Soon after another miniſter, whoſe name was Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, travelled from Switzerland through various parts of France, preaching the goſpel with great ſucceſs, until he came to the city of Thoulouſe; where the Pope and his creatures raiſed great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt him, and caſt him into priſon in 1148; and he ended his days there not long after. He was thus dealt with becauſe "He rejected the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of infants; cenſured with ſeverity the corrupt and licentious manners of the clergy, and treated the feſtivals and ceremonies of the church with the utmoſt contempt<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. 2, p. 437—439</note>."</p>
            <p>THIS account is given by a very learned Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran author, who was ſtrongly prejudiced againſt the modern Baptiſts, becauſe he held that the Chriſtian church was in its minority, when it was governed in the manner above deſcribed; and that in its mature age, "The regulation of it was, in ſome meaſure, to be accommodated to the time, and left to the wiſdom and prudence of the chief rulers, both of the ſtate and of the church<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. 1, p. 63—70.</note>;" which opinion the Baptiſts have ever oppoſed. He freely owns, that the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of their churches in Germany and Holland are derived from a maxim of reformation, which was held by the Waldenſes, Petrobuſcians, Wicklifites, and Huſſites, long before Luther's day; which is, "That the kingdom of Chriſt, or the viſible church
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018336_0007_0FA5D374875F6F98"/>he had eſtabliſhed upon earth, was an aſſembly of true and real ſaints, and ought therefore to be inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to the wicked and unrighteous, and alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all thoſe inſtitutions, which human pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuggeſts to oppoſe the progreſs of iniquity, or to correct and reform tranſgreſſors." This max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im he declares to be the ſource of all their peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In 1525, and in 1533, a few men who were called Anabaptiſts, took the lead among mixed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, that had taken up arms againſt cruel tyrants, in hopes of recovering both civil and religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty thereby; but they periſhed in the attempt: A ſight of which carried the Baptiſt churches in that country ſo far into the other extreme, as not to allow their members to be magiſtrates, to uſe the ſword, or to take an oath<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. 3, p. 524, 525, 549</note>; which are now the ſentiments of the German Baptiſts in Pennſylvania. But the Engliſh Baptiſts, both in Europe and America, has carefully avoided each of theſe extremes, for theſe hundred and fifty years; yet thoſe ſcandals in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many have been conſtantly caſt upon them, even down to this day; not becauſe they ever had the leaſt concern therewith, but becauſe this has been found to be a powerful engine to prejudice the populace againſt allowing equal religious liberty, and for forcing people into religious covenants, before they can chooſe for themſelves.</p>
            <p>ALL the reformation that ever took place, in any age or country, was produced by the word of truth, enforced by the ſpirit of truth, upon each heart and conſcience. And the admiſſion of unſanctified com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants into the Chriſtian church, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men to govern it, have cauſed endleſs confuſions; as thereby three oppoſite intereſts have
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:018336_0008_0FA5D37515D45930"/>been ſet up. The intereſt of religious teachers, of civil officers, and of the people. The two former have conſpired together to enſlave the latter; and yet have been far from an entire harmony betwixt themſelves. Their conteſts for preheminence have been long and tedious in this country; but a great and effectual door is now opened for terminating theſe diſputes, and for a return to the primitive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and liberty of the Chriſtian church. To trace out the evil effects of the apoſtaſy, and to promote, as much as may be, ſuch a return, is the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign both of this and the former volume; in the compiling whereof a large number of records, books and papers, have been ſearched, and much pains taken to ſet principles and actions in as clear light as poſſible. And the author is ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring indulgence in any miſtakes, that he earneſtly requeſts the help of all to correct them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE fathers of New-England came much nearer to the apoſtolic order of the church, than moſt other reformers had done. Dr. Cotton Mather publiſhed a ſpecimen thereof in the year 1690. Says he, "A church (as the Greek name
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:018336_0017_0FA5D384EF321B88"/>for it allows us to think) is to conſiſt of a people <hi>called out</hi> from the ways of ſin, by the powerful and effectual work of God upon their ſouls. Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is the thing without which a title unto ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not to be pretended. Real regeneration is the thing which before God renders men capable of claiming ſacraments; and viſible and expreſſed regeneration is that which before men enables us to make ſuch a claim<note n="*" place="bottom">Companion for communicants, p. 29, 30, 37.</note>." From the firſt planting of the country to 1662, none were allowed to come to the ordinance of the ſupper, nor to bring their infants to baptiſm, without ſuch a profeſſion. The ſynod of that year opened a door for the children of church members to bring their infants upon a lower profeſſion; though in the Maſſachuſetts a profeſſion of regeneration was ſtill held to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in order for coming to full communion, or having a vote in the government, either of church or ſtate. This was eſſential to the nature of their plan, of a holy government, in imitation of the church of Iſrael. And for the church to govern the world, for good men to govern bad ones, ſeemed much more rational and ſcriptural, than for the world to govern the church about ſoul-guides, as they have done ſince: Previous to which the country was involved in moſt deplorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Their charter loſt; their ſea-coaſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with privateers and pirates, and their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers with ſavage enemies. An attempt to take Quebec in 1690 was defeated, which enraged the enemy the more againſt them, and alſo involved the country in a heavy debt; to diſcharge which paper money was firſt made here, the effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were very pernicious. Officers and people were
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:018336_0018_0FA5D3865F974F90"/>greatly divided in their minds about the cauſes of theſe calamities, and about what was the beſt way to remove them. And in this juncture they were alarmed with an apprehenſion that the powers of hell were let looſe upon them, which amazed and confounded them inexpreſſibly. The ſcene was introduced in the following manner:</p>
               <p n="2">II. A VARIETY of books, concerning witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, had been publiſhed in London and Boſton, which were diſperſed in New-England. And near the cloſe of 1691, a young daughter and a neice of Mr. Samuel Parris, miniſter of Salem village (now Danvers) with two other girls in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, made ſuch complaints of diſtreſs and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon their bodies, that a phyſician pronounced them bewitched. Hereupon an Indian woman, from New-Spain, that lived at the miniſter's houſe, tried ſome experiments to find out the witch, which ſhe pretended to have been uſed to in her own country. This coming to the knowledge of thoſe children, they accuſed her of being the witch; of appearing to them, and pinching, pricking and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of them. Teachers, rulers and people, were ſo much affected with this calamity, as to keep days of faſting and prayer for its removal; firſt at ſaid miniſter's houſe, next in the village, and then through the Colony. Such notice being taken of and pity ſhown to thoſe children, they increaſed their complaints; and others advanced like accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not only againſt the Indian woman, but alſo againſt two other old women in the place, ſo that all the three were committed to priſon on March 1, 1692. And this noiſe increaſed, and ſuch accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpread, till about an hundred perſons were impriſoned on that account. In the midſt of which diſtreſs, on May 14, Sir William Phips, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018336_0019_0FA5D3871BDD77F8"/>arrived at Boſton with their new charter, in company with Dr. Increaſe Mather, who procured it. The Governor and Council were ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to purge this growing evil from the land, that they did not wait for the meeting of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, to whom the conſtituting of Courts of Juſtice belonged, but conſtituted one themſelves, whereof Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and by their ſentence one woman was hanged on June 10; and by September 22, they executed ſeven men and thirteen women; after which that Court was diſſolved. And by the time that a Court of Oyer and Terminer was conſtituted according to charter, rulers and miniſters were ſo far convinced that they had acted upon wrong principles, and had alſo admitted the teſtimony of accuſers without ſufficient care and caution, that all the reſt of the accuſed were either acquitted upon trial, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by authority. A firſt principle that they acted upon in thoſe condemnations was, that God in his providence would not ſuffer the devil to appear to and afflict any in the ſhape of an innocent perſon. And they admitted one accuſer to one inſtance, and another to another, of thoſe ſpectoral appearances, to make up two witneſſes. They alſo who would confeſs themſelves to be witches, were admitted as witneſſes againſt others. And, ſays a gentleman who was a careful obſerver of thoſe tranſactions, "Theſe confeſſors, by their plauſible confeſſions and accuſations of others, begetting cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, have been a great, if not the greateſt engine of Satan to carry on the accuſing and apprehending of others, until this matter came to ſuch a height, that, if it had not been ſtopped, might have brought the beſt Chriſtians in the country under the imputation of that abomination, and have involved all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018336_0020_0FA5D387D9A99C50"/>and blood<note n="*" place="bottom">A modeſt enquiry into the nature of witchcraft, by John Hale, miniſter of Beverly, 1697. p. 78.</note>." Deplorable indeed was the caſe of New-England at that time; though we are aſſured, by men who have ſearched fully into the matter, that a greater number of perſons were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for witchcraft in only one county in England, even in the looſe reign of Charles the ſecond, than all that were put to death here; and alſo that theſe executions were under the influence of laws and precedents from thence<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hale, p. 25; 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">III. WE cannot find that the Baptiſts had any hand in thoſe confuſed and bloody proceedings; yet much pains have been taken to turn the ſame againſt them. A late miniſter of Danvers, the place where thoſe deluſions began, ſays, "It is reported of witches, and thoſe that hold unlawful commerce with evil ſpirits, that in order to their entering into confederacy with them, they are ſolicited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their baptiſm, even though received in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; which ſhews, that ſuch a renunciation of baptiſm, which Dr. Gill pleads for and commends, is matter of <hi>great impiety</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Clark againſt Gill, 1752, p. 33.</note>." What Dr. Gill plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, was the renouncing of infant ſprinkling, and the practiſing of believer's baptiſm, according to primitive inſtitution. But how far was that from the witchcraft at Danvers or Salem! The plaineſt inſtances of any mention of baptiſm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were as follow. In the examination of a woman before authority, July 21, 1992, were theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and anſwers, viz. "Q. Goody Lacey! how many years ago ſince they were baptized? A.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018336_0021_0FA5D3889AD2D240"/>Three or four years ago, I ſuppoſe. Q. Who baptized them? A. The old ſerpent. Q. How did he do it? A. He <hi>dipped</hi> their heads in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying they were his, and that he had power over them. Q. Where was this? A. At Falls River. Q. How many were baptized that day? A. Some of the chief, I think there were ſix baptized. Q. Name them. A. I think they were of the <hi>higher powers.</hi>" Alſo Capt. Oſgood's wife, of Andover, was made to confeſs, that ſhe with others had been carried through the air to a certain pond, where the devil <hi>dipped</hi> her face in the water, and made her renounce her former baptiſm. But ſhe, with five others in priſon, gave in a retraction of their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Court, wherein they declared that they were amazed and affrighted out of their reaſon, by ſome gentlemen who told them they knew they were witches, and therefore they aſſented to what was ſuggeſted to them, as the only way they had left to ſave their lives; but when they came to be better compoſed, they profeſſed that they were innocent and ignorant of ſuch things. And fifty-three of their neighbours gave in a written teſtimony to the Court, that they believed this to be an honeſt retraction; one of whom was Dudley Bradſtreet, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Mr. Parris and other miniſters were very officious in thoſe examinations of perſons accuſed of witchcraft<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon's hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 31, 36, 40—44.</note>; and ſixty years after Mr. Clark muſt bring up the ſame, to prove that "Renouncing of his early de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication muſt appear ſuch an inſtance of <hi>impiety,</hi> as to a conſiderate perſon were enough to put a ſtop to his proceedings, how inclinable ſoever he might be to thoſe principles on other accounts<note n="‖" place="bottom">Againſt Gill, p. 33.</note>." Such methods have they taken to frighten people from
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018336_0022_0FA5D38971B138D0"/>ſeeing with their own eyes, and from acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own judgments, in the great concerns of the ſoul and eternity.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THE ſecond Maſſachuſetts charter, which was dated October 7, 1691, allowed equal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience to all Chriſtians, except Papiſts. The firſt General Court under it met a Boſton June 9, 1692, to whom Dr. Cotton Mather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a ſermon, wherein he ſaid, "The civil Magiſtrate is moſt properly the officer of human ſociety, and a Chriſtian, by nonconformity to this or that impoſed way of worſhip, does not break the terms on which he is to enjoy the benefits of human ſociety." And ten years after he publiſhed this and other paſſages, in his hiſtory of New-England, and ſaid he would thereby ſtop the noiſe about perſecution therein<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnalia, b. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. p. 28, 29.</note> But how could that be done? for he ſaid, "The General Aſſembly may, by their acts, give a <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto the religion which is the <hi>general profeſſion</hi> of the inhabitants<note n="§" place="bottom">Account of his father's life, p. 141.</note>." That is, may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power ſome to judge for others about worſhip, and to enforce their judgments with the ſword; which is the root of the worſt perſecutions in the world. He knew that ſuch acts as he ſpake of could not take place here without the royal aſſent; yet ſaid he "I am verily perſuaded, that the nearneſs of our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the crown will be found one of our moſt glorious advantages." His reaſon therefor is, its giving them a greater ſecurity in future ſhaking times. But experience has now demonſtrated, that it is better to truſt in the Lord than to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Princes. He in that ſermon called Cambridge college. "A river, the ſtreams whereof
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018336_0023_0FA5D38AECFD0760"/>made glad the city of God<note n="†" place="bottom">Said ſermon, p. 57, 66, 87.</note>;" which method of applying thoſe words of divine revelation to human ſchools, is doubtleſs a perverting of them; and is a way which has done much hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Chriſtians are required to withdraw from ſuch as ſuppoſe that gain is godlineſs; yet now a freehold worth forty ſhillings a year, or other eſtate worth fifty pounds (which was ſoon after reduced to forty) gave every inhabitant a right to vote for legiſlators; and an Aſſembly ſo elected, in their ſeſſion at Boſton, October 12, 1692, enacted,—"That the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of each town within this Province ſhall take due care, from time to time, to be conſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of an able, learned and orthodox miniſter or miniſters, of good converſation, to diſpenſe the word of God to them; which miniſter or miniſters ſhall be ſuitably encouraged, and ſufficiently ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained, by the inhabitants of ſuch town. And all contracts, agreements and orders, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made, or that ſhall hereafter be made, by the inhabitants of any town within this Province, reſpecting their miniſters or ſchool-maſters, as to their ſettlement or maintenance, ſhall remain good and valid, according to the true intent thereof, the whole time for which they were or ſhall be made, in all the particulars thereof, and ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be purſued, put in execution, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And where there is no contract and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in any town, reſpecting the ſupport and maintenance of the miniſtry, or when the ſame happens to be expired, and the inhabitants of ſuch town ſhall neglect to make ſuitable proviſion therein, upon complaint thereof made unto the Quarter Seſſions of the Peace for the county where ſuch town lies, the ſaid Court ſhall, and hereby

               <p>"AND it is further enacted, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective churches, in the ſeveral towns within this Province, ſhall at all times hereafter uſe, exerciſe and enjoy, all their privileges and freedoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting divine worſhip, church order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and ſhall be encouraged in the peaceable and regular profeſſion and practice thereof.</p>

               <p>THEY had here entered upon a new and untried ſcence; and the glaring contradiction betwixt the two laſt paragraphs of this law, with their finding that ſome towns had more than one church therein, as alſo that Boſton would not ſubmit to it, cauſed the Aſſembly, in their next ſeſſion of February 8, 1693, to repeal thoſe two paragraphs, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the reſt of that law to enact, "That each reſpective gathered church, in any town or place within this Province, that at any time ſhall be in want of a miniſter, ſuch church ſhall have power, according to the directions given in the word of God, to chooſe their own miniſter;" yet not to ſettle him without the concurrence of the majority of voters in town affairs, who uſually meet therewith for worſhip; but that being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then "all the inhabitants and rateable eſtates lying within ſuch town, or part of a town, or place, limited by law for upholding the public worſhip of God, ſhall be obliged to pay in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion towards the miniſter's ſettlement and ſupport. Provided, that nothing herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is intended, or ſhall be conſtrued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to <hi>abridge</hi> the inhabitants of Boſton of their accuſtomed way and practice, as to the choice and maintenance of their miniſters."</p>
               <p n="5">V. HERE it is to be noted, that like cauſes may ever be expected to produce like effects. One of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018336_0026_0FA5D3901D58DCF8"/>our moſt eſſential rights is not to be taxed where we are not repreſented. And it is moſt certain, that a civil legiſlature are not our religious repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and in order then to tax the country to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious teachers, they were <hi>obridged</hi> of the rights which Boſton would not part with. So when Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Hutchinſon was purſuing the ſcheme, in 1769, of having America taxed by Britain, he ſaid, "there muſt be an <hi>abridgement</hi> of what are called Engliſh liberties." But the bloody effects of that attempt, are a loud warning to all after ages. The Aſſembly went on, in ſaid law, to empower the rateable inhabitants of any town where no church was gathered, to call and ſettle a miniſter, by the advice and direction of three neighbouring ordained miniſters, who ſhould be ſupported as others were; and alſo to enact, that if any town or place neglected to obey theſe laws, their Select-Men, or other officers, ſhould be convented before their county Court, and, upon conviction of ſuch neglect, be fined Forty Shillings for the firſt offence, and Four Pounds for every after conviction. As a fruit of which, a warrant was ſent from Briſtol Court, "requiring the town of Swanzey to chooſe a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter according to law." The town met upon it Auguſt 28, and adjourned to October 17, 1693, when they concluded to report to the Court, that Elder Samuel Luther was their miniſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Swanzey town records.</note> He was ordained paſtor of the firſt church there, July 22, 1685, by the aſſiſtance of the Elders Hull and Emblen, of Boſton.

VII. THIS I carefully copied from the original, preſerved in Elder Luther's family; and Briſtol Court could not be ignorant of his being thus owned as the ſettled miniſter of Swanzey; yet this attempt muſt be made for the other denomination, though they have never been able to ſet up their worſhip in that town to this day. A ſecond Baptiſt church was formed therein, and Mr. Thomas Barnes was ordained paſtor of it in 1693. It may be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enquire into the reaſon of their being ſo much better treated when under Plymouth govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than they were after they were incorporated with the Maſſachuſetts.</p>
               <p>PLYMOUTH people were taught in Holland, that the church was the ſchool wherein Chriſt trained up his miniſters; though they were far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing human learning in its place. One of their proofs was the 14th chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians; upon which their learned paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Mr. Robinſon, made the following remarks. Says he, "That the Apoſtle in this chapter directs the church in the uſe of extraordinary gifts, is moſt evident: Neither will I deny but that the officers are to guide and order this action of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,</hi> as all other public buſineſs, yea, even theſe wherein the brethren have greateſt liberty: But that he intends the eſtabliſhing of, and ſo takes order, and gives direction for an ordinary conſtant exerciſe in the church, even by men out of office, I do manifeſt by theſe reaſons.

                     <item>(1.)

                     <item>(2.) In ver. 21, he permits <hi>all</hi> to <hi>propheſy,</hi> and ſpeaks as largely of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying as of <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>receiving comfort.</hi> But leſt any ſhould object, may women alſo propheſy? the apoſtle prevents that objection, and it may be reproves that diſorder amongſt the Corinthians, ver. 34, by a flat inhibition, enjoining them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to keep ſilence in the church, in the preſence of men, to whom they ought to be ſubject, and to learn at home of their huſbands, and not by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to uſurp authority over them, 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12, which men in propheſying do lawfully uſe.</item>

Now in that Paul forbids women, he gives liberty to all men, gifted accordingly, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing women to men, ſex to ſex, and not women to officers, which were frivolous.

Now, as the church of Plymouth had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acted upon theſe principles, it was eaſy for them to look upon Elder Luther as a miniſter of Chriſt, whoſe church was of the ſame mind about that point of goſpel order. But a miniſter of chief note among the Maſſachuſetts ſays, "That cuſtom, of the propheſying of private brethren, was not obſerved in any of the churches of New-England beſides themſelves: The miniſters of the reſpective churches there not being ſo well ſatisfied in the way thereof as Mr. Robinſon was. The moſt judicious and leading elders among ſaid churches, as Mr. Cotton, &amp;c. that were not abſolutely againſt the thing, were yet afraid that the wantonneſs of the preſent age would not well bear ſuch a liberty as that great light of theſe churches expreſſed, to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018336_0031_0FA5D3961EB6F5F8"/>a perſon of great quality, to whom he bore no ſmall reſpect, a few hours before he departed this life<note n="†" place="bottom">Hubbard.</note>." But Mr. Robinſon ſays, "It is apparent, both in the ſcriptures and eccleſiaſtical writers, that not only pride and contention, but hereſy, and almoſt all other evils, have ſprung from the officers and governors of the church. And ſurely nothing hath more in former days advanced, nor doth at this day more uphold the throne of Antichriſt, than the people's diſcharging themſelves of the care of public affairs in the church, on the one ſide, and the prieſts and prelates arrogating all to themſelves on the other<note n="†" place="bottom">Robinſon, p. 204.</note>."</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Two brethren of Plymouth church were ordained paſtors of other churches in 1694. One of them was Mr. Jonathan Donham, who was ordained at Edgarton, on Martha's Vineyard. The other was at Middleborough, fourteen miles weſt of Plymouth. About ſixteen families began to plant here a little before Philip's war; who moved away when the war broke out, and returned again after it was over; and Mr. Samuel Fuller preached to them till a church was conſtituted among them this year, and he was ordained their paſtor. The ſettlement of Dartmouth began about the ſame time with Middleborough, and their firſt teacher was alſo from Plymouth, but not in the ſame way. His name was John Cooke, who was a deacon in Plymouth church for ſome years; but was caſt out of it in the latter part of Mr. Reyner's miniſtry there, who left them in November, 1654. It is ſaid that Cooke was excommunicated for having been the author of much diſſention and diviſion, and for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018336_0032_0FA5D397523E1EC8"/>afterwards running into ſectarian and Anabaptiſtical principles. And alſo that Reyner's removal was partly occaſioned by the unſettledneſs of the church, "Too many of the members being leavened with prejudices againſt a <hi>learned</hi> miniſtry, by means of <hi>ſectaries</hi> then ſpreading through the land<note n="*" place="bottom">Plymouth regiſter, p. 4, 12.</note>." Some light concerning them may be gathered from the following facts. Plymouth church took much pains to obtain learned paſtors, if they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well qualified; but they refuſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to human ſchools for miniſters, or to compel the world to ſupport them. They laboured hard to get the learned Mr. Charles Chauncy to ſettle as a colleague with Mr. Reyner; but Mr. Chauncy could not conſent to it, becauſe goſpel baptiſm appeared to him to be <hi>dipping,</hi> and that ſprinkling for baptiſm was <hi>unlawful,</hi> as their church records wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In 1650 a ſeparation commenced at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboth, becauſe Mr. Newman, their miniſter, with ſix others, aſſumed all the power of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelves, under the name of "The church repreſentative<note n="†" place="bottom">Clarke's narrative, p. 24.</note>." For this uſurpation a number of the church withdrew, and ſet up wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by themſelves; and the miniſters tried hard to move Plymouth Court to ſuppreſs them by force, but could not prevail therein. Theſe people ſoon after became Baptiſts; and one of them was moſt ſhamefully and cruelly perſecuted the next year at Boſton. By ſearching into theſe matters, Mr. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar, Preſident of Harvard college, was brought openly to renounce infant baptiſm. And ſeeing the temper which was diſcovered in the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſſetts, he removed into Plymouth Colony, the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018336_0033_0FA5D3979C07A4D8"/>very year that Reyner moved out of it; as ſeveral other miniſters alſo did about that time, becauſe they could not bring Plymouth rulers into the uſe of tax and compulſion for their ſupport. (Vol 1, p. 282—284, 320.) And though Reyner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Cooke, yet, not being able to bring the church into all his meaſures, he left them, and robbed them of their church-records, which they never recovered; ſo that what records Plymouth church now has, were afterwards collected from memory and private writings. Theſe facts may help the reader in forming a judgment of what Cooke's ſectarian principles were, and alſo how he came by them. His poſterity inform me, that he was a Baptiſt, and that he preached the doctrine of election, with the other doctrines of ſovereign grace, in Dartmouth for a number of years. And it appears by Mr. Samuel Hubbard's letters, that a Baptiſt church was formed upon the weſt borders of Dartmouth, in the year 1685, wherein Hugh Moſier and Aaron Davis were principal leaders; which church is continued by ſucceſſion to this day; though the Quakers are the moſt numerous of any one ſect in that town.</p>
               <p n="10">X. ON Auguſt 24, 1695, the church of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough was bereaved of their beloved paſtor, aet. 66; "A great loſs to the place, ſaid Mr. Cotton, he being a ſincere godly man, and uſeful preacher." Mr. Iſaac Cuſhman, another member of Plymouth church, was invited to ſucceed him; but having a call at Plymton (betwixt here and Plymouth) at the ſame time, he accepted it; and was ordained there in 1698<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. John Cotton, above referred to, was ſon to the famous miniſter of that name in Boſton. He was miniſter at Plymouth about 30 years, till contentions about the above points of church order occaſioned his diſmiſſion, by advice of a council in 1697, and the next year he went and gathered a Congregational church in Charleſtown, South-Carolina, where he died much lamented September 18, 1699. <hi>Plymouth regiſter,</hi> p. 21, 22.</note>; and was continued a great bleſſing to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018336_0034_0FA5D3985BEAB2B0"/>them for about forty years. But thirteen miniſters, in and near Boſton, publiſhed a letter of advice to the churches, dated December 28, 1699, in the 8th page of which they repreſent it to be a <hi>jeſuitical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> for any to hold, "That <hi>illiterate</hi> men may be ſerviceable and admirable preachers." This with other things moved their churches to look only to colleges for miniſters for a long time after. In the mean while, as the empowering the world to controul the church in the choice of paſtors was an untried path to them, it took them three years to find out what to do, when a pariſh did not concur with the church therein. But when the Aſſembly met at Boſton, May 29, 1695, they enacted, that in ſuch a caſe the church ſhould call a council of three or five neighbouring churches, who ſhould decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy thus: If the council approved of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon elected, the pariſh muſt ſubmit and ſupport him; if not, then the church muſt give up their choice, and call another miniſter, and in this method they have proceeded ever ſince. And it may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hear the judgment of a number of their moſt eminent men, about the ſtate of religion in New-England in thoſe times.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE learned and pious Mr. Thomas Prince ſays, "The ſecond generation riſing and growing thick on the ſtage, a little after 1660, there began to appear a <hi>decay;</hi> and this increaſed to 1670, when it grew viſible and threatening, and was generally complained of and bewailed bitterly by the pious among them; and yet much more to 1680, when but few of the firſt generation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained." One of his proofs hereof is what Mr. William Stoughton delivered in an election ſermon at Boſton, April 29, 1668; when he ſaid, "The death and removal of the Lord's eminent ſervants, in one rank and in another, hath manifeſted the <hi>lie</hi> in many of us. Whilſt they lived, their piety
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018336_0036_0FA5D39A230393C8"/>and zeal, their light and life, their counſels and authority, their examples and awe, kept us right, and drew us on in the ways of God, to profeſs and practiſe the beſt things. But now they are gone, ah! how doth the unſoundneſs, the rottenneſs and hypocriſy of too many among us make itſelf known, as it was with Joaſh after the death of Jehoiada<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſt. vol. 1. p. 94, 95. In 1671 Mr. Stoughton was elected into the Council, and he died there Lieut. Gov. in 1702.</note>!" Other of his proofs are in vol. 1. p. 405, 406.</p>
               <p n="2">II. IN 1680 Mr. Willard ſaid, "Be ſure, when the glory of God and the ſpiritual good of your brother requires it, that you carry on your reproofs to conviction. There are ſome things that ariſe only from ſudden paſſion, and there a tranſient rebuke may be enough: Other things may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, and men are led into them more gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; they may alſo be eminently reproachful to religion, and a dangerous ſnare to the ſouls of them that are tempted; our connivance in ſuch caſes may not only blemiſh our profeſſion, but be a great hazard to it alſo. At ſuch times, and in ſuch caſe, you <hi>break your covenant</hi> if you ſuffer ſin in your brother, without uſing all the means which Chriſt hath preſcribed, and in the order he hath preſcribed them, till the end be obtained. If pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate admonition followed with gentleneſs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience will not gain, but they ſtill perſiſt in evil courſes, or are not humbled for ſuch faults, you muſt proceed by ſteps as far as Chriſt has bid you. And I believe there is no one thing wherein the covenant is more univerſally broken, than in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of this duty; and if the uſe of theſe ordinances ſhall once come to ceaſe among the churches, and the ſins of church members be not regularly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018336_0037_0FA5D39D5D535300"/>by reaſon of the unfaithfulneſs of brethren, religion will languiſh, and the power of godlineſs fail. It is not the extending of the covenant to Chriſtians (as ſome dream) but the neglect of covenant duties towards them, that is like to be the bane of our profeſſion, if any thing. Eli indulged his ſons, and one profeſſor indulgeth another; and it is to be feared, that if this were ſearched to the bottom, it would be found that the original of it is ſelf-indulgence, and that when men wink at ſcandals in their brethren, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they expect the like in way of retaliation: And if things once come to this paſs, let any ſober and prudent man conjecture whether this be not the way to <hi>cheriſh apoſtaſy.</hi>" Dr. Increaſe Mather, in the preface, gave a ſpecial recommendation of this paſſage<note n="*" place="bottom">Willard on covenant keeping, p. 110, 111.</note> Three years after another of their fathers, who was miniſter at Weymouth, delivered a ſermon before their Legiſlature, which he called, <hi>A plea for the life of dying religion;</hi> wherein he ſaid, "There is already a great death upon religion, little more left than a name to live.—Conſider we then how much it is dying reſpecting the BEING of it, by the general failure of the work of CONVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION; whereby ONLY it is that religion is propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, continued, and upheld in being among any people.

III. THE life of Mr. Jonathan Mitchel was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1697; and Dr. Increaſe Mather dedicated this work, which his ſon had compiled, to the church and college at Cambridge; to whom he ſaid, "Dr. Owen has evinced, that the letting go this principle, that particular churches ought to conſiſt of REGENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATE PERSONS, brought in the GREAT APOSTASY of the Chriſtian church. The way to prevent the like apoſtaſy in theſe churches, is to require an account of thoſe that offer themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion therein, concerning the <hi>work of God on their ſouls,</hi> as well as concerning their knowledge and belief.—Mr. Mitchel ſays, the over-enlarging of full communion, or admiſſion of perſons thereto, upon ſlight qualifications, without inſiſting upon the practical and ſpiritual part of religion, will not only loſe the power of godlineſs, but in a little time bring in profaneneſs, and ruin the churches, theſe two ways.

IV. IN the year 1700 Mather publiſhed another book, which he dedicated to the churches of Chriſt in New-England; to whom he ſaid, "The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational church diſcipline is not ſuited for a worldly intereſt, or a formal generation of profeſſors. It will ſtand or fall as godlineſs, in the power of it, does prevail, or otherwiſe: That there is a great decay of the power of religion throughout all New-England is lamentably true; if that revive, there will be no fear of departing from the holy diſcipline of the churches of Chriſt.—If the begun apoſtaſy ſhould proceed as faſt, the next thirty years, as it has done theſe laſt, ſurely it will come to that in New-England (except the goſpel itſelf depart with the order of it) that the moſt conſcientious people therein will think themſelves concerned to gather churches out of churches." He goes on to caution and warn them againſt many evils; one of which is a dull formality in relations of experiences, in order for admiſſion to communion. And he then ſays, "There are reports, as if in ſome churches perſons have brought <hi>written</hi> relations, firſt to the miniſter and then to the church, which were not of their own dictating, but deviſed by others for them. I hope theſe reports have nothing of truth in them; but if they have, I am ſure that ſuch <hi>liars to the Holy Ghoſt</hi> have exceedingly provoked the Lord."

               <p n="5">V. MR.

The decays which we already languiſh under are ſad; and what tokens are on our children, that it is like to be better hereafter? God be thanked that there are ſome among them that promiſe well; but alas, how doth vanity abound among them! How do young profeſſors grow weary of the ſtrict profeſſion of their fathers, and become diſputants for the things which their progenitors forſook a pleaſant land for the avoidance of?"

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018336_0041_0FA5D3A0C844CE58"/>ſecular and miniſterial Courts over them; but theſe evils were now coming in like a ſtood upon New-England. A church was formed in Brattle-ſtreet, Boſton, in 1699, with a profeſſed deſign of not requiring ſuch a ſtrict profeſſion of communicants as their fathers did. And Dr. Coleman, their miniſter, was judged to have the chief hand in publiſhing an anonymous anſwer to Preſident Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's vindication of their former order. And a diſcourſe was printed in London, in 1700, wrote by Mr. Solomon Stoddard, of Northampton, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he blends the Jewiſh and Chriſtian diſpenſations together, in ſuch a manner as to hold, that as all who were circumciſed were obliged to keep the paſſover, ſo that all who were baptized ought to come to the Lord's ſupper, yea, "Though they know themſelves to be in a <hi>natural condition.</hi>" And by confounding the work of Jewiſh and Chriſtian officers together, he aſſerted that the power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, cenſuring, and reſtoring of members, is wholly inveſted in the elders, ſo that "The bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the church are not to intermeddle with it." When any of them, though they were unjuſtly dealt with, they might appeal to a claſſical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and national judicature. And ſays he, "A national ſynod is the higheſt eccleſiaſtical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon earth.—Every man muſt ſtand to the judgment of the national ſynod, Deut. xvii. 12<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stoddard on inſtituted churches, p. 12, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THESE are the words of a miniſter of great note in New-England, whoſe doctrine has had an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpread therein ever ſince. Yet theſe are ſome of the main principles that formerly brought on the Antichriſtian apoſtaſy; and no text in the bible could be more aptly turned to favour their bloody perſecutions, than the one here brought to prove
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018336_0042_0FA5D3A15578FA90"/>his laſt point. For it ſays, <hi>The man that will do preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken unto the prieſt, or unto the judge, even that man ſhall die.</hi> The prieſt was to explain God's law, and the judge was to carry the ſame into execution. This is the very paſſage that the miniſters brought in 1668, to prove that the Baptiſts in Boſton ought to be baniſhed (vol. 1. p. 385.) But Dr. Owen, in his piece upon tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in 1648, truly obſerved, that as God was the head and lawgiver of that nation, idolatry, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or ſeducing of others from his worſhip, were capital crimes; and that applying of thoſe laws to caſes of worſhip or diſcipline in other nations, with the infliction of any other puniſhment than death, was nothing but <hi>arbitrary</hi> proceedings. To which I may add, that Jeſus Chriſt, and ſouls who are <hi>born again,</hi> are all the prieſts that are named in the new teſtament, 1 Pet. i. 23, ii. 5, and the name is never applied therein to officers, in diſtinction from other ſaints. Men who have tried to take the power of church government out of the hands of the ſaints, in particular churches, have never been able to fix any rational bounds to it elſewhere. A ſynod of each nation is the bounds that Mr. Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard propoſed in this piece, but would exclude the Engliſh biſhops therefrom, becauſe they are not choſen by the church, but the State<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 30.</note>; but they were for other meaſures.</p>

They drew up propoſals for aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be formed in each county, who ſhould have the power of licencing candidates for the miniſtry, and of directing particular ſocieties, in the call and ſettlement of miniſters; to which was to be added a ſtanding Council, whoſe ſentence ſhould be final and deciſive, but not without the concurrence of the majority of the paſtors preſent. A number of miniſters ſigned theſe propoſals November 5, 1705, an hundred years to a day after the gunpowder plot was to have blown up the Parliament in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter. They were ſent round for others to ſign, in order to their being preſented to the Legiſlature. But Mr. John Wiſe had been ſo well taught, by the briers and thorns of tyranny (vol. 1, p. 518) that, inſtead of ſigning them, he wrote a ſharp anſwer to them; and though he was forced to ſend into another Colony to get it printed, yet their deſign was defeated thereby. The ancient church of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth changed their way of receiving members, from verbal to written relations, in this month of November, 1705<note n="*" place="bottom">Plymouth regiſter, p. 31.</note>.</p>

An old law was in force in Connecticut, intituled, HERETICS, which forbid any town or perſon to entertain any Quaker, upon penalty of Five Pounds a week, and required that they ſhould be impriſoned and ſent out of the Colony: That none ſhould hold unneceſſary diſcourſe with them, upon penalty of Twenty Shillings: That none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept rulers and miniſters, ſhould keep any Quaker books, upon penalty of Ten Shillings, and that all ſuch books ſhould be ſuppreſſed; and that no maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any veſſel ſhould land any Quakers, without carrying them away again, under the penalty of Twenty Pounds. And though this law was not rigorouſly executed, yet it was not repealed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their friends in London made application, in 1704, to the Preſbyterian, Congregational, and Baptiſt miniſters there, deſiring that as they would ſhew themſelves friends to equal liberty, they would uſe their influence in their favour, and apply to the Queen for a repeal of ſaid law. This was thought not to be ſo agreeable, as to try for a reformation in New-England; and therefore ſaid miniſters in London wrote, to ſome miniſters of influence here, a letter to be communicated to others, wherein they ſaid, "We cannot but judge it diſagreeable with the ſpirit and principles of the goſpel, and an encroachment upon the DIVINE PREROGATIVE and the undoubted rights of mankind, to puniſh any for their conſcientious and peaceable diſſent from the eſtabliſhed way of religion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Preſident Mather anſwered him in 1708, when he ſaid of this paſſage, "I am miſtaken if in this logic there is not ſophiſtry." But the miſery of both of them was, an entanglement in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent ſcheme. The advocates for the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way covenant in 1662 ſaid, we know of no ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er argument for infant baptiſm than this, that church members are to be baptized (vol. 1, p. 335) and now Stoddard ſays, "The ſacrament is a converting ordinance to church members only, and not for other men.

               <p>How imperfect is human knowledge! Stoddard publiſhed a reply in 1709, wherein all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments turn upon theſe points, viz. "That if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified perſons might lawfully come to the paſſover, then ſuch may lawfully come to the Lord's ſupper;—and they who convey to their children a right to baptiſm, have a right themſelves to the Lord's ſupper, provided they carry inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively<note n="†" place="bottom">Appeal to the learned, p. 50, 89.</note>." He could plainly ſee that there was no half way in the Jewiſh church; and his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent could ſee as plainly, that fruits meet for repentance were required in order for baptiſm, even of ſuch as were in the covenant of circumciſion. But as tradition had taught them both to build the Chriſtian church upon that covenant, neither of them could act conſiſtently thereon; though they were two of the moſt eminent miniſters then in New-England.

Perceiving that it could not be received ſo, it was withdrawn without much noiſe, and the following method was taken to carry his point; an act was paſſed by the Aſſembly that met at Hartford, May 13, 1708, which ſays, "This Aſſembly, from their own obſervation, and from the complaint of others, being made ſenſible of the defects of the diſcipline of the churches of this government, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the want of a more explicit aſſerting the rules given for that end in the holy ſcriptures, from which would ariſe a firm eſtabliſhment amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a good and regular iſſue in caſes ſubject to eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, glory to Chriſt our head, and edification to his members<note n="*" place="bottom">Church and State are here <hi>confounded</hi> together; as if a being members of the civil community, made men members of Chriſt, and he their head.</note>, hath ſeen fit to

This order was obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the miniſters who met at Saybrook, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 9, 1708, adopted the confeſſion of faith that was compoſed at the Savoy in London, 1658, and the heads of agreement entered into between Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Independents in London, 1690, and then added fifteen articles concerning church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which were the propoſals of 1705 new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled, with ſcripture references annexed to each ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: Though a gentleman of that day obſerved, that the text which ſpeaks of Balaam's ſaddling his aſs would have been as much to the purpoſe as many they brought. Their ſecond article, which contains a ſummary of the whole ſcheme, is in theſe words, viz.</p>
               <p>"THAT the churches, which are neighbouring each to other, ſhall conſociate for mutual afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>THE firſt of theſe texts ſpeaks of Princes on their thrones, and not of church officers. And when we come to the antetype of Aaron and David's line, we find none therein but Jeſus Chriſt, and regenerate ſouls. Officers, as diſtinguiſhed from other ſaints in the Chriſtian church, are never called prieſts nor Kings in the new teſtament. And ſaid an eminent father of New-England, "The order of officers in the church is an order of <hi>ſervants,</hi> and the order of ſaints an order of <hi>Kings</hi> (which is the higheſt order in the church) <hi>ſitting upon the thrones of David for judgment,</hi> whom the miniſters are to ſerve, in guiding and going before them in, and miniſtring of their judgments<note n="*" place="bottom">Robinſon againſt Bernard, p. 227.</note>." Their ſecond proof refers to the <hi>unity of brethren</hi> under our great High Prieſt, who moſt explicitly excludes all ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about who ſhall be the greateſt from his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Neither is the third text any more to their purpoſe. The fourth gives an account of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one church, at the requeſt of another two hundred miles off, upon a ſpecial occaſion, and not of the meeting of neighbouring churches upon all occaſions eccleſiaſtical. The two laſt treat of gifts received by <hi>prophecy,</hi> and of <hi>orders</hi> given to the churches by apoſtolic authority; and until ordinary miniſters can prove that they, as ſuch, are Princes
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018336_0053_0FA5D3B36F6ABF88"/>on their thrones, and are endowed with apoſtolic authority over the churches, we may ſafely conclude, that the above application of ſcriptures was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of them from their genuine meaning and deſign. Yet thereby two kinds of judicatures were ſet up over the churches. The one called conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations, conſiſting of miniſters meeting in their own perſons, and churches by their meſſengers, whereof each church may ſend one or two, though the want of them is not to invalidate the acts of any Council; but none of their acts are eſteemed valid without the concurrence of the majority of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors preſent. They are the ſtanding council within each circuit upon all occaſions eccleſiaſtical, though in caſes of ſpecial difficulty they may call the next conſociation to ſit and act with them. They are to have a new choice of meſſengers and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors once a year, if not oftener, and the laſt mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator is to call a new meeting when it is judged proper. Their ſentence is to be final and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Their other judicatures are called aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are meetings of miniſters by themſelves in each circuit, as often as they think proper, to hear and anſwer questions of importance, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and licence candidates for the miniſtry, to receive complaints from individuals or ſocieties, and to direct to the calling of the Council to try the ſame, when they judge proper; to direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute churches in calling and ſettling of paſtors, and to make complaint to their Legiſlature againſt ſuch as they judge to be negligent of their duty in that reſpect. And each aſſociation ſends a delegate or two to a general aſſociation once a year, from all parts of that government.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018336_0054_0FA5D3B41CC80EA8"/>to the <hi>common practice</hi> of our churches, nothing ſhall be deemed an act or judgment of any Council, which hath not the major part of the elders preſent concurring, and ſuch a number of the meſſengers preſent, as makes the majority of the Council." Whereas this practice was ſo far from being <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that it was an innovation then made, directly ſubverſive of the fundamental principles of the New-England churches; as we are aſſured by Mr. Wiſe, Dr. Mather, and others. No man knew better what thoſe principles were than Mr. Thomas Hooker, the firſt miniſter of Hartford; and he is full in it, that though it is expedient on ſpecial occaſions to call councils or ſynods, yet that elders act therein as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſent, and not as paſtors; and that other meſſengers ſent have equal power with them<note n="*" place="bottom">Survey of church diſcipline, part 1. p. 119.</note> Says he, "<hi>God hath ſet officers in the church,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 28, therefore the church is before officers<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 91.</note>." And from Matt. xviii. 15, and 1 Cor. v. 12, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, "That each man and member of the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, in a juſt way, may be directed, cenſured, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or removed, by the power of the whole, and each may and ſhould <hi>judge</hi> with the conſent of the whole: This belongs to all the members, and therefore to any that ſhall be in office, if they be members.

And he obſerves, that to remove the power of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018336_0055_0FA5D3B4DBD86330"/>cenſure from a particular church, leads into endleſs diſputes; becauſe no general Council was called in the three firſt centuries, and no man can tell as there will ever be another<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 188, 190, 232, 238.</note>. Says he, "The truth is, <hi>a particular congregation is the higheſt tribunal,</hi> unto which the grieved party may appeal in the third place, if private council, or the witneſſes of two, have ſeemed to proceed too ſharply. If diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ariſe in proceeding, the Council of other churches ſhould be ſought to clear the truth; but the <hi>power of cenſure</hi> reſts in the congregation where Chriſt placed it.

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Part 4, p. 19, 47.</note>." Yet now the churches were not allowed the power to ſay whether their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould meet at Saybrook, or not; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their meeting being laid before the Legiſlature of October 14, 1708, they ſaid, "This Aſſembly do declare their great approbation of ſuch a happy agreement, and do ordain that all the churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this government, that are or ſhall be thus united, in doctrine, worſhip and diſcipline, be, and for the future ſhall be owned and acknowledged eſtabliſhed by law. Provided always, that nothing herein ſhall be intended and conſtrued, to hinder or prevent any ſociety or church, that is or ſhall be allowed by the laws of this government, who ſoberly differ or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the united churches hereby eſtabliſhed, from exerciſing worſhip and diſcipline in their own way, according to their conſciences." Thus artfully was this new ſcheme eſtabliſhed, and all others declared to be no more than allowed or tolerated.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. MR. John Woodward, another Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ſcholar, was then miniſter of Norwich;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018336_0056_0FA5D3B593BDE4E0"/>and he ſoon got and read off to his congregation the firſt part of this act, but without the proviſo. Richard Buſhnel and Joſeph Backus, Eſquires, who had oppoſed that ſcheme in the Aſſembly, informed their church of the liberty they had to diſſent from it; but the miniſter carried a major vote againſt them; therefore thoſe repreſentatives, and other fathers of the town, withdrew from that tyranny, and held worſhip by themſelves for three months. For this the miniſter and his party cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them; an account of which being ſent to the next meeting of the Aſſembly, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereform. Hereby we may ſee how far corruption had prevailed in our land. For in 1641, three years after the firſt taxing law for miniſters was made in New-England, a law was made at Boſton, which ſaid, "No church cenſure ſhall degrade or depoſe any man from any civil dignity, office or authority, he ſhall have in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts law-book, printed 1672, p. 44.</note>." How much more equitable was this, than another law in Connecticut? which ſaid, "Whatſoever perſons ſhall on the Lord's day, under any pretence whatſoever, aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together in any of the public meeting-houſes, provided in any town, pariſh or ſociety, for the public worſhip of God, without leave or allowance of the miniſter and congregation for whoſe uſe it was provided, and be thereof convict, every ſuch perſon ſhall incur the penalty of Ten Shillings for every ſuch offence. Nor ſhall any perſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the public worſhip of God in ſome lawful congregation, and form themſelves into ſeparate companies in private houſes, on penalty of Ten Shillings for every ſuch offence." This part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſeparate meetings cauſed ſore exerciſes
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018336_0057_0FA5D3B70DD9F5A0"/>to many ſerious minds, and great difficulties in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing civil offiers; yet it was never repealed until October, 1770. But not long after Norwich mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had cenſured their repreſentatives, he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to refer the matter to a Council; and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, with Council after Council, for about ſix years. Governor Saltonſtall came there himſelf upon one of thoſe occaſions; and Mr. Stoddard of Northampton was moderator of the laſt but one of thoſe Councils. My grandfather went a journey as far as Boſton and Ipſwich, an hundred and thirty miles, to conſult with Mr. Wiſe and the two Mather's upon theſe affairs.

And it was known, that when the church was conſtituted at Saybrook in 1660, with the approbation of other miniſters, Mr. James Fitch was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by the laying on of the hands only of their two deacons, as a token that the power of ordination is in the church as a body. They came and planted Norwich the ſame year; and Mr. Fitch was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued one of the moſt uſeful miniſters in Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut for near fifty years. The church in Eaſt-Windſor, under the care of Mr. Timothy Edwards, father of Mr. Jonathan, alſo refuſed to receive the Saybrook platform. And the temper of thoſe who introduced it farther appears by the incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting act of the town of Killingly, paſſed in May, 1708; which ſays, "No perſon now inhabiting on ſaid lands, or any other perſons dwelling without this Colony, who have purchaſed any lands within the ſaid townſhip, that ſhall not give due obedience to all the laws of this Colony for the upholding the worſhip of God, and paying all public charges,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018336_0058_0FA5D3B72EB4F478"/>ſhall have any benefit by this act." At the ſame time they gave their Governor two hundred acres of land therein. This account is carefully taken from their public records and laws, and other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic vouchers.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. A FEW things concerning baptiſm ſhall cloſe this chapter. An aged and honorable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman near Piſcataqua river informed me, that about the year 1710, a number of people in Dover<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hanſard Knollys was miniſter there, from the ſpring of 1638 to the fall of 1641, vol. 1, p. 101.</note> were ſo fully perſuaded that they ought, in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe, to be buried in baptiſm, that on a Lord's day, and the day after, Mr. Pike, their miniſter, baptized nine perſons in that way, in a branch of that river. But ſuch a noiſe was made, and oppoſition raiſed againſt it, as prevented any further proceedings therein. About the ſame time a Baptiſt meeting was ſet up at Scituate, in the county of Plymouth, where Preſident Dunſter ſpent his latter days to good purpoſe (vol. 1, p. 320.) Mr. John Peirce preached to them for ſome time, until he and others removed to Swanzey, in or about 1711, and on October 19, 1715, he was ordained a paſtor of the ſecond church there, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with Elder Joſeph Maſon, who was ordained in July, 1709. And they continued in good eſteem in their offices, until Elder Maſon died, May 19, 1748, and Elder Peirce September 8, 1750, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of them near 90 years old. On March 16, 1714, Dr. Cotton Mather wrote the letter to the Baptiſt church in Boſton, which is in vol. 1, p. 522; ſubſcribed thus, viz. "To my worthy friend, Mr. Ellis Callender, elder of a church of Chriſt in Boſton." He joined to it in 1669; was a leading member of it when the Court nailed up
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018336_0059_0FA5D3B7E9C3BA08"/>their meeting-houſe in 1680; and he was continued a great bleſſing to them until he died in a good old age, after the year 1726.</p>

A like application was afterwards made by the hand of Ebenezer Slocum, who reported to a meeting in 1709, that the Governor appeared kind and friendly; but as no relief was granted, they then ſent to England upon thoſe matters.

V. PRESIDENT Mather publiſhed another piece in 1716, wherein he ſays, "For miniſters to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a negative voice in Synods, or for Councils to take upon them to determine what elders or meſſengers a church ſhall ſubmit unto, without the choice of the church concerned, or for miniſters to pretend to be members of a Council without any miſſion from their churches, nay, although the church declares that they will not ſend them, is <hi>prelatical,</hi> and eſſentially differing not only from Congregational, but from Preſbyterian principles. And now that I am going out of the world, I could not die in peace, if I did not diſcharge my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in bearing witneſs againſt ſuch innovations and invaſions on the rights and privileges belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to particular congregations of Chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſquiſition concerning Eccl. Councils, preface, p. 13.</note>." Yet all theſe innovations and invaſions were made in the Saybrook ſcheme. And to ſhew that brethren, when choſen by the church, have a right to equal votes in Councils with elders, he ſays, "There are mechanics, who although they do not excel in that which is called <hi>human learning,</hi> are well verſed and learned in the ſcriptures, ſpending much time in conſulting thoſe oracles of God, and being men of great piety, and excellent natural accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they may be very uſeful in Synods."</p>
               <p>ECCLESIASTICAL hiſtorians give a remarkable account of what happened in the Nicene Synod. "A pious old man, who was no clergyman, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed philoſophical notions, by his plain diſcourſe did more towards the conviction of an heretical phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, than all the learned biſhops in the Council could do<note n="†" place="bottom">Diſquiſition, p. 19.</note>."</p>

VI. THESE things naturally led him and his brethren into another ſort of behaviour towards the Baptiſts, than when he was ſcribe of the Synod of 1679, who declared that they were ſetting up their poſts by God's poſts; which moved the Court to nail up the doors of the Baptiſt meeting-houſe. For Elder Callender's ſon Eliſha was added to the church under his care, on Auguſt 10, 1713; after which he was educated at Harvard college, and called into the goſpel miniſtry; and as Preſident Mather had expreſſed his willingneſs for ſuch a thing to Elder Callender, his church called the Preſident, his ſon, and Mr. John Webb, to aſſiſt in ordaining Mr. Eliſha Callender, as paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Boſton, May 21, 1718. And Dr. Cotton Mather, in the ordination ſermon, ſaid, "It is very ſadly true, that many eccleſiaſtical communities, wherein piety has its votaries, yet are guilty of this evil, that they impoſe terms of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which many that have the fear of God are by juſt exceptions kept from complying withal. Now in this unhappy caſe what is to be done? do this, let good men go as far as they can without ſin in holding communion with one another. But where ſinful terms are impoſed, there let them make their ſtops; there a ſeparation becomes a duty; there the injunction of heaven upon them is, <hi>be ye ſeparate ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> The <hi>impoſers</hi> are the <hi>ſchiſmatics.</hi> There have been many attempts to unite people in forms and terms, that are not the pure maxims of living unto God; and ſo to build the tower of Zion on a foundation which is not the <hi>tried ſtone and the precious,</hi> and ſo not the <hi>ſure foundation.</hi> There has hitherto been a blaſt from heaven upon all theſe attempts; they have miſcarried, as being rather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018336_0066_0FA5D3BEB2D62CE8"/>for the tower of Babel. New-England alſo has in ſome former times done ſomething of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, which would not now be ſo well approved of; in which, if the <hi>brethren, in whoſe houſe</hi> we are now convened, met with any thing too <hi>unbrotherly,</hi> they now with ſatisfaction hear us expreſſing our diſlike of every thing that looked like <hi>perſecution</hi> in the days that have paſſed over us." (See vol. 1, p. 523—525.)</p>
               <p n="7">VII. THE caſe of a member, who ſoon after joined to that church, I think proper here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Samuel Jennings, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was born in Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, in the county of Barnſtable, February 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1685, where he lived till he was above 18 years old, and then went a voyage to ſea, where he was preſſed on board a man of war. But meeting with very ill treatment there for five months, he in the evening of March 26, 1704, the ſhip being in a bay at Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados, attempted to make his eſcape therefrom by ſwimming; but by the way he was ſeized and halled under water by a ſhark; a terrible caſe indeed! yet as he cried to God for help, the venomous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture let him go, and his life was preſerved, with the loſs only of part of a foot and an arm. He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, married, and lived in good repute in his native town, which he repreſented ſeveral times in our Legiſlature. after he had ſerved them two years in that office, he wrote as follows concerning his ſoul affairs. Says he, "Though I had heard much preaching, and read many books, to ſupport the baptizing of infants, and had never read any books, or diſcourſed on that head with any that were againſt it, yet I found ſo much in the ſcripture to the contrary, that I could not believe it to be right. Notwithſtanding I went to ſeveral miniſters, and diſcourſed them on that point to get light, and alſo prayed to God to direct me in the right way; yet
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018336_0067_0FA5D3BF5B1D6030"/>ſtill it appeared to me unſcriptural and erroneous. Then I went to Mr. Callender, the Baptiſt miniſter at Boſton, who not only diſcourſed with me, but lent me books ſet out by thoſe of his perſuaſion, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the truth thereof; which when I had read, I found ſo agreeable with the ſcriptures, and with the apprehenſions I before had from them, that I quickly fought to be admitted into the communion of that church at Boſton. And having made a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal profeſſion, before the church and congregation, I was baptized (that is dipped in the water) by Mr. Eliſha Callender, miniſter of the goſpel, on the 9th day of June, 1718, in the 34th year of my age. And truly I may ſay, as is ſaid of the Ethiopian eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, that I came away rejoicing. In a ſhort time after I arrived to a conſiderable degree of bodily health, which I had lacked for eight years before." He ſerved his town afterwards as their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and in other offices; and, without his ſeeking, a commiſſion of Juſtice of the Peace was ſent him, which, for ſome reaſons, he choſe not to accept. He continued a member of ſaid church in Boſton till his death in 1764.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. SOON after Mr. Callender was ordained, he opened a correſpondence with friends in London, which, with other means, had very great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive effects. Thomas Hollis, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the moſt liberal men upon earth, had ſome acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Preſident Mather, when he was agent for this Province in England<note n="*" place="bottom">I. Mather's life, p. 170.</note>, and now receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounts of the tranfactions and catholic ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents that were delivered at the ordination of a Baptiſt miniſter in Boſton, who was educated at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard college, he became the greateſt benefactor thereto that they have ever had to this day.</p>

                     <p>I THANK you kindly, for the particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you gave me in your laſt; and I cannot but lament the ſad conſequences of ſin, and the great degrees of it which remain, even in God's own people; for ſurely the greateſt part, if not all thoſe who ſuffered ſo much for their religion at home, and at laſt left their native country, and run ſuch great hazards as they did, for the ſake of their conſciences, muſt, in the judgment of charity, be eſteemed the faithful ſervants of Chriſt. But when I conſider the methods which theſe who differed from them in matters not fundamental, I cannot but wonder at the depth of folly which remains with us, that any body of men ſhould ſo ſoon and ſo zealouſly purſue thoſe very methods which they had ſo juſtly condemned, and ſo greatly ſuffered by! It is a conſideration enough to check the reaſonableneſs of the apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal advice, let him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall; for I think we are but too ſubject to the leſſer degrees of this temper and carriage, in almoſt every ſtation of life. For though there is ſo
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018336_0069_0FA5D3C1A644FF40"/>good an underſtanding among the three denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of diſſenters, viz. Preſbyterians, Independents and Baptiſts; yet we have too many who are whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers and backbiters, who by magnifying the weakneſſes, or diminiſhing the real worth and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thoſe who differ from them, ſhew that this ſpirit, as much as it is deſtroyed, is yet too much alive, and, were it cloathed with power, would ſoon be formidable. But our wiſe and gracious GOVERNOR makes the weakneſſes and wrath of men to praiſe him, and the remainder thereof he doth raſtrain.</p>
                     <p>As I heartily rejoice that the Lord hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the baptized church, at Boſton, through ſo many difficulties, ſo I am glad he hath raiſed up to them one ſo able and willing to promote the public good among them.

I am indeed troubled at the paucity<note n="*" place="bottom">Fewneſs in number.</note> of thoſe of our denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in New-England; though I cannot wonder at it, conſidering the treatment they have generally met with. I am grieved that any who profeſs the plain ſcripture baptiſm ſhould bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by holding with it ſuch wild and antiſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral opinions; but ſo it hath been with us, and yet remains; though I thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the number of ſuch is diminiſned, within a few years laſt paſt. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have but few ſoul-ſleepers or Sabbatari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c. yet the number of thoſe that plead for general redemption, and ſome other of the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive notions of Arminius, ſeem to increaſe among us: However, they ſeem not quite ſo rigid and uncharitable as formerly, and there is, I hope, the greateſt number of our denomination free from
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018336_0070_0FA5D3C263D1A1C8"/>theſe things. As to the method of educating youth among you, it muſt be allowed, that the deſign ſeemed to be well laid for promoting uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and I hope your college will be improved to a very great advantage; but I find you have to lament, what we are not ſtrangers to, viz. that thoſe things which in themſelves are good, and tend to fit perſons for more extenſive uſefulneſs, are made neceſſary for a perſon in order to the miniſtry, or ſhould be thought, at any time, to be a ſufficient qualification for ſo great a work. Surely a man bleſſed with a good natural genius, who has been brought to a true ſenſe of ſin, and the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt, though he ſhould want the advantage of human literature, muſt be better ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable than one that has it, and is deſtitute of the other, to guide ſouls into the ways of ſalvation; becauſe as he knows ſomething of the deceitfulneſs of ſin, and the wiles of Satan, ſo he is more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comfort poor ſouls in diſtreſs, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts wherewith he himſelf has been comforted of God. Therefore, though I have a high eſteem for human learning, and wiſh every miniſter had the advantage of a good degree of it, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is far from being neceſſary to a man's being employed in the public miniſtry, and much leſs do I think it in itſelf a qualification ſufficient for ſo weighty an undertaking. You will excuſe me for ſo freely declaring my mind upon this head.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE this comes to hand, I hope you will have received a letter, ſubſcribed Thomas Hollis. This worthy gentleman is my very good friend, and one who, with his plentiful eſtate, has done much good among poor miniſters and churches here; and I hope New-England will find yet more happy effects of his liberality, and that, with your kind aſſiſtance
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018336_0071_0FA5D3C320725DB0"/>in finding and procuring proper objects, ſomething may be done by him for the particular encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our denomination. For, in converſing with him upon this head, he deſired me to intimate to you, that he ſhall be well pleaſed, if you can find a proper perſon of the Baptiſt perſuaſion, for him to recommend to the governors of the college; and I doubt not but he will give ſome further encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſuch an one, who is deſirous to be qualified for public uſefulneſs. I intreat you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to turn your thoughts to this ſubject, and give me a line, ſo ſoon as you have found a fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo good a work as this may be began. I am ready to believe, that, beſides Mr. Hollis's intereſt with the governors, in behalf of a hopeful young man, who is of our perſuaſion, he may be prevailed upon to allow Ten Pounds per annum, of your money<note n="*" place="bottom">Mexico ſilver was then about Thirteen Shillings per ounce, in our money. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> vol. 1, p. 494.</note>, towards defraying the charges of the college; which will be ſome encouragement for one, who, with promiſing natural parts, is deſirous to devote himſelf to ſtudy, in order to fit himſelf for public uſefulneſs, but is not well able to go through the charge. I leave this with you, and pray God to direct you. You will find a copy of Mr. Hollis's to you; to which I have added a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the cheſt of books therein mentioned; and if any are not diſpoſed of to the college libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yourſelf, &amp;c. that then you would uſe your intereſt to obtain ſome of them for Mr. Daniel White<note n="†" place="bottom">Who came over from Mr. Wallin's church two years before, and was then preaching at Newport. Mr. Neal's hiſtory firſt came over this year.</note>. When you have read Mr. Neal's hiſtory of New-England, I deſire you to give me your
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018336_0072_0FA5D3C3D45BD290"/>thoughts of it in general; and if you find any thing in it which deſerves to be taken notice of, in order to be altered in a ſecond edition, pray freely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to me, and I will do the ſame to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is a very honeſt gentleman, and will be glad to be ſet right, in any thing wherein he may have been miſtaken.

If you have heard any thing of any late diſcoveries made of ſilver mines with you, or any thing of the character of the man, or what notion the people have of it, and will pleaſe to give me a line, it may be of uſe to me; for as I would willingly ſerve any honeſt man, according to my ability, ſo I would gladly know the perſons I move for. I am now obliged to conclude at preſent, and with all my heart commend you to God and the word of his grace, which is able and I hope will build you up in all things.

                     <p>"I received the honor of the church's and your letter together, by Capt. Lawrence. After I had a little conſidered the contents of both, I waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our honored friend, Mr. Thomas Hollis, with the caſe, with whom I left it; and ſome little time after he told me, that himſelf and brother, Mr. John Hollis, would advance ſome money to repair your meeting-houſe, upon condition I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with my brethren, concerned in our little fund, to make a preſent to Mr. Callender, as a token of our Chriſtian reſpects to him. The motion pleaſed me well: I willingly undertook my part, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily accompliſhed it, though it were out of the common way of our exhibitions; and by the time this comes to hand I hope you will find remitted
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018336_0074_0FA5D3C564B172A8"/>by Mr. Hollis what I hope will fully anſwer the church's requeſt, together with a ſmall preſent, which I hope will not be unacceptable, to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Callender himſelf, and ſhew at leaſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the good of the baptized intereſt in Boſton, though we may not be capable to promote it in that meaſure we heartily deſire.</p>
                     <p>CONCERNING the ſtate of the Arian controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy with us, and our miniſter's concern therein, I ſhall briefly relate the whole as follows. Some few years ago one Dr. Clark, of the eſtabliſhed church, a gentleman of deſerved reputation, wrote a book, intituled, <hi>The ſcripture doctrine of the Trinity;</hi> in which he endeavours (after very high expreſſions of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Redeemer's perſon and nature) to deny him to be a neceſſary ſelf-exiſtent being; which is conſtrued by his adverſaries as a conſequential de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his proper divinity, and a degrading our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour into a ſubordinate God, notwithſtanding all he hath offered in honor to this hope of a true Chriſtian. This made a great ſtir, and ſet many pens to work; ſome for and ſome againſt the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's notions, among ſeveral of note in the church of England, and others; ſome of whom I think carried the point much further than the Doctor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have deſigned. I wiſh the conteſt had always continued in the eſtabliſhed church; but a little time carried it among the diſſenters, and one Mr. Peirce, a Preſbyterian miniſter, of ingenuity and conſiderable note, among others, eſpouſed Dr. Clark's notions openly (if he went no further.) The debates, pro and con, began to be managed with warmth, not only in the city, but in divers parts of the country. But Mr. Peirce being a man of ſo much note, and a miniſter in the city of Exeter, where the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian intereſt is in much credit, he was the firſt

His people (after ſome conſiderable time, and ſeveral methods uſed to accommodate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) propoſed parting with him, as a man not ſound in the faith. This occaſioned each party to adviſe with their friends in the miniſtry, and others, what to do in the caſe. Some of the perſons wrote to upon this account (which were not a few) thought that Mr. Peirce had given too much cauſe for his people to believe that he had departed from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox faith, in relation to the doctrine of the Trinity. Others, though they did not deny this, yet apprehended his people had not dealt ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him in this matter as they ought to have done, by a man of his character and uſefulneſs.</p>
                     <p>THE caſe was ſome time before a committee of miniſters and gentlemen of the three denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in London, to ſee if they could find a way to accommodate matters at Exeter, and prevent divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the ſame account in other places; but they were not all of one mind. Then the whole body of miniſters in and about London was called together, and a paper of advices propoſed to be conſidered of in order to ſign, for accommodating matters at Exeter. Some of the miniſters, who were zealouſly concerned for the doctrine of the Trinity, at the ſame time propoſed, that a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith, with reſpect to that important doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Chriſtian religion, ſhould be ſigned, and ſent down with the advices; but, upon a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the miniſters, it was rejected by a majority of about five perſons. It was then agreed at the next meeting to conſider the paper of advices, paragraph by paragraph; at which meeting were about one hundred and thirty miniſters of the three denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who placed your poor friend in the chair.

Warm debates there were indeed for two or three hours, when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thoſe brethren who reſolved to ſubſcribe thoſe articles withdrew into the gallery; which, however juſt their zeal might be for the truth contended for, was not looked upon as a ſufficient reaſon for the breaking up the meeting at that time. So, after ſome meſſages ſent from the one part to the other, thoſe above proceeded to ſubſcribe thoſe articles, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their ſentiments of the doctrine of the ever-bleſſed Trinity; and the other proceeded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the paper of advices, and drew up a general article of their faith as to that doctrine, which was ſigned by their moderator by appointment. This they ſent to Exeter; while the others drew up another ſet of advices, and ſent down with the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they had ſubſcribed, and henceforward we came under the diſtinguiſhing characters of ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and non-ſubſcribers, which diſtinction I fear will be too long remembered by us, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of true religion.</p>
                     <p>SOME of the too warm among the non-ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers would fain fix the odious charge of <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on the other, while they again, with full as much warmth, would fix the charge of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> upon them. But this ſeverity is not allowed, by the greateſt part of either ſide of the queſtion; and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018336_0077_0FA5D3CBC2F73B48"/>I hope time will produce a better temper in both parties; but at preſent the matter is not accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, nor ſo good a harmony among the miniſters as could be heartily wiſhed. As I am ſatisfied that ſome among the non-ſubſcribers are gone too far into ſome of the diſtinctive notions of Arius, ſo I think ſome of the ſubſcribers have given too much ground of jealouſy, that they intended to ſet up thoſe forms as a teſt of arthodoxy, and the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them as neceſſary to perſons being accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſeful in the miniſtry. But I dare ſay, for the much greater part of both ſides, that they intended no evil to their differing brethren; and that it was a zeal for the doctrine of the Trinity, and the real divinity of our Saviour, which made ſome ſubſcribe the articles, and not any deſire to impoſe upon others; and that thoſe who refuſed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, did it with a deſign to maintain Chriſtian liberty, rather than any deſign to encourage or promote Arianiſm. There is no great difference in the number of either ſide; but I think there are not ſo many of our denomination among the non-ſubſcribers as are on the other ſide; and though I cannot ſay that there are none of our miniſters who too much favour the new ſcheme, yet I may venture to ſay in general, that our miniſters, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the particular denomination<note n="*" place="bottom">i. e. holding to particular election.</note>, are ſound in the faith, as to the real divinity of Chriſt, and the true doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity. Therefore thoſe who upbraid you with their being contrary, act either from prejudice or miſinforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ſuch have been the viſible conſequences of this difference, that brotherly love and charity, that indiſpenſable ornament of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have been greatly loſt in the debates. May
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018336_0078_0FA5D3CC17A82ED0"/>the Lord encreaſe light and love, as well as zeal and faithfulneſs, among all the diſciples of our bleſſed Redeemer. So I muſt have done. The Lord be with you and yours.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. MR. James Peirce, above referred to, was ejected from his church, in March, 1719; but a party followed him, and built another meeting-houſe for him, in the city of Exeter; to encourage whom, he declared his expectation, that by what they ſuffered, "The ſpirit of impoſition and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution would be rendered more odious." And he accuſed that church of attempting to ſet up an INQUISITION, only becauſe they brought on ſuch a trial as conſtrained him to own his new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which cauſed his removal from a profitable living<note n="*" place="bottom">His works, printed 1728, p. 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Benjamin Wallin, ſon and ſucceſſor in office to Mr. Edward, publiſhed an excellent little volume upon the SONSHIP OF CHRIST in 1771, wherein he informs us, that ever ſince the above mentioned time, creeds and catechiſms have been cried down, and a regular Chriſtian educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much neglected, under a pretence of reaſon and liberty. And America has been much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſame diſtemper. But it is not all traditions and human creeds that ſuch men reject, as the following extract from Peirce plainly ſhews. Under an appearance of a great regard to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he publiſhed a catechiſm, wherein the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were in ſcripture words; part of which ſay, "Q. How many Gods are there? A. There is one God. Q. Who is this God? A. Though there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in earth (as there be Gods many and Lords many) yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018336_0079_0FA5D3CCDBF91260"/>are all things, and we <hi>for</hi> him. One God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, 1 Cor. viii. 5, 6, Eph. iv. 6." Which creed is ſo far from delivering any from the tyranny of human inventions, that where the ſcripture puts no more than a ſemicolon between the mention of the Father and the Son, Peirce puts a period, and three pages in his book. And when he comes to ſpeak of the Son, he picks out words that ſpeak of his ſubjection and obedience to the Father; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thoſe which aſſert his equality with him, which are many<note n="*" place="bottom">Peirce's works, p. 352, 418—422.</note>. Whereas, if we leave out the ſucceſſion of time, and the mode or manner wherein earthly relations commence, which have no place in the Deity, it is eaſy to conceive of a Father and Son of equal capacity and excellency; with ſuch an oneneſs in nature, and peculiarity of relation, as no others have: And alſo that one may, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary contract, ſubject himſelf to another for wiſe purpoſes, and take upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> and yet remain perfectly equal in nature. How unreaſonable then are thoſe great pretenders to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who profeſs to take the ſcriptures as their rule, and yet reject all thoſe truths therein, which croſs their darling notions! Thoſe who are convinced of the infinite evil of ſin, ſee the neceſſity of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merit to remove their guilt, and infinite power to change their hearts and lives, and to guide them to glory. We are told, that by openly owning theſe doctrines, Mr. Hollis gave a check to ſome, who had no great opinion of them<note n="†" place="bottom">Rudd's poem, p. 23.</note>.</p>

And as by charter the miniſters of Boſton for the time being were conſtituted a part of the overſeers of the college, Mr. Hollis moved that Mr. Callender might have a ſeat among them. And in a letter to Mr. Callender of February 8, 1721-2, Mr. Wallen ſaid, "I congratulate my friend upon his admitment to the honor of an overſeer of the college. I pray God that truth and Chriſtian love may more and more abound." But we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the late Mr. Condy, that Dr. Sewal, at the head of other miniſters, poſitively denied him a ſeat there. Yet how often have ſuch men accuſed the Baptiſts of being much more rigid than themſelves? and there was not a word in their charter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him.</p>

Windham had ſo large a ſhare of it, under the miniſtry of Mr. Samuel Whiting, as to add eighty communicants to their church this year; for which they kept a ſpecial day of thankſgiving to God. One curious event then happened there which I ſhall mention. The word preached was ſuch a looking-glaſs to one man, that he ſeriouſly went to Mr. Whiting, and told him he was very ſorry that ſo good a miniſter as he was
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018336_0081_0FA5D3CE8654C9E0"/>ſhould ſo groſsly tranſgreſs the divine rule, as to tell him his faults before all the congregation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of coming to labour with him in private. The miniſter ſmiled, and ſaid he was glad that truth had found him out, for he had no particular thought of him in his ſermon. Norwich, ten miles from thence, enjoyed a conſiderable meaſure of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame year, from whence my pious mother dated her converſion. Many young people in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton were turned to a ſerious regard for religion alſo in 1721. The ſmall-pox coming there in April, and prevailing moſt terribly through the year, had a deep effect upon many ſouls. It was thought that not more than a quarter of the inhabitants had paſſed through that diſtemper before, and none of them who were under 18 years<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſtory, vol. 1, p. 130. vol. 2, p. 375.</note>.

Having a great inclination for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he, by Preſident Mather's influence, was taken from an apprenticeſhip to a trade, and put to ſchool, in December, 1720. Serious turns of concern about his ſoul had been frequent with him for ſeveral years; which greatly increaſed for ſeventeen days after he had taken that infection. "Nothing, ſays he, but the ghoſtly countenance of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for was before me, and no ſight of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled God, nor any ſenſe of the application of the ſoul-cleanſing blood of Chriſt to my diſtreſſed ſoul: I remained in extreme terror until Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 22. All the interval of time I ſpent in looking over the affairs of my ſoul; and on that day I was taken ſick. As ſoon as it was told me that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper appeared, all my fears entirely vaniſhed, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018336_0082_0FA5D3CF146279B0"/>a beam of comfort darted into my ſoul, and with it ſatisfaction from theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord.</hi> Yea, ſo great was my ſatisfaction, that immediately I repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to my aunt who informed me, then I know I ſhall not die now; but gave no reaſon why I ſaid ſo."

Ephraim Crafts, one of his young brethren, was baptized and added to that church in Boſton, January 27, 1723, John Dabney, from London, had been received by them December 4, 1720, and Richard Bevens, from Wales, the next Auguſt, who were members of Baptiſt churches before they came here.

               <p n="1">I. EQUAL religious liberty, by virtue of a ſpecial act, was enjoyed in Boſton; but was ſo much denied in the country, that moſt of the Baptiſts had no heart to ſend their ſons to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard college; though a few of them did ſo, whereby they made ſome uſe of Mr. Hollis's donations there. Great pains were taken to compel every town to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſupport ſuch miniſters as the Court called orthodox. A law was alſo made at Boſton, in the May ſeſſion of 1718, to tax all to the building and repairing of pariſh meeting-houſes. In 1717 the pious and judicious Elder Luther fell aſleep, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the care of the firſt church in Swanzey to Elder Ephraim Wheaton, who had been a colleague with
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018336_0084_0FA5D3D482129FD8"/>him about thirteen years. The ſecond church in Swanzey had then two ordained paſtors; yet in April, 1719, their Select-Men were convented before Briſtol Court, "For not having a miniſter according to the law of the Province." But upon proving that Elder Wheaton was their lawful miniſter, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. "Paying coſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Briſtol Court records.</note>." His meeting-houſe ſtood near the borders of Rehoboth; and he and many of his people who lived therein were taxed to Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt miniſters of that town, of which we ſhall hear more preſently.</p>
               <p n="2">II. FREETOWN, which lies on the eaſt ſide of the great river againſt Swanzey, met with worſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than they did. For on September 9, 1717, they made choice of Thomas Craghead, a miniſter from Ireland, for their paſtor; and he accepted of their call: But inſtead of an amicable agreement with them about his ſupport, he went in January, 1718, and procured an act of Briſtol Court, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Freetown to pay him a ſalary of Sixty-five Pounds a year, to begin from the day he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their miniſter. And for refuſing to pay it, about fourteen of the inhabitants were ſeized and impriſoned at Briſtol; one of whom was Benjamin Chaſe, a member of a Baptiſt church in Newport. In April, 1719, each party carried witneſſes about theſe matters to Briſtol Court; but the Court diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed them all, and required the town to obey their former order. In 1720 Thomas Gage and George Winſlow, their Select-Men, were fined Forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a piece for not aſſeſſing Craghead's ſalary. At laſt he was defeated in a trial at law, and was forced to quit the town; but theſe broils produced great and laſting evils therein. Little-Compton had ſettled a legal miniſter; and as Elder Tabor
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018336_0085_0FA5D3D614071340"/>owned ſome land in that town, he was taxed to him; for which a riding-ſaddle was taken from Tabor, as a perſon informed me who ſaw it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. TIVERTON and Dartmouth were the only remaining towns in the Province which had not yielded to the ruling party about worſhip. When orders for that purpoſe had come from their Courts, they had reported, that Joſeph Wanton was the miniſter of Tiverton, and Elder Tabor the miniſter of the weſt part of Dartmouth, and another man for the eaſt part. But as the Court did not eſteem them to be orthodox, a complaint againſt thoſe towns was preſented to their Legiſlature in 1722; who annexed ſuch ſums as they thought proper for the purpoſe to their Province tax. This being heard of, their Select-Men refuſed to aſſeſs it; for which two of them out of each town were ſeized on May 25, 1723, and were impriſoned at Briſtol. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Thomas Richardſon, who married friend Wanton's daughter, was ſent over to London; and with Richard Partridge, Agent for Rhode-Iſland Colony, preſented a memorial to the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; wherein they obſerved, that our charter allows equal liberty of conſcience to all Chriſtians except Papiſts; and that neither the charter nor any law had eſtabliſhed any teſt of orthodoxy in this Province, only as Preſbyterians and Independents had ſet up their major votes as ſuch; whereby diſſenters from them were frequently brought under great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; from which no redreſs could be obtained here, "The Aſſembly always oppoſing whatever the Governor and Council were at any time diſpoſed to do on that behalf." And as the King, at his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the throne, promiſed protection and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience to all his diſſenting ſubjects without exception, they prayed that he would denounce his
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018336_0086_0FA5D3D69521BAA0"/>negative upon thoſe laws or parts of laws among us, that interfered therewith, and alſo order thoſe priſoners to be releaſed.

And his Majeſty is hereby further pleaſed to order, that the ſaid Joſeph Anthony, John Siſſon, John Akin, and Philip Tabor, be immediately releaſed from their impriſonment on account thereof. And the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief for the time being, of his Majeſty's ſaid Province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and all others whom it may concern, are to take notice, and yield due obedience hereunto.</p>

               <p>BEFORE this, I find Mr. Wallin, in one of his letters, ſaying of King George the Firſt, "With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any partiality to him as our reigning Prince, I believe he is the greateſt man, and the moſt fit for government, of any Prince in the Chriſtian world." And his ſon and ſucceſſor, then Prince of Wales, was not inferior to him. By the above act our friends were releaſed from a thirteen months impriſonment. And as Jacob Tabor and Beriah Goddard, of Dartmouth, were impriſoned for not aſſeſſing ſaid tax of 1723, Henry Howland, their other aſſeſſor, laid their caſe before the Aſſembly at Boſton, who on November 26, 1724, paſſed an act to releaſe them, "To ſignify their ready and dutiful compliance with his Majeſty's declared will and pleaſure." Anthony and Siſſon were of Tiverton, the reſt were of Dartmouth, and Philip Tabor was a Baptiſt miniſter therein; Theſe things
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:018336_0089_0FA5D3D8DD3FABC0"/>were far from affording any ſatisfaction to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial party here, as the following facts will ſhew.

               <p>ON June 3 the Council voted to grant their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the Repreſentatives voted to defer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till their next ſeſſion, which the Council concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, and Lieutenant-Governor Dummer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereto. June 11th, a committee of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court, whereof Samuel Sewal, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, appointed upon the affair of miniſters ſalaries, brought in a report, to have a law made to compel every pariſh to make up to their miniſters their ſeveral ſalaries, equal to what they were when their contracts were made; and for the Judges of their county Courts to determine how much their currency had depreciated.

Epiſcopalians ſent an account to the Biſhop of London of the ſaid petition for a Synod, who laid the ſame before the Lords Juſtices of the Regency; from whom a ſharp reprimand was wrote to Mr. Dummer, October 7, 1725, for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any countenance to ſaid petition, and for not ſending over an account thereof immediately after it was preſented and acted upon.

               <p>MR. Dummer, in a letter to the Board of Trade, endeavoured to excuſe himſelf, by obſerving, that a like vote of the Council upon a like petition was paſſed in 1715, which was never cenſured from home as he knew of<note n="*" place="bottom">Douglaſs, vol. 2, p. 337, 378.</note>. But then it was not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the other branches of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as this was. The miniſter who, in behalf of the reſt, ſigned the above petition for a Synod, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a book in 1726, wherein he promiſes a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account of the diſcipline of the New-England churches. Much of it was written many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and an atteſtation was prefixed to it by Dr. Increaſe Mather, dated December 10, 1719. After ſixty-ſix years labour in the great work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry he fell aſleep, Auguſt 23, 1723, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018336_0092_0FA5D3DD7545F850"/>being removed, their children renewed their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for that power. His ſon had a ſtrong affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the propoſals of 1705, and for Gov. Salton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, who procured the eſtabliſhment of that ſcheme in Connecticut; even ſo that when Saltonſtall died in 1724, Mather preached a funeral ſermon for him at Boſton, an hundred miles off, and got it printed at New-London. He alſo now diſcovered his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Mr. Wiſe, for writing againſt ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals<note n="*" place="bottom">Ratio diſciplinae fratrum Nov. Anglorum, p. 184.</note>. And having declared that four Synods had been called by authority in the Maſſachuſetts, he ſays, "The Synods of New-England know no weapons, but what are <hi>purely ſpiritual.</hi> They have no ſecular arm to enforce any canons; they aſk none, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey want none.

Had this been true, we have no reaſon to think that their meetings would have been forbidden. But plain facts ſhew, that the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effect of the firſt of thoſe Synods was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of a Houſe of Repreſentatives (who would not puniſh ſuch as the Synod had condemned) and the calling of another; who disfranchiſed, diſarmed and baniſhed a conſiderable number of perſons. And their ſecond Synod declared it to be the duty of the magiſtrate to put forth his <hi>coerſive power againſt ſchiſmatics;</hi> the effects whereof were the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, impriſoning, ſcourging, baniſhing and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe they ſo called: And the reſult of the fourth Synod cauſed the nailing up of the Baptiſt meeting-houſe in Boſton (vol. 1. p. 83—86, 190, 218, 236, 329, 379, 387, 483:) And are all theſe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018336_0093_0FA5D3DEB626CB00"/>weapons <hi>purely ſpiritual!</hi> His meaning no doubt was, that their Synods only informed rulers of what was their duty, which they were to do out of regard to God, and not to them. But the moſt horrid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions that ever were practiſed were done under ſuch pretences. And this author was in earneſt to have their order of miniſters ſupported by taxes, impoſed and collected "In the King's name." To juſtify which he ſays, "If the moſt of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in a plantation are Epiſcopalians, they will have a miniſter of their own perſuaſion; and the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> if there be any in the place, muſt pay their proportion of the tax, for the ſupport of this <hi>legal miniſter</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 21.</note>." He knew that ſuch an inſtance had not then taken place in New-England; and we know that every thing of that nature has been ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly oppoſed therein ever ſince. And he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſome of his party, for involving a ſalary for their miniſters in a general rate for all town charges, "Where Quakeriſm was troubleſome<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 22.</note>;" which he might have ſaid was likewiſe done to the Baptiſts in Rehoboth, if he had been willing the whole truth ſhould be known.

                     <p>I HAVE newly received, under covert of Mr. Eliſha Callender, your long looked-for letter, dated the 25th of December, and give you thanks for the account you give me of the affairs of your church, your circumſtances, and your neighbours. I am glad the books ſent you are of uſe unto you; by the ſame hand you will have another forwarded, which I value, and ſuppoſe you will. I rejoice in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018336_0094_0FA5D3E037A03818"/>the ſucceſs of your miniſtry, and increaſe of your church, which will naturally increaſe your cares with your joy. I mourn becauſe of the ignorance of your ſleeping Sabbatarians: Let us be thankful for our light, pity them and pray for them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in love to lead them into the light alſo. God, that hath ſhined into our hearts by his goſpel, can lead them from the Sinai covenant and the law of ceremonies, into the light of the new covenant and the grace thereof. I pity to ſee profeſſors drawing back to the law, and deſire to remember that our ſtanding is by grace; and therefore not to be high-minded over them, but fear, remembering our Lord's words, <hi>watch and pray, leſt ye enter into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Every word of God is precious; the ſaints love it; and they that honor him he will honor; and in keeping of it there is preſent peace, and a promiſe of future reward: We now live by faith and not by ſight; he that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved. Go on, Sir, ſowing the ſeed, looking up to him whoſe work alone it is to give the increaſe, whoever be the planter or waterer; and as you do abound in your labours, and do find him multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeed unto you, may you yet abound more and more to the end, which is my ſincere wiſh. Let no man rob us of our comfortable hope, that when we ceaſe to be here we ſhall be preſent with the Lord, in whoſe preſence the ſaints believe is fulneſs of joy in a ſeparate ſtate, and expectation of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the reſurrection, when it ſhall be fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted how he loved them. Let none jeer us out of our duty now to liſp forth his praiſes with our tongues, ſince we expect hereafter to ſing in a better manner the ſong of the Lamb, with a much more noble chorus. In reference to your poll-tax and other taxes, which are neceſſary for ſupport of the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018336_0095_0FA5D3E05F74D370"/>government and ſociety, are not to be eſteemed a burthen; it is giving tribute or tithes to whom tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is due, unleſs the taxes do oppreſs you unequally, becauſe you are Baptiſts and Separatiſts; if ſo, then let me know (who profeſs myſelf a Baptiſt) and I will endeavour to have a word ſpoken for you to the Governor, that you may be eaſed. You know that our profeſſion is not mody in your country nor ours; few if any of the great men ſubmitting to plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and as we profeſs ourſelves diſciples of Chriſt, it is our duty to take up our croſs with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and pay parochial duties where we live, and voluntarily maintain our own charge, and be thankful for our liberty as men and Chriſtians to our good God, who in his providence has inſpired many magiſtrates and miniſters in your Province with a truer ſpirit of catholic charity than formerly. You have heard, or may be informed by Mr. Callender, of my foundation in Harvard college, and the proviſion I have made for Baptiſt youth to be educated for the miniſtry, and equally regarded with Pedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. If you know any as may be duly qualified, inform me, and I ſhall be glad to recommend them for the firſt vacancy. And to cloſe; while we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to worſhip God nearer to the rule of primitive inſtitution and practice of our great prophet and teacher, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles, let our light ſo ſhine before men in all holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſuch whoſe inclinations may be ready to ſpeak evil of our way may be aſhamed. May ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous religion and godlineſs in the power of it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh among us; every thing that goes in to make up the true Chriſtian. Where the image of Chriſt is formed in any, I call them the excellent of the earth; with ſuch I delight to aſſociate and worſhip, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever particular denomination they may go by among
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018336_0096_0FA5D3E118738D50"/>men; and this I would do till we all come into the unity of the faith, &amp;c. Acts xx. 32.</p>

I rejoice at the increaſe of your members, and the good proſpect you have of more being added to your church, even of ſuch who ſhall be ſaved. It is ſweet encouragement to a poor labourer in Chriſt's vineyard, to find the Lord works with him; and ſome viſible inſtances of ſovereign grace and love among his people make his drooping ſpirit revive and ſing. May you have more of theſe, eſpecially among the riſing generation; for it is a particular pleaſure to ſee young ones look Zionward, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember their Creator in the days of their youth; though in this caſe we have always reaſon to rejoice with trembling, becauſe ſo many who ſeemed to run well for a time, have been turned aſide by youthful luſts (which war againſt the ſoul) to the wounding the hearts of their miniſters, and the diſhonor of Chriſt. I am ſorry you have ſo much cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, with us, of the great decay of the power and purity of religion. I am afraid this inquiſitive age of profeſſors ſpend too much time, and almoſt all their zeal, about matters of ſpeculation, and neglect
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:018336_0097_0FA5D3E1DB054C20"/>the cloſet and inward experimental religion too much. I obſerve by ſome letters and papers, by Capt. Lawrence, that there is a number of young men formed into a ſociety at Boſton, who have taken upon them the name of the Barean Society. It is a noble deſign to be wholly governed by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wiſh every profeſſor had ſuch a reſolution. They ſeem to be in earneſt about what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and if any of their zeal, for any particular point in diſpute among Chriſtians, ſhould flame too high, I am glad they are under your conduct, by which I hope they will be directed for their mutual edification, and the honor of truth.

From the whole I apprehend Mr. Hollis was not diſpleaſed, but approved of what you had done, and hath been ſo good as to order the remaining part of the money for your own uſe; beſides which he hath been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend you a preſent of books. I have often, my dear friend, adored the divine goodneſs, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this gentleman's mind to ſo much ſervice for the intereſt of Chriſt in general, in New-England as well as Old; but eſpecially for the providence by which ſuch a gentleman came to the knowledge of our ſmall intereſt in thoſe Colonies, who had ſuch a love to deſpiſed truth, as to own and encourage it in the face of ſo many and powerful oppoſers. It is this good providence, I apprehend, hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſome perſons to look favourably towards the baptized intereſt in Boſton, and gives an encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing view of greater advantage in years to come.

The great earthquake was in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of October 29, 1727; and the Aſſembly that met the 22d of the next month paſſed the firſt act of exemption therefrom, that they ever did for any denomination. It was to impower every ſettled Epiſcopal miniſter to draw all the money which was aſſeſſed upon any of his ſociety, who lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five miles of his meeting, if they uſually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worſhip there; who were alſo to be exempted from taxes for building or repairing of meeting-houſes for the eſtabliſhed way. But it required each pariſh to make up to their miniſters, within two months, all the money that might by their means be taken from them. The five mile limitation was dropt afterwards; and by an act in 1742, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and church-wardens were required to give cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to each pariſh treaſurer, where any of their ſociety lived, in order for their drawing ſaid money.</p>
               <p>NOTHING is more amazing among men, than the influence which the love of power and gain has to blind their minds. The admiſſion of the houſes both of Orange and Hanover to the Britiſh throne,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018336_0101_0FA5D222D9F343C8"/>was upon the principle that government is founded in compact. And the moſt eſſential article of the national compact was, that none ſhould be taxed but by their own repreſentatives. Yet becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in this government refuſed to put it out of their power to give or withhold the ſalary demanded by the Crown, for Governors that they could have no choice in appointing or remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an attempt was made in England to bring the caſe before the Parliament, and to take away our ſecond charter. But Mr. Jeremiah Dummer, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Lieutenant-Governor, publiſhed in London ſuch a defence of our charter-rights in 1721, as, with other things, prevented it. Though in 1725 an explanatory charter was added, which deprived the repreſentatives of power to put their own Speaker into office, without the conſent of the Governor. Theſe things were juſtly complained of, by thoſe who daily practiſed a like iniquity themſelves. For it is not more certain that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is not repreſented in the Britiſh Parliament, than it is that a quantity of <hi>money</hi> does not give any men a right to judge for their neighbours about ſoul-guides, and to enforce their judgments with the ſword.

Hereupon they ſent a petition to Governor Burnet in Council; wherein they claimed charter rights, and mentioned the late declaration from England, that there was no national or provincial church eſtabliſhed here, and the releaſe of priſoners upon that footing; and that if relief was not granted to them, they ſoon expected the impriſonment of ſeveral Baptiſts and Quakers, of Taunton and Norton, on the ſame ſcore. The Governor and Council, on March 8, gave their opinion, that ſaid law did take place the preceding year; and ordered Seth Williams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Chief Judge of that county, to convene a number of

And it was not to exempt from any tax that was made, and then in collectors hands, nor to continue in force any longer than their May ſeſſion, 1733.</p>

AFTER the death of Governor Saltonſtall, the Connecticut Aſſembly of October 8, 1724, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Joſeph Talcott, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in his ſtead; under whoſe adminiſtration they enjoyed more liberty for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, than they had under his predeceſſor. Stephen Gorton was ordained, at New-London, paſtor of the ſecond Baptiſt church in Connecticut, November 28, 1726, by the aſſiſtance of their elders, Wightman of Groton, and Comer of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. And as Wightman was called to preach in Lyme, Mr. John Bulkly, a learned miniſter of Colcheſter, came and held a public diſpute with him at Lyme, June 7, 1727, upon baptiſm and miniſters ſupport. The queſtion concerning the latter point Wightman ſtated thus: "Whether miniſters of the goſpel ought to be maintained in the leaſt, by goods taken away by force from men of contrary perſuaſions?" And he gave theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt that practice: "1. Becauſe there is no precept nor precedent for ſo doing in the new
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018336_0105_0FA5D2260BFF22F0"/>teſtament. 2. Becauſe ſo to do is what we would not be done unto ourſelves. 3. Becauſe the Lord requires only volunteers, and not forced men in his ſervice." But Bulkly refuſed to diſpute upon this footing, and ſhifted the queſtion, to whether their way was lawful or not? And, after going far about, he ſaid, "Lawful authority have a right to determine the undetermined modes of moral duties." To which Wightman ſaid,
<list>
                     <item>"1. But they muſt always determine the mode in the order of morality, and ſo they may do to others, as they would they ſhould do to them in like caſe.

                     <item>2. This point I think is not undetermined in ſcripture, which ſhews us no other way for the ſupport of the goſpel miniſtry, but what is from the free-will offerings of the people."</item>
                  </list>
And as Bulkly raked together many ſcandalous things that had been publiſhed againſt the Baptiſts, and then ſaid, "They are but of yeſterday, and ſo conſequently the truth cannot be with them, as being not known in the world till about two hundred years paſt;" Wightman repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, "I never read of a Preſbyterian longer than the ſaid term; how then can the way of truth be with them? If you ſay, there were men of your principles many years before, I anſwer, that there were men profeſſing the doctrines maintained by us long before that time<note n="*" place="bottom">Bulkly, p. 132, 176.

               <p>HEREUPON the Aſſembly, who met at New-Haven, October 9, 1729, paſſed an act to allow the Baptiſts the ſame privileges as were granted to the Quakers the May before; both of them being perpetual laws, and not ſuch temporary acts as the Maſſachuſetts have perplexed themſelves and others with. Preſident Stiles informs me, that the Baptiſts in Saybrook were the firſt who took the benefit of this act. And a conciſe account of the affairs of the college he preſides over ſhall cloſe this chapter. Connecticut Legiſlature firſt granted a charter for it in 1701. It was then intended to be
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:018336_0107_0FA5D22B37F29DD8"/>at Saybrook; but after hot contentions, wherein a large and valuable part of their library was loſt, it was ſettled at New-Haven in 1718. Elihu Yale, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the Eaſt-India Company in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, made large donations to it, upon which it was called Yale College. In 1719, Mr. Timothy Cutler, miniſter at Stratford, was choſen Rector of it. But in September, 1722, he reſigned that office, and went to England for Epiſcopal ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, from whence he alſo received the title of D. D. and was a miſſionary many years in Boſton. After his departure, Mr. Samuel Andrew, miniſter at Milford, preſided at their commencements, until Mr. Eliſha Williams, of Wethersfield, was choſen their Rector in 1725; which office he ſuſtained with honor to himſelf, and advantage to others, till he reſigned it on October 31, 1739, and removed back to Wethersfield; which town he often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in their Aſſembly, and was ſerviceable in other offices; one of which was to go over as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Agent for his Colony to England. Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Clap, of Windham, ſucceeded him in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; the government of which, by their firſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was in the Truſtees, who choſe the Rector and Tutors.

               <p n="1">I. SINCE the diſorders in Rhode-Iſland Colony have often been recurred to, as a prevailing argument for ſupporting worſhip by tax and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, the evil effects of which have had a great influence in continuing ſome of thoſe diſorders, an humble attempt ſhall here be made to ſearch this matter to the bottom. And in the firſt place we are to remember, that the exiſtence of that Colony, as a diſtinct government, was long an eye-ſore to many of their neighbours; who tried a variety of mean and cruel methods to divide and conquer it. And Solomon ſays, ſurely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad; and none will pretend that all the inhabitants of the Colony were wiſe men: Yet all the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their wiſe men, and all the ignorance and folly of others, have been induſtriouſly held up to the world, as a convincing proof of the neceſſity of an eſtabliſhed religion by human laws. And as the terms learned and orthodox have been connected in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018336_0109_0FA5D22E40D4D460"/>this argument, colleges and perſecution have grown up together in the ideas of multitudes; and in not a few Calviniſm, family worſhip, and a religious regard to the Chriſtian ſabbath, have gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame connexion. Notwithſtanding it is moſt certain, that Mr. Williams, the founder of ſaid Colony, and Mr. Clarke, who procured their ſecond charter, were men of ſuperior learning, and held ſtrictly to the doctrines of ſovereign grace, and to the duties of private and public worſhip; as many other fathers of the Colony alſo did. But their children, as well as others, have been more ready to retain their errors than their virtues; ſome of which I will name.</p>
               <p n="2">II. DAILY prayer to God for what we need, and praiſes for what we receive, are duties taught by reaſon as well as revelation; and every perſon is <hi>inexcuſable</hi> that neglects the <hi>immediate</hi> practice of thoſe duties, Pſalm cvii. 8, 15, 28, 43, Acts xvii. 27, Rom. i. 20, 21. But the ordinances of ſpecial communion in the Chriſtian church, are only known by pure revelation, which requires previous perſonal qualifications before any may partake therein. But Mr. Williams, about the time of his baniſhment from the Maſſachuſetts, blended theſe two kinds of duties ſo much toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to oppoſe the inculcating of prayer upon the unregenerate, as well as the immediate prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of church communion: As if a criminal might not petition for help and mercy, nor give thanks for what he received, any more than to act in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with his Prince before he was pardoned and reconciled. And caſting off fear, and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer before God, is ſo exceeding natural to men, that great numbers have held faſt this error. Above three years after Mr. Williams was
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:018336_0110_0FA5D22EE5FF3BE0"/>baniſhed, he alſo ſtumbled upon another error, which many who reproach him are ſtill tenacious of; namely, the opinion that miniſterial authority muſt be derived by an external ſucceſſion from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired men. The confounding of the Jewiſh prieſthood with the goſpel miniſtry, is the ſource of this error. Upon their return from Babylon, thoſe prieſts who could not produce a <hi>regiſter</hi> of their ſucceſſion from Aaron, were not ſuffered to officiate as ſuch, until a new miſſion ſhould be given from above, Ezra ii. 62, 63. And not finding a like regiſter from the apoſtles, cauſed Mr. Williams to refrain from church communion in his latter days, though not from public worſhip. And how ready have many been from hence to excuſe themſelves in a careleſs neglect of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? To which Gorton's teaching and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence added great force. He had a ſingular knack at turning the ſcriptures into miſt and allegory, under a pretence of great ſpirituality; and alſo at running down his opponents with ſatyr and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule; arts that have been very bewitching in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages. The coming and ſufferings of Chriſt he held to be myſtical, and not literal; and he treated the doctrine of viſible inſtituted churches with the utmoſt contempt. Says he, "Such Phariſaical interpreters, who erect churches as true churches of God, that admit of decay, and falling from God, in whole or any members thereof, are they who have deceived and undone the world, from the foundation thereof unto this day, and are the proper <hi>witches</hi> of the world which the ſcripture intends." And he conſtrued the mint, aniſe and cummin of the Phariſees, as applicable to all who practiſe the external adminiſtration of baptiſm,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:018336_0111_0FA5D22FA13B89B0"/>breaking of bread, and church cenſures<note n="*" place="bottom">Gordon's antidote againſt Phariſaical teachers, p. 42, 52.</note>. He was a leader in public worſhip at Warwick for ſixty years, by way of teaching, prayer and ſinging; but having no ſucceſſor, furniſhed with his art, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect if not a contempt of public worſhip and of other religious duties has greatly prevailed in thoſe parts, enforced with the remembrance of former cruelties ſhown to their fathers under religious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. And as Calviniſm was the general plan of orthodoxy among their oppreſſors, the oppoſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents more eaſily prevailed in moſt of the Baptiſt churches, though it was an apoſtaſy from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they were founded upon. And running into extremes, on other accounts, increaſed their unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Being hardly accuſed with the want of valid adminiſtrators, moved ſeven Baptiſt churches, who met in London in 1643, to declare it as their faith, that by Chriſt's commiſſion every diſciple, who had a gift to preach the goſpel, had a right to adminiſter baptiſm, even before he was ordained in any church<note n="†" place="bottom">Croſby, vol. 1, appendix, p. 21.</note>. But it is to be obſerved, that Philip was an ordained officer in the church before he baptized the young believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at Samaria; while none but apoſtles laid on hands after baptiſm, both there and at Epheſus; and which was attended with extraordinary effects in each place, Acts viii. 14, 17, xix. 6. Yet Mr. Samuel Hubbard informs us, that in 1652 the practice was adopted, firſt at Providence, and then at Newport, of gifted diſciples adminiſtring both baptiſm and laying on of hands, who were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained officers in any church; which practice was continued by ſome for many years after. In 1725 the ſecond church in Swanzey voted to make lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands a term of their communion: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018336_0112_0FA5D2306FE1DFA0"/>others had done ſo before. Many conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diviſions were cauſed by theſe things, which greatly obſtructed goſpel order in their church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. But as the Chriſtian church is the pillar and ground of the truth, and baptiſm is the initiating or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance thereof, it ſurely muſt belong to her, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ordinary times, to ſet men apart to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it.</p>
               <p>INTERNAL right, and an external warrant to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it, are diſtinct things. Every renewed ſoul has an internal right to the ſpecial privileges of the church of Chriſt; and thoſe to whom he has given ſpecial gifts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>m; but a perſon muſt be received as an orderly member of a particular church in order to his acting as ſuch; and thoſe who are qualified for officers ought to be ſet apart as ſuch before they baptize others. This is now generally allowed. Both ſcripture and reaſon plainly ſhew, that actions may be done in extraordinary caſes, which ought not in ordinary times.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As to their civil affairs, the firſt charter of Providence Colony extended to the Pequot river and country, that is, into the heart of New-London county; and it was given eighteen years before Connecticut charter. And the ſecond charter to Rhode-Iſland Colony was given by the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which gave that of Connecticut; and this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority fixed the line betwixt them in a moſt explicit manner: Yet Connecticut made a practice of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently crowding over that line for above ſixty years after they received their charter. In 1720 Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Jencks was ſent over Agent to England for help againſt them. At length, on September 27, 1728, Roger Wolcott, James Wadſworth, and Daniel Palmer, Commiſſioners for Connecticut, and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:018336_0113_0FA5D231208001E0"/>Wanton, Benjamin Ellery, and William Jencks, for Rhode-Iſland, ſigned a ſettlement of that line. The ſouth part is exactly according to Rhode-Iſland charter; the north part bears a little eaſt thereof. Plymouth Colony was only a voluntary combination among themſelves, as to government; though they were allowed to continue ſo till the revolution. And Rhode Iſland charter was given twenty-eight years before Plymouth was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the Maſſachuſetts; yet the line on that ſide was never eſtabliſhed, until it was done by a ſpecial commiſſion in 1741, according to the oldeſt charter<note n="*" place="bottom">Douglaſs, vol. 1, p. 400, vol. 2, p. 51</note>; which gave Rhode-Iſland the towns of Little-Compton, Tiverton, Briſtol, Warren, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington, and Cumberland, that they had not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before (vol. 1, p. 347, 350.) The hiſtory of their civil government may properly be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four periods. Before the revolution of 1688, parties both on ſecular and religious accounts cauſed much unhappineſs. From thence to 1732 their government was in wiſe and ſteady hands; ſo that they had but two Governors in thirty-four years. Afterwards a depreciating paper currency, with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery in elections, produced many and great evils; a ſight of which moved the two competitors for the office of Governor amicably to give up their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, and to prevail with a very peaceable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to accept the chair in 1769. Since then bribery and party influence have been better guard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed againſt. And can any or all of theſe things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the leaſt reaſon againſt equal liberty, or for the uſe of compulſion in the ſupport of worſhip? Yea, have not our opponents given evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in that Colony? The firſt Congregational church therein was formed at Newport, and Mr.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:018336_0114_0FA5D231DFE6BF80"/>Nathanael Clap, from Dorcheſter, was ordained their paſtor, November 3, 1720. He was a man of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piety, who began to preach there in 1695, and was a great bleſſing among them till his death, on October 30, 1745, aet. 78; for whom Mr. John Callender preached and printed a funeral ſermon. Mr. Clap was a hearty friend to the primitive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their churches: But Mr. John Adams, a young teacher of the modern ſtamp, gained the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a large part of his church; and becauſe Mr. Clap could not conſent to his ſettling as col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with him, nor break bread to a number of the members, a party council divided the church, and the young miniſter was ordained over a majority, April 11, 1728; ſo that Mr. Clap was ſhut out of his meeting-houſe, and his people built another for him. The third Congregational church in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony was conſtituted at Providence, over which Mr. Joſiah Cotton was ordained, October 23, 1728<note n="*" place="bottom">Comer's diary and papers. In leſs than two years Adams was diſmiſſed by his church, and not recommended.</note>. Some things previous to this laſt event call for a place in our hiſtory.

               <p n="5">V. THE town of Providence ſent them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, dated February 23, 1722, ſigned in their name by Jonathan Sprague; wherein they ſay, "We take notice how you praiſe the love and peace that diſſenters of all ranks entertain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with, in this government.—We anſwer, this happineſs principally conſiſts in their not allowing ſocieties any ſuperiority one over another; but each ſociety ſupports their own miniſtry, of their own free-will, and not by conſtraint or force, upon any man's perſon or eſtate; and this greatly adds to our peace and tranquility. But the contrary, that takes any man's eſtate by force, to maintain their own or any other miniſtry, it ſerves for nothing but to provoke to wrath, envy and ſtrife. And ſince you wrote this letter, the conſtable of Attleborough has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the eſtates of our dear friends and pious diſſenters, to maintain their miniſter; the like hath been done in Mendon. Is this the way of peace! Is this the fruit of your love! Why do you hug the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:018336_0118_0FA5D239307332C0"/>iniquity of Eli's ſons, and walk in the ſteps of the falſe prophets, to bite with your teeth, and cry peace, but no longer than men put into your mouths but you prepare war againſt them?—You deſire that all former injury, done by you to us, may be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in oblivion. We ſay, far be it from us to revenge ourſelves, or to deal to you as you have dealt to us, but rather ſay, Father forgive them, they know not what they do. But if you mean, that we ſhould not ſpeak of former actions, done hurtfully to any man's perſon, we ſay, God never called for that, nor ſuffered it to be hid, as witneſs Cain, Joab and Judas, are kept on record to deter other men from doing the like." A reply hereto was printed at Boſton, dated September 7, 1722, which did not pretend to deny the facts here mentioned; but made a great flouriſh upon a <hi>word,</hi> which was not in their firſt printed letter, but was the error of the preſs in a ſecond edition; and then took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from what they ſaid about recording hurtful actions to publiſh a copy of a ſentence of Court againſt Sprague in Boſton, April 28, 1674, "For reproaching and ſcandalizing the magiſtrates, and for laſcivious carriage." And it inſinuated that their complaints about perſecution were becauſe of ſuch ſufferings as this.</p>
               <p>SENSIBLE how the populace had been deceived by ſuch arts, Sprague wrote a rejoinder, dated January 24, 1723, in which he makes ſome apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for taking notice of ſuch an anonymous revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling piece, which profanely ſets the Court records of Boſton upon a level with God's infallible record concerning Cain and Judas; and informs us that one of the two witneſſes againſt him, in that caſe at Boſton, was afterwards brought to repentance, and joined to the Baptiſt church he belonged to in
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:018336_0119_0FA5D2397501D300"/>Providence; when ſhe aſked and received his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, for wronging him in her teſtimony in that caſe.

And did you not barbarouſly ſcourge Mr. Baker, in Cambridge, the chief mate of a London ſhip?

Mr. Comer knew him, and ſpeaks of him as a very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and pious man.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. AS a further proof on the evil effects of coercive meaſures about religious worſhip, I ſhall here add ſome account of John Rogers, of New-London, and his followers, who are briefly deſcribed in vol. 1, p. 473—480. He intermixed a number of precious truths, with may things of a contrary nature. Governor Leete well obſerved, in a letter there publiſhed, that if Rogers and his party had been Governors in Connecticut, it might be doubted whether they would have allowed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo much liberty in keeping the firſt day of the week as a ſabbath, as the goverment there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to him and his followers in the oppoſite way. For Rogers imagining that the law which required the keeping of that day eſtabliſhed idolatry, was as zealous to pull it down, as the Jews were againſt idols in old times. And the ſufferings which he met with, for his zeal about this and other religious matters, ſeemed to be his life; until, to ſhew how ſtrong his faith was, he went to Boſton, and among the infection of the ſmall-pox there; but catched it, came home and died with it, and cauſed the death of ſome others thereby. This many might think
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:018336_0121_0FA5D23ADEEEF9D0"/>was quite enough to open the eyes of his followers; but it was far from doing it. Perhaps they might think he was taken away in judgment to them, for their coldneſs and negligence. Certain it is that Joſeph Bolles now publiſhed a ſecond edition of Rogers's book, intituled, "A midnight cry from the temple of God to the ten virgins ſlumbering and ſleeping; awake, awake, ariſe, and gird your loins, and trim your lamps, for behold the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ridegroom cometh, go ye therefore out to meet him!" Bolles wrote a preface to it, in which he ſays of the author, "For his religion he loſt his wife and children, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered continual perſecution, being near one third of his lifetime, after his converſion, in priſons. And in the 73d year of his age, he died in his own houſe, at New-London, 1721." Hereupon his ſon, and others of that ſect, ſet out afreſh in zealous attempts to pull down the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l-ſabbath; and as a number of them came into Norwich, in their way to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon, on a firſt day, having things with them to diſcover that they were upon worldly buſineſs, and meant to appear againſt having that day kept as a ſabbath, they were ſeized by authority; and on July 26, 1725, they were brought before Joſeph Backus, Juſtice of the Peace, who fined them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law; and refuſing to pay it, they were whipped.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. GOVERNOR Jencks being informed of their ſufferings, and that it was becauſe they were going to Lebanon to worſhip, and to adminiſter baptiſm, wrote a paper, giving ſome account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as a warning to people againſt the Preſbyterian ſect, and ſet it up in a public place in Providence. The Juſtice having obtained a copy of that paper, publiſhed an anſwer to it; a manuſcript reply to which, in the Governor's own hand writing, is
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018336_0122_0FA5D23BB0E82FF8"/>before me. He does not pretend to reply to it all; for ſays he, "Such unchriſtian-like behaviour, in giving them diſturbance when at their public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if true, may juſtly be condemned by all ſober people, and is that which never entered into my thoughts to juſtify in John Rogers, or any other man." But ſays the Governor, "It is very well known, to all the elderly inhabitants of Providence, that the Preſbyterian governments in New-England in general, and Connecticut in particular, have for a long time been uſing their utmoſt ſkill and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring the greateſt part if not all this little Colony under their rule and government. But finding themſelves diſappointed in the ſeveral mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they have hitherto taken, they are now (as is ſuppoſed by many others as well as myſelf) about to try one artifice more in order to obtain their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and that is by ſending in their miniſters among us, under a pretence of doing good to ſouls; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the deſign chiefly is, to gain ſuch a party as may be ſufficient to over-vote us in our elections, and ſo to gain the rule over us."</p>
               <p>EXPERIENCE has ſince given much greater light about theſe things than was then enjoyed in the country. In 1758 the Rogerenes publiſhed an abſtract of the hiſtory of ancient perſecutions in New-England, with high encomiums upon thoſe Quakers who returned and were hanged at Boſton, after they had been baniſhed on pain of death; and a reproof to their own ſociety and others for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion from that temper and ſpirit. Many were hereby ſtirred up to travel from town to town, and to interrupt others in their worſhip, eſpecially in the year 1763. But when they did ſo, at Norwich and other places, the authority removed them away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til their worſhip was ended, and then releaſed them,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018336_0123_0FA5D23C5D614938"/>without fine or correction; which had a much better effect than their former puniſhments. Indeed in New-London, where moſt of them lived, Mr. Mather Byles was ſo uneaſy at their ſurrounding his gate, and calling him a hireling, that in 1768 he made a bitter complaint that their laws were not put in full execution againſt ſaid people; and for this and other reaſons he reſigned his paſtoral charge there, and went off to Epiſcopacy. About which time, a number of the Rogerenes were ſeized in a clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine way, and were ſcourged in a moſt barbarous manner; for which may all the actors or abettors thereof be brought to true repentance! An inſtance or two of late ſuicide among the members of the Rogerene church, gave a great ſhock to the reſt; and a number of their children are now become agreeable members of other communities. And if all perſons and ſocieties were impartially protected by authority, and none but ſpiritual weapons were made uſe of, and they with due faithfulneſs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and ſupport the Chriſtian religion, who can tell how happy the effects would ſoon be?</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. SOME revival of religion among the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, as well as oppoſition thereto, is now to be deſcribed. Mr. John Clark was a chief leader in forming the firſt Baptiſt church in Newport, in 1644; and he continued their paſtor until his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, April 20, 1676. Mr. Obadiah Holmes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in that office, and died October 15, 1682. Near three years after Mr. Richard Dingley, from Britain by the way of Boſton, became their paſtor. An addreſs of his to the church is before me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deſcribes the duty of a paſtor to his people, and of a people to their paſtor, in a clear ſcriptural light. About 1694 he left that church and went to Boſton, and from thence to South-Carolina. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure they had only occaſional ſupplies till 1710, when they elected Mr. William Packom for their paſtor, in whoſe ordination Elder Luther
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018336_0125_0FA5D23E169F8100"/>of Swanzey aſſiſted. In 1718, Mr. Daniel White, from Mr. Wallin's church in London, was choſen for a colleague with Elder Packom: But as he was a ſtrict Calviniſt, diſputes ſoon aroſe about doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, which were greatly increaſed by a leader in the church, who was an aſſign of Mr. Clark's eſtate, and unfaithful in his truſt. Councils were called from Boſton and Swanzey upon it; and the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature of the Colony were moved to put him out of that office, and to put another man into it; though upon further ſearch they ſaw that this was not in their power. Therefore in 1721 they made a law, which requires all men who are entruſted with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable donations annually to give an account of their proceedings therein to their Town-Council, which is ſtill in force. But a ſeparation took place in that church, and White adminiſtered to one party for ſeveral years, till it diſſolved, and he went to Philadelphia in 1728. A difference in ſentiments about laying on of hands, and ſome other things, cauſed the riſe of the ſecond church in Newport, about the year 1656; and Mr. William Vaughan was their firſt miniſter, who died in 1677, and was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Thomas Baker, and he by John Harden. who died in 1700. In 1701 James Clarke was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, by the aſſiſtance of the Elders Pardon Tillinghaſt and John Brown of Providence. In 1704 Daniel Wightman was ordained a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with him; and they were ſucceſsful, and much eſteemed in their places to old age.</p>
               <p n="2">II. MR. Comer, before mentioned, being at ſchool at Cambridge, joined to the firſt church there in February, 1723. Ephraim Crafts, his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend, had joined to the Baptiſt church in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton juſt before. This Comer thought was a very
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:018336_0126_0FA5D23F92499460"/>wrong action, and took the firſt opportunity he had to try to convince him of it: But, after a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble debate, Comer was prevailed with to take and read Stennett upon baptiſm, which gave him quite other views of the ſubject than he ever had before. However he concluded to be ſilent about it; and as education was the cheapeſt at New-Haven, he went and entered the college there in September, 1723. and continued a member of it until October, 1724; when infirmity of body cauſed his return by water to Boſton; and a terrible ſtorm at ſea, with the death of a peculiar friend juſt as he arrived, brought eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſo directly before him, as to ſpoil all his plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible excuſes for the neglect of baptiſm. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels,</hi> had ſuch, influence upon him, that, after proper labours with thoſe he was previouſly connected with, he was baptized and joined to the Baptiſt church in Boſton, January 31, 1725; and concluded to purſue his ſtudies in a private way. Four months after he was called to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and on May 19, 1726, he was ordained a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the firſt church in Newport, colleague with Elder Packom; and a great bleſſing was granted upon his miniſtry in that town. Their firſt church had but ſeventeen members when he came there; to whom thirty-four were added in leſs than three years. And ſays Comer, "There was no public ſinging until I came, and by the bleſſing of heaven introduced it." Neither had they any church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, before he got a book, and collected into it the beſt accounts that he could obtain of their
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:018336_0127_0FA5D240DCA432F8"/>former affairs<note n="*" place="bottom">He was very curious and exact alſo in recording other events, He obſerves that the year 1727 was a year of many remarkable occurrences. It was ſo for the death of rulers. King George I. died June 11; and in Rhode-Iſland Colony the Hon. Edward Thurſton, one of their Council [father of the preſent paſtor of the ſecond church in Newport] died in April; Governor Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton April 26; Deputy-Governor Nichols, who was elected in May, died in July. From July 28 to Auguſt 7 the heat was ſo intenſe as to cauſe the death of many. Through the three firſt nights in Auguſt the lightnings were conſtant and amazing. On September 26 was a terrible hurricane; and a more terrible earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake October 29, which was followed with a ſmaller one in the morning of January 28, 1728. He firſt mentions the northern lights, in the evening of July 16, 1728, which were much greater on October 2 following. Dean Berkley arrived at Newport Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 23, with whom Comer had an interview July 14, 1729. Governor Burnet came to Newport, in his way to Boſton, July 12, 1728, and died at Boſton September 7, 1729. Several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were baptized by way of immerſion by Epiſcopalian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as Mr. Carpenter by Mr. Uſher of Briſtol, January, 1725. Nathaniel Brown, and four others at Rehoboth, by Mr. Piggot of Providence, in July, 1726. A woman at Newport, by Dr. M'Sparran, of Narraganſet, in November, 1728.</note>. Out of a manuſcript written by their firſt paſtor, he tranſcribed the confeſſion of faith mentioned in our vol. 1, p. 255. For his ſupport he received £ 85 in 1726, £ 93 12 4 in 1727; but not a third part of this laſt ſum in 1728, becauſe two leading members of the church, who diſliked his cloſe and ſearching miniſtrations, had influence enough to turn a great part of the ſociety againſt him. At length Comer gave them an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they eagerly made uſe of, to croud him out of his office in that church; for, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any previous notice, he on November 17, 1728, preached up the laying on of hands upon every member as a Chriſtian duty, though not as a term of communion. Upon the cloſe of that year he ſays, "This has been a year of great exerciſe
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:018336_0128_0FA5D24102F16B00"/>to me. I have been as it were in the furnace of affliction. The difficulty in my flock has been heart-wounding, and ſometimes almoſt confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But I ſee God's grace is ſufficient for me. I am fully and clearly convinced that I ſhould have fallen into many hurtful evils, if ſovereign grace had not wonderfully prevented. Bleſs the Lord O my ſoul.—About this time I found my people ſo uncomfortable that we muſt divide from each other, which was exceeding grievous to me."</p>
               <p>JANUARY 8, 1729, Mr. Comer was diſmiſſed from ſaid church; and the next day he ſays, "I paſſed under hands by Mr. Daniel Wightman, and offered for tranſient communion until ſpring, or till I ſaw how God in his holy providence might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of me." A revival of religion in that ſecond church in Newport began the fall before; and as Elder Clarke was above 80, and unable to preach, Mr. Comer was received to preach one half of the Lord's days with Elder Wightman for two years. And above forty members were added to that church before he left it; which was the greateſt increaſe they had ever received in ſuch a length of time, at the cloſe whereof they had one hundred and fifty communicants, being the largeſt church in the Colony. For Comer's ſupport the ſociety gave him £ 129 in 1729, and £ 144 12 10 in 1730. As Newport was the head town of the government, Governor Jencks went and lived there, in order more conveniently to attend upon the duties of his office; where he joined in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion with ſaid church; wherein Mr. Comer alſo now introduced regular records, which they lacked before. And as Mr. John Walton, a young gentleman of a liberal education, was invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach at Providence, where a like reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018336_0129_0FA5D241B601AF00"/>might be hoped for, in the church whereof the Governor was a principal member, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was raiſed againſt it, he wrote the following letter to Mr. James Brown, their paſtor.</p>

                     <p>I AM heartily ſorry to hear of the difference in our church at Providence, about Mr. Walton's coming to ſettle there; as alſo for the unkind treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he there met with from ſome, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he came not there with a deſign to impoſe himſelf upon the church, but at the requeſt of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the brethren. And why his coming there ſhould be ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſed, as I underſtand it is, I cannot conceive. As to his ſinging of pſalms, I have heard him ſay, he would not urge that as a duty upon the church. And if it were for that he might expect ſome allowance, by way of contribution, for his ſupport, it moſt certainly is an error in thoſe who oppoſe that as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: For I think the ſcriptures are very clear in that point, that it is not only lawful for a miniſter or elder that preaches the goſpel to receive (by way of contribution) a competent maintenance, but alſo the duty of the church, according to their ability, to afford it to him; and this I doubt not but I can fully prove by ſcripture againſt all contradiction. And I believe there are ſeveral of my brethren who can remember, that Elder Tillinghaſt (in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time) who was a man exemplary for his doctrine, as well as of an unblemiſhed character, did ſeveral times in his teaching declare, that it was the duty of a church to contribute towards the maintenance of their elders, who laboured in the word and doctrine of Chriſt; and although for his own part he would take nothing, yet it remained the church's duty
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:018336_0130_0FA5D242964C7348"/>to be performed to ſuch as might ſucceed him. And as to what Mr. Walton holds with reſpect to laying on of hands upon believers as ſuch, I do not underſtand by him that he oppoſes it any other ways, than if it be performed for the obtaining the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: But he thinks it ought not to be any bar to communion with thoſe who have been rightly baptized. And as I have been informed, by one or more of the ancient members of our church at Providence, that ſuch was the opinion of the Baptiſts, in the firſt conſtitution of their churches, throughout this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; and that ſuch as were under laying on of hands continued their fellowſhip with thoſe that were not, until one who was in great repute for wiſdom amongſt them did in his teaching declare, that the doctrine of laying on of hands was a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of devils, upon which a ſeparation was made: And as I was informed when in England the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there was upon ſome ſuch like occaſion. But further, as to Mr. Walton's receiving, by way of contribution, if the church in Providence can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold fellowſhip with him, and do account he may be ſerviceable to them in preaching, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental of doing good to others; I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why any one ſhould oppoſe his receiving ſome allowance for his labour, from ſuch as are free to give it, none being under any compulſion; for I think it highly rational, if he leaves his own home, where he can, by overſeeing the management of his farm, live honorably, and removes to Providence purely to ſerve his brethren, that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him accordingly.</p>

ELDER Brown was of his mind; but Deacon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Winſor took the lead of a party, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſet againſt what the Governor had propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Council was called there, September 3, 1731, who adviſed them not to divide upon it; but at a meeting in October, Winſor and his party were for cenſuring Walton as a tranſgreſſor, for joining in prayer with Baptiſts who were not under hands. Elder Brown reaſoned with them upon it, and ſaid, "If we admoniſh brother Walton and ſet him apart, what will you do with others who hold that point as he does, as Elder Clarke, Elder Wightman, the Governor, and ſome others?" Their anſwer was, "That we muſt go through with it." And Elder Peter Place, of Smithfield, came and aſſiſted in making an open ſeparation in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence church upon theſe points. And Winſor taught publicly, "That all thoſe who took any thing for preaching were like Simon Magus." This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is taken from original writings of Elder Brown and others, now before me. And as he died Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 28, 1732, aet. 66<note n="*" place="bottom">He was grandſon to Chad Brown, one of the firſt planters of Providence; and ſon to John Brown, who was elected into their Council in 1665, and was afterwards an elder in Providence church. From Elder James Brown's ſon James ſprang the four brothers who are now very noted traders in Providence, and great promoters of learning, and of the Baptiſt cauſe there. Said elder's ſon Eliſha was Deputy-Governor of the Colony in 1765, and his ſon Andrew was Juſtice of Peace in the State, and long an exemplary Chriſtian in the Baptiſt church in Glouceſter, until he died in peace, 1782.</note>, Winſor's party prevailed, and ordained him as the miniſter of that church. Walton quitted the miniſtry, and followed other employments, whereby many were confirmed in their prejudices againſt him and his ſentiments.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. PERHAPS a conciſe account of a piece of villainy, which was now detected at Swanzey, may
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:018336_0132_0FA5D244B618C910"/>be of ſervice, to warn all others againſt doing the like. That town was firſt granted to five men, three of whom were Baptiſts; and they laid out ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of land, which they called paſtors and teachers lots. They had a large and curious book of church records, which was brought from Wales; and the ſurveys of thoſe lots were recorded therein. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington was originally included in Swanzey, and when it became a diſtinct town, they had their ſhare of thoſe lots for Pedobaptiſt miniſters. In 1718 Richard Harden became both a deacon and the clerk of the firſt church in Swanzey; and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to build and make improvements upon one of thoſe lots, near their meeting-houſe; and he was alſo a leading man in town affairs. Having ſuch advantages, he was tempted with a notion, that by deſtroying the records of thoſe lots, he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that whereon he lived as common land. And behold! all the records of Swanzey church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 1663 and 1718 were taken out of the book, and have never been recovered ſince! When the church came to know it, as the government was in the hands of Pedobaptiſts, they invited Barrington to join with them in ſuing for their rights, with an offer, that if they would be at proportionable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, they ſhould have two fifths of what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The offer was accepted, and Harden was ſued by a writ of ejectment, at the County Court, in July, 1730, and was caſt. He appealed to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Court in September; but was alſo caſt there. By a reference the next year he obtained £ 125 for what he had done upon the land, and was obliged to quit it; and he took to keeping looſe company, and drinking to exceſs. Elder Wheaton, and a large part of his church, had been deſirous of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Mr. Comer with him, before Comer went to

The two Profeſſors upon his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in the college each publiſhed a diſcourſe upon the occaſion, and Preſident Wadſworth wrote a preface thereto. Profeſſor Wiggleſworth ſays, "By his frequent and ample benefactions, for the encouragement of theological as well as human knowledge among us, who are Chriſtians of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent denomination from himſelf, he hath ſet ſuch an example of a generous, catholic and Chriſtian ſpirit, as hath never before fallen within my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor, ſo far as I now remember, within my reading." Dr. Coleman ſays, "That which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in the piety and benefits of Mr. Hollis, unto theſe churches, was, that though he was not ſtrictly of our way, nor in judgment with us in the point of infant baptiſm, yet his heart and hand was the ſame to us, as if we had been one in opinion and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with him. And in this let him ſtand a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pattern and example to us, of a noble, Chriſtian, apoſtolic ſpirit of love; which makes thoſe that differ in leſſer matters to receive one another to the glory of God, and a ſhining teſtimony againſt a narrow party ſpirit, which is ſo much the diſgrace and detriment of the Proteſtant intereſt, and which ſo early began among the apoſtles of Jeſus, and was rebuked by him, even in John himſelf, that apoſtle of love and charity afterwards, who once ſaid to Chriſt in a fret of zeal, Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us, and we forbid him, becauſe he followeth not us: But

We ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remember this hereafter. In the mean time, the laſt letter that I have ſeen from Mr. Hollis's intimate friend diſcovers ſo much of the views and comforts of Chriſtianity, in a near ſight of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that I ſhall annex it to the foregoing account. It was directed to Mr. Eliſha Callender.</p>

I am, through divine goodneſs, able to preach once a day on Lord's days, but hardly ever expect to get over my indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a wonder to the doctors, and all others who ſaw my caſe, that I am alive. I could not for ſeveral months but expect to be removed; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord, I had a comfortable proſpect of another world, and was rather grieved than pleaſed at the view of a return into this. Here methinks is nothing pleaſant to the mind, but rather every thing ſullying and diſcompoſing: Why then ſhould not thoſe who have taſted divine grace, long to ſtretch and ſwim in the immenſe ocean? How ſweet is a drop here, therefore how raviſhing muſt the full enjoyment be! But Lord grant faith and patience, to wait thy time, even thy time, O Lord. I am glad to hear the baptized intereſt thrives, and wiſh that the power of religion were in a more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition with you than it is with us; for ſurely Jacob is ſmall and low.

He finiſhed his courſe with joy, in his 55th year, June 12, 1733<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. page 394.</note>. To return to our own hiſtory, I would obſerve, that Rhode-Iſland Colony was firſt divided into three counties, in June, 1729; and in February, 1730, Providence was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the towns of Providence, Smithfield, Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and Scituate. There were thirteen Baptiſt churches, moſt of them ſmall, who now held an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual aſſociations to promote diſcipline and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among them, upon the ſix principles in Hebrews vi. viz. one in Providence, the ſecond in Newport, two in Smithfield, the ſecond in Swanzey, and one in each of the towns of Dartmouth, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, North-Kingſtown, South-Kingſtown, Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, Groton, New-London and New-York. The two in Connecticut had introduced ſinging in public worſhip, to promote which their Elder Wightman publiſhed a little pamphlet; but it was oppoſed by many among other churches. One church in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port held the keeping of the ſeventh day ſabbath as a bar of communion, and refuſed to aſſiſt in ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Comer in 1726, on that account. Mr. Mumford, who firſt led them into that principle, introduced ſinging among them in 1677. In that, and in their ſiſter church at Weſterly, Comer ſays
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:018336_0136_0FA5D24C53D69D00"/>were now about one hundred and forty commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants; and alſo that general redemption was held by the majority of all thoſe fifteen churches. The firſt church in Newport had now about fifty mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the firſt in Swanzey two hundred, and their ſiſter church in Boſton eighty. Theſe held to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular election, and did not make laying on of hands a bar of communion, and ſang in public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and the above named were all the Baptiſt churches then extant, north of New-Jerſey.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. MR. Comer had held a correſpondence by letter with miniſters in New-Jerſey for ſeveral years; and in March, 1731, he went there by water, and viſited their churches in Middletown, Piſcataqua, Cohanſey, &amp;c. He went as far as Philadelphia; and upon his return declared great ſatisfaction, in the ſight he had of the faith and order of thoſe churches. On July 3 he ſaid, "I deſired and obtained a diſmiſſion from the church where I had preached more than two years, becauſe I was never ſettled there, and found that ſome could not bear my preaching the doctrines of grace." In Auguſt he removed to Rehoboth, where on January 1, 1732, he ſaid, "I begin a new year, in a new place, but not in a new employment; for my delight of ſoul is in ſerving my dear Redeemer in the ſacred work of the miniſtry; which I prefer and eſteem above and beyond every thing elſe; though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge unfit and unworthy in myſelf. Lord, who is ſufficient for theſe thing! My ſufficiency is alone of God, in whom I reſt and rely continually. January 20, a Baptiſt church was gathered in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboth; and January 26 I was publicly inſtalled paſtor of it. Elder Ephraim Wheaton of Swanzey preached from 1 Theſſ. v. 12, 13, and gave me the right hand of fellowſhip." And a precious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:018336_0137_0FA5D24E55CEE6A8"/>of ſouls were hopefully converted under his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry there. In June he viſited Sutton and Leiceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and baptized Thomas Richardſon, Daniel Denny, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> brother to Mr. Prince's wife of Boſton, and ſix more. In July he preached and baptized a man in Middleborough. November 30 he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized fifteen perſons at home, who were chiefly ſeals of his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Two learned miniſters were now ſettled in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Mr. John Callender, nephew to their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Boſton, who had enjoyed the benefit of Mr. Hollis's donations in Harvard college, was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a paſtor of the firſt church in Newport, October 13, 1731, colleague with Elder Packom, who died three years after. Mr. Nicholas Eyres, who was born in Wiltſhire, Auguſt 22, 1691, and educated in the city of Briſtol, became a Baptiſt after he came over to New-York; and he was ordained paſtor of a ſmall Baptiſt church there in 1724, by the two Elder Wightman's. A collection was made in Newport, Providence, &amp;c. to help them in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meeting-houſe in that city. But in 1730 the church became much broken; Eyres ſays, "Some of them deſerted, under a pretence of love to the principles of abſolute election and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation." Therefore he came and ſettled at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in October, 1731, colleague with Elder Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Elder James Clarke, of that church, died December 1, 1736, aet. 88, much eſteemed by thoſe who knew him.</p>
               <p>MR. James Bound, a ſenſible Baptiſt, came over from England, and dwelt a while in Salem village, now Danvers, where Mr. Peter Clark was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; who could not be content with perſonal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bound told him that it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair way of treating mankind; but he perſiſted in it, until he turned a number of his people from his own way, who removed, and began a Baptiſt ſociety in Sutton. Mr. Bound's ſon John married a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Mr. Clark's church, and removed to that town, where the preaching of Sutton miniſter for infant baptiſm turned her from it; and when Clark heard thereof, he wrote her a long letter upon the ſubject. This ſhe communicated to Mr. Walton, and he wrote an anſwer thereto, and ſent it in a ſealed letter to Mrs. Bound. But by ſome means Clark got it into his hands, and publiſhed both letters, with animadverſions thereon, in 1732. She told me that ſhe never ſaw Walton's letter to her, till ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN December, 1731, an act was paſſed in Boſton, for the Quakers only; which left out the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and five mile limitation, and required the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors in each pariſh, where any Quakers lived, to take an annual liſt of them, and to deliver it to their pariſh clerk by the 20th of July; and if any of them ſhould happen to be omitted therein, two principal members of the Quaker ſociety might certify the ſame to the aſſeſſors by the 10th of Auguſt; and they ſhould alſo be exempted from taxes to the eſtabliſhed worſhip. As the exempting laws for Baptiſts expired in 1733, Mr. Comer's people were immediately taxed to other teachers; and ſome of them were impriſoned therefor. But upon appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to their Legiſlature they were releaſed, in 1734; and a like law was made for the Baptiſts as had lately been for the Quakers; though no pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty was laid upon their aſſeſſors, for breaking thoſe laws, which they frequently did.</p>

THE Baptiſt churches in Swanzey and Rehoboth met with ſore bereavements in 1734; when Elder Wheaton died April 26, aet. 75; and Mr. Comer the 23d of May following, before he had compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his 30th year. But how much did he do in a little time! A decline immediately followed, from which neither of thoſe churches have ſully return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day; though the firſt of them has lately done ſo in a great meaſure. On September 16, 1735, a Baptiſt church was conſtituted at Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and September 28, 1737, Benj. Marſh and Thomas Green were ordained joint paſtors of it. The former was from Salem, and the latter from Malden; being an early planter in Leiceſter.

               <p>MR. Jeremiah Condy, who took his firſt degree at Harvard college in 1726, after preaching a while in this country, went over to England; but he was now ſent for from thence, and was ordained paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Boſton, February 14, 1739. The third Baptiſt church in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut was conſtituted and origanized the ſame year in Wallingford. By reading Delaune's plea for the nonconformiſts, and other means, a number of people there were brought to embrace their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and joined to the Baptiſt church in New-London;
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:018336_0141_0FA5D251B4CE8248"/>but ordinarily met for worſhip at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, from 1731 till they had a regular diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on Auguſt 20, 1739; and after being formed into a diſtinct church, ordained Mr. John Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riman for their paſtor. Mr. Edward Upham, of Malden, ſon to a member of the Baptiſt church in Boſton, took his firſt degree at Harvard college in 1734; and after preaching at Springfield about two years, a church was conſtituted there October 14, 1740, and the next day he was ordained their paſtor, by the aſſiſtance of Mr. Condy, and Mr. John Callender.</p>
               <p>THE exempting law for Baptiſts had again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and their church in Rehoboth, being afraid of further trouble, requeſted the town to vote them clear. This was conſidered of at a town-meeting January 24, 1740, when it was declared that they could not lawfully do it; yet at another meeting February 13, they voted, "That they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant or agree upon a ſalary for the miniſter of the Baptiſt church the preſent year, in caſe the ſaid elder will accept thereof." For this they had no more law than the other, and it was evidently done to enſnare them if poſſible. In May following ſaid exempting law was revived, to continue ſeven years.</p>

               <p n="1">I. A VERY great change is before us, which ſome have called the great reformation, and others great confuſion; which diverſity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is no new thing. Concerning the founder of Chriſtianity, <hi>ſome ſaid he is a good man; others ſaid, nay, but he deceiveth the people.</hi> In 1680 a ſermon was delivered before the corporation of the city of London, wherein the diſſenters were accuſed of obſtructing the cauſe of reformation, becauſe they would not conform to the national worſhip; and recourſe was had to the ſeverities, of Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts in New-England, againſt the Baptiſts and others, to juſtify the ſeverities that were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards diſſenters in England. Therefore Dr. Owen publiſhed a book in 1681, wherein he obſerves, that all the reformation that has taken place ſince the riſe of Antichriſt, was produced en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely by theſe three principles, viz. taking the holy ſcriptures as their only perfect rule in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters; allowing each rational perſon to
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:018336_0143_0FA5D252F0E50B48"/>judge of their meaning for himſelf; and holding that all the power of office and government in the church of Chriſt is derived from him, by his word and Spirit, to each particular church, and not by a local ſucceſſion from any other power in the world. And ſo far as any have declined from this laſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he aſſures us that therein they have rejected a main reaſon of ſeparation from the church of Rome<note n="*" place="bottom">Original of evangelical churches. p. 291—297.</note>. If ſo, then New-England was involved at this time in <hi>darkneſs that might be felt.</hi> Very few of the common people had any idea, that a perſon could have a right to the goſpel miniſtry without a degree from college, any more than the Iſraelites could to the prieſthood, who were not of the ſeed of Aaron. And ſo great and good a man as Mr. Jonathan Edwards warned miniſters againſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over this line; even in the ſame book wherein he ſays, "It has certainly ſometimes been ſo with our colleges, that inſtead of being places of the greateſt advantage for true piety, one cannot ſend a child thither, without great danger of his being infected as to his morals.<note n="†" place="bottom">Edwards's thoughts, 1742. p. 266, 350.</note>." A profeſſor and a tutor of Harvard college, a little before this time, were convicted of groſs <hi>immoralities</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Hobby's defence of Whitefield, p. 20.</note>. And in 1738 a miniſter at Eaſtham, on Cape-Cod, was depoſed from his office for heterodoxy in principles; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected others who were of his ſentiments ſo much, that Dr. Charles Chauncy publiſhed a ſermon upon liberty of conſcience in 1739. And on June 9, 1740, he met with ten other miniſters at Salem, and ſigned a paper in favour of that depoſed miniſter; who owned to the world, that his belief was, "That men can do that, upon the doing of which they ſhall
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:018336_0144_0FA5D2539F7B1118"/>certainly be ſaved; and that men's obedience is a cauſe of their juſtification<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſborn's letter to the Convention at Boſton, July 7, 1743. p. 6, 23.</note>." And a miniſter of the capital town in New-Hampſhire ſays of the ſtate of the churches at this time, "No ſerious Chriſtian could behold it without a heavy heart, and ſcarce without a weeping eye; to ſee the ſolid ſubſtantial piety, for which our anceſtors were juſtly renowned, having long languiſhed under ſore decays, brought ſo low, and ſeemingly juſt ready to expire and give up the ghoſt.

               <p n="2">II. BUT God ever works like himſelf, even ſo as to demonſtrate to all, that our help is in him, and not in any arm of fleſh. Mr. Stoddard's doctrine had greatly prevailed in this country before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, February 11, 1729. His grandſon Edward was ſettled a colleague with him two years before;
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:018336_0145_0FA5D2545762B5A8"/>who has ſince been a chief inſtrument of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our times. A revival of religion began under his miniſtry, near the cloſe of 1733, which aroſe to ſuch an heighth in the ſpring of 1735, that he entertained hopes of about thirty conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among his people in a week, for ſix weeks together; ſo that ſcarce a grown perſon in the place remained unaffected, and many children were effectually called. Our elder Clark of Wilbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham dates his converſion there, at that time, when about twelve years old. This work was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſeveral adjacent towns; and they had a leſs degree of it in a number of towns in Connecticut. Edwards's narrative of that work was much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in London, where a preface was wrote to it, by Dr. Watts and Dr Guyſe.

After his return to Boſton, he went up an hundred miles weſtward to Northampton, to viſit our excellent Edwards; and from thence down by Hartford to New-Haven, and away through the ſouthern Colonies, until he embarked from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware Bay, December 1; when he ſaid, "O my ſoul, look back with gratitude on what the Lord hath done for thee in this excurſion. I think it is the ſeventy-fifth day ſince I arrived at Rhode-Iſland. My body was then weak, but the Lord has much renewed its ſtrength.

In their preaching, both of them laid open the dreadful evil and danger of hypocriſy as well as prophaneneſs, and ſpake as plainly againſt uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted teachers and profeſſors as any other ſort of ſinners, and the effects were exceeding great and happy.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. SOME indeed tried to perſuade the world, that the great change then made in the land was chiefly owing to the mechanical influence of their terrible words, geſtures, and moving ways of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Dr. Chauncy took much pains to put this colour upon things. But Mr. Thomas Prince ſays, "As to Mr. Whitefield's preaching, it was, in the manner, moving, earneſt, winning and melting; but the mechanical influence of this, according to the uſual operation of mechanical powers, in two or three days expired, with many in two or three hours; and I believe with moſt as ſoon as the ſound was over, or they got out of the houſe, or in the firſt converſation they fell into.

Of Mr. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Mr. Prince ſays, "In private converſe with him, I found him to be a man of conſiderable parts and learning; free, gentle and condeſcending; and from his own various experience, reading the moſt noted writers on experimental divinity, as well as
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:018336_0148_0FA5D256A2473520"/>the ſcriptures, and converſing with many who had been awakened by his miniſtry in New-Jerſey, where he then lived, he ſeemed to have as deep an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the experimental part of religion as any I have converſed with; and his preaching was as ſearching and rouſing as ever I heard. He ſeemed to have no regard to pleaſe the eyes of his hearers with agreeable geſtures, nor their ears with delivery, nor their fancy with language; but to aim directly at their hearts and conſciences, to lay open their ruinous deluſions, ſhew them their numerous, ſecret, hypocritical ſhifts in religion, and drive them out of every deceitful refuge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they made themſelves eaſy, with a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs without the power<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 384—387.</note>."</p>
               <p n="5">V. MARCH 2, 1741, Mr. Tennent preached his farewell ſermon at Boſton, and came round by Plymouth, Middleborough, Bridgewater, Taunton, Newport and Providence, and ſo returned home through Connecticut; in all which places his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours had ſome good effect. Religion was much revived in Boſton, Northampton, and places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, in the fall and winter. In February and March, it was ſo in New-Haven, Hebron, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon-Crank. At their general election in May, Mr. Jedidiah Mills preached in a powerful manner at Hartford, from whence his fame ſpread exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. Proceeding eaſtward in his labours, Dr. Benjamin Lord, of Norwich, hearing when he was to preach at Lebanon, ventured to appoint a lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for him in his own pulpit on Tueſday, June 2; but Mr. Mills was otherways engaged, and Mr. Wheelock came and preached it; and Mr. Mills came and preached there twice the Friday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe were the firſt that I heard of thoſe iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:018336_0149_0FA5D2575647F2F0"/>miniſters. Such darkneſs had prevailed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and many ſpake ſo freely of the light they now received, that the name of NEWLIGHTS was ſoon can upon them. But an old ſaint, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted under Mr. Flavel's miniſtry in England, but now lived at our Norwich, being aſked what ſhe thought of them? readily replied, "Newlights! It is new to ſuch as never ſaw it before; but it is what I knew above fifty years ago." The work prevailed very powerfully in Norwich through the ſummer. In Auguſt Mr. James Devenport from Long-Iſland came there, where Mr. Eleazer Wheelock and Mr. Benjamin Pomroy met him, and they laboured inceſſantly for three days, and a great reformation was wrought in the town; and in this and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year, that glorious work of divine grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, in a greater or leſs degree, in moſt parts of New-England, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, and many other places. A meaſure of it was granted to the Baptiſts in Boſton, Leiceſter, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Newport<note n="*" place="bottom">Betwixt March and Auguſt, 1741, forty-eight perſons were baptized, and joined to the ſecond church in Newport.</note>, Gorton and Wallingford; but as the work was begun and carried on almoſt wholly by Pedobaptiſts, from which denomination their fathers had ſuffered much, moſt of the Baptiſts were prejudiced againſt the work, and againſt the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian doctrine by which it was promoted. Though I find that Elder Robert Feke, of Oyſterbay, on Long-Iſland, wrote to his brethren in Newport, November 29, 1741, and ſaid, "God has begun a glorious work among us, and I hope he will carry it on. There have been ſeventeen added to our little band in about three months." And the work was powerful among the Baptiſts in New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania.</p>

VI. ALL allow that many imperfections attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this revival of religion; but the great difficulty has been to determine what they were, ſo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage what was right, and to guard againſt all that was not ſo. Mr. Edwards delivered a ſermon upon this ſubject at New-Haven, in September, 1741, which he enlarged and publiſhed, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face by Mr. William Cooper, of Boſton; and it cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated through the nation, and was much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But an anonymous anſwer to it was publiſhed at Boſton<note n="*" place="bottom">This anſwer was commended, it not wrote, by Dr. Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. See Chauncy's thoughts, p. 332.</note>, which condemned Mr. Cooper's ſaying "Some of the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> among men have had thoſe things revealed to them of the Father in heaven, which fleſh and blood doth not teach." This writer ſaid he could not gueſs who they ſhould be. To which it may be replied, that Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hobby, of Reading, one of the eleven ſigners to the paper in favour of Oſborn's Arminianiſm, Mr. Daniel Rogers, a tutor at Harvard college, and a number more of their teachers, freely confeſſed that they were blind guides, until they were ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightened under Mr. Whitefield's preaching. Said writer diſcovered a great diſlike of Cooper's ſaying "Theſe fruits do not grow on <hi>Arminian</hi> ground:" And alſo of What Edwards wrote againſt unregenerate miniſters. As no law could take place in the Maſſachuſetts, without the conſent of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, Preſbyterian miniſters could not carry their power ſo far there as in Connecticut, where the whole power of making laws was in one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, who therefore improved their power in the following manner.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. GOVERNOR Talcot died in October, while their Aſſembly was ſitting, who then elected a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:018336_0151_0FA5D258F1CB2D58"/>ſcholar in his ſtead, who was ſtrongly attached to their Saybrook eſtabliſhment. And, by an order from their legiſlature, a general Conſociation from all the counties of that Colony met at Guilford, November 24, and drew up ſundry reſolves; in one of which they ſay, "That for a miniſter to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another miniſter's pariſh, and preach or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſeals of the covenant, without the conſent of or in oppoſition to the ſettled miniſter of the pariſh, is <hi>diſorderly.</hi>" Mr. Robbins of Branford had done ſo at New-Haven before, for which other miniſters had reproved him, and he had made ſome conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to them therefor. In December he received a written requeſt from the Baptiſt miniſter in Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, informing him, that Dr. Bellamy had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſociety to mutual ſatisfaction, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would come and do the like. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt appeared agreeable, and he appointed a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the purpoſe, January 6, 1742. But, two days before the time, a deacon from Wallingford brought him two letters, the one ſigned by forty-two men of that town, the other ſigned by Jacob Hemenway and Iſaac Stiles, miniſters who lived by the way, requeſting him not to go and preach to thoſe Baptiſts, without giving any reaſon againſt it, but only their deſire. This did not appear to him a ſufficient reaſon for him to violate his promiſe, and to diſappoint a people who were deſirous of hearing the goſpel. He therefore went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſermons there, with an evident good effect. Yet for ſo doing he was complained of as a <hi>diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> perſon, to the Conſociation of New-Haven county, in their meeting of February 9. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired wherein the diſorder lay, ſeeing he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a particular ſociety, at the written requeſt of their paſtor? It was anſwered, that ſaid ſociety was
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:018336_0152_0FA5D259A17C2C90"/>not a lawful ſociety, but a diſorderly company. He replied, that Governor Talcot had adviſed Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford collectors not to diſtrain miniſterial taxes from them; and the authority ſent them annual proclamations for faſts and thankſgivings, as to other ſocieties. But as the Conſociation thought themſelves better judges of thoſe matters than civil rulers were, they expelled Robins from their claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal court for preaching to thoſe Baptiſts<note n="*" place="bottom">His narrative, p. 1—6.</note>.

The ſentence was overheard, and carried to the rulers of the college; though the accuſer could not tell who it was againſt. However they extorted this from his friends, and expelled Brainard out of the college juſt about the time that Robins was expelled from their Conſociation<note n="‖" place="bottom">Brainard's life, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And more effectually to guard againſt ſuch diſorders for the future, a draught of a law was made, and miniſters conveyed it into the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at Hartford, in their ſeſſion of May 13; who were not only prevailed with to paſs it, but alſo to direct the heads of their college not to ſuffer any ſcholars therein who refuſed to obey it<note n="‡" place="bottom">See their reaſons for expelling the Cleavelands, in 1744.

The ſecond itinerant miniſter, whom they accuſed of making diviſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances, publiſhed a ſermon this year, which
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:018336_0157_0FA5D2629A4BAC98"/>had an extenſive circulation; wherein he ſays, "The proper cauſe of ſinful diviſions, is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God and holineſs, which is in the hearts of natural men, of every order; being ſtirred up by the devil, and their own proud and ſelfiſh luſts. And very often natural men, who are the proper cauſe of ſuch diviſions, deal with God's ſervants as Potipher's wife did by Joſeph; they lay the blame of their own wickedneſs at their doors, and make a loud cry." And as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk was, that to go over pariſh lines to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was going out of God's way, ſo that if any thought they got good thereby, they were deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Mr. Tennent ſays, "There are three mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ingredients in this objection, namely, a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the queſtion in debate, raſh judging, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of God."

               <p n="1">I. MR. Devenport derived his deſcent from the firſt miniſter of New-Haven, and was ſon of a miniſter of Stamford, in Fairfield county. He and Mr. Daniel Bliſs, a lively mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at Concord, took their firſt degrees at Yale college in 1732, as Mr. Wheelock and Mr. Pomroy did theirs in 1733, and Timothy Allen his in 1736; who all dated their converſions before theſe times. Allen was ordained at Weſt-Haven; but upon uttering ſome unguarded expreſſions, about how unprofitable the ſcriptures were to the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, their Conſociation depoſed him from his office. Devenport was an inſtrument of great awakenings in many places; and no man before him ever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſo good purpoſe as he did, among the Mohegan and Nyantic Indians; from whence alſo ſprang a great work among the Narraganſets<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Commiſſioners at Boſton, for ſending out and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſſionaries among the Indians, ſent Mr. Joſeph Park to Weſterly, upon that buſineſs, in 1733. In 1738 the eaſt part of that town, where the Narraganſets chiefly reſided, was ſet off by the name of Charleſtown. But in nine years, he was not able to bring one Engliſh family, in thoſe two towns, to ſet up family worſhip; nor above a dozen Indians to attend on his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: Until, being greatly enlightened himſelf, by means of thoſe itinerant miniſters, a revival began among his people, and a church of 14 Engliſh members was formed in May, 1742; which was ſucceeded with ſo great a work among the Indians the next year, as brought many of them into that church, and an hundred of them uſually to attend on his miniſtry. <hi>Chriſtian hiſtory,</hi> vol. 1, p. 202—210. Mr. Park died there March 1, 1777.</p>
                     <p>Stephen Babcock, a member of that church, became the paſtor of a Baptiſt church in 1750, and continued ſo until his death in 1775.</p>
                  </note>.
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:018336_0160_0FA5D265141F9C80"/>But having always lived among miniſters who claimed a like power in the Chriſtian church, as the ſeed of Aaron had in that of the Jews; and being deeply ſenſible of the miſchiefs which unconverted teachers do to precious ſouls, he imbibed a ſtrong perſuaſion, that it was his duy to examine the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wherever he came, and to warn the people againſt hearing ſuch as he judged to be blind guides. For theſe things he was taken up and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Connecticut Legiſlature, who ſent him out of their Colony. Separations were hereby cauſed at New-London, New-Haven, and Milford. And it was impreſſed upon ſundry minds, that they muſt <hi>go their way forth,</hi> and erect a <hi>ſhepherd's tent</hi> at New-London, to educate perſons in for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Such a ſchool was therefore opened, to which a number reſorted, wherein Allen preſided. And though he was once impriſoned for preaching, and others ſuffered much, it did but animate them the more. And Devenport muſt needs go and preach to the great metropolis of New-England. Upon his arrival he had long conferences with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Boſton and Charleſtown; until on July 1,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:018336_0161_0FA5D265BAF96598"/>1742, moſt of them ſigned a declaration, wherein they ſaid, "He appears to us to be truly pious, and we hope God has uſed him as an inſtrument of good to many ſouls; yet we judge it our duty to bear teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt the following particulars. 1. His being acted much by ſudden <hi>impulſes.</hi> 2. His judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome miniſters in Long-Iſland and New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be unconverted; and thinking himſelf cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God to <hi>demand</hi> of his brethren, from place to place, and account of their regenerate ſtate, when or in what manner the Holy Spirit wrought upon and renewed them. 3. His going with his friends, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the ſtreets and highways, to and from the houſes of worſhip, on Lord's days and other days<note n="*" place="bottom">In this way of ſinging he was almoſt entirely ſingular, even from thoſe who were otherwiſe engaged with him in the general cauſe.</note>. 4. His encouraging private brethren to pray and exhort in aſſemblies gathered for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. We judge it therefore our preſent duty not to invite him into our places of public worſhip, as otherwiſe we might have readily done." But this did not prevent his going to examine each of them, and then declaring publicly againſt them; naming ſome as unconverted, and comparing others to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat in Ahab's army, and calling the people to ſeparate from them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 406—408.</note>. He proceeded farther eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this way, and upon his return to Boſton in Auguſt he was impriſoned and brought upon trial in Court, for ſlandering their miniſters, but the jury judged him to be <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted him<note n="¶" place="bottom">Chauncy's thoughts, p. 164. 165.</note>. Separations hereupon took place in Boſton, Ipſwich and Newbury. After his return to Long-Iſland, he was brought over to New-London;
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:018336_0162_0FA5D26735A90F80"/>where he and others were carried ſo far, under a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of purging away all error, as to burn a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pile of books, that in their view were erroneous, near the town wharff, on Lord's day, March 6, 1743, juſt as people were returning from public worſhip. Norcott upon baptiſm was caſt into the pile, but was catched out by another hand. The next day, under a conceit of deſtroying idolatry, they collected a large heap of fine cloaths and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, but were hindered from burning of them, partly by a gentleman's coming to Devenport, and aſſuring him, that if all he had idolized muſt be burnt, he muſt burn him firſt.

And they had now got ſo much of it, as emboldened them to appear very openly againſt the work in this land. The annual convention of miniſters at Boſton, May 25, publiſhed their teſtimony upon this ſubject; and eſpecially againſt "The ſpirit and practice of ſeparation, from the particular flocks to which perſons belong, to join with and ſupport <hi>lay-exhorters or itinerants</hi>

This moved ſome friends to the late revival to publiſh an invitation, in the Boſton papers, to all miniſters who had favourable thoughts of that work, to meet there the day after the enſuing commencement at Cambridge, to give their minds concerning it; and ſuch as could not well come, were deſired to ſend in their thoughts in writing. In anſwer to
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:018336_0163_0FA5D2682E49F5D8"/>this requeſt, about ninety miniſters met at Boſton, July 7, and elected a committee, to draw, up a teſtimony and letter of advice to the churches, to be laid before them next morning. But twenty of them went off, and did not ſtay to hear it. Of thoſe who ſtayed, forty-four ſigned it without reſerve; wherein they teſtify, that a glorious work of divine grace had been wrought in this land, in the three preceding years; but adviſe, "That <hi>laymen</hi> do not invade the miniſterial office, and, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of exhorting, ſet up preaching; which (ſay they) is very contrary to goſpel order, and tends to introduce errors and confuſion into the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. That miniſters do not invade the province of others, and, <hi>in ordinary caſes,</hi> preach in another's pariſh without his knowledge, and againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent." Fifteen more ſigned it, with an exception in theſe words, viz. "We concur with the teſtimony, for the ſubſtance of it, excepting that article of itinerancy, or miniſters and others intruding into other miniſters pariſhes without their conſent, which <hi>great diſorder</hi> we apprehend not ſufficiently teſtified againt therein." At the head of theſe was Dr. Colman; who twelve years before called it a fret of zeal, and a narrow party ſpirit, in the apoſtle John, to deſire our Saviour himſelf to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid others, becauſe, ſaid John, <hi>they follow not us.</hi> The other ſigners to this exception were Checkley and Eliot of Boſton, Fowle of Hingham, Baxter of Medfield, Carpenter of Hull, Bradſtreet of Marblehead, Abbot and Prentice of Charleſtown, Turell of Medford, Dorr of Mendon, Parkman of Weſtborough, Eells of Scituate, Baſs of Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Maccarty of Kingſton. On the other hand, nine miniſters were ſenſible that <hi>in many caſes</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters might preach in the pariſhes of others without
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:018336_0164_0FA5D2690EEFD270"/>their conſent, and that, "This liberty cannot be invaded or denied, without inhumanly invading the <hi>eſſential rights of conſcience.</hi>" Theſe were Sewall and Prince of Boſton, Diman of Salem, Chipman of Beverly, Emerſon of Topsfield, Emerſon of Malden, Goddard of Spencer, Weld of Attle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and Cotton of Providence<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſtory, vol 1, p. 155—166, 198.</note> Others were ſo much ſet againſt that liberty, as to procure the publication of the before-cited Connecticut law in a Boſton news-paper<note n="†" place="bottom">Chauncy's thoughts, p. 41.</note> And it was evidently the want of power, that prevented the enacting of ſuch laws in the Maſſachuſetts; notwithſtanding all the obligations they were under to the Hollis family.

               <p n="3">III. MR. James Bound, John Dabny, and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Boucher, from Britain, which John Proctor, a town ſchool-maſter in Boſton, members of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church there, withdrew from it, and began ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church in July; and Mr. Ephraim Bound (ſon to James) was ordained their paſtor, September 7, 1743. The reaſons of their withdraw were becauſe Mr. Condy taught Arminian doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the original principles of the church, and alſo oppoſed the late work of God in the land. Philip Freeman, member of a Baptiſt church in London, came over to Boſton, and joined to that new church; who ſent an account of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and conduct to Dr. John Gill, which obtained his approbation, and a conſiderable preſent was ſent
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:018336_0165_0FA5D2696C9D4B90"/>them from London. The increaſe of the Baptiſts in New-Jerſey ſoon after moved Mr. Jonathan Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon, the firſt Preſident of their college, to write a dialogue upon infant baptiſm. It was printed both at New-York and Boſton in 1746, but without any name to it. Mr. Freeman ſent one of them to Dr. Gill, with a requeſt that he would anſwer it. He did ſo in 1749, and began with theſe words, viz. "Many being converted under the miniſtry of the word in New-England, and enlightened into the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of believers baptiſm, whereby the churches of the Baptiſt perſuaſion at Boſton and in the country have been encreaſed, has alarmed the Pedobaptiſt miniſters of the Colony; who have applied to one Mr. Dickinſon, a country miniſter, who, as my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent informs me, has wrote with ſome ſucceſs againſt the Arminians, to write in favour of infant ſprinkling." In 1752 Mr. Clark (who wrote againſt Walton twenty years before) publiſhed a reply to Gill, wherein he ſaid, "In this introductory paſſage, there are ſeveral groſs miſtakes in fact, or manifeſt <hi>untruths.</hi>" And he takes up above five pages, in trying to prove this charge; thinking, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, that if he could prove him to be a falſe man in his introduction, his book might more eaſily be anſwered, in the opinion of moſt; who generally have <hi>men's perſons in admiration becauſe of advantage.</hi> He allows that Dickinſon wrote againſt the <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and names as ſuch the Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Arminians and Antinomians; not mentioning that himſelf was one of the eleven ſigners of the paper in favour of Oſborn's Arminianiſm in 1740. The proofs for his charge againſt Gill conſiſt in limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his words to the Maſſachuſetts, inſtead of all New-England, and denying any great increaſe of the Baptiſts, ſo as to alarm the miniſters; or that
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:018336_0166_0FA5D26A1BD09718"/>any in or near Boſton ſent to Dickinſon to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject, [which was not affirmed.] But what ſhall we think of Clark? Gill was never here, and therefore might eaſily miſtake the geography of the country; but his accuſer was born and educated in it; and he ſays of that new church, "They have ſet up an illiterate teacher. To this ſeparate ſociety there have been, indeed, ſome few enthuſiaſts and ſeparatiſts from ſome churches in Boſton, and from the adjacent parts of the country, who have joined themſelves.—Beſides—I know of no other Baptiſt church, except at the out-ſkirts of the Province to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Rhode-Iſland and Providence, where I am informed there are two or three ſocieties that call themſelves Baptiſt churches<note n="*" place="bottom">Clark againſt Gill, p. 1—6.</note> Whereas, at the time when he wrote thus, there were two Baptiſt churches in Boſton, two in Swanzey, two in Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and one in each of the towns of Bellingham, Sutton, Leiceſter, Sturbridge, Brimfield and Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. And how guilty muſt a man be, thus to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the ſtate of his own Province, in order to fix an odium upon a gentleman who never was in it! He unjuſtly accuſed him of holding conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be to a particular ſect; but how many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful names does himſelf caſt upon diſſenters from his own ſect? Arminians is one of thoſe names; whereas the largeſt addition to ſaid church in Boſton, that they had received from any one town in the country, was of a number of judicious Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in Medfield, who refuſed to join in the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Arminian miniſter there, who has ſince been forced to reſign his office, becauſe of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child by his maid. After the great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake November 18, 1755, Mr. Bound's lectures were flocked to from all parts of the town; and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:018336_0167_0FA5D26B0CC804B8"/>ſuch a bleſſing was granted upon his miniſtry, that they had an hundred communicants in that church. His life was unblemiſhed and exemplary, until he died with great peace in his own ſoul, and much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by others, June 18, 1765.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. IN 1742, Mr. Edwards publiſhed his thoughts, in five parts; ſhewing that the work going on in the land was a glorious work of God; the duty of all to acknowledge and promote it, and the great danger of the contrary; wherein its friends had been injuriouſly blamed; what ought to be corrected among them, and what poſitively ought to be done to promote the work. Upon a view of which Dr. Chauncy ſet off and travelled through New-England, New-York and New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, to collect matter for an anſwer to him, which was publiſhed this year, with the names of three Governors, two Lieut. Governors, many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, and in all above ſeven hundred men as ſubſcribers for it. Above 300 pages in the book are taken up upon things that he ſaid were of a bad and dangerous tendency in the land. He ranks them under eight heads, namely, itinerant preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great terrors, ſudden light and joy, cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, impulſes, confounding of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes together, and a ſpirit of error. Under which laſt head, eight particulars are named, viz. Holding that unconverted miniſters could not convert others, ſeparations, preſumptuous depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, aſſurance of converſion, and of the time of it, vilifying good works, and not allowing ſanctification to be an evidence of juſtification.

A touch upon what he ſays, about itinerant preaching, and raſh judging, may give ſome idea how ſtrong his arguments were.— Againſt the former he brings 2 Theſ. iii. 10-15, 1 Pet. iv. 15, and 2 Cor. x. 12-17; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the eating of other men's bread for naught, acting as buſy-bodies in other men's matters, and the commending of themſelves, and going into another man's line, of things made ready to our hands. But by whom is this line drawn? by God or man?

According to Chauncy, raſh and uncharitable judging was begun in theſe parts by Mr. Whitefield, "Who ſeldom preached, but he had ſomething or other in his ſermon againſt unconverted miniſters." And why was this uncharitable? Becauſe Dr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Mather ſaid, "No man becomes a miniſter or a communicant in our churches, until he hath been ſeverely examined about his <hi>regeneration,</hi> as well as converſation<note n="*" place="bottom">

Col. Hezekiah Huntington had been a member of their Council for three years; but at their election at Hartford, May 12, he was left out of it; and John Bulkley, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was choſen in his ſtead, who ſent Zebulon Waterman and others, of Colcheſter, to Hartford gaol the ſummer before, for teaching and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a religious meeting. Waterman was ſoon after ordained the paſtor of a Baptiſt church in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter. It was well known that Huntington was much engaged in the late revival of religion in the land, and that he openly teſtified againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions therein. King William's act of toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was adopted in Connecticut, in May, 1708, juſt before their Saybrook ſcheme was formed. But becauſe it had been extended, by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Court, to the diſſenters in New-Haven and Milford, it was now repealed, with a declaration, "That thoſe commonly called Preſbyterians or Congregationaliſts ſhall not take benefit of ſaid law." And it was enacted, that none of other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations ſhould, for the future, be allowed the privileges of diſſenters, but ſuch as ſhould "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſſembly take the oaths and ſubſcribe the

And as Mr. John Owen, of Groton, was complained of, for having in April before preached againſt ſuch proceedings, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was given out to bring him before the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to anſwer therefor, at their next ſeſſion. In the mean time a Preſbyterian miniſter came from New-Jerſey, and preached at Milford; for which he was taken up on a Saturday. And as they ſpake of confining him until Monday, he ſaid, "Sir, I hope you will not confine me from preaching Chriſt." <hi>That is what we took you up for,</hi> ſaid the Judge. He was carried, as a <hi>vagrant</hi> perſon, out of that Colony, but then he returned and preached at New-Haven. And as the people there had got into the way of concealing their miniſters on week days, an officer came and ſeized this miniſter, at their meeting-houſe door, on a Lord's day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and carried him off. Yet when he was let go, he returned again and preached to the people, an account of which being laid before the Aſſembly at New-Haven, of October 13, they added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act, which required miniſters who ſhould ſo return to pay the coſt of their tranſportation, and to be committed until they ſhould give an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds bond, not to offend again in like kind.

Pomroy was brought, and ſtood trial for ſome hours; but was condemned, and ordered to be committed till he would pay the coſts, and bind himſelf for one year, in a recognizance of Fifty Pounds, not to offend again in like manner. He then yielded to their requirements. And on July 28 Mr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport ſigned a retraction of the four articles which were condemned at Boſton, and of his enthuſiaſms at New-London; which was ſent to Mr. Prince to publiſh with all ſpeed. He did ſo, but prefixed thereto an extract from an ancient author, who ſays, "It is no uncommon thing for thoſe who love God in ſincerity, through impatience with the bold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of wicked men, to tranſgreſs the limits of a regular zeal. And when this impatience betrays them into miſtakes, for which they meet with too ſevere treatment, either from friends, or from men in power; inſtead of correcting only the irregular ſallies of their zeal, they are apt to ſuppreſs the moſt regular and laudable expreſſions of it, and become lukewarm and indifferent<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 234—240</note>." The ſequel will demonſtrate the propriety of this remark.</p>
               <p>IN January Elder Timothy Packom and Daniel Greene viſited their Baptiſt brethren at New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Saybrook, and baptized ſome perſons at each place. At Saybrook the people laid ſome things acroſs a ſtream on a Lord's day, to raiſe the water to baptize in. Falſe charges were added to what was fact in the caſe; and ſaid two teachers, and ſeveral other perſons, were ſeized and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at New London; one of whom was a woman with a child at her breaſt. But the above evils were well expoſed in a piece, intituled, <hi>The eſſential rights of Proteſtants;</hi> dated March 30, 1744. Col. Eliſha
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:018336_0172_0FA5D26F746D3BF0"/>Williams, the beſt Preſident they ever had at Yale college, was the undoubted author of it; though being printed at Boſton, it was ſent as a letter from thence to a friend in Connecticut. Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the origin, deſign and limits of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſays, "Man by his conſtitution, as he in a reaſonable being, capable of the knowledge of his MAKER, is a moral and accountable being; and therefore, as every one is accountable for himſelf, he muſt reaſon, judge and determine for himſelf. That faith and practice which depend on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and choice of any other perſon, and not on the perſon's own judgment and choice, may paſs for religion in the ſynagogue of Satan, whoſe tenet is that ignorance is the mother of devotion; but with no underſtanding Proteſtant will it paſs for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all.—Eccleſiaſtical officers, as they are Chriſt's officers, they have authority to teach men this have no authority to teach men any thing but the mind and will of Chriſt. It is a truth that ſhines with a meridian brightneſs, that whatever is not contained in a commiſſion, is out of it and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by it; and the teaching <hi>his laws only</hi> being contained in the commiſſion, what is not his law is out of it, and by that commiſſion they are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from teaching it, or forbid by it<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſential rights, p. 8, 17.</note>." And from hence he plainly expoſed their perſecuting laws and meaſures. But though this was printed at Boſton, and diſperſed in Connecticut, yet the ruling party had no eyes to ſee it, nor ears to hear it. We muſt maintain the <hi>good old way,</hi> was their cry, although what they ſo called was diametrically oppoſite to the firſt principles of New-England. And though for reaſons before given the Maſſachuſetts could

                  </gap>eir diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is conſpicuous in what follows.</p>
               <p>MR. Peter Thatcher was the third miniſter of Middleborough, where he began to preach in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1707, and he continued their paſtor until his joyful exit, April 22, 1744. He was much affected with Mr. Tennent's preaching in theſe parts, and laboured earneſtly for a reformation among his people, but with much ſorrow of heart, until ſuch a bleſſing was granted at a meeting, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 23, 1741, that about an hundred perſons, profeſſors and others, were greatly awakened; and the enſuing harveſt was ſo great, that when he died they had three hundred and forty-three communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants above half of whom were males<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtian hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 77—79.</note> The church met ſoon after, and elected a committee to manage their affairs, and in particular to provide preaching for them; but the pariſh committee, who were men of influence in the town<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Jacob Thompſon, Benjamin White, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Capt. Ebenezer Morton.</note>, were very oppoſite to the late work among them, and they counteracted the church in that matter. And when the church had voted to hear Mr. Silvanus Conant four ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon probation, they went and got another man to ſupply the pulpit the ſame days, the firſt of which was September 9; when Conant was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach in the afternoon. But on September 13 they received the following advice from a Council at Duxbury, viz. "That though it belongs to the church to lead the congregation in the choice and call of a miniſter to office, that it is the right, as it has been the cuſtom of the ſeveral pariſhes (when deſtitute of a miniſter) to apply, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee choſen by the whole pariſh, to ſuch perſon
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:018336_0174_0FA5D27115CCE308"/>or perſons as ſhall be recommended to them for that purpoſe; and we adviſe the gentlemen, and all concerned, to follow this laudable cuſtom." The miniſters who gave this advice were Eels of Scituate, Gay of Hingham, Lewis of Pembroke, Baſs of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Perkins and Angier of Bridgewater<note n="*" place="bottom">Morton againſt Cotton, p. 14, 15.</note> And by theſe means the body of the church were ſhut out of their meeting-houſe, with the miniſter they choſe; and had no better place than a barn to meet in, until they built another houſe. And leſs than a quarter of the church called themſelves the ſtanding part, held the old houſe, and went on and ſettled another miniſter. Mr. Conant was ordained, according to their laws, by the advice of a Council of five churches, March 28, 1745, and miniſtered there to good purpoſe, until his deceaſe, December 7, 1777. Mr. John Cotton, then of Halifax, now of Plymouth, publiſhed a narrative of theſe tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to which a virulent anſwer was returned; both in 1746. Judge Oliver was of that oppoſing party; and he and others had ſuch influence at Boſton, that the church could not have any proper hearing there for about four years. But when that was once granted, end every man in the pariſh had liberty to chooſe for himſelf, and each to ſupport the miniſter he choſe, the oppoſers were ſoon ſick of their miniſter, and in leſs than ten years he was diſmiſſed, and their ſociety was ſoon after diſſolved; leaving a loud warning to all againſt empowering the world to controul the church about ſoul-guides.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BY whom ſhall Jacob ariſe, for he is ſmall? ſaith one prophet. Jeruſalem hath none of her ſons to guide her, ſaith another. And how much was this the caſe with New-England in 1744? Although ſome of their miniſters had been alive in religion, and had done a great deal to promote the power of it; yet they were agreed with formaliſts in confining the miniſtry to a college education and in having of it ſupported by tax and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; therefore none of them could now lead the church out of her Egyptian bondage. And where could ſuch a leader be found? Could any man think of looking to the barren ſhores of Cape-Cod for his birth, to the obſcure village of Canterbury for his education, or to a bench of lawyers for his
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:018336_0176_0FA5D2728B92E018"/>integrity and faithfulneſs? Of all things this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt unlikely! Yet ſuch was the event. Mr. Eliſha Paine, of Eaſham, upon ſaid Cape, removed with his family to Canterbury, and was one of the ſeven men who formed a church there, June 13, 1711. His wife was of the family of Deacon John Doane<note n="*" place="bottom">His daughter Abigail married a Lothrop in Norwich, where ſhe was much eſteemed, both for her capacity and her piety, until her death in 1735, aet. 104.</note>, one of the early magiſtrates of Plymouth Colony. Mr. Paine had four ſons, whom he brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The ſecond of them dated his coverſion about the time of the revival of religion at Windham in 1721, and before the general revival, twenty years after he was become one of the greateſt lawyers in Connecticut, and was in very proſperous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the world: In one of his private papers he ſays, "God hath ſo ordered it in his Providence, that ever ſince I was a child I have had an enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind after knowledge, of almoſt all ſorts; but religion bore the ſway. I ſeemed to have a regard for good men, and therefore took great care to watch perſons, eſpecially to ſee how they kept the ſabbath. Before my converſion I had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to hear all the different worſhips in New-England, and enquired into their principles, and obſerved their behaviour, both in and out of their worſhip. And I ſaw ſo little, or rather nothing of the power of godlineſs in any of them, that I was then even in my carnal eſtate, afraid that the true religion was not in this land. Yet worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the form which was moſt acknowledged, would ſoon make me eaſy again. But when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction came to lay hold of me, let who would be of the true religion, I ſaw mine was of no value." In July, 1742, he received an internal call to preach
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018336_0177_0FA5D27323CED6F0"/>the goſpel, and in December following he offered himſelf for examination before ſome pious mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and they gave him encouragement about en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into that work, but wore for his doing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Say brook plan, which he never liked. The church he belonged to had been deſtitute of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor near two years, when they met on January 27, 1743, and declared by vote, "That the platform of church diſcipline agreed upon by the Synod at Cambridge, in 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is moſt agreeable to the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſigned practice of this church, excepting their having ruling elders as diſtinct officers, and moſt agreeable to the ſcriptures;" though they did not withdraw their fellowſhip from the conſociated churches. Soon after this Mr. Paine ſet out upon a journey; but for preaching the goſpel in Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, which then belonged to the Maſſachuſetts, he was ſeized on February 19, by virtue of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from John Chandler, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of that town, and was impriſoned at Worceſter.</p>
               <p n="2">II. BUT his bonds proved to be for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the goſpel, and he preached it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in priſon.

THIS Mr. Moſely ſent to him in a letter, wherein he ſaid, "Dear Sir, ſtand faſt in the faith; be ſtrong. They that be with you are more than they that be with our adverſaries. Never think it hard to ſuffer for Chriſt. It is enough for the ſervant that he be as his Lord."—Yet the next year all theſe men were overpowered by the enemy, ſo as to turn and act againſt him, in the great cauſe of reformation. On May 13 Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter Court were conſtrained to give him a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, as having been impriſoned without law; and he went round and preached the goſpel in the adjacent towns for a fortnight, and then returned home. July 8 he ſet off again, and travelled to Providence, Briſtol, Boſton, Cambridge, and as far northward as Dunſtable and Lancaſter, preaching the goſpel with great power; and returned home December 3, having, according to a journal he kept, preached two hundred and forty-four ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in that journey. And hearing of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures many were then purſuing, under a pretence of promoting peace and good order, he ſaid, "Let me ſpeak freely of the peace that Connecticut was in. For theſe forty years we have had the name of a contentious people in the law. This was ſo cuſtomary, that to ſue a man for debt was become not much more than a compliment. And ſcarce a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe has been ſet up for many years, without ſundry petitions to the Aſſembly; with great heats animoſity, party againſt party, not in love, as is too well known to be denied." And yet by their laws it was Forty Pounds fine for any people to ſet up a meeting-houſe without leave from Court. And, referring to what Daniel ſays of thoſe who ſhall be <hi>corrupted by flatteries,</hi> he ſaid of this time, "I verily believe they know not what they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:018336_0179_0FA5D2756972D700"/>for they ſeem to be zealous to maintain peace, but take the direct way to break it. Chriſt is a peaceable Prince, and Prince of peace; and if there was nothing in the way of his kingdom, it would be as peaceable here as it is in heaven. The Spirit is compared to water; water maketh no noiſe unleſs it is interrupted; ſo is the ſpirit of Chriſt." In June, 1744, he went and laboured with ſucceſs in his native country of Cape-Cod, from whence ſprang the Baptiſt church in Harwich.</p>
               <p n="3">III. UPON his return a diviſion took place in Canterbury in the following manner. The pariſh had called a candidate there to preach, whom moſt of the church were not edified by. In Auguſt a committee of their Aſſociation met there, at the call of the pariſh, to give advice in the caſe. Mr. Paine was requeſted to give them his objections againſt ſaid candidate, but he refuſed, becauſe they were not called there by the church. Another member gave them a copy of their church vote againſt him; which the miniſters in their reſult ſaid "Was ſigned in behalf of the <hi>aggrieved part</hi> of the church;" and adviſed the pariſh to go on and ſettle their candidate. For this Paine, on September 12, wrote a ſmart reproof to one of thoſe miniſters, for wronging the truth, in calling that an aggrieved part, which was the church; and for encouraging the world to uſurp ſuch a power over the church of Chriſt. Hereupon he was diſciplined by the ſecular arm. Their charge, his plea, and their judgment thereon, were as follow. Their charge was,</p>

               <p n="6">VI. FOR theſe reaſons Mr. Paine's two nephews, John and Ebenezer Cleaveland, were expelled from college; and three years after the eldeſt of them was ſettled at Ipſwich, and the other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at Cape-Ann. Paine was repeatedly cited to appear before the miniſters of that county, to anſwer to complaints they received againſt him; but he knew their way too well to be drawn into their trap. Twelve of them met November 13, and drew up a paper againſt him and his brethren, and publiſhed it in a news-paper. December 11, a larger number met, and publiſhed a pamphlet, as a letter from them to their ſeveral ſocieties, which at the foot p. 52 is ſigned by Joſeph Coite, Ebenezer Williams, Joſeph Meacham, Samuel Dorrance, Solomon Williams, Jacob Eliot, Marſton Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, Samuel Moſeley, Ephraim Avery, Ebenezer Devotion, Eleazer Wheelock, Abel Stiles, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen White, John Baſs, Richard Salter, William Throope. A ſingle paſſage therein will give a
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:018336_0184_0FA5D27E35CECBA8"/>plain idea of the nature of their controverſy. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quoted Deut. xiii. 1-3, as a warning to the people againſt hearing Mr. Paine and his brethren, they ſay, "The caſe here ſuppoſed is an attempt to draw the people to idolatry; and this you will ſay is not your caſe. Theſe prophets and dreamers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to draw you to Chriſt, and not from him: But then they endeavour to draw you from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, to a way of worſhip which he has not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. Though the caſe is not ſo ſtrong, yet the argument againſt your compliance is the ſame; for whatſoever worſhip God has not inſtituted and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his word, is falſe worſhip, and therefore if there ſeem to be never ſo many appearances of God's power attending it, you may not go after, any more than after falſe god.<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſociation letter, p. 43.</note>." Now obſerve, Chriſt ſays concerning the field, which is the world, <hi>let both grow together until the harveſt.</hi> While he ſays to the church, <hi>put away from among yourſelves that wicked perſon.</hi> In agreement herewith Mr. Paine applied the firſt of theſe precepts to the <hi>State,</hi> and ſaid, "<hi>The church</hi> is to caſt her tares out, <hi>when they appear,</hi> or the whole church is leavened.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 10.</note>." But they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted him; and calling the field the viſible church, aſſerted that Chriſt would not let the ſervants "Go and root up the tares, even <hi>when they appeared.</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 21.</note>." Thus thoſe who uſe ſecular force in religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, violate the divine command both ways; they obſtruct diſcipline in the church, and invade the rights of conſcience and humanity in the State. This was remarkably verified in Canterbury: For November 27 their church met, and ſixteen males againſt twenty-three joined with the pariſh in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Conſociation to ordain Mr. James
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:018336_0185_0FA5D27E5C3684D8"/>Cogſwell there; and the Conſociation met for that purpoſe December 26, but not having the majority of the church for him, they could not get along ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own laws. At length they called the pariſh together, and got them to declare, by vote, their willingneſs that the Aſſembly ſhould ſet off thoſe who did not chooſe him from ſupporting him; "And that they <hi>may have</hi> all legal privileges of a diſtinct and religious ſociety;" and ſo went on and ordained him. Which proceeding an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for them in 1771 called judicious, cautious, and gentle<note n="*" place="bottom">Fiſh's examiner examined, p. 76.</note> Yet thereby the firſt church in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury was ſtripped of all <hi>legal privileges</hi> of a diſtinct religious ſociety; and becauſe they deſired no new incorporation from the Aſſembly, but only petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be exempted from ſupporting a teacher they never choſe, their petition was diſregarded, their goods were torn away, or their perſons impriſoned therefor, for fifteen years; and the miniſters who ordained him diſcovered no more compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, than the prieſt and Levite did to the man that fell among thieves. This is the plain truth, without any exaggeration.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. NEW-ENGLAND now received a ſecond viſit from Mr. Whitefield, who came over in a maſt-ſhip, and landed at York, November 2. But how were miniſters alarmed at the news! His firſt coming cauſed a great ſhaking among the dry bones; what then could they look for in the preſent ſtate of the churches? An oppoſing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Plymouth, diſliking the preaching of the pious Mr. Leonard, had formed a new church there, and Dr. Chauncy preached at the inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their miniſter, five days after Whitefield landed; when Chauncy ſaid, "I beſeech my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:018336_0186_0FA5D27F25B84BB8"/>and brethren in the miniſtry to <hi>mark this man</hi> who has cauſed diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid him. Turn your view, my brethren, into all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the land: Behold the confuſion in towns: the contentions in churches!—Perhaps it will be ſaid, theſe miſchievous things are only accidental effects, and not to be charged upon him. So far from it, that they are the unavoidable conſequence of <hi>that ſpirit</hi> in which he appeared<note n="‖" place="bottom">Sermon at Friends inſtalment. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8</note>." This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth; and the reader may judge of the nature of that ſpirit, by the foregoing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing facts. For the heads of Harvard college ſoon publiſhed a teſtimony againſt Whitefield, which was followed with another, by an Aſſociation of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters at Weymouth, January 15, 1745; and a third by an Aſſociation at Marlborough, the 22d. The like was done by many other collective bodies, and by individuals. And much pains were taken to perſuade the world, that he was a diſhoneſt man, eſpecially becauſe of his ſaying ſo much as he had done againſt unconverted miniſters, while himſelf was a miniſter of the church of England. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of anſwers were returned, by himſelf and others; ſome of which we have mentioned under the year 1740. On May 28; 1741, the Preſident of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard college delivered a ſermon before the annual Convention of miniſters at Boſton; when referring to Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Tennent he ſaid, "Thoſe two pious and valuable men of God, who have been lately labouring more abundantly among us, have been greatly inſtrumental in the hand of God to revive this bleſſed work: and many, no doubt, have been ſavingly converted from the error of
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:018336_0187_0FA5D27FE86BD6E0"/>their ways, and many more have been in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure rouſed from their lethargy." But being now reminded of this<note n="*" place="bottom">Whitefield's letter to that college, p. 20, 21.</note>, his reply was, "Alas, how was I deluded with ſhow and appearance!" And had he and the college now got free from deluſion? In the eighth page of their teſtimony againſt White-field they ſay, "The believer may have ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he hath the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God with him, in ſo continual and regular a manner, that he may be ſaid to dwell in him, and yet he have <hi>no feeling of it.</hi>" But obſerve, to be <hi>paſt feeling</hi> is the depth of Pagan darkneſs, Eph. iv. 19. And one of the worſt things that was now alledged againſt Mr. Whitefield, was his ſaying their colleges were <hi>in darkneſs that might be felt.</hi> Therefore it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly aſked upon this occaſion, why they need to produce the evidence of their own condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="†" place="bottom">Hobby's defence of Whitefield, p. 23.</note>? The heads of Yale college wrote a private letter to him, and he returned an anſwer, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pamphlets upon the ſubject; but they were not ſatisfied therewith, and therefore publiſhed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration againſt him, dated February 25, 1745, wherein they ſay, "From theſe two principles which you have laid down, viz. that the generality of miniſters are unconverted, and that all unconverted miniſters are ſuch baneful and pernicious men, it naturally and neceſſarily follows, that the people ought to diſcard them, or ſeparate from them.—If theſe two principles are right and true, we are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your deſign is good, and we would readily join with you." But being of a contrary mind, they accuſed him of a deſign of rooting out the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſters of the country, in order to introduce foreigners in their ſtead, and aſſerted that he told
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:018336_0188_0FA5D280AB4116F0"/>Mr. Edwards a ſtory of that nature<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Said declaration,</hi> p. 6—10. The taking to Cape-Breton this year was a very remarkable event. Governor Shirley firſt propoſed the attempt to the Aſſembly at Boſton. By a very ſmall majority they voted to undertake it, and to requeſt aſſiſtance therein from other Colonies, January 25; but the vote was no ſooner paſſed, than a general union appeared in carrying it into effect. And ſuch diſpatch was made, that an army conſiſting of 4060 men, under General Pepperell, rendezvouſed at Canſo, in April, where a ſmall fleet met them, under the command of Sir Peter Warren. The army landed on Cape-Breton April 30, to the great ſurprize of the enemy; and the ſtrong fortreſs of Louiſburg was giver up to them on June 17, 1745. Old Mr. Moody, who went their chaplain, publicly declared a full belief that they ſhould take it, before the army left Boſton. Other went away ſaying, <hi>pray for us, while we fight for you.</hi> That event was a great means of reſtoring peace to Europe, as well as Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</note> This Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards publicly contradicted; neither is there the leaſt evidence ſince of Whitefield's having any ſuch intent. In Auguſt, 1745, I heard him preach at Lebanon, Windham, Norwich, Mohegin and New-London; before which I had never ſeen him. He then ſpake againſt ſeparations; and his plan evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently was, to labour for the converſion and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſouls, and to leave the building and government of churches to others. In 1768 the Corporation of Harvard college, with the ſame Preſident at their head, gave him a letter of thanks for his benefactions thereto.</p>

Mr. Hovey died October 28 follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Mr. Thomas Deniſon was baptized in July, 1743, and was ordained paſtor of a ſmall church at Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the November after; but they diſſolving, he retracted what is called re-baptizing, and had a chief hand in forming this new church at Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; and he laid on hands and gave the charge, in this and ſeveral ſucceeding ordinations. They held the power of ordination to be in the church; but as others have made great noiſe about a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power in miniſters, it is to be obſerved, that Elder Deniſon was ordained by Elder Moulton, and he by Elder John Callender, who was ordained by Elder Eliſha Callender, in whoſe ordination three

And this line was never broken, by any act of cenſuring or depoſing, as was the caſe with diſſenters from Epiſcopacy, and alſo from Popery. With my beloved mother I viſited Mr. Marſh in the ſpring, and found him comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in mind; but his body was cloſely locked up in priſon, while a phyſician, who was put into a room over his head, for giving a ſingle woman a potion to deſtroy the fruit of her womb, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed her own life, was allowed, with an officer to attend him, to viſit the ſick in various parts of the town. How much was this like Barabbas and Jeſus!

IX. THE Conſociation of Windham county had an account of many of theſe things laid before them January 13, 1747; upon which they adjourned to February 11, and ſent citations to the Elders Marſh, the Paines, and Stevens, to return anſwers to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, then received againſt them. In the mean time the Conſociation requeſted their own churches to keep a day of faſting and prayer, for divine direction. When they met again, they inſerted a copy of the Mansfield articles and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their reſult, with objections againſt many parts of it; one of which is in theſe words, viz. "Though moſt of us agree in the article of infant baptiſm, yet a difference in that particular doth not break the ſpiritual communion of ſaints; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no juſt bar to our covenanting and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the ordinances together, wherein we are agreed." This the miniſters objected againſt, as it tended "To let in Anabaptiſts, and ſeems (ſay they) more agreeable to the inclinations of parties than the word of God." And having inſerted many reports and reflections againſt ſaid people, the ſame were publiſhed at Boſton, under the title of "The reſult of a Council of the conſociated churches in the county of Windham, relating to the principles and practices of the ſeveral bodies of people in ſaid county, who have <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the communion of the churches in this land, and ſet up an uninſtituted worſhip among themſelves containing 22 pages in octavo. All their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proceed upon the ſuppoſition, without proof, that theirs were the inſtituted churches; and therefore that to ſeparate from them was a revolt
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:018336_0192_0FA5D283A2FEC550"/>from God, and a rebellion againſt his government in the church. And for teaching and exhorting the prople without their leave, the before named Elder Frothingham was imporiſoned five months, John Paine eleven months, and John Palmer from September, 1747, to January, 1748; all at Hart-ford. Solomon Paine was impriſoned a fortnight for that cauſe at Windham, beſides much more of like nature done to others. And only for being members and deacons in thoſe ſeparate churches, three gentlemen, at different times, were expelled out of their Legiſlature; namely, Capt. Obadiah Johnſon of Canterbury, Capt. Thomas Stevens of Plainfield (father to their miniſter) and Capt. Nathan Jewett of Lyme. But overſtraining their power weakened it; and it now began to decline.</p>
               <p n="10">X. AT the election at Hartford, May 12, 1748, Colonel Huntington was again choſen into their Council, out of which he had been excluded five years<note n="*" place="bottom">He was the 5th ſon of Deacon Chriſtopher Huntington, the firſt Engliſh male that was born in Norwich, after it was planted in 1660. This ſon received an early converſion, ſucceeded his father in the deacon's office, and did much to promote a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the town, in and after 1741. Henceforward, by annual and full elections, he was continued a Counſellor, and for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years the firſt man therein; was Chief Judge of their County Court for twenty years, and a Judge of Probate, until he died in peace, February 10, 1773, aet. 76.</note> And Solomon Paine came to this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with a memorial, ſigned by 330 men; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a repeal of all their laws, which debarred any inhabitants in the Colony from the liberty granted by God and tolerated by the King, or that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof might be forbidden. After long waiting, he had liberty to read and ſpeak to the memorial in the Aſſembly; and though it was then diſmiſſed , yet ſome light was communicated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:018336_0193_0FA5D28457028890"/>In December, 1748, he was proſecuted at Windham Court, for marrying a couple of his own people. His brother came and pleaded his cauſe. The King's Attorney, in pleading againſt Solomon, allowed that he was ordained the paſtor of a church of Chriſt in Canterbury, in as ſolemn a manner as could be; but then pleaded that he was not a civil officer, becauſe not choſen by the majority of the pariſh, which was the thing which made their miniſters civil officers; and he ſaid it was in that capacity that they were ſupported by tax, and had power to marry perſons. And upon this plea the caſe was turned againſt him; and alſo another caſe at the ſame time againſt one of his ſociety, about a tax to a legal miniſter. Hereupon Mr. Eliſha Paine wrote an account of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to other miniſters, to ſhew the abſurdity of their way of profeſſing to be miniſters of Chriſt, and to be ſupported in the name of the King of England, while their conſtitution differed eſſentially from the churches under either of thoſe heads. At the ſame time they met with a great ſhock from another quarter.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. FOR as long as Mr. Robbins continued a regular miniſter, and yet was excluded out of their Conſociation, it ſerved to weaken their power. A complaint was therefore received againſt him, May 31, 1743, ſigned by ſix of his hearers, before he had any notice of who the complainants were, or what they complained of; and a committee of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were appointed to go to him upon it. As ſoon as he diſcovered who the complainants were, he went and gave them ſatisfaction, and they wrote an account of it to ſaid committee; yet they came to him, and inſiſted upon his being reconciled to their Conſociation: This he tried for without ſucceſs.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:018336_0194_0FA5D28519D8A360"/>However, perceiving what ſtorm was gathering, he drew three confeſſions, which he carried to another of their meetings; wherein he went as far as he could towards giving them ſatisfaction, ſhort of confeſſing that he broke the law of God in preaching to thoſe Batiſts, contrary to the deſire of Preſbyterians. But as he could not in conſcience confeſs that, he returned home, without being reconciled to them. On May 29, 1745, a ſecond complaint was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt him, without his having previous notice of it, and another committee was ſent, who prevailed with him to go and offer them a fourth confeſſion; wherein he pleaded that his ignorance of its being a crime to preach to the Baptiſts as he did, might apologize for him, ſo that a reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation might be effected<note n="*" place="bottom">Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"I the ſubſcriber acknowledge, that I am ſorry I preached <hi>diſorderly</hi> at Wallingford, and prayed at the ſeparation at New-Haven, and promiſe not to do ſo again." And only becauſe he refuſed to ſign this, without explaining the word diſorderly, they say, "The man appeared <hi>ſtiff</hi> and <hi>ſelf-willed</hi> to the laſt degree<note n="†" place="bottom">Their anſwer, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Be that as it may, he then went home, and laid the confeſſion they had rejected before his pariſh, who voted it to be ſufficient, and deſired him to continue in the miniſtry with them, and alſo that no Councils nor committees might be ſent there again, without their requeſt.

<pb n="182" facs="unknown:018336_0197_0FA5D28B7AC29270"/>Preſbyterian and Congregational churches formed the Saybrook platform, it became their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary contract; and that being eſtabliſhed by their Legiſlature, it became the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of the whole Colony, as much as their charter, which united the Colonies of Hartford and New-Haven in one, was their civil conſtitution: And that Mr. Robbins and his church had no more right to renounce their juriſdiction, than his pariſh had to renounce the authority of the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Connecticut<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 36, 94, 112.</note>: That a toleration was never intended to deſtroy an eſtabliſhment; and that as the Baptiſts he preached to had not fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the act of toleration, they were not an orderly ſociety, "But only a number of men that in a <hi>diſorderly</hi> manner refuſed ſubmiſſion to their paſtor." And they accuſe Robbins of intruding himſelf into the <hi>biſhoprics</hi> of Mr. Whittleſey, at Wallingford, and of Mr. Noyes, at New-Haven<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 6, 8, 106</note> To prove which they quote the ſame ſcriptures that Dr. Chauncy, their champion, had cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; one of which, they ſay, means "In plain Engliſh, his doing the office of a biſhop in another's dioceſe; and this the apoſtle ranks with ſome of the greateſt crimes, 1 Pet. iv. 15<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 43.</note>." But who formed thoſe dioceſſes! Becauſe Robbins laid his fourth confeſſion, which they rejected, before his pariſh, who voted that it was ſufficient, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation obſerved, that a freehold rated at fifty ſhillings, or forty pounds, in the common liſts, made every inhabitant a voter in ſuch meetings, and from thence they exclaimed againſt him for that procedure, ſaying, "What if half the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety were ſcandalous perſons<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 101.</note>!" Ay, what indeed!
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:018336_0198_0FA5D28CF6BF6568"/>how dreadful muſt the conſequence be! juſt ſuch as Connecticut had felt for forty years! For their laws made ſuch votes equal to the votes of the beſt ſaints among them, in the choice of their Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And an Aſſembly thus choſen broke over their own law, and elected an ordained miniſter for their Governor; by whoſe influence the Saybrook ſcheme was formed and eſtabliſhed, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the churches liberty to ſay whether their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould meet to form it or not. And now, becauſe Mr. Robbins continued to preach the goſpel to his people, a complaint was carried to their Legiſlature againſt him, with a prayer that he might be turned out of his pulpit, ſo that a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man might be introduced in his ſtead. This was ſo far from being granted, that a Council was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed out of other counties, who prevailed with ſaid Conſociation to reſtore Mr. Robbins to a ſeat with them, which he held until his death in 1781, but his church ſent no meſſengers with him. In October, 1749, their Aſſembly revived their act, concerning the Saybrook eſtabliſhment in 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Governor Wolcot publiſhed a pamphlet againſt the Saybrook ſcheme.

               <p n="1">1. REFORMATION has ever been attended with great difficulties. Declenſion is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to fallen men, but a return to the right way is not ſo. When Iſrael came out of Egypt, a mixed multitude went up. And when David withdrew from Saul's tyranny, many reſorted to him, not only of his kindred, but alſo of every one that was in diſtreſs, in debt, and that were diſcontented; yet when it was ſaid of his cauſe in general, there be many ſervants now-a-days that break away, every man for his maſter, the ſcripture calls it <hi>railing,</hi> and gives the perſon who uttered it the character of a <hi>fool</hi> or <hi>madman.</hi> But how full is our world of ſuch folly and madneſs! David became the Captain of thoſe who reſorted to him; but the people, who now came out from the above-deſcribed tyranny over the churches, had no ſuch commander. Even the father who led them out had too much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and cautious deliberation, to be long follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their chief guide; and he retired to a diſtant iſland, and ſettled there. Such evils had been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed under the name of learning, orthodoxy and
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:018336_0200_0FA5D015EDE04340"/>regularity, that many were prejudiced againſt the truth of what others falſly called by thoſe names. Chriſtian liberty had been ſo much invaded, that many ran into licentiouſneſs to avoid tyranny. The right which the goſpel gives to every ſaint, freely to improve their ſeveral gifts, for mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had been ſo much denied, that frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were now ſeen, of perſons putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forward in exerciſes which they had not a gift for; being ſo earneſt to maintain the liberty of ſpeaking, as not duly to regard others right of judging. And as ſome precious miniſters had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently loſt much of their former life and freedom, by their attempts to correct errors, diſorders and imprudences, a number of pious ſouls were afraid of appearing againſt almoſt any thing that wore the garb of power and life in religion. And the example of the Erſkines in Scotland, who came out of their national church for reformation, and yet rejected Mr. Whitefield, becauſe he would not come into all their meaſures, was held up as a warning here, againſt ſtopping in what any had already attained to. And juſt in this juncture a man came from Windham to Norwich, in the ſummer of 1746, with a proclamation of liberty, and an opening of the latter day glory; exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the legal bondage of praying every night and morning in families, whether perſons felt a ſpirit of prayer or not; declaring that if they had not a ſpirit of prayer, God did not then call them to pray; and ſo of other duties. In this way ſundry perſons, chiefly at Windham, proceeded, until they aſſerted that they had paſſed the firſt reſurrection, and were perfect and immortal; and one of them declared that he was Chriſt. But this ſpirit ſoon carried them into knavery in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:018336_0201_0FA5D016A1FDEF50"/>dealings, intemperance, and what not? About the beginning of 1748, ſome people in Cumberland advanced the opinion, that if a ſaint found that he or ſhe had not been married to the perſon that was made for them, they were not held by legal bonds from a right now to take their true mate, if they ſaw who it was. Hereupon an only child of a rich father, not living comfortably with her huſband, ventured to reject him, and to lodge with another man. Some brethren of Artlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough hearing of it, went to labour with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and others, to turn them from this deluſion; but he ſaid he did not believe there was any harm in it, for they lay with the bible between them. But to his ſorrow and ſhame his daughter proved to be with child, by her new companion, and her huſband obtained a legal divorce from her. About the ſame time, a member of the firſt church in Canterbury declared that it was revealed to him, that a certain ſingle woman would become his wife, though he then had a wife and children. For ſuch converſation the church called him to an account; and, after ſeven months labour, they excommunicated him on September 27, 1749. In the winter following he purchaſed ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury at Norwich, and it was judged that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he had a fancy for poiſoned two children, they giving out that a new and ſtrange diſtemper was come among them, and then poiſoned his wife, ſo that all the three died. This was not doubted to be the fact, though ſhe was acquitted upon trial in Court, and he married her, and afterwards went into the war, and died in Canada. Some of her relations were called to an account, and were caſt out of the church in Canterbury, for perjury, when acting as witneſſes in Court upon that caſe.</p>

II. Now though no actors in the two firſt of theſe ſcenes of iniquity were ever members of any of thoſe Separate churches, and ſaid church had ſo clearly acquitted themſelves of the third, yet miniſters, even from their pulpits, through the whole country, caſt theſe ſcandals upon the Separate cauſe in general, to prove the dreadful danger and effects of ſeparating from them; and the populace were very ready to follow their guides, in this way of ſlander and railing. Such glaring injuſtice to their character, added to much violence upon their perſons and eſtates, ſerved greatly to confirm them in their way; and to guard their minds againſt receiving any inſtruction or correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from men who treated them ſo abuſively. A firſt principle of their ſeparation was, that the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the divine ſpirit are ever to be followed, and not fleſhly wiſdom, nor man's inventions; but how little was the meaning and right application of this principle underſtood? When it was aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that none but the regenerate ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to full communion, miniſters would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that you cannot know who they are. And when it was mentioned, that our Lord ſays, <hi>ye ſhall know them by their fruits;</hi> the queſtion was ſhifted, whether they held to a ſatisfactory or an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge? which diſpute was often carried to extremes on both ſides. And as many would confine the word fruits to dry morality, others ran to the oppoſite extreme, and formed their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of perſons by their inward feelings towards them, rather than upon an intelligible view of what came from them by words and actions. The evils alſo which many had ſuffered from an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing majority, turned ſome to plead againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any members till every individual had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:018336_0203_0FA5D018A6331550"/>with them, and the like in other church acts. At length they found that hereby the leaſt member might tyrannize over the whole church. Again, though the undue power of Councils had been much complained of, yet the Separates run into that evil in a new way. When Councils were called, they were received into fellowſhip with the church that wanted advice; and when they had heard the caſe, and given their advice, in many inſtances the Council acted with the church in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring delinquents; though ſometimes there were more of the Council than of the acting members of the church. After ſome years this practice was dropt. Other miſtakes will appear in the courſe of this hiſtory.</p>
               <p n="3">III. HAVING good men againſt them in the cauſe of reformation was matter of peculiar trial. It was as much ſo with regard to Mr. Edwards, as any one man. His ſucceſs was very great, and by acting upon Mr. Stoddard's doctrine, the church in Northampton was become very numerous; into which he eſſayed to bring goſpel diſcipline, in 1744. But when ſome of their chief families per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it would expoſe their own conduct, they were inflamed againſt Mr. Edwards. And though it could not be honorable to reject ſuch an eminent miniſter on that account; yet finding that he had turned from good old Mr. Stoddard's doctrine, that change was eagerly taken hold of, as a cover for their reſentment. And all his prudent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours could never bring that church, as a body, to give him a fair hearing of his reaſons for altering his ſentiments upon that point: They were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publiſhed at Boſton this year. Some of his cleareſt proofs againſt admitting unſanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the ordinance of the ſupper, are Rom. ii.
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:018336_0204_0FA5D018E025FEE8"/>29, vi. 1—4. Phil. iii. 3, Col. ii. 11, 12. From whence he ſays, "<hi>That baptiſm,</hi> by which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive converts were <hi>admitted</hi> into the church, was uſed as an exhibition and token of their being viſibly <hi>regenerated,</hi> dead to ſin, and alive to God. The ſaintſhip, godlineſs and holineſs, of which, according to ſcripture, profeſſing Chriſtians and viſible ſaints do make a profeſſion and have a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, is not any religion and virtue that is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of common grace, or moral ſincerity (as it is called) but <hi>ſaving grace</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">On a right to ſacraments, p. 20—23.</note>." Which point was the capital article that the Separate churches were built upon; but for fear it ſhould be improved in their favour, he reminded the reader of what he had ſaid againſt them, in his treatiſe on the affections, and in Brainard's life; and then ſaid, "I am ſtill of the ſame mind concerning their lay-ordinations, their lay-preachings, and public exhortings, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering ſacraments; their aſſuming, ſelf-confident, contentious, uncharitable, ſeparating ſpirit<note n="†" place="bottom">Preface, p. 5.</note>." And yet he lived remote from almoſt all the numerous communities whom he thus cenſured, and knew but very little of the real ſtate of their controverſy. The excellent rules which he had publiſhed ſeven years before, were then out of his mind; namely, to judge of a work by the real nature of it, and not by the circumſtances and means of its introduction; to make the ſcriptures the whole rule to judge by; and well to diſtinguiſh between the good and the bad among the ſubjects of the work<note n="‖" place="bottom">Thoughts on the work, 1742, p. 1—40.</note> A due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe rules of his own would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the above reflections, as well as many things in the two other books named. A Separate mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in the eaſt part of Connecticut, wrote to Mr.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:018336_0205_0FA5D019AAB866C0"/>Edwards upon this ſubject, and in particular deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to anſwer two queſtions.
<list>
                     <item>1. As he had deſcribed an excellent new houſe, how we could get into it without going out of the old one, which was in a ruined condition?</item>
                     <item>2. What he meant by the word <hi>lay,</hi> which he ſo often uſed; whether the ſame as the <hi>Latin</hi> church did?</item>
                  </list>
He returned an anſwer, wherein he allowed the old houſe to be in a ruinous condition; but thought we were not yet called to leave it. And to explain what he meant by laymen, he had recourſe to the old opinion about a ſucceſſive power in miniſters; but he ſoon after felt ſuch effects of that power, as he hardly could have believed before.</p>
               <p>FOR his people were ſo uneaſy, that he agreed to call a mutual Council of ten churches, to ſettle the controverſy betwixt them: But in the large county of Hampſhire, which then included Berkſhire alſo, he could find but three miniſters of his judgment, upon the point in diſpute; and the church was ſtrenuous againſt allowing him liberty to go out of that county for the other two whom he was to chooſe. At length they yielded ſo far; but when the Council met, one of the churches had refuſed to ſend to it; ſo that though their miniſter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to act in the Council, yet he had no delegate with him; therefore Mr. Edwards was <hi>ſeparated</hi> from his dear flock, by the major vote of only one delegate in that Council. And the only charge that they had againſt him they ſtated in theſe words, viz. "The paſtor inſiſting upon it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the admiſſion of members to full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that they ſhould make a profeſſion of <hi>ſanctifying grace;</hi> whereas the brethren are of the opinion, that the Lord's ſupper is a converting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and conſequently that perſons, if they have
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:018336_0206_0FA5D01A5D6FDF98"/>a competency of knowledge, and are of a blameleſs life, may be admitted to the Lord's table, although they make <hi>no ſuch profeſſion</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Reſult of the Council at Northampton, June 22, 1750, p. 3, 4. And Edwards's life.</note>." And Dr. Solomon Williams, who wrote againſt him, ſays, "Nothing ſhould be expreſſed in the words of the profeſſion, but what ſome <hi>unſanctified men</hi> may ſay and ſpeak true<note n="‖" place="bottom">Anſwer to Edwards, p. 47.</note>." And he was a chief actor in all that the miniſters of Windham county had done againſt the Separates. And Mr. Edwards, who had been moved to cenſure them ſo hardly, yet was now <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the people he dearly loved, upon the ſame point; and he removed and ſettled at Stockbridge, where he became more extenſively ſerviceable to mankind; eſpecially by his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable treatiſe upon the liberty of the will, and his anſwer to Taylor on original ſin, both of which have been reprinted in London. At laſt he was choſen Preſident of New-Jerſey college; but ſoon died there of the ſmall-pox, March 22, 1758, aet. 56.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THE fundamental principle above deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, naturally leads to the excluſion of infant ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but the generality of thoſe who came out in ſeparation had no ſuch idea. The Mansfield ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles held up internal union as the rule of church communion, although perſons were of different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents about baptiſm; but there were very few Baptiſts in any of their churches before 1749. In June that year Elder Moulton baptized thirteen members of the Separate church in Sturbridge, one of whom was Deacon Daniel Fiſk; and in a little time after all their officers, and the main body of the church, were baptized, even above threeſcore perſons. The exempting law for Baptiſts had again
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:018336_0207_0FA5D01BD992FB58"/>expired in 1747, when it was revived and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ten years. And in order that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it might be extended to that ſociety, two principal members of the ſecond Baptiſt church in Boſton wrote a certificate in their favour to Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge aſſeſſors, Jan. 23, 1750. And in May fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing two principal members of the Baptiſt church in Sturbridge gave in a liſt of their ſociety accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law; yet they were all again taxed to Mr. Caleb Rice, a miniſter in that town. And, only for this and the following year, five men were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned at Worceſter, three oxen and eight cows were taken away, and a great deal of other property, for ſuch taxes. Aaron Allen was the collector who did it for 1750, and Jonathan Maſon for 175<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The firſt took a good cow from David Morſe, a ruling elder in ſaid Baptiſt church, for a tax of One Pound One Shilling and Fourpence; and the other took a pair of oxen from him, valued at Eleven Pounds, for a tax of leſs than Five Dollars. Such havoc did they make of their neighbours goods, under religious pretences! Sundry proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions were commenced againſt thoſe collectors; and when one of the caſes came to the Superior Court, both parties agreed to refer it to the judges; and they gave judgment in favour of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. This gave a ſhock to their oppreſſors; but a ſcheme was ſoon contrived to nonſuit the other actions commenced; and that was by pleading, that the ſuit ſhould have been againſt the aſſeſſors, and not the collectors. By this trick Mr. Morſe was injured to the value of above Twenty Pounds; and the whole ſociety eſtimated their damages at more than a Hundred Pounds. And in a warrant for their town-meeting of March 2, 1752, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was inſerted, to ſee if the town would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:018336_0208_0FA5D01C0012F778"/>their collector for his expences, in the action which was turned againſt him. Moſes Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was Moderator, and as this article was objected to, it was propoſed to raiſe the money by ſubſcription, and they enquired how much it was. Upon which the Moderator drew out and read a paper, containing an account of "So much for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a lawyer, and ſo many dollars given to Col. Brattle at one time, and ſo many to another man," &amp;c. and he ſaid the whole, with the execution, amounted to above Twenty Pounds. This moved the people ſo, that it did not ſeem likely that they would vote it by itſelf; therefore, contrary to law, (which was inſiſted upon by the Baptiſts preſent) that article was blended with another about ſchool-money, and the vote was carried, whereby the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts were again taxed to pay the expences of an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal law-ſuit againſt themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe facts about ſaid meeting were ſworn to by three men at Worceſter, Auguſt 31, 1753, one of whom was Deacon Daniel Fiſk, who died a member of our Legiſlature in 1778</note> And this was not enough; but ſaid Moderator, who was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Legiſlature, moved them ſo with theſe things, that when they met November 22, 1752, they broke in upon their own law, and enacted, that the miniſter, with two principal members of the Baptiſt church, ſhould ſign their certificates for the future; and alſo that no miniſter or church ſhould have any power to give lawful certificates, until they ſhall have obtained "From three other churches, commonly called Anabaptiſts, in this or the neighbouring Provinces, a certificate from each reſpectively, that they eſteem ſuch church to be of their denomination, and that they conſcientiouſly believe them to be Anabaptiſts." All ſuch certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to be lodged with the town-clerk where
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:018336_0209_0FA5D01CEE58F5B0"/>the Baptiſts lived, before their ſeveral aſſeſſments were made. This act to continue in force five years. And ſaid Moderator preſented a petition to the Aſſembly in June following, that all the unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved lands in Sturbridge might be taxed to his miniſter; but did not obtain it. It is be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that thoſe who lately became Baptiſts were not in fellowſhip with moſt of the old Baptiſt churches; therefore this act was paſſed to prevent their being exempted from taxes to State worſhip. It alſo required them to certify a conſcientious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a point which they never did believe, viz. That they were Anabaptiſts <hi>(rebaptizers)</hi> a name of reproach caſt upon them by their perſecutors.</p>
               <p n="5">V. AND among the many inſtances that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered how tenacious our oppreſſors were of their taxing power to ſupport worſhip, take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Eſther White, of Raynham, had a ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt left her, for which ſhe was taxed <hi>Eightpence</hi> to the pariſh miniſter, from whom ſhe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn four years; and ſhe ſeriouſly declared that it was againſt her conſcience to pay it. Therefore, for no more than that ſum, ſhe was ſeized on Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary 28, 1752, and was impriſoned at Taunton until March, 1753, when ſaid miniſter's own people were conſtrained to go and releaſe her, without her paying any acknowledgment to that taxing power. She ſoon after became a Baptiſt, and continued to give abiding evidence of true piety, until ſhe died in peace in 1774. The caſe of Framingham, twenty-five miles weſtward of Boſton, affords a further demonſtration of the iniquity of ſupporting miniſters by tax and compulſion. The Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Edward Goddard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> formerly one of the Council in this Province, with other fathers of that town, could not concur with the majority in the
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:018336_0210_0FA5D01D8CB49FE0"/>ſettlement of a miniſter; and by the advice of other miniſters they became an organized church by themſelves in 1747, and wanted nothing but the ſanction of the civil power, to make them as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and orthodox a ſociety in law as any others were. But as they were zealous friends to the late revival of religion, ſuch an incorporation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them. And they had been all taxed to a miniſter they never choſe, for ſix years before the publication upon the ſubject, which is quoted in the appendix to vol. 1, p. 8, 15. Three years after their miniſter left them, and a Baptiſt ſociety is now formed among them. And Connecticut ſtill kept pace with the Maſſachuſetts in oppreſſion, of which the place of the author's nativity now exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a ſtriking example. A widow who had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from their worſhip ſeven years, and ſteadily attended and ſupported worſhip in another church, gives ſo clear an account of it, that her letter is here preſented to the reader, without adding or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing a word.</p>

We lay in priſon thirteen days, and then ſet at liberty, by what means
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:018336_0211_0FA5D020E40C9F58"/>I know not. Whilſt I was there a great many people came to ſee me; and ſome ſaid one thing and ſome another. O the innumerable ſnares and temptations that beſet me, more than I ever thought on before! But, O the condeſcenſion of heaven! though I was bound when I was caſt into this furnace, yet was I looſed, and found Jeſus in the midſt of the furnace with me. O then I could give up my name, eſtate, family, life and breath, freely to God. Now the priſon looked like a palace to me. I could bleſs God for all the laughs and ſcoffs made at me. O the love that flowed out to all mankind! Then I could forgive as I would deſire to be forgiven, and love my neighbour as myſelf. Deacon Griſwold was put into priſon the 8th of October, and yeſterday old brother Grover, and are in purſuit of others; all which calls for humiliation.

And on December 11 he wrote to Canterbury aſſeſſors, and ſaid, "To you, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, practitioners of the law, from your priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Windham gaol, becauſe his conſcience will not let him pay to a miniſter that is ſet up by the law of Connecticut, contrary to his conſcience and conſent. The Roman Emperor was called Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifix Maximus, becauſe he preſided over civil and eccleſiaſtical affairs; which is the firſt beaſt who perſecuted the Chriſtians that ſeparated from their eſtabliſhed religion, which they called the holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their forefathers; and by their law fined, whipt, impriſoned, and killed ſuch as refuſed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereto. We all own that the Pope or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal throne is the ſecond beaſt, becauſe he is head

He alſo compels all under him to ſubmit to his worſhip, decrees and laws, by whips, fines, priſons, fire and faggots. Now what your priſoner requeſts of you, is a clear diſtinction between the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, by which I am now held here in priſon, and the aforeſaid two thrones or beaſts, in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, conſtitution and ſupport thereof. For if by ſcripture and reaſon you can ſhew they do not all ſtand on the throne mentioned in Pſalm xciv. 20, but that the latter is founded on the rock Chriſt Jeſus, I will confeſs my fault, and ſoon clear my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the priſon. But if this conſtitution hath its riſe from that throne, then come forth to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty; for better is it to die for Chriſt, than to live againſt him. From an old friend to this civil conſtitution, and long your priſoner, ELISHA PAINE."</p>

FIVE days after he was releaſed; but the extremity of the winter hindered him a great while from getting over to his family, who ſuffered much in an unfiniſhed houſe, for want of his help. Mr. Solomon Paine publiſhed this year a view of the difference between the church of Chriſt, and the churches eſtabliſhed by law in Connecticut. And though the conteſt was hot for eight years longer, yet it then abated, and in 1771 Mr. Cogſwell was diſmiſſed; and ſuch taxes were entirely dropt in the place, and a number of actors therein were brought to confeſs their faults for the ſame. In the mean time, another unſucceſsful addreſs to their Aſſembly, ſigned by a large number of men, was preſented in 1753. After which twenty churches joined in a memorial to the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,

But having laid it before the deputation and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for the Diſſenters, whereof Dr. Avery was Chairman, they judged that if thoſe plain viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of charter rights were preſented to the King in Council, it would endanger the taking away of Connecticut charter; which the petitioners were by no means willing for. Therefore ſaid Agents returned in 1757; and ſaid committee wrote to Connecticut rulers againſt thoſe oppreſſions. And by their advice a proceſs in executive Courts was commenced, with a deſign of carrying it to England by way of appeal; but having proceeded ſome ways therein, they dropt it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. TIMOTHY PACKOM was an aged and pious member of the ſecond church in Newport, before a diviſion took place therein, in the following manner. Daniel Greene, a gifted member of it, experienced a ſudden turn in his mind, from general to particular redemption: And in the fall of 1739 James Brown joined with him, and brought a charge, in general terms, into their church againſt Elder Eyres, of his wanting the goſpel qualifications of an elder; and then named ſome inſtances of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent anger and ſeverity againſt members who did not concur with his meaſures, to prove it. This cauſed much unhappineſs: At length on January 10, 1740, he read to the church a general confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his imperfections in thoſe reſpects; and they voted the ſame to be ſatisfactory. Said brethren
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:018336_0216_0FA5D024E45427D8"/>enquired whether he meant to confeſs the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars they had mentioned, but could obtain no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him, nor a copy of his confeſſion. This appeared ſo grievous that they went and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it to their brethren of North-Kingſtown, who ſent to enquire into the matter. For theſe things Greene and Brown were cenſured; and Packom and others joined with them, and carried their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to one general meeting of their churches at Swanzey, and to another at Providence; and not obtaining ſatisfaction, they formed a new church, and got ſome of their elders to ordain Mr. Packom as paſtor of it. And in 1742 they publiſhed a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of themſelves in theſe proceedings. But private letters afterwards from each of thoſe men, to Elder Eyres and his church, expreſs deep ſorrow for thoſe haſty proceedings, and their want of a fruitful underſtanding, humility and candour, with their zeal therein; for which they earneſtly deſired for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. But not ſeeing their way clear to return into full fellowſhip with that church, a removal of their cenſure was denied them. Greene, in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter July 2, 1745, gives the following as the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he could not commune with ſaid elder, viz. "So far as I can gather, thou believeſt, that man's ſalvation, conditionally beſtowable, is the free pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo the free gift of God: But then that the ſecurity of the beſtowment, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this ſalvation, doth turn and depend upon a condition, which is ſo left to man to perform, that it may or may not be performed; not as God himſelf ſhall be pleaſed abſolutely to cauſe, but as man, ſuppoſed to be a ſelf-inclining agent, ſhall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be diſpoſed, in the improvement or miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of divine aſſiſtance. Whereas I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:018336_0217_0FA5D0259EE600F0"/>I think, with all my heart, that man is in no reſpect an independent agent; and that if he obtains ſalvation, it is not owing to himſelf at all; but that his ſalvation, and its whole ſecurity to him, depend altogether upon the free pleaſure and cauſation of Almighty God, who worketh all things according to the council of his own will, working in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren both to will and to do of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure." Such ideas, but not ſo clear, were impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon David Sprague's mind, before he began to preach, in the Baptiſt church in Scituate; where he was told, that if he went on in that way he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as bad an <hi>electioner</hi> as any of the Preſbyterians. This, as he informed me, turned him in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into their general way of preaching; and he was ſettled in that way, at North-Kingſtown, about the time of the aboveſaid diviſion at Newport.</p>
               <p n="2">II. BY the labours of Separate miniſters many were converted, and a Baptiſt church was formed in Coventry, and a paſtor was ordained in it Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 11, 1749. Elder Sprague went there, and was prevailed with to aſſiſt, with other Baptiſts, in that ordination. And he there got ſuch an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ſome Separate elders, as to invite them to come and preach in the Narraganſent country. This was done with very extenſive effects; and Sprague was drawn ſo far as to act with Solomon Paine in Elder Babcock's ordination the next ſpring; which was then the firſt inſtance of the union of the two denominations in ſuch acts. The majority of the church at North-Kingſtown grew ſo uneaſy, that above ſeventy of them, male and female, ſigned a paper May 20, 1750, which divided the church. They therein repreſent, that their church was of about forty years ſtanding, and that good order had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:018336_0218_0FA5D0269BA4D3F8"/>been kept up in it, until within the laſt ſeven years. "Since that, ſay they, our elder and ſome of the brethren have imbibed doctrines which neither we nor our general community ever did chooſe ſhould be brought into the church. The doctrines crouded upon us were,
<list>
                     <item>1. That Adam, by his eating the forbidden fruit, did bring mankind under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in reſpect to the life which is to come at the day of judgment.</item>
                     <item>2. That every perſon who is truly converted, cannot, in the courſe of his life, ſin himſelf out of God's bleſſings at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                     <item>3. That it was a duty for Chriſtians to ſing, with loud and joined voices, with rhyme and tunes of man's compoſure, in public aſſemblies."</item>
                  </list>
Theſe doctrines and their effects were then ſhut out of their meeting-houſe; though they propoſed to leave it to others to ſettle the matter with their diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brethren about their intereſt therein. Upon which Elder Sprague, and thoſe who were of his ſentiments, conſtituted a church in Exeter, and ſeveral other churches were ſoon after formed in thoſe parts, in fellowſhip with them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. SOME among them, who had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the time of their former darkneſs, were now baptized again; which moved Elder Eyres to write to Elder Sprague about it, December 1, 1750, and a ſtop was put thereto. Alſo a ſight of former diviſions, upon circumſtantials, carried a few ſo far into the oppoſite extreme, as to admit ſome to table communion without any water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm at all. There were at leaſt two inſtances of this, the one at Exeter, the other at Warwick; but that practice was ſoon over. And theſe and other miſtakes could not hinder an extenſive ſpread of believers baptiſm among the Separate churches;
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:018336_0219_0FA5D02726702238"/>whoſe elders, Mack of Lyme, Stearns of Tolland<note n="*" place="bottom">Elder Shubael Stearns (having baptized Noah Alden, in July, 1754, and left him to preach to the part of his ſociety who remained there) ſet off with others for North-Carolina; and he, Jonathan Polk, Daniel Marſhal, and others, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental of a great work in thoſe parts. I am well informed that from thence have ſprung a large number of Baptiſt churches; which, by a bleſſing upon the ſucceeding labours of many, now extend through various parts of Virginia, North and South-Carolina, and into Georgia.</note>, Haſtings of Suffield, Meacham of Enfield, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of Somers, and others, were baptized. But fierce oppoſition being raiſed againſt what was called <hi>rebaptizing,</hi> which was repreſented to be a moſt wicked and pernicious thing, ſeveral teachers and others retracted their acting therein. And as the author's refuſing to follow their example brought him to be a public object of reſentment, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding events have made him more extenſively ſo, a clear idea of this part of our hiſtory cannot be given, without a more diſtinct account of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conduct, and the motives thereof, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have been expedient and becoming. This he thinks is confirmed by ancient examples. Acts xi. 2—18, xxii. 3—21.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. HIS being born of religious parents, and having a religious (though not what is called a liberal) education, he has ever eſteemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable favour. Yet he neglected the great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for more than ſeventeen years, becauſe he ſecretly imagined that it would abridge his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent liberty and comfort; and alſo, that when he got ready to ſet about the work in good earneſt, God would be moved to help, pardon and ſave him. But in May, 1741, his eyes were opened to ſee, that time was not at his command, and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:018336_0220_0FA5D02AB0D61EF8"/>that eternity was directly before him, into which he might juſtly be called the next moment. Then he knew what it was to work for his life for three months; until on Auguſt 24, as he was alone in the field, it was demonſtrated to his mind and conſcience, that he had done his utmoſt to make himſelf better, without obtaining any ſuch thing; but that he was a guilty ſinner in the hands of a holy God, who had a right to do with him as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good in God's ſight; which he then yielded to, and all his objections againſt it were ſilenced. And ſoon upon this a way of relief was opened to his ſoul, which he never had any true idea of before, wherein truth and juſtice ſhine with luſtre, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the beſtowment of free mercy and ſalvation upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who have nothing in themſelves but badneſs. And while this divine glory engaged all his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his burthen of guilt and evil diſpoſitions was gone, and ſuch ideas and inclinations were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in his heart as were never there before, but which have never been rooted out ſince, though often over-clouded. Hereupon he was led to make a profeſſion of religion, in the church where he had always attended worſhip, and to walk therein for about two years. But then their miniſter obtained a vote in the church, to empower him to admit communicants by a major vote, without giving the church ſo much as a written relation of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change. It alſo appeared that the miniſter inclined to think that the ordinance of the ſupper was a converting ordinance; and he diſcovered a ſtrong affection for the Saybrook ſcheme, which the church had rejected juſt before they ſettled him. The author therefore withdrew from that church, about the time that Canterbury church was robbed of their rights, in the manner before
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:018336_0221_0FA5D02C29E0E6C8"/>deſcribed. He had no expectation of entering into the work of the miniſtry, until September, 1746; and the grounds he acted upon then are deſcribed in his diſcourſe, publiſhed eight years after, entituled, <hi>The nature and neceſſity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal call to preach the goſpel.</hi> The manner of his ſettling among the people he ſtill miniſters to, here follows.</p>
               <p n="5">V. IN a place called Titicut, upon the river be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bridgwater and Middleborough, a powerful work was wrought, in and after the year 1741, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by means of the preaching of Mr. Elieb Byram; which moved the people to petition for a new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, in order to ſettle him as their miniſter: But the matter was delayed until he was gone and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in New-Jerſey. And after Titicut precinct was conſtituted, in February, 1743, miniſters refuſed to diſmiſs the communicants therein, ſo as to form a new church, leſt they ſhould call a miniſter whom they did not approve of. They were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hus denied the rights which both the laws of God and man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, until the brethren determined not to be reſtrained by ſuch tyranny any longer; but came out and began to worſhip by themſelves on Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 13, 1747. The author was then unknown to them, and they to him; but by the diſpoſal of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he was brought among them the next Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, in company with Mr. Snow, of Providence, who ſtayed and laboured ten days with remarkable effects; and the author was prevailed with to tarry and preach among them. And the precinct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, perceiving that open oppoſition would then be in vain, came and requeſted him to preach to them, and to take regular ſteps for ſettlement. He informed them, that he was willing to act regularly according to the goſgel, but could not ſubmit to
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:018336_0222_0FA5D02DF4815478"/>the power that miniſters and pariſhes had aſſumed over the churches, which was contrary thereto. Yet they requeſted him, and he conſented, to preach to them for a while. Such a revival took place as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the hopeful converſion of about twenty ſouls, and the quickening of many others. A church was formed February 16, 1748, which increaſed to threeſcore members in ten months. But the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite party met in March, and voted a large ſum of money to finiſh their meeting-houſe, and to hire other ſort of preaching, and aſſeſſed it upon all the inhabitants. Therefore our ſociety, on November 21, drew an addreſs to them, to remind them of paſt tranſactions, and to invite them into a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; or, if not, yet to intreat them not to violate the golden rule in their dealings towards us. They returned an anſwer which ſays, "What we demand of you is equal and right; what you demand of us is evil and ſinful; and hence we have the golden rule upon our ſide, while you are receding and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it." And they went ſo far as to call it "Groſs ignorance and enthuſiaſm" for any to deny that Chriſtian rulers have a right to compel their ſubjects to receive and ſupport orthodox miniſters. And February 6, 1749, the author was ſeized as a priſoner, for Thirteen Shillings and Fourpence aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed upon him in ſaid tax. But as he refuſed to pay it, they after about three hours confinement ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled it among themſelves. This was the beſt reward they ever offered him for preaching two months at their requeſt. One of his brethren was impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Plymouth for ſaid tax. But when diſtreſs was made upon another of his hearers, they were proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted therefor, and it was found upon trial that ſaid money was voted at an illegal meeting. They therefore appealed to the Superior Court; and in the
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:018336_0223_0FA5D02EA2C3DB48"/>mean time, on December 14, 1749, procured an act of the Legiſlature which ſays, "That the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the meeting mentioned in the petition he and they hereby are held and deemed good and valid in law, the defect of the notification for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid meeting notwithſtanding." And by virtue of this act the caſe was turned againſt the appellee in the next trial; which ſhews that a worſhip ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tax, is <hi>partiality</hi> eſtabliſhed by law. In June preceding a memorial againſt it was carried to the Aſſembly at Boſton, by Mr. John Paine, and Mr. Samuel Peck, ſigned by a large number of men; but it was rejected; as a like memorial alſo was in 1754.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. As to baptiſm, diſputes about it were firſt brought into the church in Titicut in Auguſt, 1749; and a diſagreeable temper was ſoon diſcovered, and much heat in debates, for three weeks. And as the author was eſſaying, in his ſecret approaches to the throne of grace, to give up this caſe to God, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den concluſion came in, that the Baptiſt way is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly right, becauſe nature fights ſo againſt it. And he was hurried on to preach it up the next day; which cauſed confuſion among the hearers, and returned with a horrible gloom over his own mind; and he was turned back to his former prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Hereupon a number of the church drew off, and ten perſons were baptized in September by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moulton. About three months after, when the heat of controverſy was abated, the queſtion was put to his conſcience, in his retired hours, Where is it, and in what relation to the church do thoſe ſtand, who are baptized, but not converted? He could ſee that all the circumciſed were obliged to keep the paſſover; and had ſeen that there was no half-way in the Chriſtian church, nor any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:018336_0224_0FA5D02F5B073850"/>to admit any to communion therein without a credible profeſſion of ſaving faith. No tongue can tell the diſtreſs he now felt. The neglect of goſpel diſcipline a little before, lay heavy upon his mind; and the diſputes and diviſions in the church greatly added to his burthen. And near the cloſe of 1749, a number of people in Eaſton and Norton made ſo high a profeſſion of being led into believers bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that no ordained miniſter in the land would do to adminiſter it to them. But they met by a place of water, and one would baptize another, and then he the next; ſo that about twenty perſons were dipped, by four or five adminiſtrators among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Parting from their lawful wives and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and taking of others, immediately followed, until ſome baſtard children were born among them, with many other abominations. Could the author therefore have diſcovered any foundation for his former practice, he would moſt certainly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued therein: But all his efforts failing, he was at laſt brought to the old ſtandard; ſo as to leave good men and bad men out of the queſtion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>what ſaith the ſcripture?</hi> Hereby a ſettlement was granted, and he was baptized Auguſt 22, 1751.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. THE difficulties were become ſo great in the church, that a mutual Council of five churches was called, October 2; who after long labour brought ſixteen members to renew their covenant to go on together, and the Council declared fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, and cenſured all the reſt, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly charged thoſe ſixteen to follow all the other members with labour, until they were recovered to fellowſhip, or cut off by diſcipline. Three of the ſixteen were Baptiſts, and no hint was given of breaking communion between the two denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The author had no objection then againſt
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:018336_0225_0FA5D0301F47C060"/>their advice, but was held back about a month by inward diſcouragements. But getting relief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, he came forward, and was freely received in his office by all but two of thoſe brethren; and they refuſed to receive him, unleſs he would baptize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. A cloſe labour was hereby brought on, and it was moſt fully declared, that we meant to give free liberty to every one to act according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in that reſpect; but to require a man to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter an ordinance in the name of God, which he ſaw no command for, was requiring him to wrong his own conſcience, to ſatisfy others. Yet thoſe two brethren, who had lately renewed their convenant, refuſed to walk with their elder, or with thoſe who received him, unleſs he would ſprinkle infants. For this ſchiſm in the body they were cenſured; and, after ten months labours, were excommunicated. In the midſt of which time five Baptiſts were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for refuſing to commune with this body. Thoſe two were no ſooner caſt out than they ſent for three of the churches who were of the former Council, who met here November 1, 1752, and fully juſtified them, and cenſured all who had acted againſt them, and declared that unleſs they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted repentance therefor, they muſt <hi>mark and avoid them.</hi> Strangers cannot conceive how unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it appeared, for eminent fathers thus to treat their children this year, for acting according to their own ſolemn charge the year before. It alarmed the Baptiſts in general, and our elders Sprague, Babcock and Worden, being ſent for, met here in Council January 31, 1753; and, in conjunction with many of both denominations that came, they appointed a general meeting of theſe churches, and ſent out citations therefor. In anſwer to which twenty-ſeven churches met at Exeter, May 23, and
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:018336_0226_0FA5D030F08376D0"/>unanimouſly agreed, that a turning to or from infant baptiſm was not a cenſurable evil; but that each ſhould leave the other with God, according to Phil. iii. 15. And by their advice a Council met at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough July 11; under whoſe influence thoſe cenſures, both of the two and of the five members, were revoked, and fellowſhip was again declared with this church. But the elders at Canterbury and Plainfield refuſed to come to the Exeter meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to concur with theſe ſubſequent acts. For this Elder Babcock refuſed to act with Elder Paine in an ordination at Stonington, May 29, 1753, though he did not then give his reaſons therefor. And becauſe he afterwards gave them to that church, and they ſent to Canterbury to enquire into the matter, a proceſs was commenced againſt Babcock as a tranſgreſſor, for laying in complaints againſt his brethren to another church than their own. This charge was carried to his church, but not ſucceeding there, Paine joined with Babcock, in calling a general meeting at Stonington May 29, 1754, to ſearch into theſe matters, that the churches might come into a goſpel ſettlement. Elders and brethren from forty churches then met, viz. from twenty-four in Connecticut, eight in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, ſeven in Rhode-Iſland, and one on Long-Iſland. After long and tedious debates, the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was put to every member of the conference, whether any juſt cauſe of offence was given to the Baptiſts in the reſult at Middleborough of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1, 1752? Thirty-ſeven ſaid nay; thirty-five ſaid yea, and ſeven choſe to be ſilent about it. And after hard attempts to caſt the blame of the breach upon the Baptiſts, and manifeſting a willingneſs to commune with Chriſtians who wanted light for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm, Mr. Paine and ſundry others declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:018336_0227_0FA5D031E7871C30"/>non-communion with ſuch as profeſſed to have light againſt it. I now find, that on the back of the paper which called his brother over from Long-Iſland to this meeting at Stonington, Eliſha has ſtated the queſtion in theſe words, viz.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. "A HOLDS out his principles. 1. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he will adminiſter baptiſm to none but adult believers. 2. That he will go to any church, and baptize all perſons that were baptized in infancy, If they will declare they were diſſatisfied with their infant baptiſm. B holds out his principles, and declares that he will adminiſter baptiſm to all adult believers and their infant ſeed, and that he doth it in the name of the Trinity, in obedience of a divine precept. Now the queſtion is, be theſe two perſons agreed in their principles? or will there be any eſſential difference between their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, if they practiſe according to their profeſſed principles? Is it a matter of indifference for a paſtor of a church to ſay, he baptizes an infant in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, in the fulfilment of a divine precept? My dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you can reconcile the above principles, in the eſſential parts thereof, you will remove all the grounds of bars and diſputes: But if there be an eſſential difference in the above articles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in the practice on them, then there is an Achan in the camp; and no marvel that Iſrael hath, in all reformations, been troubled therewith. Either B ſins in making infants the ſubjects of baptiſm, or A in cutting them off. Now it is clear to me, that infants were once the ſubjects to be ſealed with the ſeal of Abraham's faith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if I allow a perſon to have Abraham's faith I muſt ſhew that God hath forbid the ſeal to be put to their ſeed, or elſe forbid it in my own name;
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:018336_0228_0FA5D0326E4E2810"/>for there is but one covenant of grace, and that had Abraham's ſeed in it. Now if we allow a perſon to have Abraham's faith, why not his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege?

               <p>THUS ſpake that eminent father of theſe churches, though the author then knew nothing of it, and never ſaw him nor his brother after that meeting<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Solomon Paine died, after a ſhort illneſs, October 25, 1754; as Mr. Stevens alſo did November 13, 1755. They were principal leaders among thoſe churches.</note>. A ſtrong perſuaſion was ſtill held by many, that if a right temper was in exerciſe, Chriſtians might and ought to commune together, although of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judgments about baptiſm. The author and his church laboured earneſtly to go on in that way; but when ſome pious members manifeſted a belief of duty to be buried in baptiſm, others refuſed to go to the water to ſee it done, becauſe, in their view, they were already baptized, and to repeat it would be taking the ſacred name in vain. And when an elder came and ſprinkled ſome infants, the Baptiſts felt a like difficulty, though they did not leave the meeting where it was done. Being unwilling to part, attempts were made to convince each other, which led into warm debates; to avoid which, at the next meeting, each one was afraid
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:018336_0229_0FA5D035E2212EC0"/>to mention the ſubject, leſt it ſhould cauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. Thus edification, the great end of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſociety, was marred inſtead of being promoted, by that which is called large communion. It was ſo far from anſwering to that name, that, with their utmoſt endeavours, the author and his brethren could never arrive at communion in the ordinance of the ſupper, from September, 1754, to the end of 1755. To be unſettled in religious matters was very diſagreeable to the author; but he could not avoid a freſh ſearch into the cauſe of theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.</p>
               <p>THE arguments of the beloved Bunyan, for a free communion with all ſaints, had before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared concluſive to him and others; but a review of them diſcovered his miſtakes. One argument is, that plain laws of old were ſometimes diſpenſed with; as circumciſion was omitted in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; David eat of the ſhew-bread that was not lawful for him, and the people in Hezekiah's time eat of the paſſover, otherwiſe than it was written. But it was found upon ſearch, that each of theſe were extraordinary caſes, which were not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore could afford no plea for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with rule at ordinary times. And as to Bunyan's capital argument, which is, <hi>God hath received them,</hi> therefore we ought to; it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that his example is often inimitable by us; but as far as it is imitable, it is always <hi>in the truth.</hi> Hence truth is never to be violated for any one, no, not to ſave natural life, which all lawful means ſhould be uſed to preſerve. And truth ſo clearly requires baptiſm before the ſupper, that Pedobaptiſts do never come to the table with any but ſuch as are baptized in their eſteem. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could we underſtandingly act in being buried
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:018336_0230_0FA5D0375D1BC070"/>in baptiſm, until we were convinced that what was done to us in infancy was not goſpel baptiſm; therefore to commune at the Lord's table with any who were only ſprinkled in infancy, is parting with truth, by practically ſaying they are baptized, when we do not believe they are. I ſince find that the learned and pious Dr. Watts allows this argument to be juſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Rational foundation of the Chriſtian church, p. 189, 260.</note>, though many ſtill wrangle againſt it.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. A NUMBER of brethren being convinced that though freedom towards all men ought to be ſhown, as far as it can be in the truth, yet that truth limits church communion to believers bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized upon a profeſſion of their own faith, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a church at Middleborough, in this way, on January 26, 1756; and, by aſſiſtance from Boſton and Rehoboth, the author was inſtalled their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the 23d of July following. Having in the mean time publiſhed a diſcourſe from Gal. iv. 31, to ſhew that Abraham's firſt ſon that was circumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the <hi>ſon of the bond-woman,</hi> an emblem of the national church of the Jews; in diſtinction from regenerate ſouls, the <hi>ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham,</hi> of whom the Chriſtian church was conſtituted; into which neither natural birth, nor the doings of others, can rightly bring any one ſoul, without their own conſent. Upon theſe principles was the firſt Baptiſt church in Plymouth county then found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it being the firſt of this perſuaſion, in an extent of country above an hundred miles long, from Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham to the end of Cape-Cod, and near fifty miles wide, betwixt Boſton and Rehoboth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are now ſeventeen churches.</p>
               <p>MEN who regard carnal eaſe, or temporal honor and intereſt, more than truth, cannot be pleaſed
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:018336_0231_0FA5D039C1F290D0"/>with the foregoing account of things; but their ſcorn, or rage is contemptible, when compar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with the divine favour or diſpleaſure. Young Chriſtians who highly regard God's favour and fear his frowns, yet are far from being aware of how nearly truth and error may be blended in honeſt minds; and nothing can teach them the nature and effects thereof like experience. The Spirit of Truth taught Peter that Jeſus was the Chriſt the Son of the living God: But Peter was greatly miſtaken, in concluding from thence that he had inherent ſtrength enough to die for his Saviour. On the day of Pentecoſt he and others received vaſtly greater light and ſtrength; yet how much were they ſtill miſtaken in ſuppoſing that all who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity muſt be circumciſed? And though a new viſion from heaven taught Peter to go freely to the Gentiles, yet what <hi>diſſimulation</hi> was he and Barnabas afterwards inſnared in about thoſe matters! Gal. ii. 11—14. Great care is ever to be taken, not to condemn any thing but what is really evil, nor to expoſe what is ſo unneceſſarily. If the author has done either in the preceding nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, he deſires to lie open to conviction. It is drawn from a large number of original papers and records, which any who deſire it are welcome to ſee. His experience in theſe affairs has very ſenſibly taught him, that miſtaken concluſions are often drawn from good premiſes; and alſo, that wrong judgments are the natural effect of erroneous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. In particular that truth is not to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced only becauſe nature fights againſt it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected becauſe bad men have profeſſed it, or good men have fought againſt it. Alſo that the holding of internal union as the rule of church communion, naturally leads to the cenſuring of brethren of both
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:018336_0232_0FA5D039E397D100"/>denominations, if they refuſe to act according to that rule, which is making our affection to creatures the ſtandard inſtead of the revealed will of God. Likewiſe to cenſure ſerious Chriſtians, becauſe of difference in opinion about worſhip, in the ſame manner as if they were guilty of a plain breach of moral precept, is doubtleſs erroneous. In a word, truth is to be received and hold for its own ſake, and not upon any exterior motives; and it is never to be violated or forſaken for any conſideration whatſoever.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="unknown:018336_0233_0FA5D03AA650D680"/>But the ſame man was judged to be heterodox, by the ſame Preſident, eight or nine years after; and then himſelf went to the ſame Separate meeting that he had cenſured others for going to. And at a meeting of the Corporation of Yale college, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 21, 1751, it was reſolved that no member of the Corporation, nor officer of inſtruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhould hereafter be admitted, until he had given his explicit conſent to their ancient forms of ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, and renounced all oppoſite principles. And that as this was a known condition of their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if any of them ſhould afterwards embrace a contrary ſyſtem, common honeſty would oblige them to own it, and to reſign their places.

In 1753 an act of their Legiſlature was procured, to eſtabliſh a profeſſorſhip of divinity in the college; which terminated in ſetting up worſhip on the Lord's days, and the gathering of a church therein. A great noiſe, in print and otherwiſe, was made about theſe proceedings; which had ſo much influence about this time, as to cut off an annual grant of an Hundred Pounds from the government to the Preſident, which has not been reſtored ſince. Much pains were taken, by him and others, to prove that none but orthodox mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought ever to be elected as members of the college Corporation.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="unknown:018336_0234_0FA5D03B6E973F00"/>therewith. So much ſmoke and duſt was raiſed hereby, as opened a pleaſing proſpect to a number of expelling the ancient plan of orthodoxy, under the name of bigotry and tyranny; which ſaid they "Degrades men from their juſt rank, into the claſs of brutes.

And the writer of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, for ſixteen years, the moſt popular author in New-England.

And he aſſerted, "That the ſcripture teaches no ſuch doctrine as that of God's <hi>imputing</hi> the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt to ſinners for juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification<note n="‡" place="bottom">His ſermons, 1755, p. 147, 417, 418.</note>" Four ſenior miniſters of Boſton joined upon this occaſion in publiſhing a teſtimony for the eſſential and eternal deity of our Saviour, and in expreſſing their grief at what had lately been publiſhed againſt it; but as they did not mention his name, he let it paſs with contempt. But his party in Connecticut ſoon after could not help diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering themſelves very plainly.</p>
               <p n="3">III. THE Baptiſt meeting at Wallingford was removed twenty miles, to Southington, four years before Mr. Whittleſey died, in 1756. Yet in two years, among twenty candidates whom they tried, they could not agree in the ſettlement of a miniſter in that pariſh. Therefore on April 26,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:018336_0235_0FA5D03C1B80E0D8"/>1758, four miniſters adviſed them to ſend to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge for a candidate; in compliance wherewith a man came, highly recommended, from thence. And in June they gave him a call to ſettle, with an offer of Two Hundred Pounds ſettlement, and a ſalary of Eighty Pounds the firſt year, Ninety the ſecond, and an Hundred a year ever after, as long as he continued their miniſter. This call he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Cambridge, where he was adviſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it; and he returned and publiſhed his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance thereof, and his ordination was appointed to be on October 11. And now we are to ſee more of what their Saybrook platform is. Like civil Courts, it does not hinder perſons and ſocieties from voluntary agreements among themſelves, where there is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet in this caſe, though much oppoſition aroſe againſt ſaid candidate, before his ordination was appointed, his party ſent for ſeveral miniſters out of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, for one out of the county of Hartford, as well as for ſuch as ſuited them in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be the ordaining Council<note n="§" place="bottom">Todd, p. 11.</note>. Before their call was given, a Juſtice of the Peace, who was a father in that church, went to talk with their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate about his doctrine; but was anſwered in a ſhort and angry manner; and the candidate ſaid, "He was too young to be examined; and if there were any objections againſt what he had delivered in preaching, he would anſwer them before the ordaining Council." To this teſtimony the Juſtice
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:018336_0236_0FA5D03CF9437838"/>has ſigned his name. Two others of the ſociety alſo certify, that they waited upon him ſome time before his ſettlement and ſalary were voted, to obtain ſatisfaction about his principles; "And particularly deſired him to let them know his ſentiments with regard to original ſin, and the ſaints perſeverance; the power of free-will, and falling from grace;" but he refuſed to tell them<note n="†" place="bottom">Eells, p. 9, 10.</note>. Therefore the Conſociation was convened at Wallingford, the day before the time appointed for his ordination, to hear and act upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint exhibited againſt ſaid candidate; but he and his party proteſted againſt their meeting at that time, and refuſed to be tried by them. And a miniſter from Hingham, in the Maſſachuſetts, and ſix more of thoſe who were ſent for, formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Council, and went into their meeting-houſe, and heard the candidate for ordination vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf, before judges that his accuſers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be tried by. Though while they were there, they received a paper, ſigned by ninety-five inhabitants of that pariſh, who were in poſſeſſion of about half the freehold eſtate therein, deſiring them not to proceed in the ordination. With this paper came a meſſage from their Conſociation, warning and beſeeching them not then to proceed: Yet in the face of all this, thoſe miniſters went on and ordained ſaid candidate, as the paſtor of that pariſh. Such an inſtance was never before known in this land; therefore their Conſociation adjourned, and called in the ſouthern Conſociation of Hartford county to act with them in the affair. But all their united efforts could not bring ſaid party to ſubmit to a trial before them; therefore, at their meeting of April 3, 1759, the ſentence of non-communion
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:018336_0237_0FA5D03DA07C96E0"/>was paſſed againſt the miniſter ſo ordained in the firſt ſociety in Wallingford, and againſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who ſhould continue with him. And the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of that county who acted in that ordination were declared to be <hi>diſorderly perſons,</hi> unworthy to ſit in any of their Councils, until they gave ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for that offence; and theſe were Joſeph Noyes, Iſaac Stiles, and Chauncy Whittleſey of New-Haven, Samuel Whittleſey of Milford, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Hall of Meriden, and Jonathan Todd of Eaſt-Guilford<note n="*" place="bottom">Eells, p. 32—48.</note>.

At the ſame time Mr. Hart (his ſecond in this affair) has recourſe to the laws of England, about the <hi>induction</hi> of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters into profitable livings, to vindicate their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of ſaid teacher at Wallingford; which word <hi>induction</hi> had been made uſe of by Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, in the Colony of New-York, to rob Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians of their rights<note n="*" place="bottom">Hobart, p. 31.</note>; becauſe it was ſaid in the Conſociation, "The conſtitution is in danger of being overſet, but it is better that the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> do it than we;" they ſaid, "It certainly muſt be a very wicked thing, to dub men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, brand them with ill names, and aſcribe to them principles that they diſclaim, only to compaſs ſome particular deſigns<note n="‡" place="bottom">Todd, p. 72.</note>." But one of their moſt knowing and candid miniſters aſſures us, that he never heard any of them ſo ſpoken of ſince, who had not the ſame character before<note n="†" place="bottom">Hobart, p. 36.</note>. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all their proceedings againſt Mr. Robbins were upon the complaints of a ſmall party, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the minds of a large majority, both of his church and congregation. And thoſe attempts were to root out a miniſter who was well ſettled; theſe were to ſettle one who had preached in the place but a few weeks before he received his call, when the oppoſition openly appeared. From all which we learn, that what they call free-will pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a power to conform to or diſpenſe with rule, divine or human, as they judge beſt, and to plead
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:018336_0240_0FA5D03FF71DAE20"/>liberty of conſcience for ſo doing. Yea, a liberty to brand diſſenters from their judgments with as many ill names as they pleaſe, but to deny that liberty to others concerning themſelves. From hence we alſo learn, that their Conſociation power over the churches, inſtead of preventing, <hi>cauſeth diviſions and offences,</hi> contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt. It now cauſed a diviſion in Wallingford, and thoſe who adhered to the ancient faith of their churches were forced to draw off, and form another church, and ſettle another miniſter; and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arm, from whence their Conſociation power was derived and is ſupported, upholds ſaid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in that place, and has called him to preach an election ſermon at Hartford, whoſe name and title now is James Dana, D. D.</p>
               <p n="5">V. THESE remarks are greatly confirmed by ſucceeding events. Sandeman's letters on Theron and Aſpaſio came out in 1758, which give thoſe teachers a moſt ſevere laſhing who point their hearers to ſomething good in themſelves, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, inſtead of Chriſt's finiſhed atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. Ebenezer White, of Danbury, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily adopted theſe ſentiments, and moſt of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers alſo; but a minor part of them were ſo much diſpleaſed therewith, as to enter a complaint againſt him to the eaſtern Aſſociation of Fairfield county. Upon hearing of which, he and a large majority of his church met June 28, 1763, and renounced the Saybroo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> platform; though they did not withdraw their fellowſhip from the churches that were under it. In Auguſt the Conſociation in that circuit met at Danbury, and viewing the caſe to be difficult, they adjourned, and called in the weſtern Conſociation of that county, to act with them. After much labour, at their meeting of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:018336_0241_0FA5D040CA1C93C8"/>March 27, 1764, they rejected Mr. White and the majority of his church, as men who had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their conſtitution; and owned the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority who adhered to it as the firſt church and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in Danbury, declaring that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from all obligations to Mr. White as their miniſter, and that the Conſociation could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him as ſuch to any other people, until he gave them ſatisfaction. But this laſt clauſe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt as unreaſonably ſevere, by five mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their number<note n="*" place="bottom">White's narrative, p. 22, 23.</note>. Mr. Izrahiah Wetmore was one of them, who in an election ſermon at Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford nine years after gave an explicit teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt any attempts to eſtabliſh the church of Chriſt by human laws. Another of them was Mr. David Judſon, of Newtown, who in 1770 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Saybrook ſcheme, as his church alſo did in 1773; and ſeveral meetings of the Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were called upon it, and pamphlets were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt them by Mr. Judſon, and for them by Mr. Robert Roſs<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1762 Mr. Roſs publiſhed a laboured piece at New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, againſt the Baptiſts and others, who had ſeparated from his party; wherein he advanced facts and arguments to prove them to be deluded enthuſiaſts. One of his plaineſt facts is, that a few fooliſh people at Wrentham, an hundred and ſixty miles from him, once ventured to appoint a time to ordain a miniſter over them, who had not conſented thereto; and they were confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. His plaineſt argument, to prove that the Baptiſts and others are a deluded people, is in theſe words, viz. "If you had not embraced ſome errors about experimental religion, why do you ſeparate FROM US!". <hi>Roſs's addreſs,</hi> p. 45, 105.</note>.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. IF we again turn our eyes to Boſton, the ſame temper preſents itſelf to view. The Separate ſociety, that began there in 1742, growing ſmall, diſmiſſed their miniſter, and diſſolved their ſociety; and a pariſh upon Caſco-Bay called and ſettled him
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:018336_0242_0FA5D0415AAFAE28"/>as their paſtor. This diſpleaſed a few of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſo much, that they brought their complaints to Boſton, in 1760; and were not only ſet off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to another pariſh, but procured a general law of the Province to prohibit the ſettling of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for the future, in their way, who had not an academical degree, or an approbation from the majority of the ſettled miniſters of the county where the pariſh lies. At the ſame time their Grand Jury, in their ſeveral County Courts, were charged by the Judges from year to year to enter complaints upon oath againſt every pariſh that neglected to ſettle and ſupport an orthodox miniſter. But about this time an Epiſcopal church was erected near the college in Cambridge, whoſe miniſter, at the opening of it, exclaimed moſt bitterly againſt the fathers of New-England, and their doctrines, and publiſhed ſome high commendations of the Epiſcopal way. This moved the popular author before named, at Boſton, to appear againſt that party. And having quoted the 9th, 11th, 13th and 17th articles of the church of England, which ſpeak of original ſin, juſtification by faith in Chriſt's imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, works done before juſtification, and of predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination and election, he ſays, "To ſpeak ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I own it is my <hi>private</hi> opinion, that it has been too common a thing for people in New-England to expreſs themſelves in a manner <hi>juſtly exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> upon theſe points, however agreeably both to the <hi>letter and ſpirit</hi> of the articles aforeſaid; but yet, I believe, not more exceptionably than many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent divines of the church of England did in the laſt century<note n="*" place="bottom">Mayhew's obſervations upon the Epiſcopal ſociety, 1763, p. 91, 92.</note>."

VII. THE eldeſt of the two brothers who were expelled out of Yale college publiſhed an eſſay at Boſton, to prove that two of this author's ſermons were erroneous, about the perſon and atonement of Chriſt. Directly upon which it was declared in ſome of the Boſton papers, "That it was as much out of character for a gentleman of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's reputation to enter into a controverſy with Mr. Cleaveland, as it would for a general of an army to accept of a challenge from a ſubaltern." To which was ſoon added, <hi>A letter of reproof to Mr. John Cleaveland, of Ipſwich, by Jonathan Mayhew,</hi> D.D. Therein the author of the eſſay was conſidered "As a perſon unworthy to be <hi>reaſoned</hi> with." Saying, "It was my determination from the firſt, not to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſpute with ſuch a <hi>wrong-headed</hi> and <hi>worſe-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch!</hi>—Had I not a right to ſpeak my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents upon theſe points? If you diſliked them, could you not content yourſelf with preaching your own?

<pb n="229" facs="unknown:018336_0244_0FA5D046606939D8"/>college, to ſend to Mr. Cleaveland a degree of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of arts, in 1764, as they afterwards did to his brother. Yet when Mayhew died June 9, 1766, Chauncy gave him a high character, in a funeral ſermon, and reflected upon his anſwerer, calling him "An obſcure perſon, without reputation;" but he could not at the ſame time conceal his own corruption.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. FOR Robert Sandeman, whoſe writings had made a great ſtir in this country, came over from Scotland, and landed at Boſton in October, 1764, and gathered a church in Boſton, another in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and a third in Danbury. Therefore, to guard againſt his influence, Chauncy publiſhed a volume of ſermons in 1765, wherein he gives his ideas concerning fundamental points in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words. Says he, "The original promiſe of life was not ſuſpended upon <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to what is commonly called <hi>the natural or moral law of God.</hi> In contradiction hereto, I know it is ſaid, by <hi>moſt</hi> Chriſtian writers, that the firſt man was ſo placed under this law, that he muſt work his way to life by <hi>perfectly</hi> doing all things commanded by it; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he could not have obtained it but by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering obedience in every point of duty, without the leaſt failure. But this is ſaid entirely without book. The ſcripture nowhere inſinuates, that he was under <hi>ſuch a covenant of works.</hi> It ſuggeſts, on the contrary, that God, in favour to him, did not put him upon ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> a trial for life. His trial, if we may believe the ſacred record of it, was in a <hi>ſingle inſtance,</hi> and this not of doing, but of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do.—That which was made the teſt of Adam's ſubjection to God, was a command not of the moral but poſitive kind; a command, not deducible from reaſon, but known only by revelation.—It
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:018336_0245_0FA5D0469D079078"/>would be the exact truth, ſhould I ſay, that the firſt parents of men, while innocent, in common with their poſterity ſince the elapſe, could have obtained life in no way but that <hi>of grace through faith.</hi>" And after a laboured criticiſm upon Rom. v. 12, he ſays, "The judicial ſentence of God, occaſioned by the offence of one man, is that which faſtens <hi>death,</hi> with all its natural cauſes and appendages, upon the human kind; and 'tis IN CONSEQUENCE of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, UPON mens coming into exiſtence under the diſadvantages ariſing from it, that they <hi>ſin</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy's twelve ſermons, p. 18—20, 23.</note>." This is his account, accented in this manner. From whence we may ſee, that his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were contrary to moſt Chriſtian writers about original righteouſneſs, original ſin, the nature of grace, and the juſtice of God in his government of the world. For the moral law is to love God with all our powers, and to love our neighbours as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which can never be called <hi>ſevere,</hi> without implicitly denying his infinite excellency and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And though the precept concerning the forbidden fruit could only be known by pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, yet by violating of it man revolted from heaven, and ſeized upon the earth as his own; and we are all born in that ſtate of revolt, which is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin. And grace and works are as diſtinct as <hi>wages</hi> and <hi>gifts,</hi> Rom. vi. 23, xi. 6. Wages can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly claimed but upon doing the work; while the moſt proper ſubjects of gifts are ſuch as are ſenſibly guilty and helpleſs. Neither can the juſtice of God, in ſending death upon infants, be clearly vindicated in any other way, than by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as ſinners in our firſt public head. And to deny God's right to conſtitute him as ſuch, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly

               <p n="1">I. DIVISIONS and perverſe diſputings, in all parts of the land, brought the churches into terrible circumſtances; and each party were ready to caſt the blame of it upon others. And a national war began in 1755, which ever tends to corrupt the morals, as well as to deſtroy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and lives of men. Its influence was very extenſive; and it iſſued in February, 1763, in the ceſſion of the whole continent of America North of the Miſſiſippi to the Crown of Great-Britain; a vaſt territory indeed. Many rejoiced greatly upon this occaſion, imagining that our wars, which for near a century had been frequent and very diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, were now come to an end. But, alas! to the whole Britiſh empire, theſe were but the beginning of ſorrows. Upon the conqueſt of Quebec, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Wentworth, of New-Hampſhire, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a public thankſgiving upon Saturday, Nov. 10,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:018336_0247_0FA5D048388CAB58"/>1759, becauſe it was the birth-day of an aged and good King; and he ſaid in his proclamation, "The miniſters of the goſpel are hereby directed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form divine ſervice, in their reſpective congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the morning only, the afternoon being devoted to public <hi>rejoicings,</hi> and lawful <hi>diverſions.</hi>" But when the day came, inſtead of rejoicings, the Governor had to mourn over the dead corps of his only ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Langdon's ſermon on ſaid day, p. 45, 46.</note>. And on October 25, 1760, that aged and good King was taken from the nation. When the news of it arrived, the paſtor of the ſecond Baptiſt church in Boſton preached from thoſe words of Solomon, <hi>Wo to thee, O land, when thy King is a child;</hi> which is a truth that others have had occaſion to remember ſince. And becauſe the great reformation, in and after the year 1740, was begun and mainly carried on among Pedobaptiſts, many had aſſerted that the Baptiſt principles always came in at the tail of a reformation, when the life of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was gone, and people were for ſettling down upon the bare letter of ſcripture. For a dozen years, this argument was much harped upon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was ſilenced in theſe parts by clear evidence to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE ſecond Baptiſt church in Middleborough ordained their paſtor on January 26, 1758. And our third church in the town was formed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized in 1761. And though we have three meeting-houſes of our denomination in this town, yet the neareſt are nine miles apart, and the fartheſt above eleven. On April 1, 1761, Mr. William Carpenter, and his church at Norton, were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Baptiſt order, and he enjoyed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable bleſſing upon his labours both there and
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:018336_0248_0FA5D048F8A73450"/>in Attleborough, and ſome revivings were granted in ſeveral other parts of the land. But a much greater work came on in June, 1762, in the third Baptiſt church in Middleborough, and prevailed through the year, and extended its bleſſings into other ſocieties and denominations. The ſubjects of this work diſcovered much more of fruitfulneſs in their underſtandings, and good government of their paſſions, than appeared in the revival twenty years before. And it was very evident, that the labours of Baptiſt miniſters were the chief means of beginning and carrying on this work; which was powerful, undoubtedly, to the ſaving benefit of many ſouls. And though the world ſaid, they ſpent ſo much time in religious exerciſes, that they would all ſtarve, or come to want and miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the contrary was remarkably demonſtrated, by the diſpenſations of Providence: For in many places almoſt the whole ſtaff of bread was cut off, by a ſevere drought; while a few ſeaſonable ſhowers, in the parts where people were ſo much engaged in religion, cauſed not only a good ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for themſelves, but alſo a large quantity to impart to others the next ſpring. This was very convincing to many. Divine influences upon the ſouls of men were more extenſively granted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Near the cloſe of 1763, ſuch a work began under Mr. Cleaveland's miniſtry in Ipſwich, as cauſed the addition of ninety communicants to his church, in leſs than a year. A like bleſſing was granted in Providence and in Norwich, and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er one on the eaſt end of Long-Iſland, of which Mr. Buell publiſhed a narrative. The work ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to New-York, New-Jerſey, and elſewhere. The beginning and progreſs of a revival at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock was alſo very remarkable. As Mr. Noah
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:018336_0249_0FA5D049AB0444A0"/>Alden paſſed through the town in December, 1763, he preached a ſermon to a few people, one of whom had been a chief leader in mirth and frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, among young people there: But God was pleaſed to direct an arrow of conviction to his heart, which ended in converſion in March, 1764. No ſooner did this news come abroad, than four of his former companions went one evening to try if they could not draw him back to his former ways again. He willingly retired with them to an adjacent ſchool-houſe, where they ſpent the evening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But, inſtead of turning him back to vanity, he prevailed with them to appoint a religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next week, which led on to others of that kind, until a large harveſt of ſouls was granted there. And who could help rejoicing, to ſee a large number of young people turned from lying vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to an earneſt engagement in religion, and the great affairs of the ſoul and eternity! Yet the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and profeſſors with whom they met for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, finding that a cold formality could not give them ſatisfaction, appointed a faſt, and called in the neighbouring miniſters to aſſiſt therein; who fell to exclaiming againſt falſe teachers, Satan's turning himſelf into an angel of light, ſeparations, Anabaptiſm, &amp;c. which plainly taught thoſe young believers, that edification, the great end of Chriſtian ſociety, was not to be enjoyed in that way. And being convinced of the truth of believers bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, a church was conſtituted in that order in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1766; and on May 29, 1768, the man who had been their chief leader from vanity to real reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ordained their paſtor; under whoſe miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions great bleſſings have been granted ſince. And ſuch a door is now opening for the removal of ancient prejudices, as had not been before in many ages.</p>

III. THE covenant of circumciſion gave thoſe who were born in it a right to treat all others, both as to worſhip and commerce, as no others had any right to treat them. A right to office alſo in that church was hereditary. When our Saviour came, he fulfilled the law both moral and ceremonial, and aboliſhed thoſe hereditary diſtinctions among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But in the centuries following, deceitful philoſophy took away the name which God has given to that covenant (Acts vii. 8) and added the name <hi>grace</hi> to it; from whence came the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that <hi>dominion is founded in grace.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this latter name has been exploded by many, yet the root of it has been tenaciouſly held faſt and taught in all colleges and ſuperior places of learning, as far as Chriſtianity has extended, until the preſent time; whereby natural affection, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, temporal intereſt, and ſelf righteouſneſs, the ſtrongeſt prejudices in the world, have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to bind people in that way, and to bar their minds againſt equal liberty and believers baptiſm. But the writings of our learned miniſters in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have communicated much light in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; to which more was added by the travels and labours of our ſouthern fathers and brethren. And hereby the Philadelphia Aſſociation<note n="*" place="bottom">A yearly meeting of the Baptiſt churches in thoſe parts, which began in 1707.</note> obtained ſuch an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehenſion that it was practicable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Iſland, under the chief direction of the Baptiſts; wherein education might be promoted, and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or learning obtained, free of any ſectarian religious teſts. And Mr. James Manning, who took his firſt degree in New-Jerſey college in September,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:018336_0251_0FA5D04B400F51E0"/>1762, was eſteemed a ſuitable leader in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant work. Therefore on a voyage to Halifax, in July, 1763, he called in at Newport, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the affair to the Honorable Samuel Ward, John Gardner, Joſias Lyndon, and other Baptiſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and friends; who readily concurred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and entered upon the uſe of means to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it. And notwithſtanding ſecret contrivances and ſome open attempts againſt it, an ample char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the purpoſe was granted by their Legiſlature, in February, 1764. In the ſummer following Mr. Manning removed to Warren, to preach to a ſociety newly formed there, and to begin the ſchool. In September, 1765, he was choſen Preſident of the college, and on September 7, 1769, ſeven young gentlemen took their firſt degrees therein, and it was removed to Providence the next ſpring, where a further account of it may be given hereafter. Mr. Hezekiah Smith, a claſs-mate with Mr. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, having travelled and laboured in the goſpel as far ſouthward as Georgia, returned and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to New-England in the ſpring of 1764, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to preach in the pulpits of Pedobaptiſts, in Providence, Rehoboth, Attleborough, Ipſwich, Newbury and other places, with an evident bleſſing upon his labours. He expected to have returned to New-Jerſey in the fall; but a vacant pariſh in Haverhill prevailed with him to alter his purpoſe, ſo as to ſtay and preach with them. Hereupon ſome miniſters, who had freely received him as an itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant miniſter, turned and exerted all their influence againſt him. Yet many ſeals were granted to his miniſtry, and a Baptiſt church was formed in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhill, on May 9, 1765, and he became their paſtor, before which there was but one ſmall Baptiſt church in any part of our country northward of

               <p n="4">IV. DR. Benjamin Lord publiſhed a diſcourſe in 1763, wherein he ſays, "Some few, I perceive, begin to hearken to corrupt doctrines, which tend to their renouncing of their infant baptiſm, and their intereſt in the very ancient covenant with Abraham and his ſeed; which you may be aſſured is a dangerous road, and often iſſueth very fatally, —witneſs the Anabaptiſts in Germany, 240 years ago, and others ſince<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſcourſe on ſober madneſs, p. 16, 17.</note>." Directly upon which, he, with ſix other miniſters, made ſome additions to Dickinſon's dialogue, and got it re-printed at Providence. In a preface to it, they ſay, "It ſeems people do not think in ſeaſon what a ſinful, God-provoking and ſoul-deſtroying evil it is, to break over God's inſtitutions: Firſt be wavering, unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, not ſtedfaſt in any right principles, nor in the covenant in which their infant baptiſm declares them to be; and then break covenant, and ſeparate themſelves, as being in their own eſteem holie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is hid from them, that evil men and ſeducers wax worſe and worſe: It is hid from them, or rather they will not ſee, that they have fell into the way of Cain, and are in danger of periſhing in the gainſaying of Core." A ſight of which, from the miniſter where the author was born, and from whom he ſeparated, moved him to ſend the Doctor a printed letter in 1764, to open the injuſtice and abuſive nature of ſuch treatment of mankind; to which he returned no anſwer, but has ſince been more friendly to the Baptiſts than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As Dr. Gill had anſwered ſaid dialogue, a copy of this new edition was ſent to him. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:018336_0253_0FA5D04CB81404A0"/>to it was made in theſe words, viz. ſay they, "St. Irenaeus, who lived about 114 years after the death of Chriſt, being the diſciple of St. Polycarp, who was the diſciple of St. John the Evangeliſt, ſays, in his epiſtle, <hi>ad.</hi> Rom. <hi>lib.</hi> 5, <hi>The church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a tradition from the apoſtles, to adminiſter bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to little children, or infants.</hi> By <hi>tradition</hi> (ſay theſe miniſters) the ancients meant the word of God, agreeable to that of the apoſtle, 2 Theſſ. ii. 15, iii. 6.<note n="*" place="bottom">Said dialogue, p. 5.</note>." Upon a ſight of this Dr. Gill pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an advertiſement, in the end of the London edition of his reply to Clark, wherein he charges this paſſage as a <hi>forgery,</hi> and challenges the whole literary world to produce or point out any ſuch paſſage in the writings of Irenaeus, if they can; and ſaid, "What a wretched cauſe muſt infant baptiſm be, to require ſuch management as this!" Various methods have been taken to wipe off this reproach, if poſſible. The firſt I heard of was, that thoſe miniſters ſent to Yale college, and there found a Latin tranſlation of Irenaeus, which had that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in it. I was afterwards told, by one of their moſt learned miniſters, that the controverſy turned upon men's different opinions about the meaning of a Greek word or two; which therefore could not properly be called a forgery. But in 1781 Mr. Moſes Hemmingway, of Wells, publiſhed a piece upon infant baptiſm, wherein he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, that it was only a ſlip of memory in thoſe miniſters to write Irenaeus, when Origen was the perſon intended; and therefore that Dr. Gill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a very bad temper, in making ſuch a noiſe about ſo harmleſs a miſtake. To which I reply, that thoſe miniſters name Origen in their next para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:018336_0254_0FA5D04D94A79518"/>and ſay he lived about 190 years after Chriſt. And how came a miniſter 180 miles from them to know that they meant Origen, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted paſſage, when it does not appear that they ever knew it themſelves! However, the uſe of the ſecular arm has ever been their worſt argument.</p>
               <p n="5">V. WHEN the Legiſlature at Boſton broke in upon their own exempting law, in 1752, the Baptiſts were ſo much alarmed as to call ſeveral meetings, and to elect Mr. John Proctor their agent, to carry their caſe to England; and they ſubſcribed above an Hundred Pounds therefor; and he drew a remonſtrance upon the ſubject, which was preſented to the Aſſembly at Boſton, in May, 1754. It ſtated matters ſo plainly, that a motion was made by ſome to take the ſigners of it into cuſtody; but Governor Shirley, newly returned from Europe, convinced them of the impolicy of ſuch a ſtep; and then they appointed a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to confer in a friendly way with the Baptiſts; and matters were ſhifted along, until the war came on, and their deſign for England was dropt. At length all their exempting laws for Baptiſts and Quakers expired, and the Aſſembly of November 23, 1757, made a new one, wherein both deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations were again included in one act. By it no Baptiſts were to be exempted from miniſterial taxes, in the places where they lived, "But ſuch whoſe names ſhall be contained in a liſt or liſts, to be taken and exhibited on or before the 20th of July annually, to the aſſeſſors of ſuch town, diſtrict, precinct or pariſh, and ſigned by three principal members of the Anabaptiſt church to which he or they belong, and the miniſter thereof, if any there be, who ſhall therein certify, that the perſons whoſe names are inſerted in the ſaid liſt or liſts are really
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:018336_0255_0FA5D04E4C0D4FD8"/>belonging thereto; that they verily believe them to be conſcientiouſly of their perſuaſion, and that they frequently and uſually attend public worſhip in ſaid church on the Lord's days:" And the like was required of the Quakers. It was continued in force 13 years; and no tongue nor pen can fully deſcribe all the evils that were practiſed under it. Only becauſe a difficulty aroſe, in 1763, between the third Baptiſt church in Middleborough and their miniſter, ſo as prevent his ſigning a new certificate for them, they were all taxed to the pariſh worſhip. And though, after diſtreſs was made upon ſome, they were adviſed to apply to Plymouth Court for help; yet, inſtead of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any, they took Twenty Dollars more from them. And this was but a trifle, compared with what was done at Haverhill. For on May 23, 1765, a paper was given to their pariſh aſſeſſors, which ſaid, "This may inform you, that we who have formed ourſelves into a Baptiſt church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of this government reſpecting Baptiſts, called by ſome Anabaptiſts, do hereby certify, that we verily believe that Major Edmond Moors, and Mr. John White, merchant, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly of our perſuaſion, and that they do frequently and uſually attend public worſhip with us on the Lord's days." Signed by the miniſter and three principal members. Yet after this was given, the firſt pariſh in ſaid town met, and voted a large ſum of money to build them a new meeting-houſe; and taxed the Baptiſts with the reſt, to pay both that and the pariſh miniſter's ſalary. And on September 15, 1766, they ſeized a large quantity of Mr. White's goods for that tax. For this he ſued the Aſſeſſors, at their County Court in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but the action was continued till March, and
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:018336_0256_0FA5D04EDC444C30"/>then was carried up to their Superior Court by way of demur. It was to have been tried at Ipſwich, in June, 1767; but it was then put off, becauſe two Baptiſt gentlemen, a Major and a Captain, were not allowed to be witneſſes of plain facts, concerning the ſeizure of ſaid goods; neither could a few hours be obtained, though requeſted, to fetch other witneſſes from Haverhill. Their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then moved for an agreement, to have the caſe tried the next term, and that the ſame ſhould be a final trial. This was concurred with, and the agreement was entered by the clerk of the Court. The next term was at Salem, in November, when, after a fair and full hearing, the jury found for the Baptiſts Thirty Pounds damages and coſts. This was immediately complained of as exceſſive high; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, rather than not have the matter ſettled, Mr. White conſented to remit Twelve Pounds of it; and the Court gave judgment to have the reſt paid. Yet the lawyers prevailed to have it referred to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Court, whether they ſhould not have another trial. And finally, in June, 1769, another trial was brought on, and the caſe was turned againſt the Baptiſts; which in all coſt them about Eighty Pounds. The reaſon given for violating an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Court, about a final trial, was that it was a matter of great conſequence. And the plea which finally prevailed was built upon the ambiguous clauſe, belonging thereto, in their certificate law. It might mean a baptized church member, or only a ſteady worſhipper therewith. The Court owned that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atter was the intent of the law; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe words were not in their certificate, though that meaning was full in it, the caſe was turned againſt the Baptiſts. And the reaſon given againſt admitting any of them as witneſs of plain
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:018336_0257_0FA5D04FB3C80310"/>facts, was becauſe they were parties concerned; that is, becauſe the Congregationaliſts are the majority, they may violate their promiſes to the minority, in matters of great importance; and may conſtrue words as they pleaſe, and refuſe to allow the minority to be ſo much as witneſſes of plain facts, becauſe, forſooth, the majority are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned!</p>
               <p n="6">VI. THE noiſe about this caſe reached as far as Philadelphia, and enquiry was made from thence, what it meant? We were told that a noted miniſter, in New-England, wrote for anſwer, that where the Baptiſts could get the power, they were as bad oppreſſors as thoſe they complained ſo much of; which ſtory was framed from the following actions. On September 11, 1765, a Baptiſt miniſter was ordained in South-Brimfield, whoſe preaching was agreeable to ſome Pedobaptiſts near him, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked a miniſter then ordained in the eaſt part of that diſtrict, of their denomination. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore got ſome of the Baptiſts to join with them in a petition for a new pariſh there. Upon which the Aſſembly at Boſton, January 15, 1766, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated the weſt part of ſaid diſtrict into a new pariſh, inveſted with all the powers and privileges, and ſubjected to all the duties of other pariſhes, without any mention of the Baptiſts in the whole act. Hereupon the majority of this pariſh made a tax for the Baptiſt miniſter, the moſt of whoſe church lived without thoſe bounds; and ſome within never concurred therewith. When the year came round, thoſe Pedobaptiſts moved to have the Baptiſt meeting-houſe voted to be the pariſh meeting-houſe; and becauſe they would not thus give away a valuable houſe, built for a Baptiſt church, and chiefly by men who did not live in
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:018336_0258_0FA5D0505872F110"/>that pariſh, the firſt movers in ſaid taxing ſcheme refuſed to pay their own tax. A gentleman from Boſton was then their collector; and, ſeeing the matter muſt be tried, he told me that he reſolved to act impartially; and therefore made diſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Baptiſt, who had ever oppoſed that ſcheme, and upon one of the other party. The caſe was then carried to Springfield Court, where it was ſoon turned againſt the Baptiſt miniſter; and why? he had ſtudied both Greek and Latin, but he had neither an academical degree, nor an approbation from the majority of the miniſters in that county, which was their legal teſt of orthodoxy. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the beloved paſtor of that church, until he finiſhed his courſe with joy, Auguſt 5, 1769; after which that church ſent a confeſſion abroad, among their brethren, of their fault in not oppoſing ſaid taxing ſcheme as they ought to have done, a copy whereof is before me. How mean then was the pretence, that the Baptiſts hereby diſcovered as bad an inclination as their opponents did! And as great meanneſs was diſcovered at Haverhill. The want of learned miniſters often been caſt as a reproach upon the Baptiſt churches; but when ſuch an one was obtained there, all manner of evil reports concerning him could not ſuffice, without many inſtances of perſonal abuſe. A beetle was caſt at him as he was walking the ſtreet one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he took up and carried to his lodgings. Alſo a ſtone, large enough to kill him, was caſt through a window near his head, where he was in bed. And his enemies went ſo far as to cut off his horſe's mane and tail in the night, and to ſet up a paper upon the door where he quartered, threatening worſe treatment to him if he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; and as he went preach at Solomon Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell's,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:018336_0259_0FA5D0558E8F2470"/>in Bradford, Amos Milliken, a Sheriff, came at the head of a mob to prevent it. And as Mr. Smith was going to begin the worſhip of God, the chair he ſtood behind was ſnatched away; and the man of the houſe tried in vain to quell the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and to command peace in his own houſe. At length Mr. Smith, with undaunted reſolution, engaged in his public work, and the rioters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and gave no further diſturbance to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. And though ſome of them laid wait for him in the evening, yet it was ſo ordered that he did not return home, until the coldneſs of the air forced them to quit their cruel deſign. After Mr. Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell's deceaſe, his widow, who alſo was of the Baptiſt ſociety in Haverhill, and had the ſame certified to Bradford aſſeſſors, yet was taxed to their pariſh worſhip. And late in a winter evening ſhe was ſeized for it, and carried ſome miles; and then, calling at an inn, ſhe was prevailed upon to pay the tax; after which ſhe was left to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eturn home, in the dead of the night, through froſt and ſnow, to her three ſmall fatherleſs children. Alſo the widow Mary Corlis, of Haverhill, a member of the Baptiſt church there, had one of her cattle taken away for a miniſterial tax. "Thus, ſays ſhe, I was oppreſſed, in a Province where there is an univerſal cry for LIBERTY! the cry of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and fatherleſs they regard not!" So far from it, that further attempts were now made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the reſentment of the ruling party againſt all diſſenters from their woſhip.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. A BOOK was publiſhed in 1767, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through New-England, wherein it was ſaid of the Baptiſt churches in general, "They little think, as I charitably believe, how far they join with the <hi>gates of hell,</hi> in oppoſing the church of
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:018336_0260_0FA5D055B15EF638"/>Chriſt, by laying waſte the nurſery, out of which his vineyard is ſupplied<note n="*" place="bottom">Fiſh's nine ſermons, p. 95.</note>." As if natural growth could fit children for Chriſtian communion; or, that a requiring fruits meet for repentance, in order for admiſſion thereto, were a deſtroying of them. In the ſame book were many odious reports concerning the ſeparations in and after 1744, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of which were not true in fact; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a plea in favour of thoſe people, that they are not ſuch now, the writer ſays, "It is readily granted, that they are now much more moderate and civil than they were in that day, are very peaceable, kind, obliging, good neighbours.—But what does this reaſoning argue? Why it only ſhows that they have loſt degree of their own <hi>original ſpirit, as Separates</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 158.</note>." And yet he began his preface with ſaying, "The ſpecial occaſion of the following diſcourſes was, the <hi>revival of the ſpirit</hi> and principles of Separation and Anabaptiſm." According therefore to his own teſtimony, they were peaceable, kind, obliging, good neighbours, after that ſpirit was revived. Neither were his party any more conſiſtent with themſelves in a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing publication. For upon the Britiſh claims of taxing America, an evident deſign was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy therein; to guard againſt which, it was ſaid in 1768, "We are, in principle, againſt all civil eſtabliſhments in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.—It does not appear to us, that God has entruſted the State with a right to make religious eſtabliſhments. If the State in England has this delegated authority, muſt it not be owned, that the State in China, in Turky, in Spain, has this authority alſo?—And as they muſt ſeverally be ſuppoſed to exert this authority in eſtabliſhments
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:018336_0261_0FA5D0570C070290"/>conformable to their own ſentiments in religion, what can the conſequence be but infinite damage to the cauſe of God and true religion? And ſuch in fact has been the conſequence of theſe eſtabliſhments IN ALL AGES, AND ALL PLACES<note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy againſt Chandler, p. 152, 153.</note>." And this publication appeared of ſuch importance, to the annual Aſſociation of miniſters from all parts of Connecticut, in June, 1768, that they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a letter of thanks to Dr. Chauncy therefor, in a Boſton news-paper. Yet, for theſe forty years, he has wrote the moſt to uphold their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhments in New-England, of any man upon earth. And a ſtill greater demonſtration of the pernicious effects thereof is before us.</p>

               <p n="1">1. A GRANT was made in 1735, to Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer Hunt and others, of a townſhip ſix miles ſquare, weſtward of Deerfield. A plan of it
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:018336_0262_0FA5D0572ECB56F0"/>was to be drawn in ſixty-three equal ſhares; one of which was to be for their firſt miniſter, one for the miniſtry, and one for the ſchool; and certain improvements were to be made upon each of the other ſhares, within three years after the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plan. They were alſo to ſettle a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed orthodox miniſter, and to build and finiſh a convenient meeting-houſe for public worſhip. By reaſon of ſucceeding wars, the planting of that place was delayed until 1751. In the mean time a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was entered to the church in South-Hadly, that one of their members had propagated a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful lie concerning Chileab Smith, a father therein. But the complaint was diſregarded, which moved him to enquire into the conſtitution of the church; and, to his ſurprize, though the words of their covenant implied a profeſſion of ſaving faith, yet he found that ſuch a profeſſion was not held to be neceſſary in order for their communion. He then laboured to convince the church that this was a dangerous error: and, being invited, he went to a meeting of miniſters at Hatfield, Auguſt 6, 1750, and laid before the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many ſcriptural reaſons againſt it. But they gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him no ſatisfaction, only refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to Mr. Edwards, who was diſmiſſed from Northampton two months before, for rejecting that principle. Edwards approved of Smith's reaſons againſt it, but not of a ſeparation therefor. But as Smith judged otherwiſe, he openly withdrew from ſaid church; and in 1751 he removed to Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, with eight children, when there were but two or three families therein. Others came in ſoon after, and lived without public worſhip for ſome time; and then eternal concernments were ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened to his mind, that he called the inhabitants together, and prayed with, and expounded the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:018336_0263_0FA5D057E1435D98"/>to them, to ſuch good purpoſe that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and many others were hopefully converted. In November, 1753, his eldeſt ſon was called to preach the goſpel; and, with great hazard and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, they kept their ſtation, and maintained pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, through a bloody Indian war of ſeven years continuance; near the cloſe whereof they were led into believers baptiſm, and became an organized church on Auguſt 20, 1761; by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Killingly, Sturbridge, and Stafford; and by the cloſe of that year the church increaſed to twenty-four members, half of whom were males.</p>
               <p n="2">II. IN 1762, a State tax was impoſed upon that plantation; and as the law exempts all ſettled mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters therefrom, two of their aſſeſſors allowed their miniſter that privilege. But, for this, the other aſſeſſor entered a complaint againſt them to Springfield Court. The Baptiſts deſired time to prove that their miniſter was regularly ordained; but the Court refuſed it, or to allow of any appeal from their judgment; and extorted a large fine and coſts from them, for not taxing their miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to law. When he was ordained, there were but five families, out of nineteen in the place, againſt him; but, the danger of the war being over, others moved in, and in February, 1763, they ordained Mr. Jacob Sherwin over that party; and not only gave him all the privileges of the firſt miniſter of the town, but alſo an Hundred Pounds ſettlement and Sixty-four Pounds a year ſalary, to which they added a large ſum to build them a meeting-houſe, and taxed the Baptiſt miniſter and his people with others to pay it. The plantation being only a proprietyſhip, it was ſaid the exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law for Baptiſts did not extend there; and when it was incorporated in 1765, by the name of
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:018336_0264_0FA5D058BB32BD48"/>Aſhfield, the word <hi>ſupport</hi> was artfully inſerted, which had no place in their original grant, nor in the incorporating acts of the towns of Charlemont and Laneſborough, paſſed at the ſame ſeſſion. New taxes were hereupon impoſed upon the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts in Aſhfield, to ſupport a miniſter whom they never choſe; but their oppreſſors at length found themſelves enſnared in the work of their own hands. For proprietors and inhabitants are two diſtinct bodies of men in law, governed by different rules; the votes of the latter being equal, but of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer according to their intereſt; ſo that the vote of a proprietor, who owns five hundred acres, is equal to ten inhabitants who own but fifty acres a piece; and by their act of incorporation, the power of taxation in Aſhfield was put into the hands of the inhabitants and proprietors, both of whom could not do it together, nor either of them apart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that act.</p>
               <p n="3">III. THIS confuſion afforded ſome reſpite to the Baptiſts; but hearing of further deſigns againſt them, they came to the Aſſembly at Boſton, of May 25, 1768, with a memorial of their ſervices and ſufferings in promoting that plantation, and a prayer for a full exemption from taxes to a worſhip that they did not join with. A committee of three was appointed upon it; two of whom brought in a report to grant the petition: But Edſon, their Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was for giving time to their oppoſites to bring in objections; and to him the Aſſembly hearkened and on May 31 ordered that the clerks of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and proprietors of Aſhfield ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of this memorial, that they might bring in objections againſt it, on the ſecond Tueſday of the next ſeſſion of the Aſſembly, and that the further collection of taxes from the petitioners ſhould be
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:018336_0265_0FA5D059C3CE3E40"/>ſuſpended in the mean time. Col. Iſrael Williams was received a repreſentative from Hatfield the next day, who was the moſt reſolute judge in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſhfield aſſeſſors in 1762; and before the cloſe of this ſeſſion a new act was paſſed which took the power of taxation out of the hands of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Aſhfield, three years after the town was incorporated, and impowered the proprietors to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what taxes they judged proper, for the <hi>ſupport</hi> of their miniſter, as well as other uſes; and to lay the ſame wholly upon the lands, in whoſe hands ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might be, which were to be ſold, if the owners refuſed to pay the tax. This was done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame influence which has ſince involved the nation in blood and confuſion. For in the preceding winter our Aſſembly came into a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to write letters to ſiſter Colonies, to requeſt them to unite in the uſe of prudent means againſt the attempts that were making, to bring America to be taxed where they were not repreſented. On June 30, our Houſe of Repreſentatives were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to <hi>reſcind</hi> that reſolution; which Edſon, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, and fifteen more, voted to do; But ninety-two members rejected that arbitrary mandate, one of whom was Captain Benjamin White, a Baptiſt, repreſentative from Middleborough. For this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtand againſt tyranny, that Houſe was diſſolved, and no other called through the year; ſo that the Baptiſts could have no hearing, while power was on the ſide of their oppreſſors, who advertiſed their lands to be ſold on May 3, 1769. But when they met, ſuch defects were pointed out in their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that the ſale was omitted; and each party came with memorials to the Aſſembly of May 31. Contentions betwixt the Houſe and the Governor ſerved as an excuſe for not hearing the Baptiſts, but
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:018336_0266_0FA5D05A56197880"/>their oppreſſors were heard; and on July 5 it was reſolved, "That all the votes and tranſactions of the ſaid town of Aſhfield, in their ſeveral town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetings, ſince their incorporation to this time, be and are hereby ratified and confirmed; any omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or neglect of making due and proper returns on the ſeveral warrants for calling the ſame meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or any of them, notwithſtanding." Williams and Leonard (two of the Mandamus Counſellors in 1774) were of the committee who framed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, though it was not paſſed into a law. July 15 the Aſſembly was prorogued to January, and in the mean time a new tax was impoſed in Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and the Baptiſt lands were advertiſed to be ſold April 4, 1770. In January they ſent to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, but the Aſſembly was prorogued to March 15, when they ſat at Cambridge, but did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Baptiſts petition until the 27th, and it was diſmiſſed April 4, the day their lands were to be ſold. Some friends in Boſton laid the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hereof before ſome of the members ſo plainly, that their petition was reſumed on April 10; but inſtead of then granting any relief, they were only put to more coſts, to notify their oppreſſors to bring in objections. On April 4 the Aſſeſſors of Aſhfield met, and ſold three hundred and ninety-eight acres of the Baptiſts lands to ſupport the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the oppoſite party. For a demand upon the Baptiſt miniſter of One Pound Two Shillings, they ſold ten acres of his home-lot. His father had one of the beſt orchards in the town, which is of ſpecial ſervice in a new place; yet twenty acres of improved land, containing the main of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, with a burying-yard, and a ſmall dwelling-houſe, were ſtruck off to Elijah Wells, for Thirty-five Shillings; who on May 4 came and forcibly
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:018336_0267_0FA5D05AEC3B5570"/>entered upon it, and meaſured it off; and the next day came and pulled up a number of the ſmaller apple-trees, and carried them away, and offered to ſell ſaid houſe. Theſe facts were proved by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of witneſſes before authority, though, to ſhift off the odium they were expoſed to, by a new ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, they left out the houſe and burying-yard, and then accuſed the Baptiſts of falſhood in the firſt account. But nothing better could be expected, from men who could deal ſo unjuſtly, and could laugh at a mock-ſermon, delivered by Wells upon that occaſion, which breathed as great cruelty as words could expreſs. Repeated applications were made to the Legiſlature for help, but in vain; and the Baptiſt agent was at laſt told plainly, that it was not worth while to wait any longer, for they would keep them under the law by which thoſe lands were ſold, as long as they ſaw fit. Receiving ſuch a plain declaration from a member of the Aſſembly, in the preſence of others, he went and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Baptiſt miniſters of Boſton therewith, who thought proper to publiſh an advertiſement to all the Baptiſts in this Province, dated July 31, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting them to bring in exact accounts of their caſes and ſufferings to their enſuing Aſſociation<note n="*" place="bottom">A yearly meeting of their churches, began at Warren, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 8, 1767, called <hi>The Warren Aſſociation.</hi>
                  </note>, "Where meaſures will be reſolutely adopted, for obtaining redreſs from another quarter than that to which repeated application hath been made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfully. Nay, complaints, however juſt and grievous, have been treated with indifference, and ſcarcely, if at all, credited." Accounts were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly brought to a meeting of fifteen churches at Bellingham, September 11, who unanimouſly reſolved to apply to the King in Council for relief,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:018336_0268_0FA5D05B9EB4C378"/>if it could not be obtained here; and they made choice of agents and a committee for the purpoſe; and wrote to their ſouthern brethren for aſſiſtance in the deſign. This alarmed ſome politicians at Boſton, who urged the Baptiſts to preſent an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to our Legiſlature, and they promiſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their influence in their favour. A memorial was therefore drawn, and was ſigned in behalf of the Baptiſt churches, by their miniſters at Boſton and Haverhill; wherein the late teſtimony of our Aſſembly, againſt the taxing of people where they are not repreſented, was commended, and this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was pleaded for in the church, and in particular that the ſaid Aſhfield law might be repealed, and their property be reſtored; that others who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in ſuch ways might recover damages, and equal religious liberty be allowed to all. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this was received by the Aſſembly at Cambridge, a piece was publiſhed from thence, dated Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 22, 1770, repreſenting that the Baptiſts had complained without any juſt reaſon at all, and that it would be ſerviceable to have an authentic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Aſhfield affair publiſhed. And, after many great ſwelling words about the charity and lenity of theſe times, the writer ſaid, "It was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to moſt people among us, to hear the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper complaints exhibited by the Baptiſts; they could not ſo much as gueſs from whence they could ariſe." This was inſerted in three or four Boſton papers. And then, on November 15, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gave orders that Aſhfield proprietors ſhould be notified to bring in objections againſt the firſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Baptiſts memorial, to their next ſeſſion. And their old certificate law being out of date, a new one was framed, which changed their title to Antipedobaptiſts, and changed the time of giving
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:018336_0269_0FA5D05C701ADD78"/>in certificates to the firſt of September; which were to be ſigned by three or more principal members, and the miniſter, if there be any. The word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was to be uſed inſtead of the word church; and the pariſhes were empowered to vote the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts clear, if they pleaſed, without certificates. But the word conſcientiouſly was ſtill retained, and the certificates were required to be given in annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to pariſh aſſeſſors.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. MR. Davis, clerk of their committee, now called them together; and, upon examination, they declared themſelves not ſatisfied with this law, and they adviſed Davis to anſwer the Cambridge piece. He did ſo, in the Maſſachuſetts Gazette of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 27, by giving a plain and conciſe view of the Aſhfield affair, and aſſerting that it was the SOLE cauſe of their complaining publicly at this time; and ſigned himſelf, A BAPTIST. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of any fair reply, a writer appeared in the Boſton Evening-Poſt, of January 7, 1771, ſaying, "There is a little upſtart gentleman, lately ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in town, who calls himſelf A BAPTIST; and the youth diſcovers a moſt inſufferable arrogance and ſelf-ſufficiency.—I very much ſuſpect, that he is one of thoſe deluded young men, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to defame and blacken the Colonies, and this town and Province in particular.—I am of the ſame perſuaſion in religion with this young hero,— and I cannot ſay what the General Aſſembly could do for the Baptiſts in general, or the Aſhfield bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in particular, that they have not done.—And I believe this is the opinion of Baptiſts in general, and of all others but enthuſiaſtical bigots." And he had the impudence to annex to this, and much more of the ſame kind, the ſignature of A CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC BAPTIST. When Mr. Davis came to ſee it,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:018336_0270_0FA5D05D2AEC3478"/>he ſaid he would never put pen to paper to anſwer ſuch mean and dirty ſtuff. In the gazette of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary 7 came out another piece, from a miniſter near Aſhfield, ſuppoſed to be of Deerfield, who ſaid, "It is a very common obſervation among us, that the people called ſeparate Baptiſts in theſe parts will not ſtick at any falſe repreſentations to ſerve their purpoſe;" which he attempted to prove by facts. But Elder Smith, of Aſhfield, came down and anſwered him in the ſame paper, of March 21, when, from public records, he fairly turned that charge back upon the miniſter who advanced it.</p>
               <p>THE Aſſembly met at Cambridge ſix days after, to whom was exhibited ſo large a bundle of reaſons againſt their granting the firſt prayer of the Baptiſts memorial, as coſt them Twenty Shillings to get a copy of it from the Secretary, it being twelve pages in folio. And yet there was no attempt in it to prove that the word ſupport was in the original grant of Aſhfield, nor other points that were truly to the purpoſe. Two paſſages in it may give a proper idea of the whole performance. They ſay, "<hi>Natural rights</hi> are in this Province wholly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded in this caſe by civil obligation, and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of taxation, individuals cannno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> with the leaſt propriety plead <hi>them.</hi>" Exactly the doctrine of the Britiſh Court at this time; but which never could be carried into effect at any time without covering it with religious pretences; therefore, they went on to flatter our rulers in that reſpect, and to ſay of the Baptiſts, "Some have had the effrontery to ſay, that the ſtanding miniſtry is corrupt, miniſters themſelves unconverted, the churches impure and unholy, admitting uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and <hi>unſanctified</hi> perſons into their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion." As if it were a very uncharitable and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:018336_0271_0FA5D05E12727920"/>thing, for any not to look upon them to be a <hi>ſanctified</hi> people, when they abſolutely refuſed to profeſs themſelves to be ſuch! For our excellent Edwards was rejected by that county with much heat and bitterneſs, only for his inſiſting upon ſuch a profeſſion from communicants. We had direct intelligence that this piece was drawn in Judge Williams's family, and it was ſigned in the name of the proprietors of Aſhfield, by Jonathan Taylor, Timothy Lewis, Samuel Belding, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Phillips, Philip Phillips. The three lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were the aſſeſſors who ſold ſaid lands, and the laſt of them was the man who got his brother aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors fined in 1762, for not taxing their miniſter contrary to law. The Council and Houſe joined in a committee upon ſaid memorial; and they ſay in their report, </p>

               <p n="5">V. ACCORDINGLY, on April 24, the Council voted to diſmiſs it. And though the Houſe was alarmed, and did not concur with this, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have a bill brought in to repeal the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field law, yet their propoſal was rejected, and the
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:018336_0272_0FA5D05E9BE80330"/>petition with it. And what a cloud was hereby brought over an oppreſſed people! On the ſide of the oppreſſors was power, bu they ſeemed to have no helper. But, behold! in a Boſton paper of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 21, it was declared that the King in Council had diſannulled that law. What a ſurprize did this occaſion! How could ſo deſpicable a people get acceſs to the throne, and obtain ſuch an act, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſo ſhort a time! However it was ſoon ſaid, that there was a man in Hatfield that would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Baptiſts from reaping any advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. This was a myſtery, till it was explained on November 8, when two officers, with a numerous aid, came to old Mr. Smith's houſe before he was up in the morning, with a warrant from Judge Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams to ſeize his perſon, and to ſearch his houſe and ſhop for bad money. Smith readily promiſed the uſe of his keys, and deſired that no lock might be broken, and alſo that he might have liberty to pray with his family before he was carried off. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for prayer was granted by one officer, but in the mean time the other broke the lock of his ſhop, and damaged his goods there, and afterwards in his houſe; and then he was carried before a Court at Judge Williams's, where he was compelled to ſtand till ten witneſſes were examined; from whom no evidence could be obtained againſt him, "Nor any circumſtance tending to prove the indictment," as ſeven of them gave from under their hands a few days after. Yet Mr. Smith was held a priſoner through the night, in a cold room, and denied either bed or fire, to the great injury of his body, being above 60 years old, and infirm before. In the morning Judge Williams inſinuated ſeveral things againſt him, without ſuffering him to make any anſwer, and bound him over to their next Superior
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:018336_0273_0FA5D05FA9ACBF38"/>Court, in large bonds with ſureties. Like warrants were iſſued, it was ſaid, againſt their paſtor, who then happened to be abſent on a journey. Reports were therefore induſtriouſly ſpread in the country, that notwithſtanding all their talk, thoſe Baptiſts were a parcel of money-makers, and their miniſter was gone to ſcatter it, and would never dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. But herein they were ſoon found liars, and though the country was ranſacked in the ſpring for witneſſes againſt his father, yet they all failed them. At laſt a man was brought near thirty miles for the purpoſe, who teſtified to the Court at Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, that he ſhould not know the man if he met him in the room. So he was diſcharged, and the law was open for him to ſue for damages for this malicious proſecution. But, lo! a bankrupt, ſon to the miniſter of Sunderland, had been brought over the river to enter the complaint againſt him, ſo that he might never obtain any recompence in this world. Yet God often takes the wiſe in their own craftineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. WHEN ſuch noiſe was made at Boſton about the Aſhfield affair, Governor Hutchinſon happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look and find that the word ſupport was not in the original grant of thoſe lands; and perhaps he might hope, that by relieving the Baptiſts, he ſhould draw them to his ſide of the controverſy betwixt America and Britain. Be that as it may, he privately ſent for one of their committee, and adviſed him to ſend the Aſhfield law to a friend in London, who might preſent it to the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and he promiſed to write to Governor Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, who paſſed it, to uſe his influence to have it repealed. This was done, and its repeal was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and then their oppreſſors had their turn at waiting upon one Aſſembly after another unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully;
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:018336_0274_0FA5D0612A6E4A18"/>for though ſeveral acts were framed for them, yet the conſent of the Governor could not be obtained, till they found out what his mind was, and conformed to it. In January, 1773, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly appointed a committee, out of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to go up to Aſhfield, and to hear both parties, and then to make a tax to pay all that they judged to be behind concerning Mr. Sherwin's ſettlement and meeting-houſe, and the charges which had aroſe about the ſame; and what they judged any of the Baptiſts had paid more than this ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded to them, and for the future they ſhould ſtand upon the ſame footing with their brethren elſewhere. The doings of that committee were confirmed by a ſubſequent act in February, 1774, and the ſmall tax which was laid upon ſome of the Baptiſts they paid, and by this time their oppreſſors were ſick of their own miniſter, and he was diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his office, ſo that they loſt the right in the town which they took ſo much pains to wreſt from Elder Smith, beſides the other unſpeakable evils and ſcandals which ſprang from thence.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. THIS account is carefully taken from our printed laws, journals of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and other writings and teſtimonies; and our opponents are welcome to point out any miſtakes therein, if they can. A gentleman of great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in our Legiſlature informed me, that it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Aſſembly, that thoſe petitioners acted with the reſt in ſettling Mr. Sherwin, but now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſlip out their necks, and leave an intolerable burthen upon their neighbours, which ſtory had great influence to hinder the granting of any relief to the Baptiſts. Whereas, if they had been informed of it, they would have demonſtrated that this ſtory was
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:018336_0275_0FA5D061E9541400"/>a glaring falſhood, as alſo was the report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee whereof Brattle was Chairman; for Wells, who bought Smith's lot, ſued him for cutting the graſs upon it in Auguſt, 1770, and upon trial in the winter, the Court turned the caſe againſt Wells, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſale was <hi>not legal,</hi> two months before Brat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reported that it was <hi>quite legal.</hi> And ſaid law being repealed, all thoſe ſales of lands fell of courſe. And who can deſcribe all their guilt in thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions! If it had been right to tax the Baptiſts to Sherwin's ſettlement and meeting-houſe, taxes of ſix times the value of his ſettlement had been laid upon them, before the law was made to ſell their lands for his ſupport; yet, for three years after, their oppreſſors aſſerted with brazen Impudence, that thoſe taxes were only to fulfil the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their grant. But according to what our delegates to Congreſs aſſerted in Philadelphia, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 14, 177<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> before many witneſſes, the ſettling of Elder Smith in Aſhfield in 1761 fulfilled that condition, and the denying of him the privileges of the firſt miniſter of the town was a violation of the faith of government; for which, as well as for their great trouble and expences, cauſed by ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts, they have received no recompence.</p>
               <p>BECAUSE Governor Hutchinſon procured relief to that ſociety, ſome have blamed the Baptiſts for not adhering to him and his party in the general conteſt betwixt Britain and America; but they had good reaſons againſt it then, and have greater ſince. For many copies of his letters have been found among us, one of which is dated from Boſton, January 23, 1771, directed to Governor Bernard, wherein Hutchinſon expreſſed his earneſt deſire that Caſtle William might not again be put under the
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:018336_0276_0FA5D06269E0FA50"/>pay of this Province<note n="*" place="bottom">In a clandeſtine way he had given it up to the Britiſh troops, September 10, 1770.</note>, and that the power of chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Council might be taken from our repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives; and ſaid he, "Something, I repeat it, muſt be done this ſeſſion, to ſhew the ſenſe Parliament has of our paſt conduct." And after further urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inflammatory meaſures, he ſays, "The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts have made a little ſtir, and complain of being oppreſſed; but in general they have all the liberty which can conſiſt with a legal eſtabliſhment for maintaining public worſhip, without which we ſhould be worſe than we are. No Baptiſt in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is obliged to pay to miniſters upon the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. All who attend a Baptiſt miniſter are not exempt; if they ſhould be, the congregations would be broke to pieces in all parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince." He then gave reaſons why the Aſhfield law ought to be repealed, and ſaid to Bernard, "I ſuppoſe you would not have paſſed it, if you had conſidered the force of the word <hi>ſupport,</hi> and that it militated with the general law in favour of Baptiſts. I have no doubt it was artfully ſlipt in by one of the Hampſhire repreſentatives." Equal religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, therefore, was far from his deſign, though he appeared for their help in that caſe. And the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful repreſentative referred to was, for being one of the ſeventeen <hi>reſcinders,</hi> ſet up as Chief Judge of their County Court; in which office he oppreſſed other Baptiſts in the following manner.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. THEY formed a regular church in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague, July 1, 1765; and gave certificates to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh aſſeſſors according to law; yet they were taxed to other worſhip, and diſtreſs was made therefor. Several attempts were made in pariſh meetings to have this diſorder rectified, but in vain, therefore
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:018336_0277_0FA5D063252E2488"/>Samuel Harvey ſued Montague aſſeſſors for a cow and calf, that had been taken from him for a tax to their miniſter. After the writ was ſerved, a pariſh meeting was called, who voted to ſtand by their aſſeſſors, and ſaid they meant to try the merits of the cauſe, whether theſe were the Baptiſts whom the law exempted or not. When Judge Williams came to deliver the caſe to the jury, he did not call that point in queſtion, yet he ſaid, "The law ſays the certificate ſhall be ſigned by three principal members of the Baptiſt church, and the plaintiff is one of the ſigners, and he cannot certify for himſelf, therefore there are but two, and the law ſays there ſhall be three." To him the jury hearkened, and turned the caſe againſt the Baptiſts, in Auguſt, 1769. They appealed to the Superior Court the next month; but the action was continued till September, 1770, when the caſe was called, and the witneſſes appeared; but becauſe they were Baptiſts, they were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the caſe was again put off, and the Baptiſts were required to pay half the jury's fees. At laſt, on May 1, 1771, a trial was brought on, when Judge Oliver and others turned the caſe againſt the Baptiſts, upon the ſame point as Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams had before done. Upon which it is to be remarked, that before 1752, their laws required but two ſigners to a certificate; and the law they now acted upon allowed of no more than three, where there was not a miniſter, as was the caſe at Montague; and the ſigners could not have been exempted, if their names had not been in the liſt. Yet becauſe they were ſtrained upon, and not others, the caſe was turned againſt them, without trying the merits of the cauſe, as was promiſed; and after the expence of above an Hundred Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:018336_0278_0FA5D064B08CD928"/>the Baptiſts were left without any hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy from our Courts. And, to worry them out, diſtreſs was again made upon their committee, and not others. A yoke of oxen was taken from Harvey, a cow from Sawyer, and Major Richard Montague was ſeized and carried ſix miles toward the priſon, kept all night, and then releaſed, and the officer went back and took a ſwine that he was fatting for his family. O how dark was this cloud over that little flock! Yet one of them ſaid to his brethren, "Who knows but that God will bring good out of this evil? though we are ſtript of our ſubſtance, yet unborn ages may praiſe him for this." Yea, they themſelves have lived to ſee ſome happy fruits of their ſufferings. One thing which gave a check to oppreſſion, was a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of authority, that the miniſters of Baptiſt churches were lawful miniſters, ſo as to have a right to marry people, and to be exempted from civil taxes. This was determined by the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Court, in one trial at Worceſter, and another in Hampſhire; the laſt of which was this year.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. NONE of their opponents appeared willing to releaſe them, till they had tried the matter, and were taught the folly of oppreſſion by experience. If we turn our eyes from the weſt to the eaſt, we ſhall ſee further evidence of this. By aſſiſtance from Haverhill, a Baptiſt church was regularly conſtituted at Berwick, in the county of York, June 28, 1768. Mr. Joſhua Emery was their teacher, though not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. They gave certificates according to law, yet were all taxed to other miniſters; and John Gowen was impriſoned therefor in December, 1769. The like was done to Mr. Emery the next month; and he ſued for recompence in both caſes, but they were delayed till July, 1770, when Emery aſked for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="264" facs="unknown:018336_0279_0FA5D065AB50AB38"/>ſummons to bring the collector with his warrant. The Judge ordered the clerk to give one, to bring the collector with his original liſt. He came with it, but not the warrant, and the Council for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants ſaid there could be no trial without the warrant; and the caſe was turned againſt Emery. He appealed to the Superior Court, where the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector was brought with his warrant; but then he ſwore that he did not take Emery as a priſoner. Emery told the Court, that he did take him and carry him to York, and held him as a priſoner thirty hours, and requeſted him to prove it, either now or at the next term. This was denied him, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given againſt him. With difficulty he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a continuance of his friend's caſe; and the pariſh committee promiſed to let the Baptiſts alone till that caſe was tried. Yet in a few days another tax was impoſed and demanded. Upon this a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was entered to authority againſt the former collector for falſe-ſwearing, and he was bound over to Court upon it; but he repeatedly ſaid, he hoped the day of death would come before that day of trial. And behold! he died ſuddenly juſt before the Court! Yet this did not hinder the next collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor from coming and ſeizing Mr. Emery's horſe, while he was viſiting a ſick perſon. The pariſh aſſeſſors were ſued therefor in January, 1771, and though they tried a number of crooked ways to delay the matter, and to defeat the deſign, yet both this and his friend's caſe, that was continued, were finally turned againſt the aſſeſſors. John Emery, of York, joined to ſaid ſociety, and got the ſame certified to the aſſeſſors of the pariſh where he lived; yet he was taxed to their worſhip, and when he was from home, a collector came and ſeized his pewter therefor. But experience has ſince taught their
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:018336_0280_0FA5D0663359A140"/>oppreſſors to ceaſe from ſuch violence. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is carefully taken from authentic vouchers now in my hands.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. A SMALL Baptiſt church at Newton, in the ſouth borders of New-Hampſhire, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a Separate ſociety there in 1755, was the only church of that denomination in that Province, before 1770. In and after the year 1764 many were hopefully converted in ſeveral parts of it; where believers baptiſm has ſince been introduced in the following manner. About the year 1720 one Scammon, of Stratham, on Piſcataqua river, married Rachel Thurber, from Rehoboth, who was a firm believer of the Baptiſt principles; but
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:018336_0281_0FA5D06A349DC9A0"/>the country round her was ſo full of prejudices againſt them, that in forty years ſhe could gain no more than one perſon to join with her therein; and that was a pious woman in the neighbourhood, who travelled fifty-five miles to Boſton, and was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Elder Bound. But Mrs. Scammon had ſuch a deſire to have others enlightened, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained Norcott's plain diſcourſe upon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſhe carried it to Boſton, with a deſign to get it re-printed upon her own coſt; though when ſhe came to ſpeak to a printer about it, he informed her that he had then one hundred and ten copies of that book on hand: Whereupon ſhe purchaſed them all, and came home and gave them away to her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and to any people who would accept of them; by which means they were ſcattered through the country, and among poor people in new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And ſhe would often ſay to her pious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that ſhe was fully perſuaded, that a church of Chriſtian Baptiſts would be formed in Stratham, though ſhe might not live to ſee it. This came to paſs ſoon after her death, and the like in other places, by the following means. One Samuel Shepard, born at Saliſbury, near Newbury, in 1739, was brought to the knowledge of internal religion when very young; and he learned the art of phyſic, and ſettled in the practice of it in Nottingham, near Piſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua river. He had no knowledge of Mrs. Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nor of any other Baptiſts, till he happened to ſee, in a houſe that he viſited, one of Norcott's books; and upon reading it, there appeared ſuch a fair examination of the ſcriptures therein, as ſtruck his mind with conviction that believers baptiſm was the truth. But it being a principle hardly named among his acquaintance, the conviction went off for ſome years. In the mean time, as Mr. Ebenezer
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:018336_0282_0FA5D06BAF6076B8"/>Jones, a Baptiſt miniſter, travelled through Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, he preached a lecture, which was the means of the converſion of a young man named Eliphaleth Smith, who was afterwards called to preach the goſpel; and in January, 1770, was ordained the paſtor of a Congregational church in a part of Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham called Deerfield. In May following, as he was preaching to his people upon the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all who love Chriſt are under to keep his commandments, the command to believe and be baptized was opened with peculiar clearneſs to the preacher's mind; upon which he immediately found ſuch a want of any warrant for bringing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as cauſed him to paſs it over in his ſermon; and put him and moſt of his church upon ſuch an examination of that matter, as convinced them that they had not been rightly baptized.</p>
               <p n="2">II. BEFORE this, Mr. Shepard, by hearing about Elder Smith of Haverhill, was brought again to think of what he had read in Norcott's book, and to ſearch the ſcriptures concerning baptiſm, and was thereby convinced that the arguments for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm were groundleſs, and was made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to become a Baptiſt. Hereupon he improved opportunities of diſcourſing upon the ſubject with Chriſtians of his acquaintance, which was large; enquiring whether he and they might not have been heretofore miſtaken about the ſubjects and manner of baptiſm? Many were hereby put upon ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the matter, which iſſued in a turn of mind to believers baptiſm. And Mr. Hezekiah Smith was ſent for to Deerfield, where, on June 14, 1770, he baptized their miniſter and thirteen others; and within ſeven days he baptized twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four more, who belonged chiefly to Nottingham, Brentwood, and Stratham; and among thoſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eight
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:018336_0283_0FA5D06D2AC4CAA0"/>perſons were a Congregational miniſter and two deacons, with Mr. Shepard; who by ſpecial teaching was brought freely to begin the great work of preaching the goſpel on July 8, 1770. And he ſoon had ſome evident ſeals of his miniſtry. Mr. Smith, of Deerfield, with the moſt of his church, were united and eſtabliſhed as paſtor and flock in the Baptiſt order. Churches in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were alſo formed in Stratham, Brentwood, and Nottingham; who all united in calling Mr. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to receive ordination, and for the preſent to take the paſtoral care of them. He was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained at Stratham, September 25, 1771; and the ordination ſermon, preached by Mr. Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of Boſton, was printed, together with the charge, by Mr. Smith, of Haverhill, and the right hand of fellowſhip by Preſident Manning, of Providence; and their principles have now had a very extenſive ſpread in thoſe parts. Thus Mrs. Scammon's bread, caſt upon the water, ſeems to have been found after many days; the books that ſhe freely diſperſed being picked up, and made uſeful to many. Neither did the writings of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miniſters, againſt the Baptiſts, weaken their cauſe, but ſtrengthen it, as what follows will ſhew.</p>
               <p n="3">III. MR. Moſes Mather, of Stamford, in his firſt piece upon the covenant, publiſhed in 1769, owns ingeniouſly, that the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, in Gen. xvii. was not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, the covenant of grace, but a divine inſtitution, whereby that nation was taken into viſible cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; and that the ordinances of that church were appointed as means for the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as comfort and ſtrengthening of its members. And he labours hard to prove that the covenant is the ſame with the Chriſtian church;
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:018336_0284_0FA5D06D9F8F4110"/>and that the Lord's ſupper is "A converting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance." And to thoſe who hold that perſons ought to profeſs ſaving faith, in order to come to full communion, he ſays, "This ſcheme makes infant baptiſm a mere nullity, or thing of naught. To me this concluſion appears juſt and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<note n="*" place="bottom">Said diſcourſe, p 17, 54, 57.</note>." Mr. Ebenezer Farris, of Stamford, was rouſed hereby to ſuch an examination of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as not only brought him to embrace believers baptiſm, but alſo to publiſh a defence of that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine at New-York. And he and others called El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gano from thence to baptize them in 1770; and in 1773 a Baptiſt church was conſtituted at Stamford, and another at Greenwich, ten miles nearer to New-York. At the ſame time, the increaſe of the Baptiſts in Boſton (above ſixty members being added to the firſt Baptiſt church there) cauſed a great uneaſineſs among other miniſters, and Dr. Chauncy publiſhed five ſermons in 1772, to perſuade people that it was their indiſpenſible duty to come up to full communion in their churches. And after labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard to remove their objections againſt coming, eſpecially becauſe of fears that they were not born again, he ſays, "The divinely appointed way, in which perſons become members of the viſible church of Chriſt, is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that, in order to their being ſo, they muſt be the ſubjects of <hi>ſaving faith, or judged to be ſo.</hi> The children of thoſe who are members of Chriſt's viſible church are, by the conſtitution of God, from their firſt coming into exiſtence, members of his kingdom in common with their parents. So it was under the Jewiſh diſpenſation; and ſo it is now, if there is any validity in one of the principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which we vindicate our practice, in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:018336_0285_0FA5D06E6B7A2C38"/>the infants of thoſe who are members of Chriſt's church<note n="*" place="bottom">His ſermons on breaking of bread, p. 106, 107.</note>." The conſequence indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clear, that if there is any validity in their main argument for infant baptiſm, their want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation ought not to keep them back from the other ordinance: But then this is directly againſt the teſtimony for the purity of their churches, which this author produced in 1743, p. 153.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THE diſpoſition of that party is further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by another publication at this time. A Convention of their miniſters at Briſtol, May 20, 1772, agreed to publiſh a diſcourſe, intituled, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiciſm; or, Chriſtian Charity:</hi> And it was printed this year at Providence. Many excellent things are inſerted therein, about charity and a catholic diſpoſition and behaviour, and falſe pretences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to are well expoſed, eſpecially in the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Say they, "Liberty and candour are the great baſis of human happineſs. We often hear perſons extolling the advantages of both, who yet ſeem to be really acquainted with neither. For if they have any deſign on foot, any end to anſwer, or purpoſe to carry into execution, if you entertain different views, and with freedom ſpeak your mind, you are inſtantly deemed an enemy, and you muſt be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch; ſo that if you eſcape without the ſword, it is not ſo much owing to a generous ſpirit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as a want of power. To ſupply the defect of their power, your reputation muſt be blaſted, your influence weakened, and your intereſt injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such liberty deſerves no better name than ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and ſuch freedom the baſeſt ſlavery<note n="†" place="bottom">Catholiciſm, p. 65.</note>." The truth of this ſentence is readily allowed; but to whom is it applicable? Thoſe miniſters evidently
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:018336_0286_0FA5D06F28598378"/>intended it againſt ſuch as refuſed communion with their churches. They name the people who began to ſeparate therefrom about the year 1744, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them as being furious then againſt <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> miniſterial ſupport; but as now being ſo <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> and <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> as to come into the ſame practice themſelves<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 37, 38.</note> Had they ſaid aſſeſſing and forcing, inſtead of giving and receiving, they would have diſcovered a regard to truth and conſiſtency that is now wanting in their performance. At this time they cenſure thoſe as very unreaſonable men, who hold immerſion to be eſſential to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 64.</note> And, ſpeaking of aſking miniſters to preach occaſionally, the writer ſays, "I cannot ſee the propriety nor expediency of inviting the aſſiſtance of any man, be his profeſſion what it may, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ME the rights and privileges of the church of Chriſt.—If WE cannot eat and drink of one bread and one cup, in token of mutual fellowſhip, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould encourage ſuch perſons in their uncharitableneſs." Is not this the charity they had before condemned, which begins and ends <hi>in ſelf</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 25, 66.</note>?</p>
               <p>IN October, 1770, an act of their Legiſlature was obtained, to incorporate a number of men in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence into a ſociety, by the name of <hi>The Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Congregational Society in the town of Providence,</hi> for the purpoſe of raiſing and managing a fund, to ſupport public worſhip in the firſt church of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination there. This was the firſt act of that nature ever paſſed in that Colony; and it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a pamphlet the next year; in the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which they recite their law againſt the uſe of force to ſupport miniſters (ſee p. 48) and ſay upon it, "Although this act was wiſely intended, yet it was followed with great inconvenience in thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:018336_0287_0FA5D06FF5B01C30"/>where the ſupport of the miniſter was thought to be a duty incumbent on the people, as thereby the burthen of the expence thereof was borne by very few perſons. The Congregational ſociety afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid has had a large ſhare of this difficulty." And could they have had their deſire, they would, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, have introduced tax and compulſion for their ſupport. But as the college in the town was formed upon another plan, ſaid miniſters refuſed to encourage it<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the firſt claſs of graduates in that college was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained at Warren July 3, 1771, who has ſince been a great bleſſing in thoſe parts. Others alſo were very ſucceſsful, ſo that in the years 1771 and 1772, about 230 perſons were baptized, in the adjoining towns of Warren, Swanzey, Rehoboth and Dighton. And Preſident Manning being called to preach and adminiſter ordinances to the Baptiſt church in Providence, cauſed a great turn in their affairs; and ill treatment from others was made to work for their good.</note> And though its charter, granted by their Legiſlature, explicitly exempts the perſons and eſtates of the Preſident and Profeſſors of the college "From all taxes," yet the vote of a town-meeting in Providence was procured in Auguſt, 1772, to limit the meaning of thoſe words to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taxes only. And becauſe the Baptiſt aſſeſſors in 1773 left ſaid officers out of their town tax, a town-meeting was called, February 7, 1774, who cenſured thoſe aſſeſſors therefor, and publiſhed their reſolves in the gazette againſt extending that law to town taxes. It is hoped that many who were active in that affair are now convinced of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and are ſenſible that they did not then ſhew the regard they ought to have done both to liberty and learning. Their honorable exertions in this cauſe ſince are freely acknowledged; and theſe facts are only mentioned to remove the ill effects of thoſe publications, and to guard againſt ſuch evils for the future.</p>

V. FOR the ſame end I ſhall give a conciſe view of another controverſy at this time. A miniſter at Bolton, in Worceſter county, after being intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate at other times, drank to exceſs on a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſeaſon, ſo as to ſhock the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. But when his church called him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count therefor, he at firſt denied the crime, and then confeſſed it; yet he violated his promiſe about offering ſatisfaction to the congregation. Three Councils were called, who were all for continuing him in office there. But as he had aſſumed the power to negative the acts of the church, even when dealing with him, and to diſſolve their meeting without their conſent, they called a meeting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and choſe a moderator and clerk, and made ſome propoſals to their miniſter, and adjourned. But as he gave them no ſatisfaction, they, at their ſecond adjournment, Auguſt 8, 1771, diſmiſſed him from his office, and from their communion; and the town concurred therewith. This alarmed many others, who exerted all their influence to prevent the ſettlement of another miniſter there in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Mr. Zubdiel Adams publiſhed a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon againſt it in 1772, which was anſwered by one who ſtiles himſelf A Neighbour; and each wrote again upon the ſubject in 1773. Two editions of Mr. Wiſe's works were alſo now publiſhed; on the other hand a pamphlet came out, ſaid in the title page to be publiſhed <hi>by the Convention of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, at their annual meeting in Boſton, May</hi> 26, 1773; the whole labour of which is to prove, that a church has not a right to diſmiſs their miniſter contrary to his conſent, or to the direction of others, where a Council of them can be had. For this end, they inſert a paſſage from Cambridge platform, which
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:018336_0289_0FA5D07169CDA130"/>ſays, "In caſe an elder offend incorrigably, the matter ſo requiring, as the church had power to call to office, ſo they have power, according to order (the Council of other churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to remove him from office." Now it is a known rule in grammar, that though a parentheſis is uſeful in its place, yet that the ſenſe is good without it. So are Councils uſeful in difficult caſes, if they hold up true light; but it is a violation of ſaid rule, to make the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Council eſſential to the churches act in diſmiſſing their miniſter. Another authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by this Convention is a paſſage from Mr. Hooker, which declares for the uſe of Councils, and for the right of churches to withdraw their communion from an erroneous church, <hi>that will not be reclaimed.</hi> This will not be denied; but the queſtion in hand was, where the power of doing it lies? Whether in the body of each church, or in a collection of officers above them? To confute the latter, and to eſtabliſh the former of theſe points, was the main deſign of Hooker in that book; of which I have given plain proofs (p. 40) and am ready to advance more if neceſſary. Directly after their pamphlet came out, a Council of ſeven church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, viz. four from Boſton, one from Cambridge, one from Roxbury, and one from Dedham, met at Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Auguſt 3, at the call of ſaid depoſed miniſter and his party. And, in their printed reſult, they have given it as their opinion, that the act of the church in depoſing of him ought be looked upon as a <hi>nullity,</hi> becauſe it had neither his conſent, nor the direction of a Council of others, where it might have been had. They alſo deny its being the act of the majority of all the male members of Bolton church; which laſt aſſertion was ſoon after proved not to be
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:018336_0290_0FA5D0724DEBCC08"/>true in fact. In another publication he is introduced, ſaying, "I have three times been tried by my <hi>peers,</hi> and ſo far acquitted, that but little blame hath been caſt upon me." And his advocate ſays of him, "Having never been condemned by the lawful judgment of his <hi>peers,</hi> and being ſtill their miniſter in the eye of the conſtitution, he is juſtly intitled to the <hi>ſupport</hi> they a firſt contracted to give him; neither is it in the <hi>power</hi> of his people to withhold it<note n="*" place="bottom">Adams's reply to the Neighbour, p. 13, 52.</note>." Which is making them <hi>lords</hi> over God's he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, inſtead of being examples to the flock. Yea, it is claiming ſuch a power in the church, as the Britiſh Court, even at this time, denied in the State. For the Governor and Council of the Maſſachuſetts were, in ſome caſes, a Court of Appeal, finally to decide executive matters; and Governor Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon claimed a negative power in this, as well as in his legiſlative capacity. But as the queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it was referred to the King in Council, it was determined againſt the Governor, that he ſhould not have a negative power in that Executive Court; which determination he was obliged to publiſh in Boſton in January, 1774. And it is moſt certain, that the Chriſtian church is only an executive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature; yet thoſe miniſters were now contending for a negative power therein.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. AND though the Baptiſts had no hand in the Bolton controverſy, yet it ſerves more clearly to juſtify their oppoſition to ſuch claims of power at this time. A leader therein was Mr. John Davis, ſon to a Baptiſt miniſter in the Delaware State, and educated at the college in Philadelphia. He came to Boſton in May, 1770, and was ordained paſtor of the ſecond Baptiſt church there the 9th of September following. He was one of the committee who ſigned
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:018336_0291_0FA5D073CB1B4EB8"/>the addreſs of the Baptiſt churches to our Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the next month; but perceiving ſoon after that our charter gave them no right to ſupport any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip by tax and compulſion, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared it to men of note; which was the chief cauſe of the mean and ſcurrilous treatment from the preſs, that he met with the next winter. General Brattle, when acting as Chairman of the committee of the Legiſlature in the ſpring, treated him in like manner; but when he had done, Davis aroſe, and diſtinctly anſwered his arguments, without taking any notice of the perſonal abuſe that was offered him. A gentleman preſent ſaid, the worth of the man never appeared ſo great before. September 10, 1771, the Warren Aſſociation made choice of him as their agent, to uſe his beſt endeavours, by the advice of their committee, in concert with their agents in London, to obtain the eſtabliſhment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> equal religious liberty in this land. And the compiler of this hiſtory was then requeſted by a number of miniſters to undertake the work; and Mr. Davis promiſed his aſſiſtance therein. But, alas! he had done but little towards it before his health failed, and his life followed after. In Auguſt, 1772, he took a voyage to Philadelphia, hoping to receive benefit from his native air. And obtaining ſome relief, and meeting with one of his brethren in the miniſtry, who was going to preach to the weſtern Indians, he ſet out with him, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with friends who were going to ſettle upon the Ohio. But on February 1, 1773, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account was publiſhed in Philadelphia, viz. "By advices from the Ohio we learn, that upon the 13th of December the Reverend John Davis, A. M. Fellow of Rhode-Iſland college, and one of the members of the American Philoſophical Society,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:018336_0292_0FA5D0746950F720"/>died there, after an illneſs of three weeks, in the 36th year of his age." The miniſter he was with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that ſome of his laſt words were theſe: "In a little time I expect to be with Chriſt, to ſee and know him as he is now known, and as he is not known.

               <p n="7">VII. IN September, 1772, the author was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen an agent of the Baptiſt churches in Mr. Davis's room; and the following events took place among them. Though their church in Chelmsford had given in certificates according to law, yet they were all taxed to pariſh teachers; and in a cold ſeaſon, January 26, 1773, three of their ſociety were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned therefor at Concord, one of whom was 82 years old; and they commenced a ſuit in law for recompence; but their caſes were long delayed. In Bellingham equal liberty was enjoyed, becauſe there was none but a Baptiſt miniſter in the town; but a number of his hearers who lived in Mendon were ſo much oppreſſed with taxes to other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that in the three preceding years they eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated their damages on that account at near Fifty Pounds. And theſe and other things being laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Baptiſt committee, May 5, they adviſed their agent to write to all their churches, to conſider whether it was not their duty to refuſe to give any more certificates to the power that oppreſſed them; and to bring in their concluſions upon it to their next Aſſociation. And further light was held up by their enemies a few days after. For, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their practice, they publiſhed an account of all their exempting laws in the Boſton Evening Poſt, of May 17, and as the firſt of them ordered Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians in each pariſh to be taxed with the reſt, and then that their miniſters ſhould draw the money out
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:018336_0293_0FA5D07553FBE010"/>of the pariſh treaſury, it was now ſaid, "Had the ſame prudent precaution been taken with reſpect to the Anabaptiſts, when they were exempted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxed towards the maintenance of the miniſters of the churches by law eſtabliſhed, thoſe avaricious and diſſolute perſons, who get under water to waſh away their miniſter's rates, without any expectation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of waſhing away their ſins, would have had little or no temptation to declare themſelves Anabaptiſts." When the Warren Aſſociation met at Medfield, September 7, 1773, they concluded to refrain from giving any more certificates to that power, for theſe reaſons.

When the author came to Boſton to compleat this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he met with two printed letters againſt the deſign; to which he returned the following reply, on October 14. "Mr. Draper, as you have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pretended Baptiſt room for two long letters in your paper of the 2d and 30th of September, I hope you will give a real Baptiſt room for a ſhort anſwer to him in your next. I call him a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:018336_0294_0FA5D075DAE2B0C0"/>Baptiſt, and think I have reaſon ſo to do; for though he gives his word for it that he is of our denomination, yet the whole tenor of his letters is, to perſuade us to be eaſy under the taxing laws of the other party; and towards the cloſe of his firſt letter he ſays, <hi>had we for a little while borne only the little finger of the Epiſcopalian hierarchy, we ſhould think the burthen comparatively light, though we were called to bear the weight of the loins of the Preſbyterians of New-England.</hi> And is not the hand of Joab in all this! For my part, I am not able to get a pair of ſcales ſufficient to weigh thoſe two great bodies in, the Epiſcopal hierarchy and the New-England Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterains, ſo as to find out exactly which is heavieſt: But if this pretended brother had felt what father Obadiah Holmes once felt in Boſton from our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, he would not have been ſo eaſy as he now ſeems to be." Hereby a ſtop was put to that mean and ſcandalous practice, of aſſuming the Baptiſt name, in writings againſt their welfare. Neither did any anſwer ever appear to the above reaſons for equal liberty, though oppreſſion was ſtill carried on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der religious pretences.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. BY aſſiſtance from Haverhill, a Baptiſt church was regularly formed at Goreham, near Caſco-Bay, June 20, 1768. And Joſeph Moody, a member of it, who lived in Scarborough, had the ſame certified annually to their pariſh aſſeſſors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law; yet diſtreſs was ſtill made upon him for taxes to pariſh worſhip. For ſuch a tax of about Six Dollars, a good riding beaſt was taken from him in 1771; he therefore preſented proper vouchers of theſe facts to the Aſſembly at Boſton, January 26, 1774, with a petition, that like the good Samaritan they would again ſet him upon his own beaſt. A committee was ſent out upon it, whoſe report was to
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:018336_0295_0FA5D076D23D9610"/>diſmiſs the petition, which was done. About this time eighteen men, of the Baptiſt ſociety in Warwick, in a very cold ſeaſon, were ſeized for a pariſh tax, and carried forty miles, and caſt into Northampton gaol. On February 15, an account thereof was brought to the agent of the Baptiſt churches, who directly laid their caſe before the Legiſlature at Boſton; praying that they might be releaſed, that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence might be made them, and effectual meaſures taken to prevent ſuch things for the future. But, though a committee was ſent out upon it, no help was granted. This moved one of the Baptiſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to expreſs his aſtoniſhment thereat, in the gazette of March 3, and to aſk how this news would be received in ſiſter Colonies, or at the Britiſh Court, from whence late help had been afforded to our Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field brethren? A reply hereto came out March 14, which ſaid, "No one can deny that they have been in great trouble of late; and whoever conſiders how dangerous the occupation of counterfeiting an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed currency is, they cannot greatly admire at it." Which inuendo was catched at, and enlarged upon in the Providence gazette. Though in fact a Pedobaptiſt church member in Aſhfield had, before this, been convicted of harbouring a counterfeiting club at his houſe, for which the Court gave judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he ſhould be fined, ſet in the pillory, and have his ears cropt; while a Baptiſt member, whom they had enſnared, was only fined. Thus do men expoſe themſelves, when they drag into religious controverſy things which have no relation to it. In a Boſton paper of April 7, the aſſeſſors of Warwick publiſhed a vindication of themſelves in taxing thoſe Baptiſts, in which they ſaid, "We apprehend that every body politic have a right to chooſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to enact laws for its ſupport, and that
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:018336_0296_0FA5D0776542B240"/>they ought ſo to do: And ſince Congregationaliſm is the choice of the people of this Province, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which our forefathers had in view to eſtabliſh in coming over to this country, we think there is good reaſon why diſſenters from us ſhould pay to the ſupport of it; eſpecially ſince it is one condition upon which they receive and hold their lands." This laſt article is flatly denied, and let any of that party prove it if they can. And will any ſtill plead for a practice that cannot be upheld without lying! Another evil effect of it is before us.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. ONE of the Chelmsford caſes was now tried at Charleſtown. Jonathan Sewal, the lawyer who was moſt active againſt the Baptiſts of Haverhill, undertook for them; and he muſt needs put the collector as well as the aſſeſſors into the writ. The effect of which was, that the jury judged the aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to be guilty, and the collector not guilty; and that the Baptiſt ſhould recover of the aſſeſſors Three Pounds damages and coſts, while the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector ſhould recover coſts of the Baptiſt for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him to priſon, where he was confined above three days. The guilty aſſeſſors ſoon had their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences paid by the town; but as the Judges and ſaid lawyer went off directly, the other Chelmsford caſes were never tried, nor the ſmall ſum now adjudged to one of them received. And no exempting law for the Baptiſts in this Province was now in force. Theſe things being heard of at Philadelphia, cauſed an uneaſineſs among the Preſbyterians there, and a man was ſent from thence to Boſton, and a new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting act was paſſed at Salem in June; after which it was declared in a Philadelphia paper, that relief was granted to the Baptiſts in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. Such pains have that ſect taken to keep up their credit and influence in this country. But that
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:018336_0297_0FA5D07B042B3708"/>act was ſo far from affording us any relief, that it required annual certificates to be recorded in each pariſh where the Baptiſts lived, a copy of which could not be had without <hi>Fourpence</hi> of our money, which is <hi>Threepence</hi> ſterling; the very tax upon a pound of tea that brought on the American war.</p>

               <p n="1">1. DISPUTES about power and gain, under a religious maſk, could no longer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to words, but muſt come to dreadful blows. To this thoſe claims have always tended. When Henry the 8th revolted from the church of Rome, and ſet himſelf up as head of the church of England, he ruled as tyrannically as the Pope did; though his allowing the common people to have the bible in their own tongue, gave much light to the nation. And a greater reformation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:018336_0298_0FA5D07B2715B8D8"/>thereby, in the ſhort reign of his ſon Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than the church of England has ever attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſince. Neither do their ideas differ ſo much from ours about facts, as about the names they ought to be called by. An Epiſcopal miniſter of conſiderable note, after thirty years labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their way in New-England, gave the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account of the cauſe of its firſt plantation. Says he, "While the virgin Queen, of immortal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſat at the helm, ſhe ſteered ſo ſteady a courſe, and rode with ſo tight a rein, that Calvin's Engliſh diſciples, impregnated with the leaven of Geneva, could do little more, upon their return, after the Maria perſecution, than fret in their fetters, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and mutter their diſcontents in ſecret.—To Elizabeth ſucceeded James, father of the martyr. He imagining it more for his eaſe, threw away the Queen's curb, and rode with a ſnaffle. Under this ſoft Sovereign the non cons ſeem, by the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liotiſm of the ſtate, and Grindalizing of the church, to have grown into great numbers. But Charles reſumed, in ſome ſort, the heroine's bridle, and gave leave to Laud to make uſe of whip and ſpur; ſo the ſturdy Puritan, unuſed to reſtraint, and growing reſtive, finding that flouncing and plunging would not throw down, ran away from his riders, and took ſanctuary in New-England. But good God! how dearly did that moſt pious Prince and holy prelate pay for this! and how fatal and laſting have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of that GRAND REBELLION, that brought both of thoſe great perſonages to the block<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters from Narraganſet, 1752, by James M'Sparran, D. D. printed at Dublin, 1753, under the title of <hi>America diſſected,</hi> p. 23, 24</note>!" That is, Charles claimed a night to impoſe laws and taxes upon the people without their conſent, and
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:018336_0299_0FA5CF065CCE92A0"/>Laud endeavoured to cover and enforce the ſame with religious pretences; and becauſe they drove on furiouſly in that way, until both of their necks were broke, arbitrary teachers have canonized them for ſaints and martyrs; and have ſtigmatized reſiſtance to ſuch power with the odious name of REBELLION. After the flames of war which they kindled had raged through three bloody cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, between the King and Parliament, their commiſſioners met at Uxbridge, January 30, 1645, to treat about reconciliation: But it could not be obtained, becauſe a ſecret inſtruction from Charles to his commiſſioners ſaid, "As the King's duty is to protect the church, ſo it is the church's to aſſiſt the King in the maintenance of his juſt authority: Wherefore my predeceſſors have been always care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (eſpecially ſince the reformation) to keep the dependency of the clergy entirely upon the crown, without which it will ſcarcely ſit faſt upon the King's head; therefore you muſt do nothing to change or leſſen this neceſſary dependency<note n="*" place="bottom">Rapin, vol. 2, p. 510.</note>." Before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the Pope rode foremoſt, and ſometimes compelled Princes to walk on foot, yea, to hold his ſtirrup; but ſince, as is here obſerved, they have been always careful to keep the reins in their own hands. And this conteſt has cauſed infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs in New-England.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE firſt planters of it requeſted no more than equal liberty of conſcience; and though the crown would only give a conditional, and not an abſolute promiſe thereof, "Yet, caſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the care of Providence, they reſolved to venture<note n="†" place="bottom">Prince's chronology, p. 57, 60.</note>." On this foundation was New-England planted in 1620; and this has been its only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:018336_0300_0FA5CF0866A24A10"/>ever ſince. For though the Maſſachuſetts company came over ten years after, with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple charter from Charles; yet he and Laud ſoon attempted to vacate it, and at length poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the company to ſend it back again<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, vol. 3, p. 105.</note>: And the loſs of their heads, and the overthrow of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, was the cauſe why theſe plantations were not then entirely ruined. In the mean time, an imagination of great purity at Boſton emboldened the church to aſſume the whole government in this wilderneſs, with an expectation of exhibiting to the world ſuch a view of the glory of Chriſtianity, as had never before been ſeen. And the leaders here were enchanted with this bright image, until their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was wreſted from them in 1684; upon which the world reſolutely took the bridle again into their own hands. And how flattering was their late proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, of riding where they pleaſed without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul? Methinks I hear the Britiſh miniſtry ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our fleets and armies have triumphed over all our enemies, and we are revered to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt regions. The wealth of both the Indies is ours, and our reſources are boundleſs. The vaſt continent of North-America is wholly at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and who can hinder our doing as we pleaſe? Arts and ſciences are already carried very high, and who knows how much greater improvements may be made? As to religion, fanaticiſm and bigotry are quite out of faſhion, and reaſon and liberty are the darling topics of the age. Epiſcopacy prevails in almoſt all our Colonies, and ſoon will in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. Parliaments have formerly made dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work; cut off the head of one King, and drove another from his throne; but thoſe days of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and cruelty are at an end. The Parliament
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:018336_0301_0FA5CF08A618A7B0"/>is now entirely at our command; and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its ſupremacy over the Colonies is all that is wanting to compleat the happineſs of the empire; and who can prevent ſo great a good? Can a few factious fellows at Boſton do it! The thought is contemptible! And we are aſſured, by the moſt reſpectable gentlement upon the continent, that as ſoon as it is ſeen that government is determined to maintain its authority, oppoſition will ceaſe, and the land will be at reſt. At their head is a man, who, by the beſt hiſtory of his country that was ever pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, has diſcovered a perfect knowledge of their affairs, civil and religious. And his influence is ſo great, that after he was made Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, he was freely elected into their Council. At the ſame time he had the command of their caſtle, the key of their chief harbour, was Judge of Probate in their head county, and Chief Judge of their Supreme Executive Court through the Colony, until his Majeſty has been pleaſed to raiſe him to the higheſt ſeat in their government. Who then can ſcruple the truth of his teſtimony, or the ſufficiency of his influence to accompliſh our deſires?</p>
               <p n="3">III. I AM ſenſible that theſe ideas will not pleaſe ſome men; therefore the following facts are adduced to ſupport them. The moſt plauſible plea for the claim of Britain to tax America was, that we were indebted to her for protection. If ſo, why did ſhe pay us large ſums, for aſſiſting her in her wars? Our conqueſt of Cape-Breton, in 1745, brought her into debt to us, for which ſhe ſent us over a good quantity of caſh, whereby we were enabled to call in our paper money. Yet, through jealouſy of our power, acts of Parliament were paſſed in 1749 to prohibit, under great penalties, the erection of any
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:018336_0302_0FA5CF09B90D4150"/>tilt-hammers here to plate iron, furnaces to make ſteel, or ſlitting-mills to cut nail-rods; although no country abounds more than ours with iron. All this and much mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was patiently borne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions from the crown, of aſſiſtance in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wars, were obeyed beyond our proportion; for which large ſums were repaid by Parliament: Did this look as if they thought we were in debt to them? By no means. But ſoon after the peace of 1763, they paſſed an act to compel the Colonies to furniſh certain articles for a ſtanding army therein in the time of peace; the great engine of deſpotiſm. And as this act was but partly obeyed in New-York, their legiſlative power was ſuſpended, until they ſhould do it fully. To this the ſtamp-act was added, to deprive America of any legal deeds of our lands, or ſecurities for our money, without paying a tax therefor to Britain. And when they were forced to repeal that act in March, 1766, it was reſolved, "That his Majeſty in Parliament, of right, had power to bind the people of the Colonies by ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." William War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton, Biſhop of Glouceſter, had delivered a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the preceding month, before the ſociety who ſupported their miſſionaries in America, wherein he called the inhabitants of it factious people, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to laugh at the bible; and ſaid, "The ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GENTILISM in the Colonies calls for our rejected charity." And to render them as odious as poſſible, he accuſed them of annually ſtealing ſlaves from the oppoſite continent, and ſacrificing them to <hi>their</hi> great idol, the <hi>god of gain.</hi> "No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (ſays he) is more certain, than that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous traffic for ſlaves directly infringes both divine and human law. Nature created man free,
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:018336_0303_0FA5CF0A234F2388"/>and grace invites him to aſſert his freedom<note n="*" place="bottom">Glouceſter's ſermon, February 21, 1766, p. 11, 13, 25, 26.</note>." Yet it is moſt certain that his party, in the ſouthern Colonies, and in the Weſt-India iſlands, have had the chief hand in that infamous traffic. February 20, 1767, John Ewer, Biſhop of Landaff, before the ſame ſociety, ſaid of the firſt planters of New-England, "What reproach could be caſt heavier than they deſerve? who, with their native ſoil, abandoned their native manners and religion; and ere long were found in many parts living without remembrance or knowledge of God, without any divine worſhip, in diſſolute wickedneſs, and the moſt brutal profligacy of manners. Inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became themſelves infidels and barbarians. And is it not ſome aggravation of their ſhame, that this their neglect of religion was contrary to the pretences and <hi>conditions</hi> under which they obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>royal grants</hi> and public authority?" And having expreſſed his earneſt deſire and hopes of the ſpeedy eſtabliſhment of biſhops in America, he ſays, "This point obtained, the American church will ſoon go out of its infant ſtate; be able to ſtand upon its own legs, and without foreign help <hi>ſupport</hi> and ſpread itſelf. Then the buſineſs of this ſociety will have been brought to the happy iſſue <hi>intended</hi>

Dr. Thomas Bradbury Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, of New-Jerſey, now publiſhed a book upon the ſame ſubject; wherein he owns it as the opinion of many, that the circumſtances of the nation now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the moſt favourable proſpect of the ſpeedy eſtabliſhment of biſhops here, that had ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince Queen Ann's death. Yet he had the face to
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:018336_0304_0FA5CF0B335649C8"/>declare that ſuch a plan was agreed upon, "That biſhops ſhall not interfere with the property or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, whether civil or religious, of churchmen or diſſenters—but ſhall only ordain and govern the clergy, and adminiſter confirmation to thoſe who ſhall deſire it<note n="*" place="bottom">Chandler's appeal to the public, p. 50—54, 79.</note>." The tea and glaſs-act was paſſed this year; which moved the Pennſylvania Farmer to write his elegant letters upon our public danger; the firſt of which was dated November 5, 1767. As thoſe letters were greatly eſteemed, and had very extenſive effects, ten letters by way of anſwer to them were publiſhed at Boſton, in 1769. Much pains were taken therein to perſuade us that the Farmer had given falſe alarms, and that our liberties were in no real danger; and yet in the ninth letter it was ſaid, "The queſtion whether the Parliament can lay <hi>internal</hi> taxes could be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined beſt by conſidering the power of that body to alter or vacate charters. The Parliament can annul our charters <hi>at will</hi>

And in January, 1773, Governor Hutchinſon purpoſely drew our Aſſembly into a debate upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and when he cloſed it the 6th of March he ſaid, "It is eſſential to the being of government, that power ſhould always exiſt which no other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er within ſuch government can have right to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or controul; therefore, when the word <hi>power</hi> relates to the ſupreme authority of government, it

And he refuſed his conſent to an act paſſed in that ſeſſion, to grant the ſalaries of the Judges of our Superior Executive Court, becauſe he expected that the King would pay them out of the American revenue then collecting. In June following his letter to a member of Parliament, of January 20, 1769, was publiſhed by the Aſſembly at Boſton, wherein he ſaid, "I never think of the meaſures neceſſary for the peace and good order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies without pain. There muſt be an <hi>abridgment</hi> of what are called Engliſh liberties." This, and other original letters, were procured and ſent back by the amiable and judicious Franklin, our agent at the Britiſh Court; who, as ſoon as this was known there, was ſpurned from thence with much ſcorn and bitterneſs; an infallible evidence that what they were in purſuit of were <hi>the works of darkneſs;</hi> for <hi>he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

IN November following arrived large car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of tea, which were ſent over to eſtabliſh a precedent of the power of the Britiſh Parliament to tax this country internally. From Philadelphia and New-York it was ſent back, and not ſuffered to be landed; and the ſame was earneſtly tried for at Boſton: But Governor Hutchinſon reduced his native town to the cruel neceſſity of either ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be landed, and the tax thereon paid, or elſe of caſting it into the ſea; and the latter was choſen. Now the character of thoſe who teach God's fear by the precepts of men, is to <hi>watch for iniquity:</hi> And when accounts of this and other tranſactions arrived in March, 1774, the Britiſh miniſtry imagined that they had got enough of it to cover and carry their arbitrary deſigns. And
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:018336_0306_0FA5CF0C8F406758"/>ſuch uſe was made thereof, as to procure one act of Parliament to ſhut up the port of Boſton, until their power was obeyed there; a ſecond to rob the people of this Province of their right to chooſe their own Council; a third to ſcreen the executors of their orders from puniſhment, even if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murder in doing it; and a fourth greatly to enlarge the Province of Quebec, to eſtabliſh Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therein, and to deprive its inhabitants of their right of trials by jury, and other Engliſh liberties. As theſe were hoſtile meaſures, Thomas Gage, the chief commander of all the Britiſh forces in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, was appointed Governor of the Maſſachuſetts, in order to carry them into effect. And he arrived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t Boſton May 13, where he met the Aſſembly the 25th, but ſoon prorogued them to Salem, where a few acts were paſſed, and then they were diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never to meet again upon their former conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The port of Boſton was ſhut up in June, and in Auguſt twenty-four of the thirty-ſix Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, appointed for us by the crown, were ſworn into office; and writs were iſſued for a new choice of repreſentatives, to meet them at Salem the 5th of October. But a week before that time the Governor, by proclamation, forbid their meeting; becauſe the people had compelled ſome of thoſe Counſellors to reſign their commiſſions, and the reſt were afraid to venture out of Boſton. Yet moſt of the repreſentatives met, reſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Provincial Congreſs, and ſat at ſeveral times and places, until they diſſolved on Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 10; having taken various ſteps towards the internal regulation and defence of the country, and propoſed a new choice of delegates from the towns, to meet in February. In the mean time all theſe Colonies conſidered the caſe of Boſton as their own,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:018336_0307_0FA5CF0D39EB7038"/>and ſent large contributions to its ſuffering inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Delegates from twelve Colonies met at Philadelphia, September 5, and ſat till October 26, ſtated the unalienable rights of mankind, and the nature, limits and end of civil government, in a clear manner; and ſent addreſſes to the throne, and to various parts of the empire, well calculated to expoſe, and, if poſſible, to remove the dangers that hung over our liberties. They alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended wiſe meaſures for our internal regulation; and, in the name of their conſtituents, ſolemnly covenanted to refrain from importing any Britiſh goods, or exporting any of ours to them, after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times ſet; if ſaid oppreſſive acts ſhould not then be repealed, until their repeal was effected.</p>
               <p>IN the night preceding September 1, a party of ſoldiers went and ſeized a large quantity of powder, in a public ſtore in Cambridge, which, with ſome field pieces, they brought off to Boſton; upon which a report flew like the wind, that Gage had ſent out his troops, who were killing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Multitudes were alarmed hereby, and were marching in arms to relieve their friends, until this report was contradicted. And on Lord's day, February 26, 1775, a field officer, with about an hundred men, ſailed from the caſtle to Marblehead, and then marched nimbly to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to fetch ſome pieces of artillery from thence; but were defeated in their deſign by the vigilance of the people. After which Colonel Gilbert col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a quantity of arms and ammunition at Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, and ſent to the Governor for protection; who thereupon wrote to the authority of Briſtol county, to make proviſion for two hundred ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers there: But, before they marched, ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the inhabitants aſſembled on April 10, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:018336_0308_0FA5CF0DF0526838"/>thoſe war ſtores, and diſperſed that neſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Freetown. Yet after all this, and much more of like nature, we are informed, that the Mandamus Counſellors at Boſton were under ſuch an infatuation, as to give it as their opinion, that their countrymen would not venture to fight againſt the King's troops; and to adviſe their Governor to try the experiment, by ſending a body of them to deſtroy or bring away the ſtores that were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at Concord. But though this advice was followed with great ſecreſy, by croſſing the water from Boſton common in the dead of the night, ſo as to get twelve miles in their way before ſunriſe, yet they then ſaw a company of the militia collected to oppoſe them; of whom they killed eight men on the ſpot, and then marched ſix miles further to Concord; where they ſhot down two men more, before our people fired upon them<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a moſt certain fact, though it was contradicted by our enemies in London.</note> And they not only uſed their endeavours to deſtroy ſome cannon and carriages, but alſo caſt a conſiderable quantity of flour into the river. Hereupon the cowardly Americans drove the heroic Britons back to their ſhips the ſame day, with much terror and ſlaughter, although near two thouſand of their beſt troops were employed in the affair; which will tranſmit the remembrance of Lexington, and the 19th of April, down to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
               <p n="5">V. BUT how the inhabitants of a country of fifteen hundred miles extent, divided into thirteen Colonies, very differently conſtituted, wherein were perſons of almoſt all nations, ſects and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, could unite againſt the arbitrary claims of the moſt powerful kingdom upon earth, and could perſevere therein for eight tedious years, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:018336_0309_0FA5CF0EA37BC168"/>of the utmoſt exertions both of craft and violence, until thoſe claims are fully given up, is matter of univerſal aſtoniſhment, and will be the ſubject of curious enquiry to future ages. To me it is paſt all doubt, that no other ſufficient reaſon can be given for this unparalleled event, than the deſign which God has declared to us, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that adorns our title page. Pride and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him had arrived to ſuch height in both countries, that we muſt become dreadful ſcourges to each other, to diſcover what was in our hearts, whether we would keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or not.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A SECOND Provincial Congreſs met at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; February 1, and proceeded to further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the defence of our liberties; and other Colonies did the like. The Aſſembly at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in December, had ordered the cannon to be brought up there from their fort near New-port, which were now conveyed to the camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Boſton, formed by the militia, who aſſembled by thouſands, and filled the towns and villages, from the bay ſouth of Boſton to Myſtic river on the north; being a circle of twenty miles. On the other hand, the Britiſh Generals, Howe, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne and Clinton, arrived with large reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their army at Boſton. Charleſtown, to the north of it, lies, as that does, upon a peninſula, the latter betwixt Charles and Myſtic rivers. It contained above four hundred houſes, many of them very elegant. June 17 the Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders perceived that the Americans had begun to fortify a hill on the north ſide of Charleſtown; upon which the town was ſurrounded with their ſhips and floating batteries, and then their army landed to attack our entrenchment. Burgoyne
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:018336_0310_0FA5CF0F7A79DD28"/>was upon a hill in the northeaſt part of Boſton; and eight days after he wrote the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the action to England. Says he, "If we look to the height, Howe's corps aſcending the hill in the face of entrenchments, and in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſadvantageous ground, was much engaged; to the left the enemy pouring freſh troops, by thouſands, over the land, and in the arm of the ſea our ſhips and floating batteries cannonading them; ſtraight before us a large and noble town in one great blaze; the church ſteeples, being of timber, were great pyramids of fire above the reſt, behind us, the church ſteeples and heights of our own camp covered with ſpectators of the reſt of our army which was engaged; the hills round the country covered with ſpectators, the enemy all in anxious ſuſpence; the roar of cannon, mortars and muſquetry, the cruſh of churches, ſhips upon the ſtocks, and whole ſtreets falling together in ruins, to fill the ear; the ſtorm of redoubts, with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects above deſcribed to fill the eye, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion that perhaps a defeat was a final loſs of the Britiſh empire in America, to fill the mind—made the whole a picture and complication of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and importance, beyond any thing that ever came to my lot to be witneſs to.—Yet the day end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory, and the ſucceſs was moſt important, conſidering the aſcendency it gave the regular troops; but the loſs was uncommon in officers, for the number engaged."</p>
               <p n="7">VII. CAN this be believed by poſterity? Major Pitcairn, who was moſt forward in firing upon our people at Lexington, was now ſlain, with two other field officers, two of Howe's aids, ſeven Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and about eight hundred men; beſides near
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:018336_0311_0FA5CF1026621490"/>as many more who died of their wounds, while our loſs was but about half that number. All this in driving the deſpiſed Americans from a redoubt they had raiſed in one night, under the direction of a phyſician<note n="*" place="bottom">The Honorable Joſeph Warren, of Boſton, who had juſt before been appointed a Major-General by our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Congreſs.</note> as their chief commander; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he fell, the Britiſh veterans did not venture to purſue our people, though it might have been done for half a mile, under the protection of their own ſhips and batteries. Is this their glory! it was glorying in their ſhame. And a plain account of their motives here follows. Charles Lee had been an officer under Burgoyne in the laſt war, and had contracted a near friendſhip with him; and hearing of his arrival at Boſton, he ſent him a letter, which Burgoyne anſwered from thence, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 8; and ſaid, "The vital principle of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in which it moves and has its being, is the ſupremacy of the King in Parliament: A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, indefinite, indefeaſible power, coeval with the origin of the empire, and co-extenſive over all its parts." And having laid this as his foundation, he, in an artful manner, went on to compare our conduct with theirs who beheaded Charles, and ſet up Cromwell; and that of his party, to thoſe who expelled James, and crowned William; and then ſays, "Theſe principles, depend upon it, actuate the army and fleet throughout; and let me at the ſame time add, that there are few if any gentlemen among us who would have drawn their ſwords in the cauſe of ſlavery.—I know Great-Britain is ready to open her arms upon the firſt overture of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. I know ſhe is equally <hi>reſolute</hi> to maintain
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:018336_0312_0FA5CF110AF461E0"/>her original rights; and if the war proceeds, your one hundred and fifty thouſand men will not be a match for HER POWER." This was their capital argument; which, however, failed him and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at Saratoga two years after. Our ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental Congreſs met at Philadelphia May 10, and ſent a petition to the King, wherein they aſſured him, that their ardent deſire was, for the reſtoration of the former harmony between the two countries, and for its eſtabliſhment upon a permanent and laſting baſis; and ſaid, "Our breaſts retain too tender a regard for the kingdom from which we derive our origin, to requeſt ſuch a reconciliation as might in any manner be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with her <hi>dignity and welfare.</hi>" And they prayed him to direct to ſome mode wherein ſuch a reconciliation might be accompliſhed. On Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1, this petition was delivered to Lord Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, by Governor Penn, and Mr. Arthur Lee; to whom the miniſter ſaid, "No anſwer would be given." Now compare this with Burgoyne's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. He called their claims over the Colonies original rights, and the vital principle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; which was ſo oppoſite to truth, that it is impoſſible for any men ever to have ſuch a right to power over others: And inſtead of a readineſs for accommodation, they were earneſtly barring the door againſt it. General Gage covenanted with our friends in Boſton, that if they would deliver up their arms and ammunition, they ſhould have liberty to go out with their other effects. But when he had thus diſarmed them, he violated his promiſe in a ſhameful manner; which raiſed both the reſentment and the contempt of the country againſt his party. It taught the people not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:018336_0313_0FA5CF11FAD1C128"/>in their promiſes, and alſo to deſpiſe them; as being afraid, that if our women and children were not kept there as hoſtages, the people would ruſh in and deſtroy or captivate their boaſting army.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. ON the other hand, becauſe Cromwell, with the wiſdom of the ſerpent, but not the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the dove, made a great overturn in the nation, which yet ended in confuſion and ſlavery, our enemies imagined that nothing better could take place here, if we revolted from their King. But how far are God's thoughts above theirs? He raiſed up a man in Virginia, the oldeſt of our Colonels, who, by the Congreſs, was unanimouſly appointed the chief commander of our armies; and as ſuch arrived at the camp at Cambridge July 2. And through eight perilous campaigns he was preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſafety and health, was enabled to unite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and reſolution, authority and mildneſs, until his country was delivered from the moſt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and peace reſtored to the nations; and then he as readily reſigned his command as ever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, and joyfully retired into a private ſtation, followed with the univerſal eſteem and bleſſings of his country; while a demonſtration is hereby held up to all the world, that prudence, upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benevolence, will procure and preſerve that honor, authority and happineſs, which are in vain ſought for in any other way.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. SINCE the Baptiſts have often been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this land, and would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more than they did, had it not been for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints from Great-Britain, how came they to join in a war againſt her? Many have wondered at it, and ſome have cenſured them ſeverely therefor. But they had the following reaſons for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<list>
                     <item>1. Where Epiſcopalians have had all the power of government, they have never allowed others ſo much liberty as we here enjoyed. In England all are taxed to their worſhip, while none are admitted into civil offices but communicants
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:018336_0315_0FA5CF13DAD4E968"/>in their church. In Virginia, they cruelly impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Baptiſt miniſters, only for preaching the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to periſhing ſouls without licence from their Courts, until this war compelled them to deſiſt therefrom. Of this we had inconteſtible evidence. Therefore we could have no rational hopes of any real advantage in joining with them.</item>
                     <item>2. The worſt treatment we here met with came from the ſame principles, and much of it from the ſame perſons, as the American war did. Many proofs of this have already been given, and more are at hand if called for.</item>
                     <item>3. The firſt Baptiſt miniſter in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica publicly held forth, that all righteous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded in compact, expreſſed or implied; which is equally binding upon rulers and ruled; ſo that every officer, whether ſucceeding or elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who intermeddles in any matter not fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from thence, goes beyond his commiſſion. (Vol. 1, p. 168.) When therefore our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men adopted theſe principles, and founded their oppoſition to arbitrary claims wholly thereon, how could we avoid joining with them? For,</item>
                     <item>4. thoſe claims appeared to us abſolutely unjuſt, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect violation of the immutable rules of truth and equity; ſo that a concurrence with them would have brought ſuch guilt upon our conſciences, as is infinitely worſe than all the frowns of men.</item>
                     <item>5. Though heavy corrections were to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet a ſtrong hope was begotten of final deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to this land; the good effects whereof might hereafter return to the people who now invaded our rights. It is not pretended that our denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were all agreed, or had equal clearneſs in theſe points; but a majority of them were, more or leſs, influenced thereby.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>

II. A MAIN ground of the hope now mentioned, was the gracious viſitations granted from time to time, in various parts of this country, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke a deſign of final deliverance, and not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or ſlavery. Within ſeven years paſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thouſands had been hopefully converted from the errors of their ways, in Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia. In and after the year 1773, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful work prevailed in Pittsfield, Adams, Laneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Hancock, and other towns in Berkſhire; and the like in the adjacent parts of the county of Albany, and into the State of Vermont; which raiſed and increaſed many Baptiſt churches there. And, to come nearer home, the ſecond Baptiſt church in Middleborough was reduced very low, until a revival began in the ſpring of 1773, which by the fall of 1775 cauſed the addition of ninety members to that church, and thirty to our third church in this town. The work extended into the eaſt and moſt uncultivated part of Freetown, where it raiſed a new church, and another in Dartmouth. In November, 1774, a like bleſſing was granted in Attleborough, which in ten months added thirty members to the firſt Baptiſt church there, and a number more to other ſocieties. In December this revival extended into Providence, where it prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gloriouſly through the winter. Their college en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a precious ſhare of it, the good effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſtill experienced in diſtant churches. In ten months, more than an hundred perſons were added to the Baptiſt church there, beſide large additions to other churches in the town. And though the alarms of war in the ſpring cauſed a great interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpiritual exerciſes and enjoyments, in places near the ſcene of action, yet the ſame were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted thereby in diſtant places. At the time of the
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:018336_0317_0FA5CF1599313418"/>Bunker-Hill battle, a young phyſician was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Harverd, thirty-five miles off, who was called the next year to preach the goſpel; and he is now paſtor of a large Baptiſt church there, who are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeals of his miniſtry. Royalſton and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, to the northward, and Suffield, to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, were favoured with a conſiderable revival of religion at this time, as Pomfret, Killingly, and other towns in Connecticut, were in 1776. And while the defence of the civil rights of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica appeared a matter of great importance, our religious liberties were by no means to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the conteſt concerning each kept a pretty even pace through the war.</p>
               <p n="3">III. VIEWING the Continental Congreſs as our higheſt civil reſort, the Warren Aſſociation, at their meeting at Medfield, September 13, 1774, agreed to ſend their agent to Philadelphia, there to follow the beſt advice he could obtain, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome influence from thence in their favour. A Convention of the county of Suffolk, at this time the head county of our Province, gave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to this procedure; for their ſeventeenth reſolve ſays, "This county, confiding in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and integrity of the Continental Congreſs, now ſitting at Philadelphia, will pay all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and ſubmiſſion to ſuch meaſures as may be recommended by them to the Colonies, for the reſtoration and eſtabliſhment of our juſt rights, civil and <hi>religious</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The Congreſs gave their ſpecial approbation of theſe reſolves.</note>." Theſe reſolves were carried by ſaid agent to that city; where he met with an Aſſociation of Baptiſt churches, from ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Colonies, who elected a large Committee to aſſiſt in the affair, and by their requeſt a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:018336_0318_0FA5CF17182E6E00"/>was procured in the evening of October 14, with the Honorable Delegates from our Province to Congreſs, in the preſence of ſeveral more of their members, and other gentlemen. It was opened by reading a brief memorial of our chief grievances in the Maſſachuſetts, on religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, which our Delegates endeavoured to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; firſt by denying that we had any cauſe for ſuch complaints, and then by attempting to caſt all the blame thereof upon the executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and aſſerting that our Legiſlature were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely clear of it; but plain facts, eſpecially in the Aſhfield affair, confuted both of theſe pleas; and the conference was cloſed with a promiſe from ſaid Delegates of the exertion of their influence in our favour. But as ſome in Philadelphia made an attempt to turn theſe things againſt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral union of the Colonies, in the defence of our civil rights, a report was induſtriouſly ſpread in New-England, before ſaid Baptiſt agent got home, that he had been to Philadelphia on purpoſe to break that union. And while he was gone, the firſt pariſh in his own town voted to tax all the Baptiſts therein to their miniſter, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give them any more certificates. He therefore ſoon met the Baptiſt committee at Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, by whoſe advice a plain memorial of their grievances and deſires was laid before our Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Congreſs; to which the following anſwer was returned.</p>

               <p>OUR former charter provided, that when the Province ſhould happen to be deſtitute of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor or Lieutenant-Governor, the Council and Repreſentatives ſhould have the whole legiſlative power therein. Therefore, by the advice of the Continental Congreſs, ſuch an Aſſembly was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened at Watertown, July 19, 1775; to whom in September the Warren Aſſociation preſented a memorial, wherein, after mentioning the above advice, they ſay, "Our real grievances are, that we, as well as our fathers, have, from time to time, been taxed on religious accounts where we were not repreſented; and when we have ſued for our rights, our cauſes have been tried by intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judges. That the Repreſentatives in former Aſſemblies, as well as the preſent, were elected by virtue only of civil and worldly qualifications, is a truth ſo evident, that we preſume it need not be proved to this aſſembly; and for a civil Legiſlature to impoſe religions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>xes, is, we conceive, a power which their conſtituents never had to give; and is
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:018336_0320_0FA5CF1AF881DDB8"/>therefore going entirely out of their juriſdiction.— Under the legal diſpenſation, where God himſelf preſcribed the exact proportion of what the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were to give, yet none but perſons of the worſt characters ever attempted to <hi>take it by force.</hi> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. Mica. iii. 5—9. How daring then muſt it be for any to do it for Chriſt's miniſters, who ſays, <hi>my kingdom is not of this world!</hi>—We beſeech this honorable Aſſembly to take theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into their wiſe and ſerious conſideration, before him who has ſaid, <hi>with what meaſure ye mete it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> Is not all America now appealing to heaven, againſt the injuſtice of being taxed where we are not repreſented, and againſt being judged by men who are intereſted in getting away our mon? And will heaven approve of your <hi>doing the ſame thing</hi> to your fellow ſervants! No, ſurely.—We have no deſire of repreſenting this government as the worſt of any who have impoſed religious taxes; we fully believe the contrary. Yet, as we are perſuaded that an entire freedom from being taxed by civil rulers to religious worſhip, is not a mere favour, from any man or men in the world, but a right and property granted us by God, who commands us to <hi>ſtand faſt in it,</hi> we have not only the ſame reaſon to refuſe an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a taxing power here, as America has the aboveſaid power, but alſo, according to our preſent light, we ſhould wrong our conſciences in allowing that power to men, which we believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to God."—This memorial was read in the Aſſembly, and was ordered to lie a week on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and was then read again, and debated upon, and was referred to a committee, upon the receipt of whoſe report it was read a third time, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty granted to bring in a bill in our favour;
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:018336_0321_0FA5CF1CB61100E0"/>and ſuch a bill was received and read once, and a time ſet for a ſecond reading: But then other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was crowded in, and nothing more done upon it. Such is the diſpoſition of mankind.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. As the Britiſh miniſtry were deceived, and entirely diſappointed in their firſt ſcheme, a new one was invented, in the cloſe of 1775; which was, by acts of Parliament, to declare all theſe Colonies to be in a frate of rebellion, and out of the King's protection; to hire a large army from Germany, to add terror to the ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ings of the Britiſh lion; and then to appoint Commiſſioners to proclaim pardon and peace to any Colony or place that ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their power, and promiſe to raiſe as much money among themſelves as the Court of Britain ſhould judge to be their proportion, towards the ſupport and defence of government: Their peace to laſt as long as this was done. And in order to man the Britiſh ſhips, and to make all afraid of their power their commanders were ordered to enter the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nes of as many of the captives whom they ſhould take as they thought proper, among the liſt of their hands on board, ſo as to compel them to fight againſt their own country, and to be puniſhed as deſerters, if they ſhould attempt to make their eſcape. And had not the Lord been on our ſide, when men thus roſe up againſt us, how ſoon would they have ſwallowed us up! But when, in his wiſe diſpenſations, he had given them all the advantages that could well be conceived of, how eaſily did he turn their counſels into fooliſhneſs? For when the Britiſh party in Boſton came to look out in the morning of March 13, 1776, behold! two ſtately forts appeared on the top of two hills in Dorcheſter, capable of commanding both the town and the ſhips in the harbour. Burgovne's
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:018336_0322_0FA5CF1CDD4345A0"/>letter to England the June before informs us, that his party had laid a plan to take poſſeſſion of thoſe hills, which was to have been executed the 18th of that month; but was prevented by the Bunker-Hill battle the preceding day. And as the only land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſage on to thoſe heights was acroſs an open marſh, within half a mile of their guards on Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Neck, and as they had a multitude of their friends ſcattered through the country, was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſeveral hundred tuns weight of materials to be prepared before, and then to be carted ſome miles on to thoſe hills, and two forts to be erected there in one night, by the undiſciplined Americans, and the ſagacious Britons know nothing about it! Yet ſuch was the event; and let them deny it if they can. Not only ſo, but while they were preparing to go over and attack thoſe forts, the winds and waves were put into ſuch a commotion, as finally prevented the attempt. And on March 17 the Britiſh army, with a large number of our inimical countrymen, fled from Boſton; and ſoon ſailed to Nova-Scotia, or to Britain. Indeed ſome of their men of war were left in Nantaſket road, out of the reach of our cannon; yet on May 17 a ſmall arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed veſſel took a large ſtoreſhip of theirs in the bay, which was conveyed into Boſton in their ſight, and they had not power to prevent it, having on board a thouſand ſtands of arms, fifteen hundred whole bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder, and a large quantity of other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſupplies for our army. And on June 14 their ſhips were compelled to quit the lower harbour, by the firing of ſome cannon which our people had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down the night before; whereby that port was again opened, which was cruelly ſhut up two years before. And about four hundred and fifty of their troops were captivated by our cruizers about this
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:018336_0323_0FA5CF1DA9B77180"/>time; and a vaſt quantity of their goods of all kinds were taken and brought into our country.</p>
               <p n="5">V. NOT aware of ſuch events, the next object of Britiſh policy was, to appoint ſuch men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their new plan as ſhould be able to divide the Colonies, by drawing ſome part of them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their pardons. And as Lord George Howe, who was ſlain near Ticonderoga, July 6, 1758, was ſo much beloved here, that the Maſſachuſetts were at the expence of erecting a monument for him in Weſtminſter-Abbey, who could be ſo likely to gain upon our people as his two brothers? William was already appointed Governor of this Province, and Chief General of their armies; and Richard, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in title to George, and an intimate friend to Dr. Franklin, was now made Chief Admiral of their fleet; and they were made joint Commiſſioners to proclaim pardon to all who would accept of it on the above terms. And as an army of thirty-five thouſand men was to be at their command, who would not be glad to receive their pardon and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, rather than to be a mark for their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But alas! the winds and waves were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the two brothers could not meet, to ſend out their proclamations, until July 12, eight days after the Congreſs, by the conſent of the people in the thirteen Colonies, had declared them to be FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES. However, from on board their ſhips near New-York, they ſent forth their proclamations, which our people readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated through all theſe States. And, with a packet to Congreſs, Lord Howe ſent a letter to his friend Franklin, a member of it, wherein he ſays, "Retaining all the earneſtneſs I ever expreſſed to ſee our differences accommodated, I ſhall conceive, if I meet with the diſpoſitions in the Colonies which
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:018336_0324_0FA5CF1E92D716F0"/>I was once taught to expect, the moſt flattering hopes of proving ſerviceable, in the objects of the King's paternal ſolicitude, by promoting the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of laſting peace and union with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. But if the deep-rooted prejudices of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and the neceſſity of preventing her trade from paſſing into foreign channels, muſt keep us ſtill a divided people, I ſhall, from every private as well as public motive, moſt heartily lament that it is not the moment wherein thoſe great objects of my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition are to be attained."—Franklin returned an anſwer from Philadelphia July 30, wherein he ſays, "The official diſpatches, to which you refer me, contain nothing more than we had ſeen in the act of Parliament, viz. offers of pardon upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; which I am ſorry to find, as it muſt give your Lordſhip pain to be ſent ſo far on ſo hopeleſs a buſineſs. Directing pardons to be offered to the Colonies, who are the very parties injured, expreſſes indeed that opinion of our ignorance, baſeneſs and inſenſibility, which your uninformed and proud na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has long been pleaſed to entertain of us; but it can have no other effect than that of encreaſing our reſentment. It is impoſſible we ſhould think of ſubmiſſion to a government that has, with the moſt wanton barbarity and cruelty, burnt our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs towns, in the midſt of winter; excited the ſavages to maſſacre peaceful farmers, and our ſlaves to murder their maſters; and is even now bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our ſettlements with blood<note n="*" place="bottom">October 17, 1775, the enemy burnt four hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen buildings in the town of Falmouth, in Caſco-Bay. In the evening of the 7th of that month, their ſhips fired upon the town of Briſtol, near Swanzey; which cauſed the death of Mr. John Burt, their miniſter, and ſome others. Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, retired on board an armed ſhip, and drew off all the ſlaves and others that he could; and, after much other miſchief, they burnt the town of Norfolk on January 1, 1776; in which cruel action, beſides the unnatural nature of it, the whole loſs to the inhabitants was computed at above three hundred thouſand pounds. And a man was taken up, upon his way to the Ohio Indians, with a Colonel's commiſſion from General Gage, to command all the ſavages and others that he could raiſe in the wilderneſs againſt us.</note>. —Long did I endeavour, with unfeigned
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:018336_0325_0FA5CF200F43A378"/>and unwearied zeal, to preſerve from breaking that fine and noble china vaſe, the Britiſh empire; for I knew, that being once broken, the ſeparate parts could not retain even their ſhares of the ſtrength and value that exiſted in the whole; and that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect re-union of theſe parts could ſcarce ever be hoped for.— The well-founded eſteem, and, permit me to ſay, affection, which I ſhall always have for your Lordſhip, make it painful for me to ſee you engaged in conducting a war, the great ground of which, as deſcribed in your letter, is the neceſſity of preventing the American trade from paſſing into foreign channels. To me it ſeems that neither the obtaining or retaining any trade, how valuable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is an object for which men may juſtly ſpill each others blood: That the true and ſure means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and ſecuring commerce, are the goodneſs and cheapneſs of commodities; and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of no trade can ever be equal to the expence of compelling it, and holding it by fleets and armies."</p>
               <p>THE real nature of the controverſy is here ſtated in a fair and elegant manner; and its whole progreſs verifies the truth of the word which ſays, <hi>only by pride cometh contention; and the love of money is the root of all evil.</hi> And can a clearer demonſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be given, than for the inhabitants of one country to claim a right to be lawgivers and judges for
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:018336_0326_0FA5CF20AA773F10"/>others three thouſand miles off, ſo as to diſpoſe of their perſons and property without their conſent? A darling practice of our age, eſpecially among high politicians, is to ſet up reaſon above divine revelation; but how will their rules ſuit in this caſe? One of their noted authors expreſly denies that God had a right to command Abraham to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his ſon, with an intent to have it obeyed; and ſays, "The command might be given in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to convince Abraham, that even his <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> when not under the direction of <hi>his</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, might <hi>miſlead</hi> him in the conducting of his actions." The reaſon given for thus ſetting up an <hi>inward rule</hi> above the <hi>written word,</hi> is this: Says he, "It was <hi>right</hi> and <hi>fit,</hi> in the nature of the thing, that Abraham ſhould guard and protect the life of Iſaac; which obligation, as it is founded in nature, ſo it is <hi>independent</hi> of, and <hi>antecedent</hi> to, any divine command; yea, it is antecedent to the <hi>conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of a <hi>deity,</hi> becauſe it muſt and would be the ſame, if there were no ſuch thing as a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note n="*" place="bottom">Chubb's tracts, printed in London, 1754, vol. 2. p. 3, 12.</note>." Yet when he comes to the queſtion, <hi>from whence does evil proceed?</hi> he ſays, "The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this caſe may not ariſe from the ſtate of things, but from the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of our knowledge, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us incapable of ſeeing <hi>through</hi> and to the <hi>end</hi> of them<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 22.</note>." Very true; why then do theſe weak and dark minds refuſe entire ſubmiſſion and ready obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to HIM whoſe underſtanding is infinite? Had any due regard been paid to his authority in our mother iſland, we ſhould never have heard of <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſolicitude</hi> in invading the unalienable rights of her children; nor of pardons brought upon the
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:018336_0327_0FA5CF2182B1AAB0"/>points of bayonets! At the ſame time we have juſt cauſe to confeſs, that all our ſufferings were leſs than our iniquities deſerved, and that we were far from giving God all the glory of our ſupport and deliverance, as we ought to have done. To give a particular hiſtory of this war is out of my province, though a conciſe view of the chief events of it comes into our plan. Yet wanting time and means for it, my narrative muſt neceſſarily be incomplete.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. As Canada had long been a dreadful ſcourge to New-England, and the repeating of thoſe bloody tragedies was intended by our enemies, amazing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions were made to prevent it, and to unite that country with ours. Moſt of its inhabitants deſired it, which was a great inducement to this attempt. Therefore the Colonels Ethen Allen and Seth Warner, encouraged thereto by the authority of Connecticut, ſurprized and took the ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, May 10, 1775, without the loſs of a man on either ſide; whereby above two hundred pieces of cannon, two veſſels on Lake-Champlain, and a large quantity of other ſtores, fell into our hands. All this was done by three hundred and thirty men, chiefly from the State of Vermont. An army followed under Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Montgomery, and after a cloſe ſiege took St. Johns, at the farther end of ſaid lake, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the city of Montreal, November 13; previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous whereto Allen was taken and carried to Europe. In September Colonel Arnold ſet off from Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge with eleven hundred men, and marched to Newbury-Port, from whence they ſailed into Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck river, and went up to its head. And though near a third part of them then returned back, yet the remainder went forward, through a great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wilderneſs, over rivers, hills and mountains,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:018336_0328_0FA5CF2226AB9CC8"/>where they ſaw not the habitation of any human perſon for thirty-one days, until they arrived among the Canadians on November 3, by whom they were kindly treated. And the falling ſnows, ſevere cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the air, and other unſpeakable difficulties in that northern region, did not hinder their march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor the junction of Montgomery's forces with them in December before Quebec, the capital of Canada. Theſe were ſome of the doings of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom Britiſh policy, or rather folly, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be cowards and paltroons. Allen and Arnold ſprang from the deſpiſed Rhode-Iſlanders. On the other hand, as General Clinton had ſailed from Boſton with ſome forces, General Lee ſet off by land, and headed him at New-York, in Virginia, and in North and South-Carolina. At length, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforced from Britain in June, by Admiral Parker and Lord Cornwallis, a furious attack was made upon the fort on Sullivan's Iſland, near Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; but they were defeated, with great damages in their ſhipping, as well as loſs of their men; and the remainder returned and joined their main body near New-York. General Waſhington with our main army was there, and had erected various for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications in that city, and upon Long-Iſland. And through the land many gloried in what the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had done, and evidently treated their enemies with contempt. But how vain did their glorying ſoon appear?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. OUR army met with a terrible defeat on Long-Iſland, Auguſt 28; were forced to evacuate the city of New-York, September 13; fought on a retreat at the White-Plains; Fort Waſhington was given up November 16; General Lee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken December 13; and General Waſhington with the ſmall remnant of our army retreated beyond the
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:018336_0329_0FA5CF22ED676DA8"/>Delaware. Raviſhing of women, and plundering of houſes, by an enraged enemy, was ſeen through all the beautiful country of New-Jerſey, and their cantonments were extended into the towns of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Bordentown and Burlington, on the Delaware; the latter within twenty miles of Philadelphia, over to which a few freezing nights might give them an eaſy paſſage. And if we turn our eyes to the north, we behold General Montgomery ſlain, December 31, in attempting to ſtorm Quebec. In the ſpring our army were forced to make a haſty retreat from thence, being moſt cruelly harraſſed by the enemy, and greatly diſtreſſed at the ſame time with the ſmall-pox. And though a coſtly fleet to oppoſe them was formed on Lake-Champlain, yet it was loſt on October 12. And on December 3 the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with a powerful force, took poſſeſſion of Rhode-Iſland, near the heart of New-England. Our firſt army enliſted for eight months, the ſecond for a year, which was now expiring, and the ſoldiers were daily returning home. Our paper money had been kept in good credit, until large additional ſums were made in September, which leſſened its value; and ſuch vaſt quantities of goods were taken by our cruizers, and ſold at public auction, that ſugars roſe from five dollars and a third per hundred to ten dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in three months, and the like in other goods. Thus our proſperity ſeemed likely to deſtroy us, for if our public credit failed, confuſion and ſlavery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the unavoidable conſequence. And, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this, if poſſible, the enemy counterfeited our paper currency at New-York, and in a clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine manner diſperſed large quantities of it through the country. Every earthly help failed us; but as our appeal had been to heaven againſt oppreſſors, many cries now undoubtedly aſcended there, ſaying,
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:018336_0330_0FA5CF23B214B1A8"/>
                  <hi>give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.</hi> And what an anſwer thereto was returned!</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. WHILE the enemy were expecting in a few days to march in triumph to Philadelphia, on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 26 General Waſhington takes near a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them, and carries them there as captives. And though a large reinforcement of the enemy marched up to Trenton, and expected to have out General and his forces in the morning, yet the next news they hear of him is at Princeton, a dozen miles off, where he captivates another party of their troops, and is ſoon gone out of their way, January 2, 1777. Theſe things terrified the enemy in ſuch a manner as to call in and confine them at Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, within ſight of their ſhipping, until ſpring, when they returned to New-York. Hard attempts indeed were made by ſome, to perſuade the world that bribery moved the Britiſh General thus to act: As if men who could ſcarcely reward their friends for neceſſary ſervices, could outbid their enemies, who had the wealth of both the Indies at command! Such violence will courtiers offer to reaſon, rather than to confeſs that wherein they deal proudly God is above them, and eaſily turns their counſels into fooliſhneſs. For though their main army ſailed into Cheſapeak-Bay, and marched from thence to Philadelphia in September, and kept it one winter, yet they got no real advantage thereby. Rather, by dividing their forces, they prepared the way for their own confuſion. Burgoyne had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a large ſhare of military ſkill and fame, in former wars in Europe and in the Eaſt-Indies; and thirteen thouſand troops were aſſigned him, beſides ſavage auxiliaries, to invade our country from Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. Ticonderoga was thought by many to be almoſt impregnable, and yet it was deſerted by our army,
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:018336_0331_0FA5CF2463A08F48"/>July 5, before it was fully inveſted by the enemy, who purſued and harraſſed our people moſt terribly. And if the ſtrongeſt ſortreſs in the land was thus given up, only upon ſeeing the manner of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's approach, how eaſily might they ſubdue an open country, and march where they pleaſed! Where is the power now that can defend us! A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation ſpread through the country; and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this advantage with the utmoſt ſpeed, moved Burgoyne to take ſuch methods as effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated his deſigns. Had he returned a little back, and taken the advantage of a water paſſage over Lake-George, he might have reached to Fort-Edward much ſooner than he did. But fearing an abatement of the ardour of his troops, and of the conſternation of the Americans, he purſued them in a way attended with great natural impediments, which were much augmented by fallen trees and other obſtacles then thrown in their way. So that by the time he ſent out a party towards Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with a haughty proclamation to intimidate our countrymen, their ſpirits were revived, and on Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 16 they faced the enemy's encampment, and forced their lines with undaunted reſolution. His weſtern detachment, under St. Ledger, was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. And the chief commanders in that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being removed, and others appointed, in whom our people had confidence, they were all alive in the defence of our country. Ticonderoga was recovered, and every reſource and way of eſcape was cut off; ſo that the haughty General and his army had no way left but to ſurrender themſelves and their weapons into the hands of the people the had greatly abuſed and deſpiſed. This was on October 17. All Europe were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at this event; and one of their moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:018336_0332_0FA5CF251BE2A818"/>Princes ſoon made the propoſal, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed on February 6, 1778, of coming into an alliance with the United States of America. Hereby a great turn was made in our affairs, and a door was opened for our deliverance, though not without many other trying ſcenes.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. AS the invaders of our rights called us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, it was very difficult ſettling a cartel for the exchange of priſoners; and when that was agreed upon, new difficulties about it ſoon aroſe. When they had taken General Lee, who had been one of their officers, he was not dealt with as our country officers in their hands were; which moved the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to order ſome retaliation upon their officers in our hands, which cauſed reciprocal complaints, and many terrible actions on both ſides. On Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1, 1777, two hundred of our countrymen, who had been priſoners at New-York, were brought to Milford to be exchanged; but they had been ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly uſed, that a very large part of them died before their friends could have notice of it, ſo as to afford them any relief. Two young men from Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and a pious member of a Baptiſt church in Attleborough, died there in that manner. And during the war their priſon-ſhips at New-York deſtroyed many thouſands of our people, in a much more cruel manner than common murder. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when there was a want of union and vigour in the defence of our country at any time, new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the enemy againſt us never failed of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that want. They plainly acted like thieves and robbers in all parts of the land. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of May 25, 1778, a party of them came up to Warren, and burnt their meeting-houſe and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's houſe, with ſome others; plundered their goods, and carried off ſeveral of the inhabitants
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:018336_0333_0FA5CF260D800A18"/>that were not in arms, one of whorn was the paſtor of the Baptiſt church there, who was confined for ſome time in a priſon-ſhip at Newport. On their return they burnt a number of houſes in Briſtol, among which was their Epiſcopal church. But I muſt not enlarge upon this ſubject. Other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were now ſent over, with new offers of pardon, and alſo of an enlargement of our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, if we would ſubmit to the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Copies thereof were ſent to the Congreſs, and to the Governors of the ſeveral States. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe ſent to Governor Trumbull, he well ſaid, "There was a day when even this ſtep, from our then acknowledged parent ſtate, might have been accepted with joy and gratitude; but that day, ſir, is paſt irrecoverably. The repeated rejection of our ſincere and ſufficiently humble petitions; the commencement of hoſtilities; the inhumanity which has marked the proſecution of the war on your part in its ſeveral ſtages; the inſolence which diſplays itſelf on every petty advantage; the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have been exerciſed on thoſe unhappy men, whom the fortune of war has thrown into your hands; all theſe are inſuperable bars to the very idea of concluding a peace with Great-Britain, on any other conditions than the moſt abſolute, perfect independence." However, the vaſt uncertainty of human affairs muſt yet be largely experienced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a peace could be obtained.</p>
               <p n="10">X. GENERAL Howe was recalled, and Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton took his place as Chief Commander; and he evacuated Philadelphia, after they had poſſeſſed it near nine months, and marched his army acroſs the lower part of New-Jerſey, where General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington gave them battle, near Monmouth court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, June 28; when many were ſlain on both
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:018336_0334_0FA5CF279080A3D0"/>ſides, and the exceſſive heat of the air cut off many more. And no ſooner had the Britiſh troops ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at New-York, than a powerful French fleet appeared upon the coaſts, and came before that place. Britiſh fears and American hopes were raiſed hereby; which alternately were as change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the winds. The French made no attempt upon New-York; but their ſpeedy arrival at Rhode-Iſland cauſed conſiderable deſtruction of the Britiſh ſhipping, and raiſed the hopes of our people of ſeeing that place delivered. Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were collected for that purpoſe, who, under the command of General Sullivan, landed upon the iſland, Auguſt 9. But the appearance of the Britiſh fleet drew that of France out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the ſame day; and a terrible ſtorm ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſhattered both fleets, ſo as to prevent any general engagement, or a deliverance to Rhode-Iſland. In December the capital of Georgia was taken, by a party of the Britiſh troops. In 1779 various attempts were made to open a paſſage up the North River; but finding it impracticable, a ſtrong party was ſent to New-Haven, who ſlew a number of the inhabitants, and plundered the town, and then went and burnt the beautiful towns of Fairfield and Norwalk. Their malignity was hereby further diſcovered; but it could not draw the ſagacious Waſhington from the mountains, while he ſaw a powerful fleet and army below him. From Georgia a party of their troops marched to the gates of Charleſton; but the arrival of a French fleet on the coaſts turned them back to Savannah; which place our friends attempted to take by ſtorm on October 9, but without ſucceſs. Thus the hopes of help from our allies were a ſecond time diſappointed. The produce of the field was alſo
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:018336_0335_0FA5CF281CC4DA58"/>ſo much cut ſhort laſt year, that bread was the ſcarceſt the beginning of this that we had ever known. And to have the judgment of famine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that of the ſword, would be terrible indeed. But infinite goodneſs now gave us an earlier har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt than we had ever ſeen, and in a few months our ſcarcity was turned into plenty. And on Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 24 the enemy went off from Rhode-Iſland, which was a great relief to this part of the country.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. HAVING made ſufficient trial of theſe north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern hills, they flattered themſelves with much greater advantages in the ſouthern plains of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. And for a while it ſeemed as if in that way they would have carried all before them. A large force ſailed from New-York in December, and though they had a tempeſtuous paſſage, yet after ſome repairs at Georgia they came and beſieged the capital of South-Carolina; which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to yield to them, May 12, 1780. The country then lay open to their ravages; and on Auguſt 16 General Gates, who had gained great fame in the north, was entirely defeated in thoſe ſouthern regions. And though a French fleet and army arrived at Rhode-Iſland July 10, yet none could then tell whether we ſhould obtain any ſolid benefit thereby. Our public credit was ſinking dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even ſo that ſcarce any recruits for our army could be obtained, but upon private perſonal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. And in November the officers therein conſtrained the Congreſs to promiſe them half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay during life, to prevent their deſerting the pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lic ſervice of their country. In June our curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had depreciated ſo far, that ſeventy-five paper dollars were readily given for one of ſilver. By orders from Congreſs, the New-England States then came into ſuch meaſures as kept it at a ſtay until
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:018336_0336_0FA5CF2BE4704710"/>February, 1781; when the pouring in vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of it from the ſouthward gave it ſuch a rapid turn, that it run entirely down in May, ſo as to ſtop paſſing. Before which General Greene, on March 14, loſt a large number of men in the battle of Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford court-houſe, in North-Carolina; from whence Lord Cornwallis marched with a powerful army into Virginia, where he ſpread much terror, and laid waſte the country; while the credit of Congreſs was ſunk ſo low, as ſcarcely to be able to ſend the leaſt ſupply to General Greene. Yet, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of our enemies, he was made inſtrumental of an entire recovery of South-Carolina and Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. A loan of money from France revived our public credit; their troops marched through the land from Rhode-Iſland to Virginia; the winds and ſeas, with the hearts of the people, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred together to compel another experienced Britiſh General, with a large and powerful army, to yield themſelves as priſoners to the deſpiſed and much injured Americans, October 19, 1781. The effect of which was, that on November 30, 1782, the Britiſh Court fully gave up their claims to theſe Thirteen United States; which treaty was to take place as ſoon as peace was ſettled with France and the other powers concerned. Preliminaries for it were ſigned January 20, and the peace was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in September, 1783. Though before we ſay more upon it, we muſt take a further look at things among ourſelves.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. OUR Aſſembly for 1777 were empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to frame a new conſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was to be eſtabliſhed or rejected by the next Aſſembly. This was done in the winter after, but without any bill of rights; and an article was inſerted therein to adopt their old eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal laws, which cauſed the Baptiſt agent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to meet at Boſton February 21, 1778, and to draw up an addreſs to our next Aſſembly againſt thoſe laws, with a prayer that it might be fixed as a fundamental principle of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "That miniſters ſhall be ſupported only by Chriſt's authority, and not at all by aſſeſſment and ſecular force; which impartial liberty has long been claimed and enjoyed by the town of Boſton." An hundred copies of it were printed and diſperſed, and a large number of various denominations ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it. This gave ſuch an alarm, that an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt warning was given to our rulers, in the election
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:018336_0338_0FA5CF2E2B1AE1B0"/>ſermon at Boſton, May 27, againſt making any alteration in their eſtabliſhed modes and uſages in religion; when it was ſaid, "Let the reſtraints of religion once be broken down, as they infallibly would be by leaving the ſubject of public worſhip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all human wiſdom and power to ſupport and preſerve order and government in the State<note n="*" place="bottom">Payſon's ſermon, p. 20.</note>." However that conſtitution was ſet aſide; and his party in the country, ſoon after, gave a remarkable diſcovery of what their ideas were about religion and good order.</p>
               <p n="2">II. FOR two young Baptiſt miniſters were called to preach in Pepperell, near forty miles northweſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Boſton, to whom ſix perſons offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as candidates for baptiſm. Therefore, on June 26, they met in a field by a river ſide, where prayers were made, and a ſermon begun, when the chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the town, with many followers, came and interrupted their worſhip. The owner of the field warned them to depart out of it, if they would not be peaceable; but they refuſed to go. One of the Baptiſt miniſters deſired them to act like men, if they would not like Chriſtians; and reminded them of the liberty of conſcience which is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and even by the powers we were at war with; and began to open the divine warrant therefor: Upon which an officer ſaid, "Don't quote ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here!" Another of them, who was a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant in their church, caſt the odious name tory upon one of thoſe candidates for baptiſm. And he no ſooner attempted to diſcover the injuſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than the officer ſaid, "Hold your tongue, or I'll beat your teeth down your throat!" And a dog was carried into the river and plunged, in evident
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:018336_0339_0FA5CF2F182A4F50"/>contempt of our ſentiments. A gentleman of the town then invited the Baptiſts to go and hold their meeting at his houſe, which was near another river. They accepted of it, and ſo went through with their worſhip. At the cloſe of which a man was hired with a bowl of liquor to go into the river, and dip another two or three times over; where alſo two or three dogs more were plunged. After which three officers of the town came into the houſe where the Baptiſt miniſters were, and adviſed them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to depart out of what town for their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Being aſked whether their lives would be in danger if they did not depart? no anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. But ſeeing their temper, the Baptiſts agreed to diſperſe, and to meet at a diſtant place of water; which was performed, and thoſe ſix perſons were decently baptized, though further abuſe was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the cloſe of it. By direction of the Warren Aſſociation, an account of theſe things was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Independent Chronicle of October 15; which others laid before the Grand Jury of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Middleſex. But they were prevailed with to ſuſpend the matter, until the town ſhould vindicate themſelves. This they attempted in the Chronicle of November 12. It mainly turned upon diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of actions, and about the perſons who performed them. The Baptiſt account charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hiring of a perſon to go into the water upon an officer, which was ſaid to be by way of mockery. But ſay the town, "The miſrepreſentation of this affair, and indeed a moſt unpardonable one it is, appears from conſidering, that the conduct of ſaid Bynton and Lawrence was altogether from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of a youngſter, who promiſed Bynton a bowl of liquor on complying with his propoſal; and this was done inconſiderately, and not meant as
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:018336_0340_0FA5CF2FA8CBBDA8"/>a piece of religious mockery. The officers of the town had no concern in that affair.—They were quite oppoſite, and particular care was taken by the officers of the town to prevent <hi>riotous</hi> behaviour, and to maintain peace and <hi>good order.</hi> That we did, as a town, pay particular attention to the conduct of thoſe <hi>dangerous</hi> perſons, is a fact we do not wiſh to conceal." Now the dangerous perſon, who then carried into Pepperell the dangerous practice of quoting ſcripture to defend liberty of conſcience, and of <hi>burying in baptiſm,</hi> was Iſaiah Parker, paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Harvard, who from that day to this is allowed by authority to be regular miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, though he is not a State miniſter. Another event, ſtill more dangerous to their way, was as follows.</p>
               <p n="3">III. BY the unanimous voice of the Warren Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of September 8, a pamphlet was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſays, "As the affairs of GOVERNMENT and LIBERTY are the greateſt points of controverſy now in the world, it certainly is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that our ideas be clear and juſt concerning them. Permit us therefore to offer a few thoughts upon a familiar metaphor, which the Holy Ghoſt has uſed to illuſtrate their true nature. In Amos v. 24, he ſays, <hi>let judgment run down as waters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream.</hi> From whence we may obſerve,
<list>
                     <item>1. That judgment and righteouſneſs are eſſential to freedom. When we would repreſent any thing as quite free, we ſay it is as free as water. And not only the flow of mercy and grace from God to men, but alſo its effects in them, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing obedience unto him, are often compared thereto in the word of truth. John iv. 14, vii. 38, Titus ii. 11, 12, iii. 5—8. This is moſt certain, becauſe,</item>
                     <item>2. Freedom is not acting at random, but
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:018336_0341_0FA5CF305EEDDCA8"/>by reaſon and rule. Thoſe who walk after their own luſts, are <hi>

                           </gap>louds without water, carried about by winds;</hi> or <hi>raging waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame;</hi> while the true SONS OF LIBERTY are like ſtreams which <hi>run down</hi> in a clear and ſteady chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. David ſays, <hi>I will run the way of thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart. I will walk at liberty, for I ſeek thy precepts.</hi> Streams and rivers muſt have ſteady channels to run in; but they that <hi>promiſe liberty</hi> while they <hi>deſpiſe government,</hi> are <hi>wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempeſt.</hi> 2 Peter ii. 10—19.</item>
                     <item>3. Though tyranny and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs often make a great noiſe, yet govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and liberty are much ſtronger than they are. The former, like raging waves, daſh themſelves againſt the rocks, and die upon the ſhore; or like a tempeſt, after making ſad waſte and devaſtation, their ſtrength is gone, and their force is over. While the latter, like a <hi>mighty ſtream,</hi> carry all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and never reſt till they can get through or over all obſtacles put in their way.</item>
                     <item>4. Streams and rivers are of great uſe, and cauſe a conſtant flow of refreſhment and bleſſings wherever they come; ſo does the exerciſe anD adminiſtration of judgment and righteouſneſs, among all people that enjoy them. Hence,</item>
                     <item>5. The command of heaven is, <hi>let them run down:</hi> Put no obſtruction in their way. No, rather be in earneſt to remove every thing that hinders their free courſe.</item>
                     <item>6. The context plainly ſhews, that a main obſtruction to theſe great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings among the people then ſpoken to, was their aſſuming a power to govern religion, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed by it. True religion is a voluntary obedience unto God. And the great deſign of all ordinances and acts of worſhip towards him, is that thereby we may obtain pardon and cleanſing, with
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:018336_0342_0FA5CF3174612630"/>direction and aſſiſtance to behave as we ought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our fellow men. But inſtead of this, thoſe people added their own inventions to divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and ſubſtituted their acts of devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in the place of a righteous practice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; or for a cover to their contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: And they would fain have been thought very religious, although they turned <hi>judgment into worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, hated him that rebuked in the gate, and abhorred him who ſpake uprightly.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. INFINITE wiſdom diſpoſed things in ſuch a manner, as to give a keener edge to this remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance than could be foreſeen by man. For an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the laſt election ſermon, and alſo from Chauncy againſt Chandler, was added to the above obſervations, with ſome remarks thereon. At the ſame time our army on Rhode-Iſland ſaw ſuch danger of being ſurrounded by the Britiſh fleet, that they wiſely came off with all their ſtores, in the night after Auguſt 30. Chauncy imagined that this defeat might be turned to miniſterial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and therefore at his next lecture, when many of our rulers were preſent, he delivered a diſcourſe from the ſeventh of Joſhua, wherein he repreſented that one of the <hi>accurſed things</hi> which cauſed that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, was their neglect of making a new law to help miniſters about their ſalaries, which the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our currency had greatly leſſened. This ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ſoon printed and diſperſed in the country. And in the Continental Journal of October 8 it was highly commended, and its author alſo; and then it was ſaid, "Although the General Aſſembly has now been ſitting for ſome time, no motion (as I can learn) has as yet been made, or is likely to be made, for this purpoſe.—Are the clergy then to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to this treatment? Are they as an order, and the
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:018336_0343_0FA5CF31E2405F20"/>only order of men in the community, to remain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to <hi>injuſtice and fraud!"</hi> Now it was ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the above paſſages in the Baptiſt pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet were inſerted in the Independent Chronicle the ſame day, in the ſame ſtreet in Boſton. By which means the ſame author was declaring to the world in one paper, that all religious eſtabliſhments were of infinite damage to the cauſe of God and true religion; and in another, that the want of further exertions in that way was an accurſed thing, which cauſed the defeat of our army. And what could be done in ſuch a caſe? In the Boſton Gazette of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 2 it was declared, that ſaid Baptiſt pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet "Exhibited only a compound of <hi>ignorance, impudence and abuſe.</hi>" And their refuſal to comply with miniſterial demands, was declared to be a uſing force againſt them; upon which it was ſaid, "I cannot conceive that it is more proper to uſe force againſt miniſters than for them; yet this is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from which a ſet of men, who have occaſioned more diſturbance and damage to this State than would be repaired by all the money which ſelling them all for ſlaves would produce, derive their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance." And the ſecular arm was called for to puniſh them. This was ſo far from being obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the paſtor of the firſt Baptiſt church in Boſton was called to preach the election ſermon there, May 26, 1779, in which the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween church and State was well deſcribed, with the importance of keeping them entirely diſtinct; and it was printed and ſent through the State by order of authority. However our opponents were far from yielding this point.</p>
               <p n="5">V. DELEGATES from the ſeveral towns, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed entirely for the purpoſe of framing a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government, met on September 1, and
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:018336_0344_0FA5CF32A26FB450"/>choſe a large committee to make a draught for their conſideration, and adjourned. When they met again, they took in hand a bill of rights which was laid before them. The third article therein was to give civil rulers power in religious matters, which occaſioned much debate; until a Baptiſt member moved to have that article re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed. The motion was concurred with, and he was elected the Chairman of a committee of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon that article. Five of them were great politicians, and they brought in a new draught, which, after warm debates, was paſſed by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, November 10, as it now ſtands in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. In order to obtain this vote, it was aſſerted that there never was any perſecution in this land; but that what had been ſo called were only juſt puniſhments upon diſorderly perſons, and diſturbers of the public peace. And the Baptiſts were accuſed of ſending their agent to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in 1774, with a falſe memorial of grievances, in order to break the union of the Colonies. Sharp debates were cauſed hereby for ſome time; but the firſt volume of our hiſtory was brought in and laid upon the table, which ſilenced the firſt part of thoſe declamations, and their agent being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the latter part, publiſhed ſaid third article in the Chronicle of December 2, with reaſons againſt the power claimed in the middle part of it; and then named his accuſers concerning the Philadelphia affair, and charged them with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their promiſe made there; and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged them to a fair hearing before any proper judges. This was ſo far from being granted, that a long reviling piece, full of glaring deceit, came out in the Chronicle of February 10, 1780; which was ſoon after re-printed in the Providence Gazette,
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:018336_0345_0FA5CF336CCCCBB8"/>where the appeal it pretended to anſwer was not known. It accuſed the Baptiſt members of the Convention of <hi>bitterneſs and rage</hi> againſt their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, eſpecially for comparing them to the ſons of Eli; and to prove that they were not worthy of that charge, the writer ſays, "Eli's ſons were not to blame for taking that part of the offerings which the law allowed them, but for the <hi>illegal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in which they took it." Very true; and the only cauſe of the bitterneſs and rage now diſcovered againſt the Baptiſts, was their refuſal to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch an <hi>illegal</hi> and wicked <hi>manner</hi> of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An anonymous Baptiſt writer began ſome publications in the Chronicle, againſt the power of taxation claimed in the aboveſaid third article, about the time that the conſtitution was finiſhed. In anſwer to whom a writer appeared in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental Journal of March 9, ſaying, "The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies of our civil and ſacred rights are like the troubled ſea, whoſe waters cannot reſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven by furious winds are continually caſting up mire and dirt.—There is a certain junto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of diſguiſed tories, Britiſh emiſſaries, profane and licentious Deiſts, avaricious worldlings, diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſectaries, and furious blind bigots, who had much rather overturn and deſtroy the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, than not to have the gratification of their own humour." And he ſubſcribed himſelf <hi>Irenaeus, a member of Convention.</hi> The Baptiſt agent and committee met April 6, and publiſhed and appeal to the people of this State, againſt the taxing power for religious teachers claimed in the new conſtitution, then ſent out for their acceptance or rejection. But their opponents were ſo much concerned about it, that no leſs than three different pieces againſt the Baptiſt agent were publiſhed in the Boſton papers
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:018336_0346_0FA5CF34E35D48A0"/>in the month of May, to two of which the writers ſubſcribed their names, which had not been done before. One of them was a follows: The firſt part of the third article in our bill of rights ſays, "The happineſs of a people, and the good order and preſervation of civil government, eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon piety, religion and morality, and theſe cannot be generally diffuſed through a community but by the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and of public inſtructions in piety, religion and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;" which part ſaid agent, in his publication of December 2, declared a full concurrence with. Upon which a miniſter of Roxbury, in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of May 18, ſaid, "Mr. Backus, by inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently <hi>concurring fully</hi> with this part, gave up the whole cauſe for which he was agent." This he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove, by fixing an emphaſis upon the word <hi>eſſentially,</hi> and then obſerving that government <hi>can exiſt</hi> without Chriſtianity. And his evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to ſink the credit of the agent among his brethren, in order to terminate this controverſy. But the agent anſwered all thoſe three publications in one paper, June 26, when he obſerved, that "No government could ever be eſtabliſhed without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Deity; the knowledge of whom is as much greater under the goſpel than it is in Pagar countries, as <hi>ſeeing</hi> in day-light is above <hi>feeling</hi> in the night, Mat. v. 14, Acts xvii. 27.

Two of them were of Bridgwater, the others were of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter. Thoſe of Bridgwater were threatened this month with impriſonment for another miniſterial tax; but it was prevented in the following manner. One of them was lieutenant of a company of militia; and, as the public credit was ſunk ſo low as to render it exceeding difficult to raiſe recruits for our army, news came to him that the town had choſen him a member of a ſpecial committee to procure a number of men that were wanted, which news came juſt after the collector had threatened to carry him to gaol for ſaid tax, and prevented it. But a third Baptiſt from Lancaſter was impriſoned at Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, June 26, where two of his brethren had been from April 12, and they were confined there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til fall.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. YET when the new conſtitution took place, October 25, 1780, it was ſaid, "We may rely that the preſent government will do all it fairly can, by authority and example, to anſwer the end of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that the members of this Commonwealth may <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all</hi> GODLINESS as well as <hi>honeſty,</hi> and our liberty never be juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as licentiouſneſs. I know there is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſentiment reſpecting the extent of civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in religious matters.

And in the Boſton Gazette of February 5, 1781, it was

Some neighbours were ſo uncharitable and cenſorious as to imagine that this perſon changed his religion in order to be freed from miniſterial taxes.—However it remained a queſtion in the minds of many people, by what means his eſtate could be exempted legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? inaſmuch as they verily ſuppoſed that Mr. Backus has declared he would give no more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to any body whatſover, always pleading, as they received it, that the practice was contrary to the dictates of his conſcience. Nevertheleſs, contrary to the expectation of every one, our aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors have been furniſhed with a certificate.—I hope the public will put the moſt favourable conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the late remarkable conduct of our agent for a thouſand ſouls; that his laudable example will be punctually imitated by all others of the ſame profeſſion, and thereby finiſh one part of the tedious diſpute which has long ſubſiſted." This paper was left for him three days after, by a noted lawyer, at a houſe he was to preach at in Bridgwater. From thence he went into Boſton, and demanded the name of the writer of that libel. This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the printer, though he was ready to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an anſwer to it: An anſwer was therefore left, upon an expreſs promiſe from the printer, that he would not publiſh a reply without the writer's name.

<pb n="334" facs="unknown:018336_0349_0FA5CF37258EE610"/>pieces were publiſhed in the Boſton papers againſt him; in one of which he was threatened with a halter and the gallows. Yet for all this noiſe, they had no other foundation than a line that was given July 12, 1780, which certified that a man in Pembroke was a baptized member of the firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Middleborough, ſigned only by their paſtor, at a time when no certificate law had been in force for ſome months, and never could be again, according to ſaid third article, which excludes all ſubordination of any one ſect to another. And the line given did not anſwer to any law ever made in this government, from its foundation to this day. It may therefore be proper in this place to give a diſtinct account of what the faith and order of theſe Baptiſt churches are, againſt whom ſuch oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been made.</p>

                     <item>1. That God ſet Adam as the public head of all mankind; ſo that when he revolted from heaven, and ſeized upon the earth as his own, all the human race fell in him, and all bear his earthly image, until they are born again.</item>
                     <item>2. That in infinite mercy the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave a certain number of the children of men to his beloved Son, before the world was, to redeem and ſave; and that he, by his obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, has procured eternal redemption for them.</item>
                     <item>3. That by the influence of the holy Spirit, each of theſe perſons, as they come into exiſtence, are effectually called in time, and ſavingly renewed in the ſpirit of their minds.</item>
                     <item>4. That their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God, is wholly by the perfect

                     <item>5. That every ſuch ſoul will be kept by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, through faith unto eternal ſalvation.</item>

                     <item>7. That the right way of building ſuch churches is by giving a perſonal verbal account to the church of what God had done for their fouls, to the ſatisfaction of the church.</item>
                     <item>8. That the whole power of calling, ordaining and depoſing officers, is in each particular church; although it is ordinarily proper and expedient to call in the advice and aſſiſtance of ſiſter churches upon many ſuch occaſions.</item>
                     <item>9. That the whole power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and diſciplining their members is in each particular church; though advice and courſel from others, in ſome caſes, is becoming and even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</item>
                     <item>10. That the government of the church ſhould be wholly by the laws of Chirſt, enforced in his name, and not at all by the ſecular arm.</item>

<pb n="336" facs="unknown:018336_0351_0FA5CF3B16454758"/>as men and brethren in Chriſt. Theſe are the chief points of faith and order, wherein we differ from others, and for which ſuch reſentment has been ſhewn againſt us. And in this and the former volume of our hiſtory we have clearly proved, that all theſe points were held by the fathers of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Colony. And Governor Winſlow, one of their firſt planters, informs us that when they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. Robinſon, their dear paſtor in Holland, in 1620, he gave them the following advice and ſolemn charge, viz.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. "WE are now to part aſunder, and the Lord knoweth whether ever I ſhall live to ſee your faces again: But whether he has appointed it or not, I charge you, before God and his bleſſed angels, to follow me no further than I follow Chriſt. And if God ſhall reveal any thing to you by any other inſtrument of his, be as ready to receive it as ever you were to receive any truth by my miniſtry; for I am very confident that he has more truth and light yet to break forth out of his holy word. He took occaſion alſo miſerably to bewail the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the reformed churches, who were come to a period in religion, and would go no further than the inſtruments of their reformation. As for example, the Lutherans could not be drawn to go beyond what Luther ſaw; for whatever part of God's will he has further imparted and revealed to Calvin, they will rather die than embrace it. And ſo you ſee the Calviniſts, they ſtick where he left them; a miſery much to be lamented, for though they were precious ſhining lights in their times, yet God had not revealed his whole will to them; and were they now living, they would be as ready to embrace further light as what they had received. Here (ſays Winſlow) he put us in mind of our
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:018336_0352_0FA5CF3C8FBB2150"/>church covenant, whereby we promiſe and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and one another, to receive what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever light and truth ſhall be made known to us from his written word; but withal exhorted us to take heed what we receive for truth, and well to examine and compare it with other ſcriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we received it; for, ſaid he, it is not poſſible the Chriſtian world ſhould come ſo lately out of ſuch thick Antichriſtian darkneſs, and that full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of knowledge ſhould break forth at once<note n="*" place="bottom">Winſlow's anſwer to Gorton, p. 97, 98.</note>." Such were the noble ſentiments and ſolemn charge of Mr. Robinſon, that eminent father of the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of New-England. To which I ſhall annex a caution he gave, in his preface to a defence of their cauſe ten years before. Says he, "I deſire the Chriſtian reader to take knowledge of this one thing, that as the pretence of zeal in forward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters againſt all corruptions is a thick miſt, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of many well-minded people from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, ſo the perſon with whom I now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deal truſts to this inſinuation above all others, conveying himſelf under this colour into the hearts of the ſimple, and hereby making way moſt effectually not only for his counſels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, for the quenching of their affections towards the truth, but alſo for his idle gueſſes and <hi>likelihoods</hi> (vol. 1, p. 7) with ſuch <hi>perſonal</hi> compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and imputations as his book is ſtored with, to alienate mens hearts from it.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. DR. Mayhew publiſhed two ſermons, in the beginning of 1763, from thoſe words, <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> From whence, after laying down many juſt obſervations, he endeavours to prove, that the Lord is good to all the different ranks, orders or ſpecies of his intelligent and ſenſitive creatures; and good and kind to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>individuals</hi> of which theſe ſpecies conſiſt. He allows that the terms <hi>all, every,</hi> and the like, are ſometimes uſed in a limited ſenſe in ſcripture, and that there are many places which muſt neceſſarily be ſo underſtood; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any limitation here, becauſe God's goodneſs is perfect and infinite, as well as his other perfections. And beginning with a greater number, and coming down to a leſſer, he at laſt comes to the loweſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; and if any held that he was not good to that individual, Mayhew ſays, "I think you ſhould paraphraſe the text thus, the Lord is good to all <hi>but one,</hi> and his tender mercies are over all his works, <hi>excepting a ſingle</hi> inſignificant creature, which either eſcapes his notice, or at which he is angry,
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:018336_0354_0FA5CF3EAF822F88"/>and ſo makes it miſerable, though it neither has nor is capable of offending him." And he goes on to obſerve, that John ſays, <hi>God is</hi> LOVE; and then ſays, "It is worthy of particular remark, that though God is infinitely wiſe and powerful, &amp;c. as well as good, yet he is never ſtiled in ſcripture <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>power</hi> in the abſtract, as he is here ſtiled LOVE. Perfect goodneſs, love itſelf, is his very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, in a peculiar ſenſe; immeaſurable, immutable, univerſal and everlaſting LOVE<note n="*" place="bottom">Said ſermons, p. 39, 44.</note>." Again ſays he, "Nothing was prior, not even the exiſtence of God, to his <hi>will</hi> to be good.—God is then not only eternally, <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and eſſentially, but infinitely or perfectly good. And if ſo, then equally, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, and immutably good in all times and places." Neceſſity therefore he aſcribes to the will of God, though his party ſtrenuouſly deny that it can be conſiſtent with the liberty of our wills. And he had before aſſerted, "That there is no medium betwixt God's being actually kind and merciful to all, and his being poſitively cruel and unmerciful to ſome<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 35, 46</note>." And to give his ideas of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſays, "Infinite goodneſs itſelf, conſidered in connexion with infinite wiſdom, requires that order, and the higheſt veneration for the majeſty of God, his laws and government, ſhould be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt all his reaſonable creatures. Their own good eſſentially depends upon it. And this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant end is <hi>moſt effectually</hi> attained by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, by whom <hi>we have received the atonement.</hi> We are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtured in the holy ſcriptures, that God forgives the ſins of men through this great ſacrifice interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>rather</hi> than without any, not becauſe he is in his own nature deficient in goodneſs, or not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merciful, but becauſe he is infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> as well
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:018336_0355_0FA5CF3FB4147948"/>as merciful.—There was a fitneſs and congruity in it, as the wiſeſt and beſt method for ſaving ſinful men, without any kind of reference to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but yet <hi>ſtrange</hi> ſuppoſition, of divine <hi>juſtice</hi> being entirely diſtinct from divine goodneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 64.</note>." It is to be noted, that here he owns that he rejects the <hi>common</hi> ſentiments of our fathers; and ſays he, "I ſeriouſly declare, that if I were to form my concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's moral character, by ſuch diſcourſes as I have ſometimes heard and read, and ſuch as were, <hi>by many,</hi> thought to be truly <hi>evangelical,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thinking him really good to ALL, and his tender mercies over ALL his works, eſſentially good, and infinitely the beſt of beings, I could not but conclude him to be <hi>infinitely</hi> more <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> than any other being in the univerſe!" And he at length ventures to ſay of infants, "To ſuppoſe that the ſin of Adam and Eve is or can be ſo imputed to them, as to render them <hi>juſtly</hi> liable to eternal miſery, without any offence of their own, is one of the groſſeſt of all abſurdities." And to hold that any of the human race are not choſen in Chriſt to eternal life, is a doctrine which he rejects in the ſame manner; after which he ſays, "If, therefore, my brethren, you know of any particular ſcheme or ſyſtem of Chriſtianity (ſo called) two or three of the moſt diſtinguiſhing and leading principles of which, and the baſis on which the whole reſts, are plainly and certainly repugnant to the doctrine of God's <hi>univerſal</hi> goodneſs, and his tender mercies over all his works; you may be certain that ſuch ſcheme or ſyſtem is falſe; abſolutely and wholly falſe, ſo far as it has any connexion with or dependence upon thoſe principles<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 50, 62, 63, 83, 85.</note>." He allows that there will be a future puniſhment to the wicked, but leaves the
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:018336_0356_0FA5CF412F7CF798"/>words concerning it undefined; and concludes with mentioning, that in the other world the meaning of that paſſage in the Revelation will be more clearly opened than we can conceive of it here, that "<hi>Every creature</hi> which is in <hi>heaven,</hi> and on the <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>under the earth,</hi> and ſuch as are in the <hi>ſea,</hi> and <hi>all that are in them,</hi> heard I ſaying, bleſſing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE reader may now judge, whether this author had not a deſign againſt ſome of the moſt important principles of the Proteſtant reformed ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Chriſtianity, as it had long been profeſſed in this and other countries. Yet becauſe Mr. Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land repreſented his ſermons in that light, in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to defend that ſyſtem, Dr. Mayhew called it "A defamatory libel;" and ſaid to Cleaveland, "Can you poſſibly think it became you, an obſcure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from another Province, and one ſo unlettered as you are, an out-caſt from the college to which you was a diſgrace?—Did you not ſhow the utmoſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, in thus ſetting up your little ſelf?—Poor, unhappy man! You doubtleſs thought to emerge from your obſcurity, and to appear as a perſon of ſome conſequence, by this vain attempt.—It is as much <hi>beneath me</hi> to play the <hi>critic</hi> on ſuch a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as yours, as it would be particularly to expoſe the vanity of your criticiſms on my ſermons.—But I will proceed to the main buſineſs of this letter, which is to ſet your <hi>falſhood</hi> and iniquitous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, with reference to my ſermons, in <hi>ſome order before your eyes;</hi> and to adminiſter the reproof and correction which you deſerve, or rather a <hi>part</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For it is only they that hold the <hi>ſword of public juſtice,</hi> that can legally puniſh ſuch wickedneſs to the <hi>extent</hi> of its demerits. Your <hi>villainy</hi> in this
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:018336_0357_0FA5CF41AF14B048"/>affair appears written, as one may ſay, even upon your forehead<note n="*" place="bottom">Mayhew's letter of reproof, 1764, p. 4—6.</note>." And his whole letter of forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine pages is in this ſtrain; which inſtead of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal goodneſs, diſcovers how ſuch men would treat their opponents, if their power was equal to their wills. A ſight of theſe things moved the Preſident and Corporation of the college, who expelled Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to give him the title of A. M. the ſame year. Yet when Mayhew died two years after, Chauncy reflected upon Cleaveland (as before obſerved, p. 229) and called him an obſcure perſon without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. And to this day the perſons of thoſe two men are held in ſuch admiration by multitudes, that they are much ſooner diſturbed at hearing their errors expoſed, than at hearing their MAKER blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed! while they are highly pleaſed with ſeeing eminent miniſters of oppoſite principles treated with a high degree of abuſe and contempt, as appears in what follows.</p>
               <p n="3">III. ALL eſtabliſhments of worſhip by human laws, that ever were erected under the Chriſtian name, were built upon calling the covenant in Gen. xvii. the covenant of grace. Yet our excellent Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was ſeparated from his dear flock at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, only for inſiſting upon a perſonal profeſſion of ſanctifying grace in order for full communion. (Page 191.) From thence he went and ſettled at Stockbridge, on the weſt borders of our State; where his ſucceſſors have endeavoured to purſue his plan of reformation. A conſiderable number of miniſters, in various parts of the land, have alſo laboured in the ſame cauſe. About the cloſe of 1768, Dr. Joſeph Bellamy publiſhed a ſmall piece upon the half-way covenant; which was ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and he wrote not leſs than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="343" facs="unknown:018336_0358_0FA5CF4266C8E4E0"/>upon the covenant, to prove that a profeſſion of ſaving faith was a neceſſary term of communion in the church, and of being active in baptiſm. The piece on the oppoſite ſide, mentioned in p. 268, was occaſioned hereby. And within ſix years above twenty pamphlets were written by different par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon this ſubject, through the country from New-Jerſey to Boſton. The name of a half-way covenant was diſowned by all theſe writers, and their controverſy turned entirely upon the queſtion, whether a profeſſion of ſaving faith ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of communicants, or not? For both parties agreed that none ſhould be active themſelves in baptiſm, but ſuch as had a right to come to the other ordinance; and they were as unable to ſettle this matter as Stoddard and Mather were ſeventy years before. (Page 33, 34.) How to reconcile divine ſovereignty with human liberty, and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace with the uſe of means for converſion, were alſo queſtions that they had long and tedious debates upon. At length a ſingular act of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline at Stockbridge ſeemed to give the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an occaſion, and it was eagerly improved, to give them as bad a <hi>thruſt with their horns,</hi> as ever was given by any bulls in Baſhan. It was as follows. Thoſe who have ſeen the nature of original ſin, cannot tell how to keep up the idea of childrens being born in the covenant of grace, without ſome regard to grace in their parents. And in the ſame chapter where the unbelieving conſort is ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the believer, a widow is required to marry <hi>only in the Lord.</hi> Therefore, becauſe a young widow in Stockbridge church married an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral profane man, in the beginning of 1777, ſhe was cenſured and excluded from their communion. This occaſioned the calling of a Council in Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:018336_0359_0FA5CF43270C1800"/>1779, which was adjourned to May, and from thence to October, when they juſtified the church in that act. The man who married ſaid widow was from Connecticut; and he got a learned miniſter from thence to plead his cauſe in the laſt of thoſe Councils, who was ſon to the ruler that ſent a man to priſon forty years ago, for preaching the goſpel. (Page 165.) As his client was not relieved by that Council, he publiſhed his plea for him, which has paſſed through three or four editions. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered from Stockbridge, upon which he publiſhed a larger piece in 1780, intituled, Letters of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; which being replied to, he in 1781 gave what he called a gentle reprimand. And in 1782 theſe three pieces were printed in one at Boſton. Their evident deſign was to relieve that woman, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent diviſion among their miniſters, and to keep up the uſe of force for their ſupport; all which it is ſaid are accompliſhed thereby. Be that as it may, it is certain that much deceit and cruelty have been uſed in this affair. Many would limit the word perſecution to corporal puniſhments; which is ſo oppoſite to truth, that <hi>reviling</hi> and <hi>mockery</hi> contain a great and <hi>cruel</hi> part of it, Mat. v. 11, Heb. xi. 36. Colonel Gardiner, who was converted ſixty-five years ago, declared that "He would much rather have marched up to a battery of the enemy's cannon, than have been obliged ſo continually as he was to face ſuch artillery as this<note n="*" place="bottom">Gardiner's life, p. 35.</note>." Yet in order to carry his point, this advocate advanced a parable of a church who refuſed to allow a brother therein to marry a woman he dearly loved, becauſe not a gracious perſon; and adviſed him to marry a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theirs that was ſound in the faith, which is moſt ſhockingly deſcribed; and then ſaying of her
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:018336_0360_0FA5CF43E07595E8"/>perſon, "As to ſome trifles, which a carnal man would object to, it becomes you, as a ſpiritual man, to make no objection. It is true, ſhe is of a mean family, and a very weak underſtanding; ſhe is pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and fretful to the higheſt degree; her ſhape is ſemicircular; ſhe is what the world calls monſtrous ugly; every feature is adapted to mortify carnal deſires, which is much better than to have them gratified; ſhe is the queen of ſluts, and without any polite education. But ſhe has grace, SAVING GRACE; ſhe is regenerated; let your grace wed with hers, and a <hi>ſweet bride</hi> ſhe will be. Moreover, <hi>ſhe is paſt the flower of her age,</hi> and we ſuppoſe <hi>need ſo requires</hi>

                     </gap>a, p. 29.</note>." Now is it poſſible to dreſs up a church and ſcripture phraſes in a more odious and ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner than is here done! Yet in his repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which he calls gentle, he inſinuates that for any to be offended at it argues guilt; becauſe, ſays he, "It was expreſly declared that it is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only as <hi>truth</hi> applies it." But when we look into his plea, we find him ſaying, "Let the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parable apply where it <hi>will</hi> apply<note n="†" place="bottom">Plea, p. 27, Reprimand, p. 15.</note>." Truth cannot apply it to any church upon earth; but his <hi>will</hi> has publiſhed the names of thirteen miniſters in that plea, more worthy than himſelf, for the world to laugh at as much as they <hi>will.</hi> And this is doubtleſs the chief reaſon of its circulating ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively. But how mean and ſpiteful is it to treat the word grace in this manner! Affixing the word to the covenant of circumciſion, where God never put it, is the ſource of that difficulty at Stockbridge. The words <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> in 1 Cor. vii. 14, are both of a kind, and the latter the effect of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and their meaning may be aſcertained by 1 Tim. iv. 5. But if we muſt go to the law for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:018336_0361_0FA5CF44C5769328"/>of the world holy there, the ſame word in the law is given as the reaſon why they ſhould not marry with unholy perſons, Deut. vii. 3, 6. Every ſoul therefore will be ſelf-condemned that affixes the name grace to the convenant of circumciſion, and at the ſame time cenſures the church at Stockbridge for attempting to act conſiſtently upon it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. HIS ſecond pamphlet is directed to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who had eſſayed to withdraw from the major party in the country; to whom he applies the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic warning, <hi>beware of dogs, beware of the conciſion:</hi> Which warning was levelled againſt thoſe who held to the covenant of circumciſion after it was out of date, and could not bear to quit all <hi>confidence in the fleſh,</hi> Phil. iii. 2, 3. The General Aſſociation of miniſters in Connecticut, June 3, 1780, ſtated the nature of thoſe miniſters crime in theſe words, viz. "Refuſing intercourſe of miniſterial labours, and to receive our members, on recommendation from the paſtors and churches to which they belonged, to their communion, without a particular and perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al examination<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters of friendſhip, p. 133.</note>."

And it is aſſerted, that "The churches in New-England are generally <hi>full as ſtrict</hi> in their practice, as the church at Stockbridge, and require <hi>full</hi> as much religion in the profeſſion, life, and converſation of the candidate." And the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Lebanon (mentioned in p. 191) is referred to as an example thereof<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 62, 115.</note>. Yet he was a man who held tenaciouſly that the field where ſaints and the viſible children of the wicked one are ordered to <hi>grow together,</hi> intends the viſible church; which an
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:018336_0362_0FA5CF4563472890"/>excellent writer ſays gave others occaſion to reflect, "That thoſe churches whoſe practice is agreeable to his looſe principles, do that at noon-day, in the preſence of God, angels and men, which the devil did in the night, while men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is alſo to be obſerved, that a member of the church in Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge detected ſaid advocate in ſeveral violations of truth, as to matters of fact there. But inſtead of any honeſt retraction, he ſaid of that member, "Where he is known, he can perhaps hurt no man's character, either with his tongue or pen; and it is a queſtion whether, at this period of time, he can hurt his own." And again, "He has exerted himſelf with all his might, to ſuppreſs the goſpel miniſtry in this land, labouring among other efforts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>only</hi> probable means for the ſupport of it<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters of friendſhip, p. 138. Reprimand, p. 13</note>." That is, the man he points to, being of the Convention who formed our new conſtitution, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to exclude the uſe of violence from it in ſupporting religious teachers. And his character was ſuch as to be freely choſen one of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts Senators in May, 1781. How then did his opponent <hi>deſpiſe government?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. MR. Locke long ſince obſerved, that learned diſputants often act as deceitfully about the main <hi>words</hi> of their controverſy as a trader would do if he took the figure 8, and called it ſometimes ſeven and ſometimes nine, as would ſuit his advantage. And how much was that the caſe in this diſpute! The moſt puzzling argument of the advocate for the profane man, was declaring that by baptiſm he was in the church, and ought to have been diſciplined, rather than his wife for marrying of him. And in 1783 the ſame author publiſhed an addreſs to the
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:018336_0363_0FA5CF46346CFD70"/>Baptiſts, wherein he repreſents the covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to be ſuch an ample charter of church privileges, that it would even have been an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the ſacred character, or reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perfections of God, to expect an expreſs deſcription of who were the ſubjects of baptiſm in the new teſtament. Now it is certain that every man in Iſrael who ſhould <hi>forbear</hi> to keep the paſſ-over as it was inſtituted, muſt be <hi>cut off from his people,</hi> Numb. ix. 13. And if the covenant is the ſame now, every perſon among their churches who has been ſprinkled in infancy muſt come to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the ſupper, or be excommunicated, be he converted or unconverted, moral or profane. Yet the aboveſaid pleader has the effrontery to ſay to his opponents, "You tell us, gentlemen, that ſome of us do not agree with you, in our notions of the terms of church communion, or admiſſion of church members.—But—no mortal knows, or can know, who has grace or who has not.—Let us ſpeculate and diſpute as long as we pleaſe, we muſt practiſe alike, or we cannot practiſe at all<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters of friendſhip, p. 20.</note>." But if many are in darkneſs, and know not where they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does that prove that others have no true light? And if they love darkneſs rather than light, can their evils make void the word of Chriſt? who ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</hi> They <hi>bite with their teeth, and cry, peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war againſt him.—Yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord among us? None evil can come upon us.</hi> This is their learning, their logic; from a negative propoſition they form a poſitive concluſion. They are in covenant with death, and agreement with hell, and from thence think to ſecure themſelves; and they <hi>ſcornfully</hi> ſlight all warnings of future danger. But the time is haſtening when their <hi>bed</hi> will be too ſhort for them, and their <hi>covering</hi> too narrow; and it will be <hi>a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation only to underſtand the report of the goſpel,</hi> Iſai. xxviii. 14—20. Rom. x. 16. Union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, who is LIGHT and LOVE, was the life of man at firſt; and a revolt from him, into <hi>darkneſs and diſorder,</hi> was <hi>death,</hi> the penalty of the law. And the character of hell is <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> John viii. 44. Therefore I conclude, that the known uſe of <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> is the covenant with death and agreement with hell, wherewith ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful officers have often thought to ſecure themſelves againſt preſent and future dangers. This I take to be a ſcriptural glaſs, and return our opponents compliment upon it. Says he, "Why do the letters of friendſhip offend them, ſince it is ſo expreſly premiſed that no perſon is pointed at in them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs juſtly characterized? If my face is dirty and not fit to be ſeen, I waſh it, and never quarrel with my glaſs about it<note n="*" place="bottom">Reprimand, p. 15.</note>." And ſince his zeal has been ſo great for the relief of one cenſured woman, let him appear for another nearer home. For a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good character, in the head county of his own State, was cenſured in 1781, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:018336_0365_0FA5CF47B0CB1E90"/>in 1783, by a miniſter who is a fellow of Yale college, for no other crime than refraining from coming to the Lord's table with ſuch as hold the Lord's ſupper to be a converting ordinance.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. THIS may lead us to take a further view of their claims of power over the churches. About twenty years ago, a miniſter who was a fellow of Yale college publiſhed a pamphlet to prove that the power of ordination is inherent in miniſters, and that Chriſt never gave that power to the church as a body. This he dedicated to their Governor; and he therein allowed that the people have a right to chooſe their miniſters, but not to ordain them, any more than the freemen of Connecticut have to ſwear their magiſtrates into office. An anſwer was wrote to him, and he made a reply in 1766. But then both his patron and his compariſon failed him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Governor and ſeveral magiſtrates were left out of office by the people, for favouring the stamp-act. And what could he then do? He ſlipt over the line, and ſaid, "The Governor of a Province is, by the King's commiſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power and authority as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch an officer, diſtinct from the rights, powers and privileges, belonging to the government, by the conſtitution, charter, and laws of the land. And though the magiſtracy, and other officers, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives, have a legiſlative and executive authority with him, under his precedency, and act with him in judgment, in many caſes; yet are theſe diſtinct branches of authority, originating from different fountains of power: The former from ſpecial commiſſion from the King, the other from the conſtitution and laws of the government. I take the caſe to be <hi>much parallel</hi> in eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:018336_0366_0FA5CF4859A166C0"/>government<note n="*" place="bottom">Beckwith's ſecond letter againſt lay-ordination<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, p. 42, 43.</note>." And we have ſhewn (p. 275) that the Maſſachuſetts miniſters claimed a higher power than the King allowed to his Governor; and he was the head of their eſtabliſhments for worſhip, both there and in Connecticut. (Page 78, 178.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are now in a deplorable caſe; for an ocean three thouſand miles wide rolls betwixt the head and the body of that conſtitution, ſo that they have only a dead polluted <hi>carcaſe</hi> left <hi>in their high places,</hi> Ezek. xliii. 7. And thoſe who have ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the reaſonable teſtimonies and petitions of the Baptiſts, are forced now to become ſuppliants to them, in order to ſave their polluted ſcheme. In a Boſton paper, before mentioned, of February 5, 1781, they tell a ſtory of a gentleman's babe, that was taken by an ape and carried to the roof of the houſe, while he and his family were at church, and a careleſs maid got to ſleep; and yet that the babe was ſaved by their prayers. Upon which they name the Baptiſt agent, whom they accuſe of doing the like with their religion; but expreſſed their hopes of having it now returned into its former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But herein they appear more contemptible than the prieſts of Baal did in Elijah's time; for they came out like men, and performed their devotion in the ſight of the people, while theſe only publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their prayers in news-papers, and were afraid that their names ſhould be known. And the babe they pray for is not a human creature, but a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, begotten upon a whore; and great <hi>happineſs</hi> is promiſed to thoſe who ſhall <hi>daſh ſuch little ones againſt the ſtones,</hi> Pſalm cxxxvii. 8, 9. And the Baptiſts not only covet ſuch happineſs, but obedience to government requires it of them. For all Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant kingdoms have ſet up their King as head of
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:018336_0367_0FA5CF4C251053B8"/>the church; but that name is now excluded from our Legiſlature. And to move the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this conſtitution, the compilers of it ſaid to them, "Your delegates did not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves veſted with power to ſet up one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians above another; for religion muſt at all times be a matter between God and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als<note n="*" place="bottom">Addreſs before the conſtitution, March 2, 1780, p. 17.</note>." And no man can take a ſeat in our Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature until he ſolemnly declares, "I believe the Chriſtian religion, and have a firm perſuaſion of its truth<note n="‡" place="bottom">Conſtitution, chap, vi.</note>." And as ſurely as it is true, Chriſt is HEAD <hi>of all principality and power,</hi> and the church is COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLEAT in him; and required to do all her acts in <hi>his name.</hi> Therefore all worſhip that is ſupported in any other name is only <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> Col. ii. 9, 10, 23, iii. 17. And though recourſe has often been had to Germany, for matter to prejudice people againſt equal liberty and believers baptiſm, yet twenty thouſand mercenaries have lately been brought from thence to fight againſt ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to deluge our land with blood againſt whom no denomination in America have acted with more prudence and vigour than the Baptiſts. In the fall of 1778, our Legiſlature paſſed an act to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents are ſtill ſo unwilling to allow equal liberty, and that the power of church government ſhould be in the body of each community, that a pamphlet was publiſhed at Boſton againſt it, near the cloſe of 1783, wherein it is ſaid, "If the power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing its paſtors is determined to be lodged in the

This author was an active member of the Convention who formed our new conſtitution, but they are now enſnared in the work of their own hands; and to move others to relieve them he ſays, "The world produces not a ſet of miniſters more holy in their lives, more free from immorality of every kind, more pure in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, or more ingenious, animated and pathetic in their addreſſes, than the clergy of New-England.— The obſervation hath often been made, that it is natural to the clergy to be fond of power. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpute they are ſo, for they are men, and ſubject to the ſame feelings and inclinations with others. But in New-England, let them have felt ever ſo much of this inclination, they have not diſcovered it.

Their main arguments turn upon extending the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every individual, and Chriſt's merits alſo; although they do not attempt to tell how long it will be before all come to enjoy the ſame. They ſay, "There will be a great deal to be done, after the ſecond coming of Chriſt.—Indeed (ſay they) the doctrine of PURGATORY, as now taught by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, ſeems to be a corruption of a genuine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine held by the ancient fathers, concerning the <hi>fire of hell,</hi> which will <hi>burn up ſin and luſt</hi>

Though Dr. Chauncy himſelf ſays, "I am clearly of the mind, that a viſibly wicked miniſter is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſcandal to religion, and plague to the church of God; nor is it a hurt, but a real ſervice to the cauſe of Chriſt, to expoſe the characters of ſuch, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their power to do miſchief<note n="†" place="bottom">Chauncy's thoughts, 1743, p. 141.</note>."

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. WHEN we have conceived an ill opinion of any denomination, it is exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to treat them fairly. An inſtance hereof is before me, that may be proper to mention. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's treatiſe on the will has paſſed through one edition at Boſton, and two or more in London, without ever being anſwered, although it is levelled directly againſt the turning point of Arminianiſm, to which the opinion of univerſal ſalvation naturally ſucceeds. Many who do not own either of thoſe names, yet have conceived a ſtrong prejudice againſt Calviniſm, which Edwards profeſſed to own, though
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:018336_0371_0FA5CF4F27325128"/>not every opinion that Calvin advanced. A late learned performance from London, re-printed at Philadelphia in 1783, contains the following things. The author, when giving his own deliberate ideas, ſays, "The viſible world demonſtrates, it was made by an omnipotent power, and is preſerved by the ſame power. What doth not neceſſarily exiſt, muſt be originally created, and continually upheld by the power that made it.—There is no medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſelf-exiſtence and dependence on its cauſe; therefore a ceſſation from it of the power that made it is annihilation to it. Thus as all created things were made, and ſtill ſubſiſt ſolely by the energy of the Creator's <hi>will</hi> and power, he muſt neceſſarily, whilſt they exiſt, be omnipreſent with them, in them, and through them; therefore cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any thing relating to them, nor unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about them, or any part of them<note n="*" place="bottom">Phipps againſt. Newton, p. 37, 38.</note>." If ſo, then the creature can do no act but what his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator ſees cauſe either to order or permit, which is the eſſence of Calviniſm. No, ſays this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, "We attribute the whole of man's ſalvation to the light or grace within, firſt and laſt, without at all placing man's deſtruction to the account of his Maker, which John Calvin directly doth." And after attempts to prove this charge from ancient writings, he tries to confirm it from Edwards on the will. And in reference to his main point, he ſays, "We are told, <hi>the will is always determined by the ſtrongeſt motive.</hi> Has the will no liberty then at any time? Is it always ſo <hi>forcibly</hi> determined, in all its motions, by circumſtances and motives ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ariſing upon it, from the original conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, that every man is neceſſarily oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think, ſpeak and act, juſt as he doth?—Was
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:018336_0372_0FA5CF4FE0C23330"/>this really the caſe, our <hi>inevitable</hi> acts would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render us no proper ſubjects of reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of come, ye bleſſed, or go, ye curſed. We muſt be equally unintitled to approbation and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 86, 97, 98.</note>." But I muſt tell him and all his friends, that I am much better acquainted with Edwards's writings than they are, and I abſolutely know that the ideas naturally ariſing from the words <hi>forcibly</hi> and <hi>inevitable,</hi> as here uſed, when charged upon Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, are entirely unjuſt and abuſive. And it tends to raiſe an evil temper in thoſe who read the ſame, againſt all the friends of Edwards's writings, of whom I am heartily one. I am certain that the author who has thus cenſured him, is not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er friend to the full liberty of the human will, and againſt every idea of poſitive influence from God to reſtrain men from good, or to impel them to evil, than Edwards was. And I know that from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thoughts I abhor and deteſt every thing of that nature, and challenge all the ſons of men to prove the contrary if they can. Whether ſaid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will like the following deſcription of liberty is uncertain. In a Boſton paper of June 21, 1784, we are informed, that a new book of Dr. Chauncy's is now in the preſs, which gives a view of man, "As an <hi>intelligent moral agent;</hi> having within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> to WILL, as well as to <hi>do,</hi> in oppoſition to NECESSITY from any extraneous cauſe whatever."</p>
               <p n="2">II. THIS perfectly agrees with that diſregard to God, and to equal liberty among the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which has lately been ſo conſpicuous in that metropolis. Perhaps a text could not be found more ſuitable to have preached upon, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of our new conſtitution, than the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:018336_0373_0FA5CF515CB37538"/>"Their children alſo ſhall be as aforetime, and <hi>their congregation ſhall be eſtabliſhed before me,</hi> and I will puniſh all that oppreſs them. <hi>And their nobles ſhall be of themſelves, and their Governor ſhall proceed from the midſt of them,</hi> and I will cauſe him to draw near, and he ſhall approach unto me; for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? ſaith the Lord." Jer. xxx. 20, 21. But a noted miniſter of Boſton took out the words here printed in <hi>Italic,</hi> and not the reſt, for the ſubject of his ſermon at that time; in which he told of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being pleaded on both ſides of the queſtion about religious liberty. And the two ſides are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly theſe. The Baptiſts pleaded that Chriſt's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might be ſupported only by his laws and influence: Their opponents pleaded ſtill to be called by his name, but that they could not in conſcience give up the uſe of ſecular force to ſupport them. The Baptiſts never aſked for any greater liberty in this reſpect in the country than Boſton has long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed: Their opponents plead conſcience for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to them, which doubtleſs is ſuppoſing that <hi>gain is godlineſs,</hi> and from ſuch we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to withdraw. The miniſter of Chelſea, who in 1778 defied our Legiſlature to preſerve order in the State, if they allowed equal liberty in the church, was received a member of that Aſſembly in 1783, to tax others, while he pays none himſelf. But who can wonder at their treating the people thus, ſince their treatment of their Maker is ſo flagrant! Claim his promiſes without regarding his precepts, which is the practice the <hi>tempter</hi> would have drawn our Saviour into, Mat. iv. 6, 7. But greater abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and blaſphemy can ſcarcely be conceived of, than to claim God's promiſes to ſupport us in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his precepts, and to deny his right to
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:018336_0374_0FA5CF5183C64F00"/>govern our wills, further than we pleaſe. His au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and commands are certainly a cauſe <hi>without us;</hi> but we have already ſeen that the above writer thought them <hi>too ſevere</hi> even for Adam in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and that <hi>grace</hi> gives an exemption from that ſeverity. (Page 229, 230.) But I have ſeen a record concerning one, who was as zealous for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the fleſh</hi> as theſe late diſputants are, and had as fair a claim to it as any of them, who at length was made to know that ſaid law was <hi>haly, juſt, and good;</hi> that it was <hi>ſcriptural,</hi> but he a <hi>carnal ſlave to ſin,</hi> inſtead of having ſuch high dignity and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as he before imagined he had.' And NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITY brought him moſt <hi>freely</hi> to preach the faith that he before endeavoured to deſtroy, 1 Cor. ix. 16. Gal. i. 16, 23. And any perſon in the world can as ſoon ceaſe to exiſt, as ceaſe to deſire happineſs, and to eſcape miſery. A falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>good</hi> in the forbidden fruit, drew our firſt parents into rebellion againſt God; and ſuch ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations are the only ſource of ſin in all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, James i. 14, 15. <hi>Good</hi> is ſtill their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, but the have loſt the knowledge of who can give it, or what it is; but the regenerate ſoul knows both, and this is the preciſe difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, Pſalm iv. 6, 7. Who does not know that debtors and criminals are not fit judges in their own cauſes? yet that is the caſe with all reaſoners againſt the truth and perfection of God's written word. How would wrong judgment proceed in civil Courts, if the Judges or jurors were allowed to conſtrue laws according to a rule <hi>within them,</hi> inſtead of a fixed known ſtandard! If we believe the word of truth, a moſt obſtinate tyrant, a moſt hardened wretch, yet <hi>gladly</hi> ſent Iſrael away with rich treaſures, the ſame night which God had told
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:018336_0375_0FA5CF521B6A91E8"/>Abraham of four hundred and thirty years before. Exod. xii. 33, 40, Pſalm cv. 37, 38. Which turn of his will and choice was by a cauſe <hi>without him,</hi> which brought him to act voluntarily and exactly according to a previous immutable decree, and that without giving any renewing grace to his ſoul. But as ſoon as death was out of view, he eagerly purſued Iſrael into the Red Sea, where he and his army periſhed. And none but infidels will pretend to deny the juſtice of God in that deſtruction, although it was he that exactly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all the circumſtances which moved Pharoah voluntarily to act as he did. And the goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to this inſtance, to ſhew how, by <hi>much long-ſuffering, veſſels of wrath are fitted to deſtruction,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſovereign <hi>will of God.</hi> Rom. ix. 17, 18, 22. And thoſe who will not believe him here, will in vain cry for mercy hereafter. Thoſe who are effectually <hi>drawn</hi> to Chriſt by <hi>divine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> know that they <hi>could not</hi> have come without it, nor avoid coming moſt freely with it. John vi. 44, 45. And to hear many <hi>ſpeaking evil of things which they know not; but what they know naturally as brute beaſts, and in thoſe things to corrupt themſelves:</hi> To ſee them <hi>tread down the good paſtures, and foul the deep waters,</hi> and <hi>thruſt others with ſide and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſerves to confirm believers in the truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and in the hope of a ſpeedy deliverance from ſuch <hi>evil beaſts,</hi> Jude x. Ezek. xxxiv. 18—25. As the wages of ſin is death, God cannot be juſt in paying the ſame to infants, but upon his right to conſtitute Adam as their head to act for them, and dealing with them as ſinners in him; for juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice cannot pay wages where they are not due. And as Chriſt came into the world purely to ſave ſinners, infants could have no part in his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:018336_0376_0FA5CF52DC76FCC0"/>if they were not ſinners. That infants may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that ſalvation, even in their mothers womb, is certain, Luke i. 44. And it is as certain, that though the firſt Adam was a figure of the ſecond in ſome things, yet that he was not ſo in others; and in none more plainly than theſe three, viz. the one brought death, the other life; the one by a judicial ſentence of law, the other by a free gift of grace; the one by a ſingle offence ruined the world, the other atoned for <hi>many offences,</hi> and will finally bring forth a much more glorious world than that which Adam deſtroyed. I conceive that theſe ideas, both of the reſemblance and the difference betwixt the two public heads of mankind, are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in the fifth of the Romans, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the firſt to the Corinthians. Yet how many are there who will have it, that Chriſt died equally for all the human race, and yet that he ſaves but a part of them, becauſe their wills defeat his good deſires and intentions? To theſe others have ſucceeded, who aſſert that he died for every one of them, and will finally bring them all to happineſs, though not until many of them have been in hell-flames for thouſands of years, to burn up their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. But I boldly declare I would as ſoon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Pagan god of flies, as any imaginary ſaviour that could poſſibly be miſtaken or diſappointed in any of his deſigns. I fully believe that God's plan of government was and is infinitely perfect. That it is calculated ſo in infinite wiſdom, that all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſhall demonſtrate to all intelligent creatures, that all deſirable good is to be enjoyed in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his revealed will, and nowhere elſe; but that diſobedience thereto is infinitely hateful and dreadful, how pleaſing ſoever it may appear at firſt. That he gives ſinners opportunity to try their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:018336_0377_0FA5CF53ECF16EA0"/>to the utmoſt extent of them, moſt plainly warning them of their danger in the mean time; and that examples of their defeat, and of juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, inflicted upon the impenitent, will be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the bleſſed, and cauſe high praiſes to him <hi>forever and ever;</hi> which words are equally made uſe of to deſcribe the continuance of his glories, the happineſs of the ſaints, and the miſery of the wicked, Rev. v. 13, xiv. 9—11, xix. 3, xx. 10, xxii. 5. And as it was the old ſerpent that poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our firſt parents, by ſetting up reaſon againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, eſpecially in calling in queſtion the truth of the penalty of the law, ſo the ſame poiſon is exceeding viſible and pernicious among their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at this day.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is moſt certain that the reformation in the church of England, which took place in the days of Edward the ſixth, was produced by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrines of original ſin, juſtification by faith in Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſs, and his ſovereign and efficacious grace upon the ſouls of men, to their eternal ſalvation. And it is as certain that a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from theſe doctrines has been growing upon that church ever ſince. Taylor againſt original ſin, though he was a diſſenter, yet was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eaſt part of Connecticut by an itinerant miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary of the church of England above forty years ago; and it has had an extenſive circulation through this country. Many of other denominations were pleaſed with it, while they tried hard to perſuade the world that Whitefield was a diſhoneſt man, and upon evil deſigns againſt this country, when he preached the goſpel according to the doctrines eſtabliſhed by law, both in Old-England and New. (Page 171.) Ten years after, a profeſſor of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard college tried to fix that odium upon his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:018336_0378_0FA5CF54745B4648"/>in the minds of his pupils; and at the ſame time denied the liberty of goſpel miniſters to preach in any pariſh where another was ſettled, without his licence<note n="*" place="bottom">Wiggleſworth's lectures concerning miniſters power, 1754, p. 14—16;</note> And if facts are fairly examined, will it not be found, that thoſe in our day, who have been moſt fierce for taxing others where they are not repreſented, yet are not willing to own that their Maker had a right to conſtitute Adam as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative? In 1628 a charter was granted to the Maſſachuſetts from the Britiſh Court, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted this Colony from all taxes thereto, but only the fifth part of the gold and ſilver ore that ſhould be found in it; and it gave the Colony the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right to chooſe their own Governors. But in 1684 theſe privileges were wreſted from them, and their lands were all claimed by the crown, and great tyranny was here exerciſed for ſome years, until the King was driven from his throne, and another was placed thereon by compact. He gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s a new charter of many privileges, but reſerved a power to tax our trade, and an arbitrary power in the crown to appoint our Governors, and to demand our property for their ſupport. And as thoſe who <hi>turn every one to his own way can never have enough,</hi> the remainder of our charter privileges were taken away in 1774, and fleets and armies were ſent to compel this country into an unlimited ſubmiſſion to the <hi>wills</hi> of the Britiſh Parliament. And after many terrible frowns of providence upon their unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proceedings, a ſpeech from the Britiſh throne of November 2, 1780, ſaid, "The preſent arduous ſituation of public affairs is well known; the whole force and faculties of the monarchies of France and Spain are drawn forth, and exerted to the utmoſt,
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:018336_0379_0FA5CF57B682F0D8"/>to ſupport the rebellion of my Colonies in North-America, and, without the leaſt provocation or cauſe of complaint, to attack my dominions; and the undiſguiſed object of this confederacy manifeſtly is to gratify BOUNDLESS AMBITION, by deſtroying the commerce, and giving a fatal blow to the POWER of Great-Britain. By the force which the late Palia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put into my hands, and by the bleſſing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence on the bravery of my fleets and armies, I have been enabled to withſtand the formidable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of my enemies, and to fruſtrate the great expectations they had formed; and the ſignal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which have attended the progreſs of my arms in the Provinces of Georgia and Carolina, gained with ſo much honor to the conduct and courage of my officers, and to the valour and intrepidity of my troops, which have equalled their higheſt character in any age, will I truſt have important conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in bringing the war to a happy concluſion. It is my moſt earneſt deſire to ſee this great end ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; but I am confident you will agree with me in opinion, that we can only ſecure ſafe and honorable terms of peace by ſuch powerful and reſpectable preparations, as ſhall convince our enemies, that WE WILL NOT SUBMIT TO RECEIVE THE LAW FROM ANY POWER WHATSOEVER." Lord Cornwallis was one of his moſt ſucceſsful officers in Carolina, who there gave orders, on Auguſt. 30, 1780, "That every militia man, who had borne arms with us, and afterwards joined the enemy, ſhall be immediately hanged." Yet on December 30 General Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the King for reſtoring peace to the Colonies, gave out a declaration from New-York, "That Great-Britain had manifeſted the ſincerity of her affectionate and conciliatory intentions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

And <hi>this</hi> declaration arrived and was publiſhed in Boſton juſt before the King's ſpeech, which expreſſed a reſolution not to receive law from any power whatſoever, not even excepting the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of heaven.

               <p n="4">IV. FOR ſix months after the war began the general welfare of the country was kept ſo much in view, that men enough were eaſily obtained to fill up our army, which was alſo plentifully ſupplied with proviſions. But a committee from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward met at the camp in or near Cambridge, in October, 1775, to ſettle the affairs of the next cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, who raiſed the wages of officers, and lowered thoſe of the private ſoldiers, which directly cauſed an uneaſineſs; and a looking to private intereſt, both in and out of the army, gradually prevailed from that time, until in the fall of 1780 it procured a promiſe of half-pay to officers during life. And juſt before the news of peace arrived, this ſelfiſhneſs aroſe ſo high in the officers, as to appoint a public meeting in the camp at Weſt-Point in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March, 1783 (without leave from General Waſhington, who was there) to conſult about either marching in arms to Philadelphia, and compelling
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:018336_0381_0FA5CF5A8312D998"/>the Congreſs to grant their deſires, or elſe drawing off into the wilderneſs, and leaving the country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs to the ravages of the enemy. And though, with a wiſe and maſterly addreſs, General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton prevented their taking either of thoſe horrid ſteps, yet none can tell how much influence theſe contrivances had, to produce a vote in Congreſs for five years whole-pay, in lieu of the half-pay dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. And though the war was leveiled againſt hereditary claims of power over others, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure equity among all the inhabitants, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of union and confederation between theſe States expreſly forbid their granting any titles of nobility, yet in May following thoſe officers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to incorporate a ſociety among themſelves, to have an hereditary ſucceſſion, and each a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en medal and blue ribbon, with a large fund of money at command, and power to elect our chief rulers into their ſociety.

               <p n="5">V. THE above proceedings have cauſed unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difficulties through theſe States, which have been loudly complained of by multitudes, who ſtill are bewitched with the opinion, that they are born in a like covenant as the ſeed of Abraham were, which gave them a right to make ſervants of others who were not in that covenant. Yea, and alſo with the opinion that civil Legiſlatures have a right to empower ſome men to covenant for others with religious teachers, and to compel them to fulfil it. And this practice (which is directly againſt the law of God even as it was given to the Jews) was at the commencement of our new conſtitution called GOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINESS, in capitals, while <hi>honeſty</hi> was put in ſmall letters. Which things are not mentioned becauſe
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:018336_0382_0FA5CF5B1EB22B68"/>I think myſelf better by nature than others, for I know the contrary. And after renewing grace was granted, I was ſuch a dull ſcholar in Chriſt's ſchool, that I was thirty-two years in learning a leſſon of only ſix words, viz. <hi>one Lord, one faith, and one baptiſm.</hi> It took ten years to get clear of the cuſtom of putting baptiſm before faith, and near five more to learn not to contradict the ſame in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; after which above ſeventeen trying years roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over us, before we could refrain from an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit acknowledgment of more than one Lord in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affairs. And what noiſe has been made in the world ſince, only becauſe we will not give up this leſſon, and obey man rather than God! And the chief movers therein, undoubtedly, are men who deny his right to impute Adam's ſin to them, or to damn them for not receiving Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſs for their juſtification. Neither can any own theſe doctrines, and be ſelf-conſiſtent, in holding that natural birth or human doings can bring infants into the covenant of grace. If it be of grace, then it cannot be of the birth or works of nature. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> ſays our bleſſed Lord. Circumciſion was a type of his death, and of our being cut off from confidence in the fleſh, and ingrafted into him by regeneration. Before his perſonal coming this ſign was, by divine inſtitution, put upon many who had not the thing ſignified within them; but as Abraham had it, it was a <hi>ſeal</hi> to him, while it was only a ſign or type to many others, Rom. iv. 11, Col. ii. 11, 12. By the covenant with Abraham, none were to be circumciſed but ſuch as were born in his houſe, or bought with his money; in which capacity he was an eminent type of Chriſt, whoſe church is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of perſons purchaſed with his blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:018336_0383_0FA5CF5BE1D66E08"/>by his ſpirit. Aaron was alſo a noted type of him, and his lawful ſeed a type of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſouls, who are the <hi>ſpiritual houſe</hi> which is built upon the foundation that is <hi>diſallowed of men.</hi> And in vain do any of them try to prove the covenant to be the ſame now that it was with Abraham, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they can prove that Chriſt is hereafter to come, and endure another crucifixion. <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> which means the myſtery of confuſion, was erected by <hi>confounding</hi> type and anti-tpye, church and ſtate, together. For a woman after marriage to refuſe to be governed by her huſband, and to ſay, <hi>I will go after my lovers, that gave me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink,</hi> proves her to be a <hi>harlot.</hi> And by this practice the church of Rome became the <hi>mother of harlots, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth. Kings have committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her; and by her ſorceries were all nations deceived.</hi> How much have Proteſtants been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with theſe abominations! To ſet up any mere man as head of the church, is an imitation of thoſe who crucified our bleſſed Lord, by holding to an <hi>earthly kingdom of the Meſſiah.</hi> The taking away of the property of the people <hi>by force,</hi> for the prieſts in the church of Iſrael, brought amazing vengeance upon thoſe who gave countenance to that practice; yet the like iniquity has been tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly held faſt, by men who call themſelves mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the goſpel; and <hi>forcing</hi> away the property of the Baptiſt for ſuch, has been done in various part of this country, even down into this year 1784. and much clamour is made againſt them, only for refuſing to give any countenance to ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the call from heaven to all the ſaints is, <hi>come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; for her
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:018336_0384_0FA5CF5CACC866B8"/>ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities,</hi> Rev. xvii. 5, xviii. 3, 4, 5, 23.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. LATE reaſonings have ſet the creature man ſo high, as to deny that a cauſe without him can determine his choice; while they hold that God's choice muſt be determined by what he ſees in the creature, and not in himſelf. But the only ſeed that can produce the new birth gives ſuch a turn to the mind, as to view all fleſh but as fading graſs, and the inhabitants of the world but as graſshoppers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Yea, as a drop of the bucket, and ſmall duſt of the balance. And to ſet the contraſt in its full light, it is declared that <hi>all nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi> This is the <hi>incorruptible ſeed,</hi> of which ſouls are <hi>born again,</hi> Iſai. xl. 6—17, 1 Pet. i. 23, 24. In our natural darkneſs we imagine that our obligation to ſerve God and to come to Chriſt depends upon our will and pleaſure; and that when we get ready to ſet about the work in earneſt, his goodneſs and mercy will neceſſarily bring him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for our help, and to pardon and ſave us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth it is as much impoſſible for any ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſon ever to be exempt, for one moment, from obligation to love God with all his powers, and to love his neighbours as himſelf, as it is for him to eſcape out of God's preſence, or to put an end to his own exiſtence. When Chriſt came and laid down his life for us, he gave the fulleſt demonſtration of the truth and love of God (as it was previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in predictions and figures) and greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced our obligation to love and obey him; and alſo clearly opened the way for our doing it, in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter. The oldneſs of the letter lays every ſin and defect as a bar in the way of approach to a holy God; but
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:018336_0385_0FA5CF5E259CA1B0"/>the newneſs of the ſpirit, while it cuts us off from any confidence in the fleſh, makes all our ſins and wants powerful arguments for our daily coming to the throne of grace for ſupplies. Though Adam in innocency could have no idea of a mediator, or of pardon and cleanſing from ſin; yet his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the God of truth made it his indiſpenſable duty to believe and obey him, in all his revealed will, and highly criminal to call the ſame in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And unbelief ſtill remains unſpeakably cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in his poſterity; for their natural powers of thinking and choice are not loſt. Therefore the more unable we are to love God with all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to believe and obey his revealed will, the more guilty and inexcuſable; becauſe we love the creature inſtead of the Creator, and regard lying vanities in oppoſition to eternal truth, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by every event that ever happened. Good men and bad, angels and devils, all act according to the characters given of them in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. No ſoil can bear good wheat until the roots naturally in it are broken up, and the wheat ſown therein; ſo the new birth cannot be wrought in any but by divine revelation. It is not a creation of new faculties, but the giving new ideas and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which were our indiſpenſable duty before, but our evil hearts were contrary thereto. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the thorns and briers in a field, is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things which ought not to be there; and the good ſeed being ſown, and an union formed between the ſeed and the ſoil, the birth, the growth is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. By ſuch means as theſe great relief was granted to our country, when its ruin ſeemed inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. For at the cloſe of 1779 public credit was ſunk ſo low, that forty paper dollars would not buy more of the produce of our own country, than one
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:018336_0386_0FA5CF5EDC9C3FD0"/>would in 1775; and from thence to the end of the war very few ſoldiers were raiſed in New-England, but upon private perſonal ſecurities; and large quantities both of cloathing and proviſions, that were raiſed for them, never reached to their camps, by reaſon of the unfaithfulneſs and treachery in thoſe who ſhould have conveyed the ſame to them. But in the year 1779 a freſh revival of religion was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which increaſed in the year 1780, and ſpread the moſt extenſively and powerfully through New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that any revival had done for near forty years. Beſides conſiderable additions that were made to ſome of the Congregational churches, it greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Baptiſt churches that were formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and raiſed about twenty new ones. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt accounts yet obtained, there were not leſs than two thouſand perſons baptized upon a profeſſion of ſaving faith in New-England, only in the year 1780; and chiefly in the States of New Hampſhire and the Maſſachuſetts. And though true religion is directly, oppoſite to wars and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among men, yet it teacheth an inviolable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth and equity; and no ſmall part of the duty of love is a defence of the innocent, when their rights are invaded, and their lives are in danger. The goſpel ſhews that the only lawful uſe of the ſword, is to puniſh ſuch as <hi>work ill to their neighbour;</hi> and ſubjection to the powers that do it is a matter of <hi>conſcience</hi> with believers, Rom. xiii. 1—10. And this revival of religion was undoubtedly a great means of ſaving this land from foreign invaſion, and from ruin by internal corruption; though the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſtill ſo great, that there has been but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and leſs thankfulneſs, for the deliverance and peace which are wonderfully granted to us. The Warren Aſſociation, at their meeting, September 9,
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:018336_0387_0FA5CF604F7E3790"/>1783, gave their views of theſe times in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing addreſs to their countrymen, viz.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. "<hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"AFTER a long and very diſtreſſing war, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at this opportunity of congratulating you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the return of peace to the nations, and to our land in particular, with a proſpect of unſpeakable advantages to the preſent and future generations. Indeed we are not inſenſible that many are ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and complaining, inſtead of rejoicing at theſe times; ſeveral cauſes whereof are obvious. For ever ſince our firſt parents revolted from heaven, in order to pleaſe their eyes and their taſte, their children have been chiefly influenced by carnal ſenſe, inſtead of reaſon and truth. And the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of taxes, the great ſcarcity of caſh, with the preſſing calls for money from every quarter, have drawn a terrible gloom over many minds; which is greatly increaſed by a view of the untried ſcene of political exiſtence into which we have entered, where none can tell what is before us; and we have no ſuch arm of fleſh to truſt to as formerly. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to which are a great variety of diſappointments and loſſes, with the uſe of corrupt ſchemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair them, and to get more power and gain, among all orders of men in the land, which make a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber think our caſe almoſt deſperate. But the goſpel gives light, and opens the moſt glorious proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, where nature can ſee nothing but darkneſs. It aſſures us that ſufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, and forbids anxiety about to-morrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſparrow cannot fall to the ground, nor an hair from your heads, without the providence of our heavenly Father. And what confirmations of this truth have we had? Yea, and which now ſurround us? A main hope of our enemies was built upon the
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:018336_0388_0FA5CF6071661670"/>proſpect of ſtarving us into ſubmiſſion; but behold! the ſhowers and ſhines of heaven were not at their command; no, nor the hearts of the people neither. The events of this war are unparalleled.—Deceitful reaſonings from the power given to the members and rulers of the Jewiſh church, have perſuaded people for many ages, that ſome men are born with a right to govern others, and that they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the people for what they receive and do; which has been the grand ſource of oppreſſion and tyranny through the world. But how has God rent away this veil of darkneſs! The American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution is wholly built upon the doctrine, that all men are born with an equal right to what provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gives them, and that all righteous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded in compact or covenant, which is equally binding upon the officers and members of each community.—And as ſurely as Chriſtianity is true, Chriſt is the only lawgiver and head of his church; whom he will ſave from the power both of <hi>gallies</hi> and <hi>gallant ſhips,,</hi> thoſe modern engines of tyranny, Iſai. xxxiii. 16—24. And his laws deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that his miniſters ſhall neither be tyrants nor ſlaves: Shall neither be ſupported by <hi>forcing</hi> away any man's property without his perſonal conſent, nor <hi>go a warfare of their own charges,</hi> Mat. x. 7—10, Luke x. 3—12, 1 Cor. ix. 7—14. Oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes about theſe matters have long ſerved to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold each other. The terms <hi>hire</hi> and <hi>reward,</hi> on one hand, have been taken to drag this affair into ſecular courts; and the word <hi>freely,</hi> on the other, to excuſe people from doing any thing to ſupport their miniſters; as if <hi>freedom</hi> belonged only to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, while the people were <hi>ſlaves</hi> to their luſts. Whereas it is as clear as the day-light, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations between paſtors and people are mutual;
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:018336_0389_0FA5CF611A30F8A8"/>and that their union and welfare greatly depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a free and faithful diſcharge thereof, out of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme love to God; viewing themſelves to be but ſtewards of all their gifts and treaſures, who muſt ſoon give account unto him of their ſtewardſhip: Yea, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe laws naturally tend to keep his flock from being devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as feed themſelves and not the flock, as well as to exclude all members therefrom who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be governed by him; and likewiſe to guard againſt all ſinful diviſions. Corrupt men will not have ſuch advantage as they formerly had, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſimple with artful addreſſes to their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, either about the licentiouſneſs or tyranny of others. The cry of perſecution will be ſtopped, while thoſe who love the truth will endeavour to unite with ſocieties who walk moſt clearly therein, and be in earneſt to fill their places with duty and uſefulneſs; knowing that mutual eſteem and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence are moſt ſurely promoted thereby, without which ſocieties are unhappy, if not broken and diſſolved."</p>

                  </gap>ount of the late revival of religion, and of the ſtate of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches. And we may begin with the affairs of Martha's Vineyard, an iſland about twenty miles long, and ten broad, whereon are the towns of Edgarton, Tiſbury, and Chilmark. They are a county by themſelves, for holding of Inferior Courts, from whence they may appeal to Superior Courts in other counties. From Falmouth, in Barnſtable county, to the entrance of the harbour of Holmes's Hole, on ſaid iſland, is nine miles; which harbour is much frequented by thoſe who ſail upon theſe coaſts, and piloting of veſſels round
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:018336_0391_0FA5CF66553E2028"/>Cape-Cod and elſewhere is no ſmall part of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of its inhabitants. The line betwixt Edgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Tiſbury comes down upon the head of ſaid harbour, ſo that the inhabitants round it are upon the corners of two towns, ſeven or eight miles from the meeting-houſes in either of them: which I am told ſome of their children of fifteen or ſixteen years old never ſaw. For the ſoil is generally thin and barren, ſo that but very few horſes can be kept there, and the men are much employed on the ſea, or in getting ſuſtenance out of it: Yet they have been all taxed to a worſhip that they or their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies could but rarely attend, and from which they ſeemed to get no good; ſo that at length very few of them went to any public worſhip at all. It is ſaid, however, that but few intemperate perſons were found among them. The war added greatly to their calamities, as our State could not protect them, and they lay at the mercy of our enemies; who came there with a powerful force in the fall of the year 1778, and took from the iſland all their arms and ammunition, beſides three hundred head of cattle and a thouſand ſheep, and moſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the land near ſaid harbour. Dark indeed did their caſe appear; and on December 26 was ſuch a cold ſnow-ſtorm as cauſed the death of ſeventeen men in a privateer ſloop at the eaſt end of the iſland, and ſeventy-five more in a brig near Plymouth. Yet this terrible ſtorm drove into a creek, at the head of Holmes's Hole, ſuch a vaſt quantity of baſs as ſupplied the inhabitants of the whole iſland with as many of them as they were pleaſed to take, and more than they could make uſe of. And not long after a Britiſh veſſel was caſt away upon the weſt part of the aland, which gave the inhabitants a good ſupply of rice. And greater
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:018336_0392_0FA5CF67CEAB4B78"/>favours of another kind were before them. By afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive providences, and private means of grace, four perſons near Holmes's Hole were awakened to a ſenſe of their ſin and danger, and in the ſpring of 1780 they experienced a happy deliverance of ſoul. And no ſooner was light granted to them than they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hold the ſame forth to others, which brought them to ſet up religious meetings, and a number were hopefully converted by theſe means. And about the laſt of June they ſent for Elder Lewis, of Freetown, who went over in July, and preached and baptized a number of them. He did the like again in Auguſt and October, as Elder Hunt alſo did in November; and, by particular requeſt, I met them there in December, when a careful enquiry was made into their ſentiments and views, and the order of the goſpel, with the ſolemn nature of the Chriſtian profeſſion, was publicly laid open and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated. After which, on December 21, 1780, we ſaw fifty perſons ſolemnly ſign covenant together, to whom ſix more were added on the 24th, and all then ſweetly communed together at the Lord's table. The high ſheriff of the county was a leading mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this church, which contained ſome perſons of every rank among them. The huſband of one of them was born among the Portugueſe, and was now newly returned from a diſtreſſing captivity in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. By ſeeing and hearing of theſe wonders of divine grace, his vows in trouble were brought with authority upon his mind; and though the tempter ſet in violently with his ſuggeſtions, that there was no mercy for him, and that he had better go and drown himſelf, in the evening after this communion, yet ſovereign grace prevented it, and ſet his ſoul at liberty, ſo that he was ſoon after baptized and joined to that church, as a conſiderable number
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:018336_0393_0FA5CF6846AD0F88"/>more alſo did. I have received no late accounts of the Indian Baptiſt church on that iſland. (Vol. 1, p. 439.)</p>
               <p n="2">II. OUR next view is of the county of Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. The Separate miniſter at Harwich, named in p. 175, has removed to Tamworth, in New-Hampſhire, and the other of Barnſtable is now a paſtor of a Congregational church at Newmarket, in that State; and Baptiſt churches are raiſed out of each of thoſe Separate ſocieties. A Baptiſt church was formed and organized at Harwich in 1757; but by advice of a Council, their miniſter was depoſed from his office in 1777, for immoral conduct, and they are now deſtitute of a paſtor, though they have an agreeable teacher with them. They have ſome members from Wellfleet, where our miniſters have frequently preached to attentive audiences. A ſmall pariſh in the ſouth part of Harwich got a Baptiſt miniſter, from the weſt part of our country, to preach in their pariſh meeting-houſe; and in 1781 they formed a Baptiſt church there, and he was ordained their miniſter: but he is upon the Arminian plan, and not in fellowſhip with our churches. The Baptiſt church in Barn ſtable was conſtituted June 20, 1771; but they were very ſmall for ſeven years, and then a revival was granted, and another in 1781; and things at preſent appear encouraging among them, though they have not been able as yet to get a ſettled paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. There is the beginning of a Baptiſt ſociety in Sandwich, in that county; but we may truly ſay of our times, the harveſt is great, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers are few.</p>
               <p n="3">III. THE riſe of the firſt Baptiſt churh in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough has been deſcribed (p. 215); but coldneſs and ſtupidity had greatly prevailed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:018336_0394_0FA5CF68A05D9948"/>for five years before the late revival of religion, which began in the latter part of 1778, and was at its height in July, 1780. The firſt perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the church in this revival was on Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 28, 1779, and eighty-five have been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince, above two-thirds of whom belong to Bridgwater, in the weſt part of which town a large Baptiſt meeting-houſe was built laſt year, eight miles from ours, and they have now got a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to preach to them, though as yet they remain a branch of our church. The riſe of the ſecond Baptiſt church in Middleborough was as follows: Mr. Thomas Nelſon, who was born in the town June 6, 1676, juſt before Philip's war broke out, removed into that part of it called Aſawamſet, in 1717; about which time he joined to the firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Swanzey, as his wife alſo di Auguſt 5, 1723. In 1753 he and his ſons, with a few more, ſet up a meeting at his houſe, and obtained Mr. Ebenezer Hinds to preach to them. Four miles ſouthweſtward from thence Mr. James Mead was ordained paſtor of a Separate church in 1751; but he died in 1756, after which the body of his church became Baptiſts, and Mr. Hinds's hearers joined with them, and ordained him their paſtor, January 26, 1756, in which office he ſtill continues. Mr. Nelſon died before this church was formed, in his eightieth year; but his wife, Mrs. Hope Nelſon, lived to be a member of it, and communed with them at the Lord's table after ſhe was an hundred years old. She died December 7, 1782, aged an hundred and five years and ſeven months. Her living poſterity, beſides all that had deceaſed, were two hundred and fifty-ſeven in the year 1774. But as ſome of them are removed to Nova-Scotia, and to other diſtant places, their number when ſhe died
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:018336_0395_0FA5CF6982373AF0"/>has not ſince been obtained. Many of them are members of Baptiſt churches, and three of them are public teachers therein. Mr. Ebenezer Jones was ordained the paſtor of the third Baptiſt church in Middleborough October 28, 1761; but whiſperers, who ſeparate very friends, cauſed ſuch a diviſion there two years after, as not only removed him from being their paſtor, but alſo broke up their meeting for a time. He has been preaching for ſome years paſt at Steventown, in the county of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany. Mr. Hunt was ordained the paſtor of ſaid church October 30, 1771; in which year they had a conſiderable revival, and another much greater in 1780. Their letter to the Warren Aſſociation, in September that year, gives the following account of it. Say they, "In our letters for ſeveral years paſt, we had to lament the ſad decay of religion among us, and the abounding of iniquity, which in the laſt year increaſed to the greateſt degree ever known in this place. Men were bold in wicked ways, and all the endeavours of a few faithful ones among us could not prevent it. But bleſſed be God, things have taken another turn this year; for when ſin, the great enemy of mankind, was <hi>coming in like a flood, the ſpirit of the Lord has lifted up a ſtandard againſt him.</hi> About the middle of March, on a Lord's day in the afternoon, there appeared a very viſible alteration in the face of the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; they were all attention to the word, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern was diſcovered in their countenances, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo that by the beginning of April ſeveral ſcores of perſons appeared under deep concern about their ſouls and eternal ſalvation. And ſince the work began we have reaſon to hope that about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſouls have been turned from darkneſs to light, and eighty-three have been baptized.—It is very
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:018336_0396_0FA5CF6A2545CB38"/>remarkable in our view, to ſee ſo many ſuddenly turned from darkneſs to light, and have ſuch a clear underſtanding of the nature of religion, and ſo ready to practiſe what they know.—We have been remarkably free from diſorders, by means of which thoſe who appeared to oppoſe this work (who are chiefly of another denomination) and were waiting to ſee how things turned out, have ſeen ſuch things as have greatly ſtilled and convinced them. Thus has it pleaſed our gracious God to viſit a moſt unworthy people, and after a dark night of ſorrow and mourning, to make us glad with his ſalvation." From the beginning of the revival to September, 1781, more than an hundred perſons were added to that church, above half of whom were males.</p>
               <p n="9">IV. A BRANCH of this church is at Marſhfield, where a ſteady ſociety for worſhip has been kept up for ſome years; and in the late revival a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons were hopefully converted in Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, on the north borders of our county; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent religious meetings were held there. This cauſed a great uneaſineſs in the adjacent town of Hingham, where their miniſters had long taught the world to tyrannize over the church (p. 159). And as an exhorter from Rhode-Iſland govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had attended ſeveral meetings in Scituate, the people of Hingham could not be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing their particular reſentment againſt him. Therefore one of them followed ſaid exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into Abington, as he was upon his return home, and importuned him to go and hold a meeting at his hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of people met there for religious worſhip in the evening of May 28, 1782. But juſt as they were going to begin their exerciſe, a large mob
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:018336_0397_0FA5CF6B24A3C6A8"/>came up, whoſe leader was a communicant in one of the churches in Hingham, and, by leave of the man who had invited ſaid exhorter to his houſe, they went in and ſeized him, and carried him away with the bible in his hand; but upon his telling them that it was the beſt law he ever heard of, they knocked it out of his hand, and ſtamped it under foot, with oaths and execrations too horrid to be repeated! And they bruiſed and injured his body, as well as tore his cloaths; and forcibly carried him and two other baptized brethren out of Hing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and afterwards threatened the liſe of ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horter, if he ever came there again. By good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, a complaint was exhibited to the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that county againſt the chief of thoſe rioters, and a bill was found againſt five of them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by eight witneſſes; and four of the rioters were arraigned before the Court at Boſton, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 10, and pleaded not guilty; upon which their trial was appointed to be on January 14, 1783; and they were laid under bonds then to appear; and the Court bound the witneſſes alſo to appear at that time, four of whom were men, and the others women. The ſeaſon proved to be exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, by reaſon of ſnow, ice and a ſevere air, yet the four male witneſſes appeared at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of the rioters, neither was any forfeiture of their bonds exacted; but their trial was put off for two days, and all the witneſſes were required then to appear. A ſleigh was therefore procured to carry two of the female witneſſes; but as they called at a friend's houſe in Hingham in the evening, to refreſh themſelves, it was conveyed away and cut to pieces, and they could not find their horſe till next day. Yet all the eight witneſſes appeared in Boſton at the time laſt appointed; but
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:018336_0398_0FA5CF6BF061C5D0"/>then the lawyers prevailed to have the trial put off until April; one of whom was the man that pleaded conſcience for ſupporting worſhip by tax, in our conference at Philadelphia, mentroned p. 303. But the world may now ſee what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſuch men have. In the ſpring thoſe rioters found that they could no longer put the caſe off, and then they were in earneſt to ſettle it without a public hearing, which was finally done, by their engaging to pay all coſts. But let the politicians of Boſton remember, that it is but a few years ſince they declared to the world, that a delay of juſtice is a denial of juſtice, and therefore that wherein they judged others they are ſelf-condemned. And they appear more openly ſo from the following inſtance. The burthen of civil taxes being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavy, and a pair of oxen being expoſed to ſale therefor in Taunton, oppoſition was made againſt the ſale; until a gentleman offered a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous price for them, and then the matter was ſettled. Yet to deter perſons from any ſuch thing for the future, two men of Taunton were ſeized in the night, and carried off to Boſton by armed men, the Auguſt after ſaid riot at Hingham. What right they had thus to bring men out of another county, belongs not to me to determine; but if an <hi>impartial</hi> regard to the public peace, as well as to the rights of Chriſtianity, had prevailed in the breaſts of ſome men in Boſton, could thoſe rioters in their own county have poſſibly been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged as they were, and thoſe ſufferers have been ſo cruelly treated!</p>
               <p n="5">V. OFFICERS in the church as well as ſtate often do much miſchief if unfaithful, and much good if faithful in their ſeveral ſtations. Our churches in Swanzey and Rehoboth have had large experience of
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:018336_0399_0FA7AF301D9B8F30"/>this. The bleſſings which the firſt church of Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey enjoyed under the ſucceſſive miniſtrations of their elders, Miles, Luther and Wheaton, are touch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed upon (vol. 1, p. 353, 506, vol. 2, p. 68, 121, 124). Mr. Samuel Maxwell was ordained a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with the laſt of them the year before his death. Mr. Maxwell lived to a great age, and was eſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>med a pious man; but he was ſo unſteady in his principles and conduct, as to cauſe much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs in the churches. On this account he was, by his own requeſt, diſmiſſed from Swanzey in 1739, and though he took the charge of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Rehoboth ſix years after, yet he did not continue four years with them. In 1742 ſaid church in Swanzey ſettled a gifted miniſter from Narraganſet, who had a thronged audience for a few years, yet then he was accuſed of the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, which charge he never cleared up, but went off and left the church. Their next miniſter was accuſed of taking unjuſt methods to get into that place; and he was much influenced by a few men in the church who were attached to Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; and by theſe means, the church that had two hundred members in pious Elder Wheaton's days, was reduced to a very ſmall number, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation alſo. After about thirty years he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed at his own requeſt, and removed away. And as the meeting-houſe and miniſter's houſe in Warren were burnt by the enemy, and the place was ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to their rage, they agreed at preſent to unite with Swanzey church, three miles off; and their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was called and ſettled there. And ſuch a divine bleſſing was granted, that when I was there in Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, 1781, I was informed that within two years about two hundred perſons had been added to the two churches in Swanzey. The former elders of
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:018336_0400_0FA7AF2970D84D90"/>the ſecond church in Swanzey are before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (p. 11, 13, 43.) Their next elder, Job Maſon, was ordained May 22, 1738, and was well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his office until his deceaſe, in Auguſt, 1775, aet. 80. His brother Ruſſel Maſon, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent paſtor, was ordained November 2, 1752. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral redemption had been ſo much held there, as to admit members upon a general declaration of their faith, until a powerful work among them, in the beginning of 1772, introduced particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the work of divine grace upon their ſouls; and light has greatly increaſed among them ſince. And in this late revival it has introduced ſinging in their public worſhip. The town of Rehoboth calls for our next attention. The Baptiſt church form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there under Mr. Comer's miniſtry (p. 121) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ninety-five members in leſs than two years. But in 1736 a miniſter was ordained in his ſtead, whoſe principles were unſound; and ſix years after he took a whore inſtead of his wife, and went off with her. Since which diverſity of ſentiments about doctrines, terms of communion, &amp;c. have produced many ſmall ſocieties in that town, which I ſhall not attempt particularly to deſcribe here, as a liſt of them may hereafter be given. The two Baptiſt churches in Attleborough were formed out of Separate churches there. The paſtor of the church in Norton (mentioned p. 232) after a pious and uſeful life, fell aſleep on Auguſt 23, 1768. After which the church united with a ſmall ſociety in the north borders of Taunton, where they are become a large ſociety; and their preſent paſtor was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed November 12, 1772. In the year 1780 there was a moſt precious harveſt of ſouls among them. No other Baptiſt churches in that county have had

The Colony of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts is the next before us, the head county whereof is Suffolk. The affairs of the two Baptiſt churches in Boſton, their capital, have been deſcribed (vol. 1, p. 353, &amp;c. vol. 2, p. 33, 50, 125, 149, 269, 276.) To which I ſhall add, that Mr. Condy was a gentleman of ſuperior powers and learning, and of a very reſpectable character among mankind; but the ſentiments he had imbibed about the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of ſovereign grace, impeded his public uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the miniſtry; and upon the inſtalment of their preſent paſtor, January 9, 1765, he freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his office in that church. The preſent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of their ſecond church ſucceeded Mr. Davis in 1774. The next Baptiſt church in that county is in Bellingham, which was conſtituted October 15, 1750. Their firſt paſtor was Mr. Elnathan Wight, a pious and uſeful man, who died in November, 1761. To him ſucceeded their preſent paſtor, who was inſtalled there November 12, 1766. He was firſt ordained at Stafford, June 5, 1755; but was diſmiſſed from thence by the advice of a Council, Auguſt 28, 1765, becauſe the majority of the church appeared to be ſo much out of a goſpel line of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that other churches withdrew their followſhip from them. The reſt of the Baptiſt churches in that county have had no more than one miniſter. In Eſſex, beſide the church of Haverhill, of which we have ſpoken (p. 236) Baptiſt meetings are held at Danvers, Rowley a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Mr. Eliſha Rich was the firſt paſtor of our Chelmsford church, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained there October 5, 1774, but he removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the State of Vermont near four years after. Their preſent paſtor was ordained September 24, 1783. Baptiſt meetings are ſteadily held at Framingham and Weſton, but churches are not formed there.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. IN Worceſter county, the church at Sutton, mentioned (p. 124.) was become finall when their aged paſtor died, January 4, 1775, and they are ſince diſſolved. The ſecond Baptiſt church there ſettled a miniſter in 1768, who was diſmiſſed four years after for not being found in the faith. Elder Green, of Leiceſter, after a very laborious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life, was taken to his reſt Auguſt 20, 1773, act. 73. Benjamin Foſter, A. M. educated at Yale col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, was ordained there October 23, 1776, and an evident bleſſing attended his labours for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. But differences about ſome points of practice ariſing among them, he was diſmiſſed by mutual conſent, about ſix years after, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and preaches to a new ſociety in Danvers, his native place. The firſt paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Sturbridge died in 1755, and they have gone through many trying ſcenes ſince, but have at preſent a proſpect of ſettling an agreeable paſtor ſoon. Mr. Samuel Dennis was ordained at Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in October, 1778, but he was taken from his beloved flock by death in April, 1783. The firſt paſtor of South-Brimfield church, in the county of Hampſhire (p. 124) removed from thence to Nova<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Scotia (though he came back afterward) and Mr. James Mellen was their ſecond paſtor, who is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned p. 242, 243. Their preſent paſtor was
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:018336_0403_0FA7AF319944AC78"/>ordained November 11, 1773, when the church was very ſmall and feeble, but a great bleſſing has been ſince granted there. They had but twenty-three members in the church before a revival began among them in 1779, which in their letter to our Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in September that year, was thus deſcribed, viz. "Dear brethren, we have to inform you, that by the grace of God we are at peace among ourſelves, and enjoy much of that love which paſſeth knowledge. The Lord of his mercy is come down among us, by his great and mighty power. Such ſolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we never had before; it comes like the ſhowers of rain upon the mown graſs.

The work is ſo great that we cannot conſent to our elder's meeting you in Aſſociation this year. We have this year thirty-four added by baptiſm; our whole number is fifty-ſeven." From our ſiſter church in Wilbraham, adjacent to them, they wrote at the ſame time and ſaid, "We pray God to direct you in conferring upon matters that concern the viſible kingdom of Chriſt, and do that which may be for his glory, and the laſting peace and benefit of his churches. Beloved, the love of Chriſt, that
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:018336_0404_0FA7AF326FBB7F68"/>bond of peace, ſtill unites our hearts. God of his infinite grace and goodneſs is carrying on a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work by his ſpirit. Saints are quickened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and ſinners are converted to him. It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold the change that has been in the ſpace of one year with us. The hearts of fathers are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the children, and the children to the fathers. God is to us a place of broad rivers; we deſire to exalt him, and give him all the glory.—Added to the church this year fifty-one; died none.

               <p n="8">VIII. AN elder from Berkſhire wrote Auguſt 29, 1779, and ſaid, "I ſnatch a moment to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the debt of love. I read the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines from you, and rejoice in your proſperity. May Zion's King enlarge her borders.

Elder Maſon has baptized perhaps near thirty more, and a number have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what God has done for them, that are not yet baptized. O brethren, help us to praiſe the God of love!" From Aſhfield they wrote in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1780, and ſaid, "The Lord has been pleaſed to pour out of his ſpirit abundantly in this place, to the quickening of his children, and the conviction and converſion, of many ſouls, as we in a judgment of charity, have reaſon to believe.
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:018336_0405_0FA7AF32B280F868"/>O help us to praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and his wonderful works to the children of men, and to us in particular!—We have had the addition of nine members by letters, and thirty-ſix by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; have diſmiſſed two to the church in Colerain, and excluded one. Our preſent number is nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four." And in all the churches and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that were added to the Warren Aſſociation in 1780, there was an increaſe of ſeven hundred and ninety-ſix members. Ninety were added only to the church in South-Brimfield, which formerly had paſſed through many and ſore trials. And from a miniſter in the State of New-Hampſhire, to whom I wrote, I received the following remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account, dated March 15, 1781. Says he,</p>

                  </gap> ſuch a God as I would have him to be; in hopes, that for what good there was in me, he would ſhew mercy to me. But when about twenty-ſix years of age, and my affections much ſet upon the things of the world, juſt about the time I was married, I was ſuddenly taken down with ſickneſs, and part of the time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of reaſon; and thoſe who ſaw me deſpaired of my recovery. But, glory be to God, he dealt not with me according to my deſerts, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his rich love and free grace in Jeſus Chriſt; for he enlightened my underſtanding, and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my conſcience, and ſet my ſins in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and that which I had forgotten came all to memory, with the breach of many vows and promiſes, which grieved me to the heart as I thought. O, I cried to God to forgive my ſins, and to ſhew mercy for Chriſt's ſake; for I ſaw myſelf a condemned ſinner, and told thoſe who came to diſcourſe with me about religious matters, that I ſaw myſelf to be the greateſt ſinner of all men; and had I owned all this globe, I would have given it
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:018336_0408_0FA7AF34F0C1D790"/>all for an intereſt in Chriſt. Yea, all the men upon earth could not have perſuaded me out of the opinion, that I was more willing to receive Chriſt than he was to receive me. But it pleaſed the Lord, in about a month, to raiſe me up to a conſiderable ſtate of bodily health, with a great earneſtneſs, as I thought, to ſeek and ſerve him; reading the ſcriptures often, praying in ſecret and in my family, exhorting many others to ſeek and ſerve God, and warning them againſt evil practices. Yet in all this I did not think I was born again, neither did I think I could do any thing of myſelf to forward the work of regeneration; and here I got clear of one falſe hope, and began to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; now I put great dependence in my non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and ſo went on with my reformation, thinking all the good I did that it was God who wrought it in me, and the evil came from the devil and my own corrupt nature; and this hope gave me great joy in my good performances, but great grief, guilt and repentance, for the commiſſion of any known ſin, or the omiſſion of any known duty; and ſo I went on for ten or twelve years, and after that I grew more engaged after the treaſures of the world, and then my delight in religion died away. —At length I began to think I was blind, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant both of my own miſerable eſtate, and of the remedy God had provided. I prayed that God would enlighten my underſtanding; but ſtill I grew more blind, ignorant and wicked, as I thought, but kept it to myſelf, till at laſt I got hedged up ſo that I could neither read nor pray, which laſted but a ſhort time. This was a ſabbath morning, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 30, 1781.—Now I began to ſee the baſe views I formerly had of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the plan of ſalvation; for when I had a diſcovery of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:018336_0409_0FA7AF35B2B7B038"/>ſins, and the danger I was expoſed to thereby, I would repent and reform, and think what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saviour Chriſt was, and that ſome time or other he would ſave me from hell, and take me to glory, with a deſire to be happy, but no deſire to be holy. But, glory be to God, he now gave me another view of ſalvation; now I ſaw his law to be holy, and loved it, though I and all my conduct was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by it. Now I ſaw that God's juſtice did not ſtrike againſt me as his creature, but as a ſinner, and that Chriſt died not only to ſave from puniſhment, but from ſin itſelf. I ſaw that Chriſt's office was not only to make men happy, but to make them holy, and the plan now looked beautiful to me; I had no deſire to have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then it was aſked me, could I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any thing more? And at firſt I ſaw no want, till I found a want of love and gratitude in me to return thanks to God for this great deliverance, which I began to cry and plead for; and thoſe words were ſpoke to me, <hi>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend;</hi> which came with ſuch light, life, love and power, that I knew it to be the voice of my bleſſed Jeſus, who by his holy ſpirit ſet that glorious ſeal to my ſoul that God is true; and now, by his grace, I could ſpeak forth redeeming love and free grace without dread or fear. At this time there was no work or moving of religion among us, or round about us."

               <p n="1">I. WHEN we turn our eyes weſtward, and take a view of the firſt Baptiſt church in America, the folly of man and the goodneſs of God appear very conſpicuous therein. The learned Mr. Callender, in his century ſermon, expreſſed ſome ſcruple whether Mr. Roger Williams, the founder of that town and Colony, was ever a member of that church, or not. But he was convinced of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take afterwards. Governor Winthrop, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:018336_0411_0FA7AF3AF60957F0"/>and upright writer of any gentleman at Boſton in that day, whoſe writings have come down to us, dates the beginning of the Baptiſt church in Providence in March, 1639, and ſays it began by Ezekiel Holiman's baptizing Mr. Williams, and then he baptizing the reſt. But that in July after, the opinion mentioned (p. 95) put a ſtop to his further travel with them. And Richard Scott, who was one of them, ſays two or three of the church withdrew with Williams. (Vol 1, p. 106—108.) Thomas Olney was their next miniſter. But the diverſity of ſentiments mentioned in this volume (p. 94—96) brought ſuch darkneſs over their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that no regular records before 1770 are now found therein. Their ancient fathers, Olney, Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Wickenden, Tillinghaſt and others, could write well, as their civil records and ſome private papers witneſs; and I cannot but hope that more diſtinct accounts of their religious affairs will hereafter be diſcovered. Elder Tillinghaſt, whoſe memory is precious (p. 110, 114) pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nly told his people their duty to future miniſters; but himſelf was ſo far from being chargeable to them, that he gave the lot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their firſt meeting-houſe was built, and died in a good old age, in 1718, and his poſterity are now numerous and reſpectable. Mr. Ebenezer Jencks, brother to the Governor, was a paſtor of that church from 1719, to his deceaſe in 1726, colleague with Elder James Brown (p. 116.) And their two families have, in late years, done the moſt of any families upon earth for the promotion of learning, and the Baptiſt cauſe in Providence. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Winſor, there mentioned, continued in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice until his death in 1758, aet. 81. Elder Thomas Burlingham was a colleague with him, and died in 1770, aet. 82. Elder Winſor's ſon Samuel ſuceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:018336_0412_0FA7AF3C873BE9D8"/>him in the care of ſaid church in Providence, from 1759 until 1771, when he and a minor part of the church drew off, on account of differing ſentiments concerning the doctrines of grace, and ſinging in public worſhip, then introduced (which was a return to the firſt principles of the church) and he and his followers formed another church in Johnſton. One of the two churches in Smithfield (mentioned in p. 120) is diſſolved: Elder John Winſor officiates in the other, where Elder Place did; but I have not been favoured with any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct account of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">II. OF the miniſters of the firſt and ſecond churches in Newport, we have before ſpoken (p. 109, 110, 122.) The learned Mr. Callender died there January 26, 1748; and Mr. Upham's ſociety at Springfield being ſmall, he was prevailed with to remove to Newport the next year, where he miniſtered the chief of his time until 1771, when he returned to his flock at Springfield, whom he had often viſited in the mean time. And Mr. Kelly, from Philadelphia, was ordained paſtor of the firſt church in Newport, October 9, 1771; and though the war cauſed his removal from them,
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:018336_0413_0FA7AF3D2F382668"/>yet he has ſince returned to them again, Elder Wightman, of the ſecond church there, died Auguſt 31, 1750, aet. 82. Elder Eyres was taken from them February 13, 1759, aet. 68, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent paſtor, who had often preached to them before, was ordained the 29th of April following. He was almoſt the only diſſenting miniſter who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to preach on the iſland through all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing ſeaſon of its being poſſeſſed by the enemy; and he has had a precious harveſt of ſouls there ſince. The third church in Newport, who keep the ſeventh day, began under the miniſtry of Mr. William Hiſcox in 1671, who continued their paſtor until his death, May 24, 1704, aet. 66. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der William Gibſon from London was his ſucceſſor, and died March 12, 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ears, and continued their miniſter until he died, September 13, 1737. Elder John Maxſon was their next miniſter, from 1754 until his deceaſe, March 2, 1778. Mr. Ebenezer David (who was converted in Providence college, and took his firſt degree there in 1772) belonged to this church; and having been a chaplain much eſteemed in our army, died therein not far from Philadelphia, a few days after Mr. Maxſon. Their preſent paſtor was ordained a colleague with him.</p>
               <p>THE church in Dartmouth (mentioned in p. 18, 73) now have their meeting-houſe and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of their members within the bounds of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton. Elder Tabor died in 1752; after which they had Elder David Round for their miniſter a number of years, and ſome others; but it was a dark trying time with them, until a late remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able revival was granted. Their preſent paſtor is from Newport. He removed there in the ſpring
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:018336_0414_0FA7AF3DEDF08750"/>of 1775, but laboured under many diſcouragements for five years, and then heavy afflictions were made to work for good to him and his people. He was ordained April 13, 1780, and much of a ſpirit of prayer was granted for the revival of religion; which prayers were anſwered in ſuch a manner, that betwixt the firſt of June that year, and June 27, 1781, ninety members were added to that church. In which time ſay they, "We have ſeen as it were many Pentecoſt days, and enjoyed heaven upon earth: All glory to God forever and ever. The ſubjects of the work ſeem to be of all ages, from fifteen to ſixty, and all circumſtances of life. They tell clear experiences of a work of grace; and ſome who have been profeſſors ſeveral years can now tell ſomething like a new converſion."</p>
               <p n="3">III. WHEN we paſs over the Narraganſet Bay, I perceive that the church in South-Kingſtown (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned p. 120) has long been diſſolved; thoſe in North-Kingſtown and Warwick continue, but my intelligence concerning them is too imperfect to be of any ſervice to the public. The like may be ſaid concerning the ſeventh day church at Weſterly and Hopkinton, who continued to act as one church with their brethren of Newport, until they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly diſmiſſed therefrom in 1708. The church in the weſt part of Warwick, where Elder Worden was ordained (p. 175) is diſſolved; and after preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome time to the church in Coventry (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned p. 202) many of them removed to the place where he is now ſettled in Berkſhire. The weſt part of Coventry, with the adjacent borders of Scituate and Foſter, had ſcarcely the appearance of religion among them, until Elder Nichols was raiſed up, and made inſtrumental of a very conſiderable reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe parts, Elder David Sprague died in

                  </gap> Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock ſucceeded his father in office at Weſterly. Elder Wightman's ſon is his ſucceſſor in Groton. The church at New-London (p. 89) is diſſolved, by means of the ill conduct of their miniſter. The pious Elder Merriman died at Southington laſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aet 88. Such a revival of religion was granted in Woodſtock, in 1780, as added ninety members to the Baptiſt church there in leſs than two years. And to the honor of Governor Trumbull it is to be remembered, that he has repeatedly interpoſed his influence in favour of that ſociety, to relieve them when taxed to the worſhip of their opponents. The preſent Baptiſt miniſter of Suffield was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1775; and ſuch a bleſſing was granted upon his labours, that their church increaſed in about a year from ſixty to two hundred members. And our principles prevail more and more in all parts of the country; ſo that we may truly adopt the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Moſes's prophetical ſong, <hi>for their rock is not our rock, even our enemies themſelves being judges.</hi> They have often declared that their miniſters and churches would come down, if they were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by compulſion. They have now tried that power againſt us, and to ſupport themſelves, until it plainly fails them, while our rock ſtands firm. Let all the glory be given to God therefor. We are ſo far from deſerving any part of it, that like babes we have need again to be taught which are the firſt principles of the oracles of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. LET us take a brief view of thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and of the folly of man in departing from them. If we pay any regard to the word of Chriſt, we muſt know, that no man can ſee his kingdom, nor have right to any <hi>power</hi> therein, without regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:018336_0416_0FA7AF3F6DC043D8"/>and alſo that all ſtriving about who ſhall be the greateſt is excluded therefrom, John i. 12, 13, iii. 3, Mat. xviii. 1—4, xx. 25—28. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to which the fathers of New-England were taught, that, "As the kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world (John xviii. 36) but ſpiritual, and he a ſpiritual king; ſo muſt the government of this ſpiritual kingdom, under this ſpiritual king, needs be ſpiritual, and all the laws of it. And as Chriſt Jeſus hath, by the merits of his prieſthood (1 Cor. vi. 20) redeemed as well the body as the ſoul, ſo is he alſo, by the ſceptre of his kingdom, to rule and reign over both: Unto which Chriſtian magiſtrates, as well as meaner perſons, ought to ſubmit themſelves; and the more Chriſtian they are, the more meekly to take the yoke of Chriſt upon them; and the greater authority they have, the more effectually to advance his ſceptre over themſelves and their people by all good means. Neither can there be any reaſon given, why the merits of ſaints may not as well be mingled with the merits of Chriſt for the ſaving of his church, as the laws of men with his laws for the ruling and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. He is as abſolute and entire a king as he is a prieſt, and his people muſt be as careful to preſerve the dignity of the one, as to enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the other<note n="*" place="bottom">Robinſon againſt Bernard, p. 38.</note>." And as the teachers in the church of England continued to call baptiſm regeneration, as Origen did, and yet the author againſt whom Mr. Robinſon wrote told of his begetting many of his hearers in Chriſt by his preaching, Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid to him, "Their baptiſm was true baptiſm, and ſo the true ſeal of their forgiveneſs of ſins, and new birth, as you affirm p. 119, and this their ſeal of the new birth hath ſtood good upon them all this
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:018336_0417_0FA7AF416311A170"/>while, viſibly and externally; and yet, after all this, you preach unto them and beget them anew, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and eternally (for only God knoweth that which is true within.) You have begotten them through the goſpel. Behold a monſtrous generation! a man begetting children twenty, thirty or forty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be born! If Nichodemus had heard of this, he might well have ſaid, how can theſe things be<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface, p. 11, 12.</note>!" And how is the folly of others alſo now expoſed in our land? In 1638, the year Harvard college was founded, a law was made at Boſton, to empower the voters in each town (which then were only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants in their churches) to compel every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant therein to contribute proportionably with others, "For upholding the ordinances in the churches, whereof he <hi>doth or may</hi> receive benefit." And becauſe a man wrote ſome arguments againſt this practice, he was fined Ten Pounds; and another was fined Forty Shillings, only for reading the ſame before company; and the miniſters ſaid ſuch men were "Rather to be taught by cudgel than ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument." (Vol. 1, p. 98, 100.) But how is their folly now made <hi>manifeſt unto all men,</hi> according to God's promiſe? 2 Tim. iii. 5—9. Corrupt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have done the moſt to promote infidelity and a contempt of revealed religion of any men upon earth. After theſe things had broken forth in the nation moſt terribly, in and after the reign of Charles the ſecond, biſhop Burnet ſaid, "I am forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that having had much free converſation with many that have been fatally corrupted that way, they have very often owned to me, that nothing promoted this ſo much in them, as the very bad opinion which they took up of all clergymen of all ſides: They did not ſee in them that ſtrictneſs of life, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:018336_0418_0FA7AF41ACDC4890"/>of the world, that zeal, that meekneſs, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and charity, that diligence and earneſtneſs, with relation to the truths of the Chriſtian religion, which they reckoned they would moſt certainly have, if they themſelves firmly believed it. Therefore they concluded, that thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was more ſtrictly to enquire into the truth of their religion, knew that it was not ſo certain as they themſelves, for other ends, endeavoured to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was. And that, though for carrying on of their own authority or fortunes, which in one word they call their <hi>trade,</hi> they ſeemed to be very poſitive in affirming the truth of their doctrines; yet they in their own hearts did not believe it, ſince they lived ſo little anſwerable to it, and were ſo much ſet on raiſing themſelves by it; and ſo little on advancing the honor of their <hi>profeſſion,</hi> by an exemplary piety and ſhining converſation. This (ſays Burnet) is a thing not to be anſwered by being angry at them for ſaying it, or by reproaching ſuch as repeat it, as if they were <hi>enemies to the church;</hi> theſe words of heat and faction ſignify nothing to work upon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any<note n="†" place="bottom">Preface to his paſtoral care, 1692, p. 12, 23.</note>." And he well obſerves, that a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is the only effectual remedy. And ſuch a door is now opened for an extenſive reformation, as never has been before among any people ſince the riſe of Antichriſt. He roſe and has prevailed by the connexion of the officers of church and ſtate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as to level the terrors both of this and the future world againſt all that attempted to reſiſt their power. But how is that connexion now broken? A learned gentleman in the law publiſhed an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer laſt January, to the miniſter mentioned (p. 353) who tells him plainly, "That a church hath a right, beyond all obligation that human laws can
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:018336_0419_0FA7AF429B07EC00"/>lay upon them, to diſmiſs their paſtor when they pleaſe. Churches may adviſe churches, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may reaſon with members; but to adviſe will always ſuppoſe, that the advice may be accepted or rejected; and ſhould it be rejected, I know not to what earthly tribunal the paſtor, as paſtor, could repair with his complaint againſt his church.—The firſt principle in a religious body is, that they will act according to the dictates of a good conſcience, adviſing, not controuling one another. There is nothing more plain than that when they conſent to do that which their conſciences diſapprove, they do <hi>not act as a religious ſociety</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Strictures upon Thatcher, by J. S. p. 19, 22.</note>." This is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth, but how little is it regarded?</p>
               <p n="5">V. CAN the conſcience of any man approve of his taking away the property of another for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? or requiring him to do much ſervice for a community, without any ſupport or reward? Chriſt ſays the labourer is worthy of his reward; and his command is, <hi>let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked.</hi> Yet how many are there at this day that make high pretences of regard to a free goſpel, and at the ſame time treat thoſe whom they applaud as true teachers of it worſe than they do their oxen? Not only neglect to communicate good things to them themſelves, but hinder others from doing of it. Such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has been deſcribed (p. 116.) And there are perſons now in all parts of the land, who are ready to ſpit their venom, and if poſſible to ruin the characters of all teachers who will not either be tyrants or ſlaves; either be confederate in forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the property of people for nothing, and worſe than nothing, or elſe ſpend their lives and

The great deſign of religion is to make men juſt and merciful; but how oppoſite thereto is it, to ſet a man up in a public and expenſive office, expoſed to the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of earth and hell, and require him to <hi>go this warfare of his own charges!</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 7—14. Can any wonder if a curſe is ſent upon the bleſſings of men who refuſe to lay theſe things to heart? Mal. ii. 2, iii. 9, 10. Truth and love bring teachers and members to act in union, and to regard each others caſe as their own, which a precious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber do in our day; but pride and covetouſneſs <hi>cauſeth diviſions and offences,</hi> contrary thereto; and all ſuch are to be <hi>marked and avoided.</hi> Thoſe in general who have made uſe of ſecular force in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters have been ſuch <hi>ſchiſmatics</hi> (p. 50) neither can others be free of that guilt, who lay heavy ſervice and burthens upon their officers, and will not touch them with one of their fingers.

<pb n="406" facs="unknown:018336_0421_0FA7AF43EFC79528"/>of <hi>oppoſitions of ſcience falſly ſo called,</hi> and of thoſe who <hi>hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> and perhaps the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are inſtances of it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. THAT Chriſtianity is eſſentially neceſſary to the good order of civil ſociety, is a certain truth, (p. 331) but men hold it in unrighteouſneſs, when they aſſume a power to <hi>add</hi> to Chriſt's laws about his worſhip. Pretenders to new immediate revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do this as really as ſtate politicians. Special teachings of the Holy Spirit we all need continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to give us a right underſtanding of the holy ſcriptures, ſo as to apply and obey them in a right manner; but they are perfect in themſelves, and ſufficient to furniſh the man of God for every good work, when he takes the <hi>apoſtles</hi> as the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of the <hi>prophets.</hi> On this foundation the Chriſtian church was built, Eph. ii. 19, 20. And though <hi>confounding</hi> of them together produced my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery Babylon, yet when ſhe ſhall be deſtroyed that order will be again obſerved, Rev. xviii. 20. Their writings, with the united church of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews and Gentiles built thereon, appear to be the two witneſſes mentioned in Rev. xi. 3—15. Directly after their reſurrection, the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of Chriſt; which undoubtedly intends an entire ſubmiſſion to his laws and government. Reference is there had to Zech. iv. 11—14, which ſpeaks of one candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, of two olive trees, and of <hi>golden oil</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated into it through them. There was then but one church; but after the partition wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Jews and Gentiles was broken down, <hi>both</hi> have acceſs by <hi>one ſpirit</hi> unto the Father; which ſpirit is plainly the golden oil communicated to ſouls through the word of truth. This united church is the light of the world, and the pillar and
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:018336_0422_0FA7AF4502C4B5B0"/>ground of the truth, Mat. v. 14, 1 Tim. iii. 15. The chief diſputes in the world have been whether God's revealed mind is ſtrictly <hi>true?</hi> or if true, how it can be <hi>equal?</hi> The apoſtles and prophets, and all hearty believers of their writings, have ever witneſſed for both of theſe points; but it has long been in ſackcloth or mourning. And perhaps when they are killed, and yet the <hi>people</hi> will not permit them to be buried, means when officers become ſo corrupt that <hi>truth falls in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter,</hi> though the people will not entirely part therewith. Hereupon Jehovah will ariſe and render <hi>vengeance to his enemies according to their deeds;</hi> yea, <hi>recompence to the iſlands.</hi> After which the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> ſhall come to Zion, and to them that <hi>turn from tranſgreſſion in Jacob;</hi> who will be eſtabliſhed in a way of <hi>covenant</hi> obedience to the <hi>words of his mouth,</hi> by the influence of his <hi>ſpirit.</hi> This prophecy the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle applies to future times, which will be as <hi>life from the dead,</hi> Iſai. lix. 14—21, Rom. xi. 15, 26. Again, becauſe it is a moſt important truth that <hi>God is no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> many deny his right to <hi>do what he will with his own grace,</hi> though in a way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect juſtice. He is perfectly juſt in all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, while he <hi>ſhews mercy to whom he will ſhew mercy.</hi> And to deny this is to deny him the right which every freeman has with his own property. Oh, madneſs! It is alſo an eſſential truth, that God is LOVE in the abſtract; but it is a fatal deluſion to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he loves every individual ſinner, ſo as not to inflict endleſs puniſhment upon ſuch as die in impenitency. The devils are his creatures, and were a higher order of them than men; yet their endleſs puniſhment is declared as one evidence againſt thoſe who turn grace into laſciviouſneſs, Jude 6. Again, Chriſt's finiſhed atonement is the
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:018336_0423_0FA7AF4689D3FDC0"/>object of faith, and all our encouragement to come to God by him, is ever to be derived from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thereof given in the goſpel, which is as true before we believe it as afterwards; but it is a moſt deceitful trick to argue from thence, that the true believer is not conſcious of an inward change in his ſoul, ſo as to be enabled to do ſuch acts as are <hi>well pleaſing to God,</hi> Heb. xiii. 16. When any in Iſrael were bitten with the fiery ſerpents, all hope of life was cut off, but only from an object without and above them, to which each of them muſt look, or death was his portion; yet when he looked, a change was wrought <hi>within him;</hi> the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was expelled, and health recovered; and it would have been a wicked thing in any of them not to have rejoiced, and been thankful therefor. Now Chriſt himſelf explains faith and regeneration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, John iii. 14, 15. Yet Robert Sandeman, and James Relly after him, have poiſoned the ſouls of many with artful repreſentations that it is phariſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical pride for any to tell of inward experiences, and to rejoice in what God had done within them. And the latter of them, by deceitfully repreſenting that our own intereſt is part of the firſt object of faith, has carried his argument in many minds, that every individual will finally be ſaved, becauſe if it were not ſo, it could not be a crime not to believe a point which was not true in fact. Whereas in the paſſage that he builds moſt upon, a not believing the <hi>record</hi> as it ſtands in the book is the crime charged; and life is there declared to be <hi>in the Son,</hi> and <hi>given to us,</hi> and alſo that none have life but thoſe who <hi>have that gift,</hi> 1 John v. 10—12, Now compare this with Chriſt's own words concerning the brazen ſerpent, and Relly's argument appears as falſe as it would to have argued, that it could not have been a crime
<pb n="409" facs="unknown:018336_0424_0FA7AF46ED7494D8"/>for a poiſoned perſon to refuſe a look to it, unleſs healing was as certainly his before as afterwards: No crime to <hi>make light</hi> of the goſpel call, unleſs the feaſt they are called to is certainly theirs, and they may come to it when they pleaſe; and that God's infinite love obliges him to receive them when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall cry for it in good earneſt, Mat. xxii. 1—4. The devil himſelf never preached worſe doctrine than this, yet how many are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attached thereto!</p>
               <p n="7">VII. ANOTHER eſſential truth of the goſpel is, that we muſt daily deny ourſelves and take up our croſs, or we cannot be Chriſt's diſciples: But this truth has often been held in unrighteouſneſs in every age. The people mentioned p. 209, run to a great length in that way. A man from Charleſtown, near B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Since which the ſame houſe in Harvard has been made the head-quarters of a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from Britain, who have a woman for their head. They privately got together in the county of Albany, and formed their ſcheme; and then in April, 1780, it was ſuddenly proclaimed, that a new diſpenſation was begun, greater than had ever been known in the world before, which all were called to enter into, or they could not be ſaved.

The ſaid Baptiſt miniſter in Pittsfield, after being a few months with them, was delivered from that deluſion, and publiſhed an account of their ſcheme, which was printed at Hartford, Norwich, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Boſton. I was at his houſe in June, 1782, and went with him to viſit a conſiderable number of them. They earneſtly inculcate that doctrine of devils of <hi>forbidding to marry,</hi> and require ſo much <hi>bodily exerciſe,</hi> in ſinging and dancing, &amp;c. as has deſtroyed the health and even the lives of ſome; a cruel croſs indeed! while their chief leaders delight themſelves much in feaſting and drinking ſpirituous liquor. I would by no means miſrepreſent any of their ſentiments or conduct; but I have obtained moſt certain evidence that theſe ſeven abominations conſtitute the eſſence of their ſcheme.

                  </gap> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in Cumberland, in the county of Providence, being a young woman of a retentive memory, and an eloquent tongue, declares that in October, 1776, ſhe was not only taken ſick but actually died, and her ſoul went to heaven; ſoon after which, ſhe ſays, her body was re-animated by the ſpirit and power of Chriſt; upon which ſhe ſet out as a public teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and for a while had large aſſemblies to hear her in various parts of the county of Briſtol, and from thence weſtward to New-London. Indeed ſhe has travelled as far as Boſton on one hand, and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia on the other; but her chief followers were within the above limits. A young man, who was an intimate counſellor of hers for ſome years, gives the following account of her, and of how he and other people were enſnared by her. He firſt heard her at Tiverton, in 1778, and ſays he, "The firſt appearance ſeemed to be ſomething ſingular and extraordinary, in a habit different from what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt women, wearing her hair curled in her neck, without any other covering on her head, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when ſhe travelled out ſhe put on a hat much like a man's, only with the brim down. Her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage a good deal bright, with a very agreeable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; her voice very grum and ſhrill for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſeemed pathetical and engaging in her diſcourſe, in which were abundance of ſcripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, though not much explained, or light held up from them; neither did I ever hear her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance much ſcripture doctrine of the principles of religion, but her exhortation ſeemed to be very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, ſhewing a very ſedate countenance with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and ſolemnity, admoniſhing all to repent
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:018336_0427_0FA7AF492D96F5A0"/>and forſake evil, and learn to do well, and live as they would wiſh to die.—And as the ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at this day is much like the Athenians, that ſpent their time in nothing elſe but either to hear or tell ſome new thing, her coming forth as a preacher different from all other ſects or denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of people, being a woman of extraordinary natural abilities, ſpeaking as an orator, of a great memory in the ſcriptures, and having abundance of ſtrange reports ſpread abroad concerning her, ſome falſe and ſome true, produce abundance of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators and enquirers. And ſhe appears zealouſly engaged, and ſays ſhe devotes herſelf and ſervice wholly to the glory of God, and the good of ſouls. She exhorts people in a pathetical manner, with great confidence and boldneſs; and ſays ſhe has an immediate revelation for all ſhe delivers; that ſhe is the greateſt miniſter that God has ſent to the people theſe ſeventeen hundred and odd years; and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing herſelf to live as ſhe exhorts others to, fully in a ſtate of perfection, with no liability of error or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in any reſpect, ſeems to have great influence upon many ſerious people; for no one would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally think that a perſon in their right ſenſes would dare to hold forth and affirm ſuch great and exalted things concerning themſelves, unleſs it were ſo in reality<note n="*" place="bottom">Brownell upon enthuſiaſtical errors, 1783, p. 5—7.</note>." This is a brief view of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his account of her way of proceeding, which brought a number of ignorant people, and ſome who have been officers in the State, to follow and cleave to her affectionately, as a perſon inveſted with immediate and great power from above, even power to work miracles.

               <p n="8">VIII. AND thus I have pointed out ſome of the ways wherein men have gone a <hi>whoring with their own inventions</hi> (Pſal. cvi. 39) which is fixing their affections and dependence thereon, inſtead of the God of truth. And though it is a maxim with earthly politicians, that their King can do no wrong, thereby imputing all that is wrong to others, yet they have long taken the oppoſite courſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kingdom of Chriſt. All the frauds, oppreſſions and licentiouſneſs, that have been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed under his name, have been caſt upon Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity itſelf; as if becauſe men are falſe, therefore God is not true. Inſtead of owning his juſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they have exalted themſelves above him, and have arraigned <hi>his ſayings</hi> at their bar, Rom. iii. 4. What he ſays concerning the entire depravity of man, and their enmity of heart againſt God, they make a chief argument againſt the truth of his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his written word; and thus they plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of it, by their arguments againſt it. And becauſe errors and hereſies more openly break out, where he has poured out his ſpirit, than where people like Moab are ſettled upon their lees, many conclude that it was not his ſpirit that moved upon the minds of the people; which argument is about as concluſive as it would be to ſay, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the ſun are not really good in the ſpring and ſummer, becauſe they cauſe a very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtench to ariſe from dunghills and dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, which we do not ſmell when the ſun is at a great diſtance, and theſe things are hard frozen in the winter; or to ſay that the ſhowers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are not good, becauſe they make the thorns to grow as well as the wheat. Theſe reaſoners
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:018336_0429_0FA7AF4AAE79FEB8"/>often declare, that if we are entirely dependent upon the ſovereign will of God, for renewing and ſaving grace, then all our uſe of means to attain ſalvati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n is in vain; but why do they uſe means for their bodies? <hi>If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that.</hi> Who were they that ſaid a few years ago, "<hi>We will bring</hi> America to our feet!—We <hi>will</hi> not receive law from any power whatever!" Where is the Governor who required us to ſubmit to an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>unlimited power</hi> in man! (Page 289, 290, 364.) God's plan of government is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect and immutable; and he has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the means and the end, and the means in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the end, in the moral as well as natural world. The means of grace are calculated in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom to open the eyes of men, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Precepts and promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, calls and warnings, are all motives to influence the choice of man. And the ſtrongeſt hold that the devil has in this world is to perſuade man, that a being governed in his choice by motives without himſelf, is inconſiſtent with the liberty of moral agents; and to perſuade him at the ſame time that neceſſity obliges God to pardon and ſave them, whenever they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſincere penitents. Thus they aſſume a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty to themſelves, which they deny to their MAKER; and treat him as a <hi>ſervant,</hi> to whom they may ſay, <hi>go thy way for this time, and when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee;</hi> making his choice dependent upon theirs. If motives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us do not determine our choice, it would be impoſſible for God to govern us; and, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Edwards obſerves, Arminian principles truly involve in their nature the horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:018336_0430_0FA7AF500F7A6ED0"/>which they falſly caſt upon the Calviniſts, of charging God with acting a deceitful part towards men, in appointing the means of grace; for theſe are motives to determine their choice on the ſide of virtue, which he could not be ſincere in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if their choice is not determined by motives without themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards on the will, p. 266, third edition.</note>. His immutable deſigns are ſo far from interfering with the liberty of moral agents, that where they are known, the believer dare not make them the rule of his conduct; and hereby ſubjects and rebels are diſtinguiſhed. An expreſs precept required Saul to deſtroy Agag, as well as the reſt of the Amalakites; and by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereto he loſt his kingdom and his ſoul. On the other hand, David knew that God deſigned to remove Saul, yet having no precept to kill him, he refuſed to do it, though much provoked thereto, when he had very convenient opportunities to cut him off. And though the prophet Samuel, by immediate direction from above, anointed Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to be king over Iſrael, yet he never aſſumed that power but by their free choice and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and when this was done by part of them, he made no uſe of their arms to compel others to receive him. And when ten tribes revolted from his grandſon, who collected an army to bring them under him again, God warned him not to do it, and was obeyed therein. And if a <hi>power of will</hi> oppoſite to the bible had not been dreadfully ſet up in latter ages, myſtery Babylon would not have been drunken with blood as ſhe now is. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the Jews of God's deſign, that Jeſus ſhould die for that nation, did not at all leſſen the guilt of thoſe who thereupon <hi>took counſel together for to put him to death,</hi> John xi. 51—53. Obedience
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:018336_0431_0FA7AF50B5C92270"/>to what he requires of us, is the meaſure of our duty and felicity, without attempting to get into the place of the univerſal Ruler. At the ſame time no honeſt ſoul could be happy under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if they thought it poſſible for men or devils to deceive him, and to defeat his deſigns. And whether the whole hiſtory of this country, as well as others, does not demonſtrate, that a hearty and unfeigned obedience to his revealed will is our wiſdom as well as duty, and that all diſobedience thereto is infinitely hateful and dreadful, is now freely referred to the reader's conſcience.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THE word covenant, when uſed concerning contracts between man and man, includes many ideas that can have no place in the affairs betwixt the creature and his Creator; and ſo much darkneſs has appeared in controverſies upon this ſubject, that ſome worthy men have thought it beſt to adopt the word teſtament inſtead of covenant in the latter caſe. But a review muſt convince us that

Yet teſtament ever means the will of the teſtator expreſſed, and alſo a free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of his property as he pleaſeth; which, when well ratified, is as good a title as any in the world, although it would ſpoil it for the legatees to have any hand in forming it. And mutual conſent, with mutual obligations and privileges, are eſſential ideas in all covenants. <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> was the language of God to Adam in innocency, with which his heart concurred; and this obligation to love is immutably binding upon all his children, Luke x. 27, 28. To withhold this obedience is to rob both God and man of their right; and God juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires every ſinner to <hi>give again that he had robbed, and to walk in the ſtatutes of life without committing iniquity.</hi> And the new covenant is the writing the law of love in the believer's heart, which yields a free conſent to it, in the tenor of <hi>I will, and they ſhall,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 15, Rom. viii. 3, 4, Heb. viii. 10, 11. All who have this work wrought within them ought to confeſs the ſame <hi>with their mouths,</hi> and to receive each other as Chriſt received them, to the glory of God. Says the apoſtle, they <hi>faſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

II. GREAT imperfections ſtill remain among us in theſe reſpects; yet it is thought beſt to exhibit to the world a liſt of the churches in New-England who profeſs theſe principles, at leaſt ſo far as not to allow that perſons can be forced into religious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. A few of them admit ſome Pedobaptiſts to their communion, and it is but a few; neither can that practice laſt long, as our opponents know that practice ſpeaks louder than words; and a noted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and church in the county of Plymouth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debarred one of their pious members from their communion laſt year, for no other crime than a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried in baptiſm;</hi> by which act ſay they, "She has practically declared infant baptiſm a nullity, and this church to be a company of unbaptized perſons." And the Separate churches in Connecticut pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their terms of communion three years ago, which were theſe, viz. "As to our Baptiſt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we are free to hold occaſional communion with ſuch as are regular churches, and make the Chriſtian profeſſion as aboveſaid, and <hi>acknowledge us to be baptized churches,</hi>" &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">Declaration of ſaid churches met at Killingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> September 19, 1781, p. 21</note>. Hereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our terms of communion, as deſcribed (p. 214, 215.) Our ſentiments concerning the uſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Councils are the ſame as thoſe deſcribed by our fathers (p. 39, 40) and we refuſe to hear any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of cenſured perſons in our annual Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe that would imply juriſdiction over the churches, which we diſclaim; and we hold that a Council freely choſen, and meeting near the place of difficulty or grievance, where a fair hearing of the parties concerned may be had, is the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and ſcriptural method of proceeding in ſuch
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:018336_0434_0FA7AF5A040524F0"/>caſes. Our ſentiments about the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of human learning are well expreſſed (p. 55.) Confining the miniſtry to an education at college, as well as compelling people to ſupport ſuch, have produced infinite miſchiefs in all ages, which could never have prevailed as they have, if cruel arts had not been made uſe of to keep the people in ignorance, and to prejudice their minds againſt true knowledge, both ſacred and civil. The foundation for learning laid at Providence (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned p. 235) has ſuffered much in the late war, but the ſchool appears now again in a promiſing way. All other colleges have been very expenſive to governments, but this has never received any thing in that way (no not to repair damages which government has occaſioned therein) but perſonal generoſity laid its foundation, and has been its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port hitherto. Gentlemen of various denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, chiefly in the town of Providence, ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Four Thouſand Pounds therefor before the college edifice was erected in that town; and conſiderable ſums have been given ſince, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the year paſt, to augment their library. And as liberal ſentiments are taught therein, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, whoſe civil and moral conduct is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, have equal privileges for learning in it, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral communications are earneſtly ſollicited for the neceſſary ſupport of this inſtitution.</p>

Having had ſeveral Interviews with divers of the People called Quakers, on the Subject of the firſt Volume of my Hiſtory, and finding I have not clearly expreſſed their Sentiments and Practices, and ſome Facts appearing to me different from what they did when I wrote, I am deſirous, with them, to have the Hiſtory corrected, and Matters put in ſuch a Light, that Poſterity may not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehend them: Let the Reader therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the following Correction, as what appears to me moſt conſiſtent with the Truth, and in Juſtice to that People ought to be tranſmitted to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN page</hi> 141, <hi>the following extract from John Tyſo's letter, "There was nothing</hi> IN <hi>him (i. e. Dr. Increaſe Mather, as he ſaid) that he hoped to be ſaved by," hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been made by me to manifeſt an error in Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Chriſt within; I would obſerve, that I do not look upon it as an error, provided Chriſt without be alſo acknowledged, and it be held agreeable to the true ſenſe of John</hi> vi. 56, xvii. 26, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 24, <hi>in which ſenſe I am informed it is held by Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In page</hi> 143, 144, <hi>I have quoted ſome of Roger Williams's arguments againſt Friends ſentiments of the</hi> grace of God having appeared, or being manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all mankind univerſally; <hi>for their anſwer to which arguments, I would refer to Fox, &amp;c. anſwer, page</hi> 17—20, <hi>2d part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In page</hi> 307, <hi>I mentioned that</hi> Quakers <hi>were ſo called from Fox and his companions trembling and quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before</hi> Gervaſe Bennet, a Juſtice in Derby. <hi>I meant not to inſinuate, that their trembling on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or others, was occaſioned by the fear of man; neither do I on a review of proofs find ſufficient grounds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Fox's account of their receiving ſaid name, which follows in the ſame page; though it is allowed by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:018336_0442_0FA7AF6AF9640FF8"/>as well as Moſheim, that their quaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in other places occaſioned their being commonly called by that name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In page</hi> 321, <hi>I undertake to inform poſterity how thoſe Quakers behaved under their ſufferings; upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of which it appears juſt to add, that I find, and that by other parts of Cudworth's uncontroverted letter, not quoted by me, that he was turned out of office, as he expreſly ſays, "Becauſe I had entertained ſome of the Quakers at my houſe, that thereby I might be the better acquainted with their principles; the Court profeſſing they had nothing</hi> at all <hi>againſt me, only in that thing, of giving</hi> entertainment <hi>to the Quakers." And he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, "That when the Quakers were committed to priſon, they muſt be kept-on coarſe bread and water, no Friend may bring them</hi> any thing, <hi>none permitted</hi> to ſpeak with them, <hi>nay, if they have money of their</hi> own, <hi>they may not</hi> make uſe of that to relieve themſelves; <hi>they have many adherents, and a little to acquaint you with their ſufferings, which is grievous unto and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the hearts of moſt of the precious ſaints of God; it lies down and riſes up with them, and they cannot put it out of their minds, to ſee and hear of poor families deprived of their comforts, and brought into penury and want. As far as I am able to judge of the end, it is to force them from their homes and lawful habitations, and to drive them out of their coaſts.—As for the means by which they are impoveriſhed, theſe in the firſt place were ſcrupulous of an oath." This does not appear to be confined to allegiance of fidelity to government, but oaths at large, which principle I underſtand they maintain from our Saviour's command, Mat.</hi> v. 34, <hi>I ſay unto you ſwear not at all, &amp;c. "Why then we muſt put in force an old law, that all may take the oath of fidelity;—they cannot—then a fine of Five Pounds. On this account thirty-five head of cattle, as I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, hath been by the authority of the Court taken
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:018336_0443_0FA7AF6BB52DE440"/>from them the latter part of this ſummer. A poor weaver that has ſeven or eight ſmall children, himſelf lame in his body, had but two cows, and both taken from him: The Marſhal aſked him what he would do? The man ſaid,</hi> that God, who gave him them, he doubted not would ſtill provide for him. <hi>To fill up the meaſure yet more full, though to the further emptying of Sandwich men, the Court of Aſſiſtants, the firſt Tueſday of this inſtant, was pleaſed to determine fines upon them for meetings, One Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and among others the poor weaver ſpoken of Twenty Pounds, &amp;c." And after his mentioning their not ſuffering their friends of Rhode-Iſland to come and trade with them, proceeds, "So that unleſs the Lord ſteps in to their help and aſſiſtance, in ſome way beyond man's conceiving, their caſe is ſad and to be pitied, and truly it moves bowels of compaſſion in all ſorts except</hi> thoſe in place, who carry it with a high hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. <hi>Our bench now is Thomas Prince, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, &amp;c." See the letter in Biſhop's hiſtory, from page</hi> 168—177, <hi>or more at large in the ſecond volume, folio, of the book of ſufferings of the Quakers, from page</hi> 191—195, <hi>which laſt I did not ſee till ſince the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the firſt volume of my hiſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the foregoing account, and what Biſhop charges upon Governor Prince, viz. "That in thy conſcience they were ſuch a people as deſerved to be deſtroyed, they, their wives, their children, their houſes and lands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity or mercy:" Which ſentiment of his againſt the Quakers, I am told, is remembered in the family, being handed down to thoſe of his poſterity now living.—It muſt therefore be acknowledged, he muſt have had too great a ſhare in the perſecutions mentioned: And as the perſecuted Norton ſaid, the</hi> ſtrength of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>muſt then have been too unhappily over him. And in juſtice to Humphry Norton's character (which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be leſſened by my manner of inſerting his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:018336_0444_0FA7AF6FF6107440"/>and treating this ſubject, in page</hi> 322 <hi>of my hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) I think further to manifeſt his and J. Rouſe's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour under their ſufferings, by inſerting a paragraph in Biſhop's hiſtory, page</hi> 179, <hi>which would render my account more intelligible and full. Speaking of the number of laſhes, which I mentioned, he adds, "Which as it drew ſtore of blood, ſo it took much with the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, who beheld them in the ſtocks firſt praying, then ſaluting each other, and bidding the executioner have patience a little (when he came to take off their cloaths) and he ſhould ſee they could give their backs to the ſmiters." And Biſhop adds, that "They gave in a paper aſſigning the grounds and reaſons of their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they were demanded wherefore they came in, which the magiſtrates</hi> would not ſuffer to be read; <hi>and ſo envious were they, that for taking John Rouſe by the hand they put three of the inhabitants of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich in the ſtocks." And it appearing by the ſaid Biſhop's hiſtory, and the book of Friends ſufferings, that other whippings and perſecutions followed in Plymouth Colony, and that the ſaid Humphry Norton, under whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and other perſecutions at New-Haven, appears to have behaved in a Chriſtian temper, when being looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſtocks after being whipped, having a great iron key tyed athwart his mouth, and burnt deep in his hand with a red hot iron, "He kneeled down and prayed to the Lord, uttering his voice towards heaven, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them all."—The reader is referred thereto for a more particular account.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In page</hi> 323, <hi>I interpreted the figurative expreſſions of "Rending the rocks of wiſdom and knowledge, and exalting that which is low," as directed againſt civil and eccleſiaſtical government, which I ſuppoſed they meant to ſubject to a ſuppoſed ſpiritual power in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians without outward laws and rules: But on further enquiry and converſation with Friends, I am convinced they thereby referred to the coming of the Lord, by his
<pb n="430" facs="unknown:018336_0445_0FA7AF70A1D452F8"/>ſpiritual work, to level the wiſe and great, compared to mountains; and the literal knowledge and meer ſcolaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic divinity, compared to rocks, as being hard to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate and break; for that which is meek and low to be exalted, even Chriſt within the hope of glory.—In which ſenſe I perceive that paſſage is now underſtood by Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſame page I obſerved, on ſome preceding extracts from Fox's and Williams's writings, "This opens the plain cauſe why they (the Quakers) milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo hard againſt other magiſtrates and government." And in the form of an allegory, in page</hi> 507, <hi>it is ſaid, "To whom others made fierce oppoſition profeſſedly from the light within; and their claſhings were ſo great that ſeveral lives were loſt in the fray." The terms</hi> mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, fierce oppoſition and claſhing <hi>to the loſs of lives, uſed to repreſent the conduct of Friends in thoſe days, in reſpect to civil government, are too harſh to be juſtified by any authenticated facts.—I conceive it to be eſſential to civil government, that the magiſtrate have a power to inflict corporal puniſhments, and alſo to ărm his ſubjects to war againſt invaders of their rights, and therefore that the teaching of a contrary doctrine in either of theſe points, ſo far as it has influence, tends to obſtruct or pull down government; and in no other ſenſe did I ever mean to charge the Quakers with militating againſt or obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I find they allow magiſtrates to inflict corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon their ſubjects, who tranſgreſs the rules of equity<note n="*" place="bottom">See Fox's epiſtle to Friends at Nevis, in 1675. Alſo, Iſaac Pennington's works, folio, firſt part, page 323.</note>; but do not approve of arming their ſubjects to war againſt others. And in all States where they have been, I know nothing but that, as a ſociety, they have been either actively obedient thereto, or have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſuffered what they were pleaſed to inflict upon them, without plotting againſt the government thereof,
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:018336_0446_0FA7AF70F9956CB0"/>or uſing any forcible reſiſtance againſt it. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the reader to remember that I mean to correct every thing in my hiſtory that ſeemingly or really contradicts theſe ideas, and this character of the ſociety.</hi>

                  <hi>In page</hi> 324, <hi>I ſpeak of our Lord's direction to his diſciples, Mat. <hi>x. 23,</hi> and of his own conduct towards the Gergeſenes, Mat. <hi>viii. 34,</hi> as forming a general rule for us, thence charging ſome blame upon thoſe Quakers who returned into the Maſſachuſetts; whereas they now both appear to me to refer to ſpecial and peculiar caſes.</hi>

                  <hi>As to the writings I referred to at the top of page</hi> 327, <hi>I rather think my memory failed me in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; and as to not having light from ſcripture, for actions, in the ſame page, I find that they ſuppoſe that Iſaiah <hi>xx. 2,</hi> and Micah <hi>i. 8,</hi> prove, that the women there mentioned might be moved by the divine ſpirit to do thoſe actions; of which the reader is left to judge for himſelf.</hi>

                  <hi>Upon a review of page</hi> 325 <hi>and</hi> 462, <hi>compared with their own writings, I find that I had ſome miſtaken ideas of what they held concerning the light within, and therefore freely refer the reader to their own authors for information in that reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I did not mean, in page</hi> 462, <hi>to charge them with calling</hi> darkneſs light, <hi>any further than wherein they appeared to be againſt allowing others the free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of examining and by arguments oppoſing ſentiments which they ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>William Harris is referred to at the bottom of page</hi> 152, <hi>and in page</hi> 457 <hi>is named as a Quaker; I am now convinced that he was not one then, if he ever was; and the word</hi> only, <hi>as I twice uſed it in page</hi> 469, <hi>and once in page</hi> 472, <hi>in a way that ſeems to acquit Mr. Williams from any blame in his diſpute with the Quakers, was more than I intended; for I
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:018336_0447_0FA7AF71D64A8EE8"/>really think there was a great deal of imperfection diſcovered by him, as well as his opponents, in the management of that diſpute; and if he meant to puniſh any meerly for their plain uſe of thee and thou (which I think he did not) I do not concur with any ſuch thing.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In page</hi> 463, <hi>I have not ſo fully quoted Friends anſwer to Roger Williams's objections as might be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give an adequate view of both ſides of the diſpute; therefore I refer my reader to their writings on that ſubject, particularly George Fox's anſwer to ſaid objections, page</hi> 155, <hi>and appendix,</hi> 117, 118.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 470, <hi>line</hi> 32, <hi>after the word</hi> ſentence, <hi>inſert,</hi> viz. blood will be given, <hi>which words are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly marked, as referred to by Grove.</hi>

                  <hi>Perhaps the partiality, in favour of Mr. Cotton, which I mention in page</hi> 471, <hi>was owing to Mr. Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington's particular affection for him, rather than to the cauſe there aſſigned.</hi>
