            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL Ignorant People That desire to be <hi>INSTRVCTED.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>POor People, your manner is to sooth up your selves, as though you were in a most happy estate: but if the matter come to a just tryal, it will fall out far otherwise. For you lead your lives in great ignorance, as may appear by these your common opinions which follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That Faith is a mans good meaning and his good serving of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God is served by the rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the ten Commandments, the Lords Prayer, and the Creed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ye have believed in Christ ever since you could remember.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is pity that he should live which doth any whit doubt of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That none can tell whether he shall be saved or not certainly; but that all men must be of a good belief.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That howsoever a man live, yet if he call upon God on his death-bed, and
<pb facs="unknown:000328_0003_0FA4AA782A4F0E00"/>
say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> and so go away like a lamb, he is certainly saved</p>
            <p n="7">7. That if any be strangely visited, he is either taken with a Planet, or bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That a man may lawfully swear when he speaketh nothing but the truth, and swears by nothing, but that which is good, as by his faith and troth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That a Preacher is a good man no longer then he is in the Pulpit; <hi>They think all like themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. That a man may repent, when he will, because the Scripture saith, <hi>At what time soever a sinner doth repent him of his sin, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. That it is an easier thing to please God, then to please our neighbour.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That ye can keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as God will give you leave.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That it is safest to do in religion as most do.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That merry Ballads and Books, as <hi>Skoggin, Bevis of Southampton,</hi> &amp;c. are good to drive away the time, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move heart qualms.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That ye can serve God with all your hearts; and that you would be sorry else</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb facs="unknown:000328_0004_0FA4AA78F9253A08"/>16. That a man need not hear so many Sermons, except he could follow them better.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That a man, which cometh at no Sermons, may as well believe, as he which hears all the Sermons in the world.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That ye know all the Preacher can tell you: for he can say nothing, but that every man is a sinner, that we must love our neighbour as ovr selves, that every man must be saved by Christ: and all this ye can tell as well as he.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That it was a good world, when the old Religion was, because all things were cheap.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That drinking and bezeling in the Ale-house or Tavern, is good fellowship, and shews a good kind nature, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains neighbour-hood.</p>
            <p n="21">21. That a man may swear by the Mass, because it is nothing now: and by our Lady, because she is gone out of the countrey.</p>
            <p n="22">22. That every man must be for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and God for us all.</p>
            <p n="23">23. That a man may make of his own whatsoever he can.</p>
            <p n="24">24. That if a man remember to say
<pb facs="unknown:000328_0005_0FA4AA79C45C12D8"/>
his prayers every morning (though he never understand them) he hath blessed himself for all the day following.</p>
            <p n="25">25. That a man prayeth, when he saith the ten Commandments.</p>
            <p n="26">26. That a man eats his Maker in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="27">27. That if a man be no Adulterer, no Thief, no Murderer, and do no man harm, he is a right honest man.</p>
            <p n="28">28. That a man need not have any knowledge of Religion, because he is not book-learned.</p>
            <p n="29">29. That one may have a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he saith and doth that which is evil.</p>
            <p n="30">30. That a man may go to Wizards called wise men, for counsel: because God hath provided a salve for every sore.</p>
            <p n="31">31. That ye are to be excused in all your doings, because the best men are sinners.</p>
            <p n="32">32. That ye have so strong a Faith in Christ, that no evil company can hurt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These and such like sayings, what argue they, but your gross ignorance? now where
<pb facs="unknown:000328_0006_0FA4AA7BF4C02680"/>
ignorance raigneth, there raigns sin, and where sin raigns, there the devil rules; and where he rules, men are in a damnable case. Ye will reply unto me thus: that ye are not so bad as I would make you. If need be, you can say the Creed, the Lords Prayer and the ten Commandments: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye will be of Gods belief, say all men what they will, and you defie the Devil from your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer again, that it is not sufficient to say all these without book, unless ye can understand the meaning of the words, and be able to make a right use of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the Creed, of the Lords-Prayer; by applying them inwardly to your hearts and consciences, and outwardly to your lives and conversations. This is the very point in which ye fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for an help in this your ignorance to bring you to true knowledge, unfeigned Faith and sound Repentance, here I have set down the principal points of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in six plain and easie Rules, even such as the simplest may easily learn: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is adjoyned an Exposition of them word by word. If ye do want other good directions, then use this my labour for your good instruction. In reading of it, first learn
<pb facs="unknown:000328_0007_0FA4AA7CCCEBC128"/>
the six Principles: and when you have them without book, and the meaning of them withal, thtn learn the exposition also which being well conceived, and in some measure felt in the heart, ye shall be able to profit by Sermons, whereas now ye cannot; and the ordinary parts of the Catechisme, namely, the ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the institution of the two Sacraments, shall more easily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</hi>

willeth and lusteth after evil. Fourthly, the <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5.24</note> affections of the heart, as love, joy, hope, desire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moved and stirred to that which is evil, to embrace it; and they are never stirred unto that which is good, unless it be, to eschew it. Lastly, the <note n="b" place="margin">Rom 6.19</note> members of the body are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and tools of the mind, for the execution of sin.</p>
               <p>Q What be those evil actions, that are the fruits of this corruption?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Evil <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 6.5</note> thoughts in the mind, which come either by a mans own conceiving, or by suggestion of the devil: <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 13.2 Act. 5.3</note> evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and lusts stirring in the heart: and from these arise evil words and deeds when any occasion is given.</p>
