            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Mr. Chairman;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ 3. This Order is the Ground of Our Complaint. There are ſundry Things in it which weſhall take Notice of, in order to entitle our ſelves to the Relief of this Honourable Houſe: The publick Intereſt of this Colony is greatly concerned in the Conſequences of this Order; and for our own Parts, we think it exceeding hard to be deprived of our Subſiſtance, meerly for having done our Duty.</p>
            <p>¶ 4. This a ſurprizing Thing to us, that the Gentlemen who made this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, could proceed the Length they have done. The good Opinion we were willing to entertain of them diſpoſed us to think, That they would never have done their Country and us ſo great an Injury. Could any Man have thought, that they would have <hi>denyed the Subject a Liberty to take an Exception to their Commiſſions, when his Right to do ſo, is ſo clearly founded in Reaſon and Law?</hi> He muſt be but little acquainted with the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> who could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly make a Doubt, <hi>Whether the Subject had ſuch a Right?</hi> But theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without Queſtion, had ſeen that Matter fully treated of in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Dam,</hi> in his Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Juſtices of the Supream Court, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>oceed in a Courſe of Equity. The Argument on that Head had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to one or both of them in Manuſcript, before the Day appointed for hearing thereof, and had been long printed before they made the aboveſaid Order. In that Argument, from <hi>page</hi> 14, to 35, <hi>the Right of the Subject to take
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003864_0004_100206CDC1772EE0"/>
ſuch Exception,</hi> is eſtabliſhed upon ſuch Principles as have not yet been ſhaken, nor do we ſuppoſe that the Reaſons and Authorities there offered will ever be anſwered. The Subſtance of what is there printed, would have been repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Caſe of <hi>Zenger,</hi> had not theſe Gentlemen thought fit to CONDEMN <hi>us and the Exceptions</hi> UNHEARD. This ſurprizing Method of Conduct, is not to be warranted by the Practice of any Country, but where ARBITRARY POWER prevails, and where TYRANTS rule and SLAVES obey. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable ſuch a Precedent, in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court of Juſtice is, and what is the plain Tendency of it among a free People, needs but little Penetration to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
            <p>¶ 5. Nothing can be more evident, than that by the Laws of <hi>England, the Subject may in all Courts plead to the Juriſdiction</hi> (12 <hi>Co.</hi> 53.) This was the Opinion of My Lord <hi>Coke</hi>; and if what that Oracle of the Law ſaid, was true, it cannot but be eſteemed a bold Act in our Judges, <hi>not only to deprive the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Right, but alſo to inflict one of the moſt ſevere Puniſhments, for their modeſtly claiming it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ 6. It is ſaid in Capt. <hi>Streater</hi>'s Caſe (<hi>State Tryals,</hi>

               <hi>Vol. 1. pag. 750.</hi>) That our Fore-fathers left us a Law, by which we might <hi>demand</hi> Juſtice, and not be neceſſitated to make uſe of Friends to beg Juſtice; and in Proof of it quotes <hi>Mirrour, Chap.</hi> 3. § 6. <q>of Exceptions to the Power of a Judge, thus it is, <hi>Sir. I demand the Hearing and Sight of your Commiſſion, by which you claim Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over me.</hi>

                  <hi>Anno 13 Edw. I. Chap. 3.</hi> When any Man is impleaded before any Juſtices, and doth alledge an Exception, praying that the Juſtices will allow it; which if they will not allow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall require the Juſtices to put to their Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lord (ſays Capt. <hi>Streater</hi>) this Law of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>a Law of Freedom and a Law of Freeme and not of Slaves</hi>; it is a Law that ſetleth a Right in its Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>¶ 7. Thus has the Law and Liberty of the People, been always underſtood to be in our Mother Country. And in the ſame Book and <hi>Chap.</hi> cited by Capt. <hi>Streater,</hi> (<hi>Mirrour Chap.</hi> 3. § 6.) it is further ſaid, <q>that the Party may plead thus: Sir, I appeal from this Commiſſion, becauſe it maketh no Mention of the Cauſe, for which I was brought to Judgment, or not of that Point; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe you have no Cognizance in ſuch a Point; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe it is vicious, and that may be divers Ways, as if it be not Sealed with the King's Seal of the Chancery; for none is tyed to yield Obedience, according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Realm, to the King's Privy Seal, or to the Seal of the Exchequer, nor unto any other Seal, but only to the Seal which is aſſigned to be known of the common People, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Juriſdictions and original Writs, if not for the King only. Or it may be vicious, becauſe the Seal is counterfeited or falſifyed; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the King is not named in the Writ, be not being out of the Kingdom, nor in Ward; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Writ containeth Summons in the Action where it is perſonal; <hi>or,</hi> Attachment where the Action is mixt or real; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Seal is not faſtned to the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but one may remove it, and take it from it at his Pleaſure; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Writ was brought too late, or too ſoon; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe it hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ure, or Interlining, and Diverſity of Hands and of Words, or falſe Latin; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Writ is written upon Paper, or Parchment which is forbidden; <hi>or,</hi> for Default found in the 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003864_0005_100206D009DEC390"/>
Writ, as the Omiſſion or Tranſpoſition of a Word, Syllable or Clauſe, as it is of abateable Writs; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the King dred before the Writ was brought; <hi>or,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Writ is falſe in the Day of the Date; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Commiſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the Aſſociation of one who is not preſent; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Writ was never ſealed; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Fact was not done within his Juriſdiction; <hi>or,</hi> in a Plea not there determinable; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe the Judge bath not Power or Conuſance, either of the Quality or the Quantity of the Thing. —</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſingle Authority proves, not only the Right of the Subject to take ſuch Exception to the Commiſſions of Judges; but alſo ſhews many Cauſes and Grounds for it. And what was here above 500 Years ago declared to be Law, was, in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Van Dam,</hi> proved by many Reaſons and Authorities, to have been the Law in all paſt Times; and alſo, that it ſtill is the Right of the Subject, and the Law of the Land to this very Day.</p>
            <p>¶ 8. But as the Cauſe of Mr. <hi>Van Dam</hi> was <hi>a Civil Cauſe,</hi> and the Examples there given, to prove the Right of the Subject to plead to the Juriſdiction, and to take Exception to a Judge's Commiſſion, are chiefly taken from <hi>Cauſes of the ſame Nature</hi>; therefore, to bring the Matter more home to the Caſe of our Client <hi>Zenger,</hi> we beg Leave to add here <hi>ſome modern Examples,</hi> even in <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Cauſes,</hi> that prove the ſame Point. And the ſame Examples will alſo clearly prove, that a Council's ſigning ſuch Plea, or Exception, which he thinks pertinent to his Client's Cauſe, cannot, conſiſtent with Reaſon or Law, be termed a CONTEMPT; as has groundleſsly been ſuggeſted againſt us in the aforeſaid Order.</p>
            <p>¶ 9. But we muſt firſt obſerve here, that it is a Rule in Pleading (as <hi>in Regula P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>itandi</hi> 56) That all ſpecial Pleas (which thoſe to the Juriſdiction particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly are) ought to be ſigned by Council, otherwiſe it is a ſufficient Objection againſt them, (which Rule is exemplified in <hi>State Tryals, Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 229. and in <hi>Vol.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 212, 213, 214.) From whence we may infer, that when a Plea to the Juriſdiction, made by the Advice of Council, is offered, or received, it conſequently is to be eſteemed ſigned by Council, tho' it is not expreſsly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to be ſigned by Council.</p>
            <p>¶ 10. The firſt modern Caſe we ſhall mention, is the Caſe of <hi>Fitzbarris (State Tryals, Vol.</hi> 3. 229) who, in the Year 1681, was indicted of High Treaſon. That Man offered to plead to the Juriſdiction of the King's Bench (whoſe Powers our Judge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſeem to claim by the common Law) but the Judges there were ſo far from thinking it a Contempt in him, to offer to plead to their Juriſdiction, that they aſſigned him ſeveral of the beſt Council in <hi>England</hi> to draw it, and gave him three Days Time for thoſe Council to draw that Plea in, which Plea thoſe Council drew, and brought it into the King's Bench, and prayed that it might be received, and it accordingly was received, and the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General demurred to it, and the Council for the Priſoner joyned in Demurrer.</p>
            <p>I believe none will ſay, that the Time in which this Example happened, was the moſt favourable to the Liberty of the Subject; yet even then it was look'd upon to be lawful to pread to the Juriſdiction of the King's Bench, the higheſt Court of Common Law of ordinary Juriſdiction in the Kingdom; and it was not eſteemed any Crime or CONTEMPT for a Lawyer to ſign and file ſuch Plea.</p>
            <p>¶ 11. A ſecond Example to this Purpoſe, is the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Delamere (State Tryals, Vol.</hi> 4. 212.) who was tryed for High Treaſon, in the Year 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003864_0006_1002082BC02CBD20"/>
1685. a Time when Arbitrary Power threatned the Deſtruction of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and which brought about that Revolution, which ſoon followed. In that Caſe the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> offered a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Lord High Steward, and the Peers commiſſioned to try him; but his Plea was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to, for want of Councils Hand to it; whereupon he prayed to have Council aſſigned him, to put it in Form, and to argue it, which was agreed to be allowed him, if he had them ready; the Lord High Steward ſaying, <hi>If the Lord</hi> Delamere <hi>inſiſts upon having his Council heard, it is not fit for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe bearing what they can ſay</hi>; and afterwards, <hi>If you inſiſt upon it to have your Council beard,</hi> GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD DENY IT! Upon which it may be obſerved, that tho' this was in the Year 1685. three Years before the Revolution, &amp; a very bad Time, yet even <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> then Lord High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, was ſo far from thinking Council criminal to ſign a Plca to the Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was allowed the Priſoner to get Council to do it, and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to, for being without Council's Hand; and leaſt it may be ſuppoſed he might be <hi>Guilty of Condemning unheard,</hi> he, even <hi>JEFFERYS,</hi> in an apparent <hi>Horror</hi> at ſuch a Thing, ſays, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould deny to hear his Council!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ 12. But if it ſhould be objected, that the Pleas in theſe two Caſes, were not to the Judges Commiſſions, nor to the Being of thoſe Courts, but tended only to <hi>ouſt</hi> or deprive thoſe Courts, of the Juriſdiction of thoſe particular Cauſes, we ſhall offer two other Examples.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1686, two Years before the Revolution, King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond erected High Commiſſion Courts, and made the Lord Chancellor <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> and other Inſtruments of Arbitrary Power, whoſe Names are now infamous, to be the Judges thereof; before which Court, by Virtue of one of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was cited, for not obeying the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſuſpend Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> for preaching againſt Popery. When the Biſhop appeared, he demanded a Copy of their Commiſſion. <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> told him, it was on Record, and to be bought for a Penny in every Coffee-Houſe in Town; the Biſhop ſaid, he had not ſeen it, and begged ſome Time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with Council what to anſwer; and they, <hi>even they,</hi> gave him a Week, and in five Days afterwards, he came and begged a Fortnight more, and they alſo gave it to him, to adviſe with Council. At the Time laſt appointed, the Biſhop came with four Council, and a Plea ready drawn, to their Juriſdiction, and offered that Plea; and the Biſhop ſaid, he was told, <hi>That to plead ſuch Plea, was a Right every one has to make uſe of, when he finds it for his Advantage,</hi> and ſays, my Council tell me, <hi>That Tour Proceedings in this Court are directly contrary to the Statute Law, and are here to plead it, if Tour Lordſhips will admit them.</hi> Upon which the Lord Chancellor <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> ſaid, <hi>We will neither hear Tour Lordſhip, nor Your Council, We are ſatisfied of the Legality of Our Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which it may be obſerved, That tho' thoſe Council had adviſed, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were ready to argue in ſupport of that Plea to their Juriſdiction, which was to their Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſſions and whole Power; yet it does not appear, that even this infamous Chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>llor <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> gave them the leaſt harſh Word, for ſo doing (tho', to his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>petual Shame, he refuſed to hear the Biſhop or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to that Plea,) but admitted thoſe Council afterwards to argue upon the Merits of the Cauſe. This appears by <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. of <hi>Kennet's</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>England, pag..</hi> 458. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>State Tryals, Vol.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 846. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Hiſtory of the Reign of the <hi>Stewards,</hi> 711.</p>
            <p>¶ 13. The ſecond of theſe Examples is in the Year 1687. one year before the Revolution, before the High Commiſſioners, Chancellor <hi>JEFFERYS,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003864_0007_1002082DEB75BB80"/>
others: The Caſe was thus; King <hi>James</hi> the 2d commanded the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> to admit <hi>a Papiſt</hi> to the Degree of <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> which they refuſed to do; and for that Contempt were cited before the High Commiſſion. They appeared by their Vice Chancellor, and eight of their Senate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Vice Chancellor <hi>prayed, and bad Time to anſwer, with Leave to put the Anſwer in Writing, and with Council, and by what Council be pleaſed.</hi> At the Time appointed they pleaded to the Juriſdiction of the Court, both as to that particular Caſe they were cited for, and as to the whole Power of the Court, by ſetting forth the Act of 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, that enacted, that no ſuch Court as that ſhould be afterwards held. Which Plca was received, and read, and when read, the Chancellor <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> aſked, if it was ſigned? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was anſwered, <hi>Tes My Lord</hi>; and then the Matter was taken into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for a Week: But it appears not by this Caſe, that even that wicked Man, the Chancellor <hi>JEFFERYS,</hi> ever ſo much as thought, that thoſe Council acted amiſs, for adviſing or ſigning of that, or the former Plea in the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Caſe: Tho' in the laſt Caſe, to the ſhame of that Court, <hi>JEFFERYS</hi> pronounced the Judgment of it, which was, <hi>That, as a Mark of His Majeſty's and their Lordſhips</hi> DISPLEASURE, <hi>they thought fit to appoint, that the Vice Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor ſhould be thenceforth deprived of that Office.</hi> All which appears in the 4<hi>th Vol.</hi> of the <hi>State Tryals,</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 250. to 259.</p>
            <p>¶ 14. Theſe Authorities, with what is referred to in the Argument of Mr. <hi>Van Dam</hi>'s Council, are a full Proof, that it is by Law the Right of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to take Exception, either to the Juriſdiction of the Court, or the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Judge. And if this be the Right of the Subject, how conſiſtent is it with the GREAT CHARTER to deny it to him? It is ſaid there, <hi>Nulli negabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nulli differemus Juſtitiam vel Rectum. We will deny no Man, we will delay to no Man, Juſtice or Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Law was made our Birth-Right (ſee My Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Comment. upon 2<hi>d Inſt.</hi> 56.) And to obſerve this Law, not only the King, at His Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but all his Judges of Common Law, are or ought to be ſworn. And if this is the Subjects Right, what Judge, without Violation of his Oath, can deny it? And how can it, conſiſtent with either Reaſon, Law or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, be termed <hi>a CONTEMPT</hi> to claim that Right? Or for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to ſign and file Exceptions in Conſequence of that Right?</p>
            <p>¶ 15. In the next Place we obſerve, that the Suggeſtion, in the ſaid Order, <hi>That the Exception denys the Being of the Supream Court,</hi> is altogether without Truth and groundleſs. Had the Supream Court no other Foundation than the Judges Commiſſions, there might have been ſome Truth in that Suggeſtion. In ſuch Caſe, to deny the Lawfulneſs of their Commiſſions, would be to deny the Being of the Court: But it is well known, that the Being of the Supream Court has a quite different Foundation.</p>
            <p>¶ 16. It was, till lately, underſtood to have been founded on Ordinances, ſeveral of which have been made from Time to Time, either to give or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue its Being, the laſt of which was publiſhed in the Supream Court, in the Preſence, and by Order, of theſe Gentlemen, and bears date no longer ago than the 19<hi>th March,</hi> in the ſixth Year of His preſent Majeſty's Reign. But ſuppoſe it to exiſt or have its being <hi>by the Common Law,</hi> as ſome have lately imagined, and which ſeems to be Mr. Chief Juſtice's Opinion (ſee his Charge to the Grand Jury of 15<hi>th January,</hi> 1733. <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> — [whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph to] — <hi>now.)</hi> Yet in either Caſe, it doth not derive its Being from 
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003864_0008_1002065677A56838"/>
the Commiſſions of the Judges, but wholly from <hi>the Ordinance,</hi> or <hi>Common Law</hi>; and therefore to deny the Lawfulneſs of their Commiſſions, cannot, conſiſtent either with Truth or Reaſon, be called <hi>a Denyal of the Being of the Supream Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ 17. Now the Exceptions deny only the Legality of the Judges Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and neither affirm or deny any Thing, with reſpect to the Supream Court. But both ſpecial Matter pleaded, and the Concluſion, are expreſs to that Commiſſion, whereof Hearing was given, as will appear to any one that reads them. We inſiſted, that the Exceptions did not deny the being of the Supream Court, at the Time that the Order was publiſhed, and tho' Mr. <hi>De Lancey</hi> was pleaſed then to acknowledge (with great Truth) That the Court might well exiſt, tho' the Commiſſions of the Judges were unlawful; yet when we prayed, that the Order might be amended in that Point, our Requeſt was not granted, but the Order was ſuffered to remain as it had been entred. Which Conduct in theſe Gentlemen, firſt in declaring that the Exception <hi>denyed the Being of the Supream Court,</hi> when <hi>it did not,</hi> and making it a Ground of ſo ſevere a Sentence; and afterwards, when this Matter was objected to them, and it was admitted, That the Court might exiſt, tho' all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions were unlawful (which of it ſelf plainly implys, that the Denial of the Legality of the Commiſſions, was no <hi>Denial of the Being of the Supream Court</hi>) we ſay, after all this, ſtill to continue that Suggeſtion, ſo plainly repugnant to Truth, as a Reaſon of their Sentence, carries with it a more heavy Imputation, than we wiſh we had Occaſion to take Notice of.</p>
            <p>¶ 18. Again, in the next place, we would humbly aſk, whether any Thing can be more Arbitrary, than theſe Gentlemen's pretending to make the Notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> to be the Rule of our Conduct? Is not, or rather, ought not the Law to be the only Rule of their and our Duty? Indeed, had they received their Commiſſions from the <hi>French</hi> King, who aſſigns no other Reaſons for his Mandates, Writs, or Commands, than, <hi>Car tel eſt notre Plaiſir,</hi> or <hi>for ſuch is our Pleaſure</hi>; they might in this Point have been excuſed by the Example of their Maſter, and the Arbitrarineſs of his Government. But for Judges, pretending to act by Commiſſion from the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who could give no Authority, but to act according to Law, and who themſelves were, or ought to have been ſworn, to judge according to that Rule; for them, we ſay, to ſet up their <hi>Pleaſure or Diſpleaſure,</hi> as a Rule of Conduct, in the Supream Court of Common Law in this Country, and avowedly to make that any part of the Reaſon of ſo ſevere a Sentence, we believe is not to be paralleled by one Example within the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, unleſs in ſuch Reigns as that of King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond, and in ſuch Courts as the <hi>High Commiſſion Court,</hi> or <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> and by ſuch Judges as the cruel <hi>JEFFERYS,</hi> and others, whoſe Names will be tranſmitted to the lateſt Poſterity with Infamy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. What can be more aſtoniſhing in a free Country, than for Judges in the Seat of Juſtice, executing the moſt ſacred Truſt that is delegated by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who in the Execution of their Offices, ought to be diveſted of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives either from <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Diſpleaſure, Favour</hi> or <hi>Fear</hi>; who cannot ſuffer the leaſt Mixture of theſe, to ſway their Judgments, or influence their Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, without Violation of their Oath and ſacred Truſt; for Men, under ſuch ſolemn Obligations, to do right to every Man, according to Law, for ſuch Men, to make either their <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> the Rule of their Conduct! — to own it without Bluſhing or Remorſe! — nay, to record it in the Supream Court of this Province, as a Reaſon of ſo ſevere a Sentence! — It ſeems to us ſo ſhocking as to leave no Room for an Apology!</p>

¶ 19. Theſe Gentlemen have been ſo unhappy, as either to have no Precedent to warrant their Proceedings, or, only ſuch as are taken from the worſt of Men, in the worſt of Times. The Biſhop of <hi>London's</hi> Exception, or Plea to the Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the High Commiſſion Court, was indeed <hi>rejected</hi> and <hi>condemned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> aſſigned as a Reaſon of that Sentence.</hi> Doctor <hi>Fairfax,</hi> a Fellow of a Colledge at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for <hi>vive voce</hi> (not by Council) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Authority of the High Commiſſioners, boldly to their Faces in Court, was firſt ſuſpended, and afterwards when no Arts or Threats, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private, could perſwade or force him to ſubmit to their Authority, they <hi>ſtruck out his Name from among the Fellows of the Colledge,</hi> and gave this for Reaſon of their ſo doing, <hi>viz. For as much as you have denyed the Authority of the Court, and have refuſed to obey the Biſhop of</hi> Oxon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe are the neareſt Precedents that we have hitherto found of ſuch Proceedings. But he muſt be a great Stranger to the Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> who does not know how the Injuſtice of theſe Proceedings was reſented, and what an Influence they had upon the Revolution which ſoon followed: Yet in neither of the Caſes cited, were the Council ſilenced or debarred of their Practice, for ſigning ſuch Pleas or Exceptions. In <hi>this Point,</hi> our Judges ſeem to have acted beyond Example, and have done, perhaps, what no Judge of Common Law ever ventured to do before.</p>
            <p>¶ 20. Theſe Gentlemen, in <hi>that Point,</hi> we believe are truly an Original; they ſeem to have found out ſome new Law for this Young Country, and ſuch as its ancient Mother Country has never heard of: They will not ſuffer their Commiſſions to be diſputed or tryed, whether they are legal or not, tho' the Law requires their Commiſſions to be publiſhed, and the Hearing thereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for that very End: Indeed in this they acted not without a Precedent; The High Commiſſion Judges, and ſome others that we could mention, acted in the ſame Manner. Sometime our Judges can ſay, that they have their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>by the Law,</hi> (ſee Mr. <hi>De Lancy's Charge,</hi> 15<hi>th January,</hi> 1733.) But then they inſiſt upon it, that we ſhould take their Word for it, for they will let no Man examine that Point but themſelves.</p>
            <p>¶ 21. Is not this in conſequence to ſay, <hi>We know our Authority to be ſo good, that We are incapable of erring in that Point? We know We are ſo impartial, tho' in our own Caſe, that all the Proviſions for Appeal to ſuperiour Judges, as to Us in this Point, are impertinent, needleſs and uſeleſs; and to Doubt of this, and to claim the Means of Appeal, which is the Right of the Subject from all other Judges (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>¶ 22. Thus the Right and Liberty of the Subject, in one of its moſt effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Articles, is broke in upon; and that Remedy, which, by Law, is in every Man's Power, againſt an illegal Authority, entirely taken away: For, if a Commiſſion iſſue to try my Life, not according to the Law of the Land, but by the Diſcretion or will of my Judges, and I may not except to that Commiſſion, and ſhew it to be unlawful, what Security have I by the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> that I ſhall not looſe my Life, but by the Verdict of my Peers? If a Commiſſion Iſſue to take away my Eſtate, by the Diſcretion or Pleaſure of a Court, if I may not except to that Commiſſion, and ſhew it to be illegal, what Security can I have of a Tryal by Jury, and the Law of the Land? Many ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions 
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003864_0010_100265B7AA0877B0"/>
as theſe have iſſued in Times paſt, witneſs the Commiſſions to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Council of the North, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 243.) which have produced much Rum and Confuſion in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. What has been may be, and in all Probability will be, if the Example our Judges have given be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſequence. And if ſuch a Commiſſion ſhould iſſue what Security has the Subject againſt being utterly ruined by it, if he may not be allowed his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And if he cannot take ſuch Exception, but by the Help of a Lawyer, and his Lawyer cannot defend him againſt ſuch illegal Commiſſion, but with the Loſs of his Livelihood, and the Ruin of his Family; how deplorable muſt the Caſe of the Subject be? How deſtitute and helpleſs! For what Lawyer will dare to undertake his Defence? And what Motive can induce him to it, when he knows. That the very Attempt to ſerve his Client, will have no other Effect than his own Ruin? What a Wound is given by this <hi>Arbitrary Proceeding,</hi> to the Liberties of this Country! In conſequence of this Proceeding, Life, Liberty and Eſtate, are at once ſeized into the Hands of <hi>Arbitrary Power:</hi> For if the <hi>beſt Commiſſion</hi> upon Earth is not to be diſputed, and Lawyers muſt be ſilenced for daring to attempt it, then the very <hi>worſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in the World may ſoon be obtruded upon a People. For, if it be a Crime to except to a <hi>good Commiſſion,</hi> and ſo grievous a Penalty is annexed to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, who will dare to except to a <hi>bad one,</hi> when no Man can know, but the Judge may declare the moſt <hi>illegal Commiſſion</hi> to be <hi>good</hi>? Such were the <hi>High Commiſſions</hi> granted in 1686, by King <hi>James</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> two Years before the Revolution, and ſuch were they declared to be, by the Stature that gave King <hi>William</hi> the Crown.

                  </gap>ght alſo to have been ſaid.— And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards excepted to Judge <hi>Philipſe's</hi> Commiſſion, ſoon after the Date of it, for Perſons nearby the ſame with theſe in <hi>Zenger's</hi> Exception.</note> We adviſed it then, becauſe we thought that Exception neceſſary for his Safety, and the Good of the Country.</p>
            <p>¶ 25. We adviſed <hi>Zenger's</hi> Exception for the like Reaſon; but we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways omitted it, where we ſaw our Clients Safety did not require it. Mr. <hi>Van Dam's</hi> Exception would not be of any Service to Mr. <hi>Zenger,</hi> nor will Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Exception be of any Service to any one that ſhall hereafter be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the ſame Manner, unleſs ſuch Perſon will take ſuch Exception in his own particular Caſe. We ever thought it lawfull for any of our Clients, to bring the Commiſſions of the Judges to the Touchſtone of the Law: But we never thought it ſo neceſſary as in this Caſe. We conceived the Innocency of our Client, no ſufficient Security, while we eſteemed the Governour his Proſecutor, who had his Judges in his Power. We had too much Reaſon for Caution from the Conduct of the Chief Juſtice. We heard, how His Honour had vented his Diſpleaſure againſt him, when he accidentally met him in the Streets, on a <hi>Sunday</hi> before his Arreſt. We had been near Witneſſes to ſundry warm Charges, and moving Addreſſes, to ſeveral Grand Juries, plainly levelled againſt <hi>Zenger,</hi> and with Intention to procure his Country to Indict him. And we ſaw his Name amongſt that Committee of Council, which conferred with a Committee of this Houſe, in order to procure a Concurrence to condemn ſome of <hi>Zenger's Journals,</hi> without giving him an Opportunity to defend them. We heard that the Chief Juſtice was a principal Manager upon that Conference, and ſpoke much on that Occaſion. We ſaw his Name among thoſe who iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Order of the Council, which commanded the Magiſtrates of this City to attend the Burning of ſome of thoſe <hi>Journals</hi>; and which ſets forth, <hi>that they bad been condemned by the Council to be burnt by the Hands of the common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> We much doubted of the Legality of theſe Extraordinary Proceedings, of the Chief Juſtice, and the Reſt of the Council. We ſaw the Chief Juſtice's Name, among th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, who iſſued that Extraordinary Warrant, by which our Client was apprehended. We had ſeen his Want of Moderation, in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Security in <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds,</hi> when <hi>Zenger</hi> was brought before him, on his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> tho' the Act only required Bail to be taken, <hi>according to the Quality of the Priſoner, and the Nature of the Offence,</hi> and tho' at the ſame Time, the poor Man had made Oath before him, <hi>That be was not worth Forty Pounds, beſides the Tools of his Trade, and Apparel.</hi> We had heard the Chief Juſtice declare, in the fulleſt Court we had then ever ſeen in that Place, <hi>That if a Jury found Zenger Not Guilty, they would be perjured</hi>; or Words to that Effect; and even this before any Information in Form was lodged againſt him, As for Juſtice <hi>Philipſe,</hi> we had been sold, how vigorous and Active he had been, in the General Aſſembly, to procure the Concurrence of that Houſe, with the Council, in the Order for burning of <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Papers; even before they were legally Condemned; and Addreſſing the Governour to iſſue a Proclamation, with Promiſe of Reward for the Diſcovery of the Writers of them; and in an Order for Proſecuting the poor Printer. We wiſh we had no Occaſion to repeat theſe Things, to ſhew the Motives of our Conduct; had we not been obliged thereto, In Order to vindicate our ſelves we had much rather that they had been buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003864_0012_100265BC068A7428"/>
in Silence: But under theſe many Forewarnings, what could we, what ought we to do for our Client? Surely every Thing that was lawfull and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to contribute to his Safety. And in taking the Exception, we conceived ſome Benefit would accrue: For, had the Exception been allowed, the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Judges on the Governour (which we thought dangerous to our Client) would be in ſome Meaſure removed, and the Judges have ſtood more indifferent between the real Parties; Had it been over-ruled, yet we had Reaſon to think, that it might have proved ſome Check to an exorbitant Stretch of Power; becauſe, That if in the <hi>dernier RESORT,</hi> the Commiſſions had been judged illegal, any Abuſe offered, after Exception taken, might have rendered the Judges, not only civilly, but criminally, anſwerable for their Conduct.</p>
            <p>¶ 26. Thus either Way, ſome Advantage was expected, which would have been entirely loſt, if the Validity of the Commiſſions had been admitted, by pleading to the Merits of the Cauſe, without taking the Exception. Hence, with a ſincere Regard to the Safety of the Poor Man, whoſe Cauſe we had undertaken, we adviſed, and ſigned, and filed the Exceptions. And had we done otherwiſe, our Conſciences muſt have reproached us, with a Breach of Truſt, and Neglect of Duty: Yet neither the Lawfullneſs of the Action, nor the Uprightneſs of our Intention, could ſcreen us from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of theſe Gentlemen. We might have been innocently miſtaken, in ſuppoſing an Exception would lye, when it would not, or for Cauſes not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; and by Law ſhould have deſerved no Cenſure for offering them. The Buſineſs of the Judges in ſuch Caſe would have only been, to have over-ruled our Exceptions, and ſaved us the Benefit of them, in the laſt Reſort, if we had thought they would have been of Service to us. But in this Caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Exceptions were valid or not, was no Ways determined. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was in <hi>offering any Exception at all,</hi> and it is for this only that we are Sufferers. The honeſt Defence of Our Client in that Point, was Crime enough with theſe Judges, to merit what's next to a Capital Puniſhment. A reſpectful Propoſal of a Matter of Law to their Judgment, that had a Tendency to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lawleſs Power, was by theſe Gentlemen treated, as Cauſe ſufficient, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us at once of the Fruits of many Years hard and laborious Study, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs us of an extenſive and profitable Practice.</p>
            <p>¶ 27. It was then full <hi>two and Thirty</hi> Years, ſince one of us had firſt applied to the Study of the Law (a Time near equal to the whole Age of either of theſe Judges) and who for ſeveral Years had been one of the oldeſt Practitioners at the Barr here; the other of us did not want <hi>two</hi> Months of <hi>Ten</hi> Years ſtanding there, and had had a good Share of Practice for ſeveral Years, before either of theſe Judges were known to have had any Knowledge of the Law, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have made it any Part of their Study. What hath been our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Reputation for Ability, of Integrity, in our Practice, and Morals, belongs not to us to declare: But we hope, our being employed in almoſt all the Cauſes within this Colony, of any Importance, that have depended for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, may, as to thoſe Points, in ſome Meaſure, witneſs in our Favour. Yet no Regard to our Age, to the Experience of ſo long Practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to our Innocency, our Integrity, or Abilities; no Concern for the Intereſt of our Clients, who had a Right to our Aſſiſtance; nor the publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, which demanded our Help; no Tenderneſs or Compaſſion for our Wives, our many Children, with which it hath pleaſed God to bleſs us, which as well as our ſelves, had a Right to be provided for, by our honeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003864_0013_100265BDD0AEF730"/>
could withhold and reſtrain theſe Gentlemen, from exerciſing the moſt ſevere Act of Power, that perhaps has been ever committed.</p>
            <p>¶ 28. We have not in all our Reading found, and believe theſe Gentlemen cannot produce, any Example of ſuch a Conduct, from the Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> in the worſt of Times. They may indeed produce Examples of Silencing Attornies, for notorious Villany, or Ignorance, in their Profeſſion. They may poſſibly alſo find ſome, and but few Examples of doing the like for other Grimes; as for Inſtance, one <hi>Brown,</hi> convicted of Lybelling, was fined 1000 Marks, and ſtruck out of the Roll of Attornies: But (becauſe this Crime being neither Villany nor Ignorance in his Profeſſion) the Injuſtice of that Part of the Sentence was taken Notice of by the Houſe of Commons, and for that, among other Arbitrary Acts, as the Hindring the Publiſhing of a weekly News Paper, and putting People to their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be bailed, without juſt Cauſe, and diſcountenancing the People in Petitioning the King for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They, in 1680, reſolved to impeach the Judges, and did impeach Chief Juſtice <hi>Scrogs,</hi> the moſt guilty Perſon, and had they not been prorogued, and Chief Juſtice <hi>Scrogs</hi> diſplaced, and another put in his Room, before the Houſe ſat again, they probably would have proſecuted their Impeachment againſt him.</p>
            <p>¶ 29. <hi>America</hi> poſſibly may furniſh ſome Examples of the Silencing of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies, as, we have heard, did happen in the Caſe of one Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> in <hi>Parha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> who was ſilenced by Governour <hi>Louther,</hi> a Man famous, not for his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and we have heard that Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> recovered ſeveral Thouſand Pounds Damages in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> for that Arbitrary Act.</p>
            <p>¶ 30.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <p>Note that the Information we had of thoſe Circumſtances in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Letters, in this Paragraph, was not true; but the Paragraph will be, as we believe, agreeable to Truth, after the <hi>Italick</hi> Words are ſtruck out.</p>
                  <p>We have been ſince informed, that it was the Aſſembly of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Jerſey</hi> that complained of Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> and that Coll. <hi>Morris</hi> (then one of that Aſſembly) was the Drawer of the Complaint, and alſo that be went to <hi>England,</hi> againſt a then former Go ernour, at his own Expence, and was ſucceſsfull; which Facts, we believe, gave riſe to the Miſtake in the Information we had of this Matter, and which Information we believed to be true, at the Times of our Complaint.</p>
               </note> We have heard alſo that Mr. GOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON was by the Lord CORNBURY ſilenced in NEW-JERSEY, when he was Governour of that and this Province, and that this Injury done to Mr. GORDON, made one of the Articles of Complaint againſt that Governour, <hi>which Coll. MORRIS took a Voyage to ENGLAND, at his own Expence to exhibit againſt him</hi>; at a Time when this Country groaned under the Weight of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Proceedings of that Governour and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; at which Time the People were made to diſpair of Relief, by Reaſon of his great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; And what was more, his being firſt Couſin to the then reigning Queen; But <hi>Coll. MORRIS proved ſucceſsful, not withſtanding all the Difficulties be bad to ſurmount: For,</hi> upon the Articles exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>by him</hi> to Queen ANNE, againſt this Her near Relation, he was turned out with Diſgrace; Queen ANNE declaring, That it ſhould never be ſaid, that ſhe would countenance, even her neareſt Relations, in oppreſſing her People; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Nobility, his great Intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> his near Relation, to the Queen, did protect him, from the legal Suits of the Subjects here, whom he had injured. Upon which Suits, he lay near three Years in the Cuſtody of the Sheriff of NEW-YORK, after the End of his Tyranny, as much deſpiſed as he had before been dreaded.</p>
            <p>¶ 31. We believe this Province can afford no Example of ſuch a Treatment, tho' there had been the ſame Occaſion for it before this Time. We remember that in the Year 1725, in the Caſe between the <hi>French</hi> Church and Mr. <hi>Ron,</hi>

Yet, tho' he over-ruled our Exception, he did not ſilence, or give us ſo much as a harſh Word, but heard all we had to ſay in Support of the Plea, before he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled it. Again, in the Cafe of Mr. <hi>Philipſe,</hi> at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Quinby</hi> and others, about the ſame Time; tho' Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> after the Hearing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the Decree, offered an Exception to the Power of His ſaid Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, to judge or decree as Chancellor, who patiently heard all that Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> had to ſay in Support of it; yet Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> did not ſilence Mr. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> or teſtify the leaſt Reſentment of his Conduct in that Particular; but ſaid, <hi>be was ſorry, that be bad not made the Exception, before Mr.</hi> Philipſe <hi>bad ſichmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Juriſdiction of the Court, and if be bad, that it ſhould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and bad its due Weight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ 32. Though theſe Gentlemen, of whom we complain, may ſay, <hi>That theſe Things were done before they had any Standing in the Law, or pretended to have ſtudied it:</hi> Yet they could not but have heard of theſe Caſes, their neareſt Relations having been, in ſome Meaſure, concerned in one or other of them. And tho' ſome Things done at that Day, gave ſome Diſſatisfaction, yet the Mildneſs of that Adminiſtration, in theſe Particulars, will be a ſtanding Evidence of the Unhappineſs of the preſent Times, into which we are fallen.</p>
            <p>¶ 33. We ſhall only add here, that in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Van Dam,</hi> on two ſeveral Occaſions, tho' Exceptions were ſigned by Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> as well as our ſelves, and tho' indeed we had no Reaſon to boaſt of the kindeſt Uſage from the two <hi>puiſne</hi> Judges, upon theſe Occaſions; yet they did not think fit to take away our Bread from us, for thoſe Pieces of Service done to our Client. We would aſk theſe Gentlemen, <hi>If it was not juſt to ſilence Mr.</hi> Chambers <hi>and us then, what has made it lawful and juſt for them to ſilence us in the preſent Caſe? And if it was juſt, to ſilence us for ſigning and filing the Exception for</hi> Zenger, <hi>why did they not ſilence Mr.</hi> Chambers <hi>and us, for ſigning and filing the Exceptions for Mr.</hi> Van Dam? Theſe Gentlemen would do well to reconcile their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in theſe two Caſes.</p>
            <p>¶ 34. That we were perfectly innocent, and did our Duty in the Caſe of <hi>Zenger,</hi> is what we have the cleareſt Senſe of. That the Law was with us, <hi>in the Right of the Subject to take an Exception,</hi> is what we will ſtedfaſtly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and challenge theſe Gentlemen to prove the Contrary. Had we err'd; muſt a Man looſe his Livelihood for an innocent Miſtake? Muſt his Brains be beat out, becauſe they are not caſt in the ſame Mould with another Man's? Had we been guilty of a <hi>Contempt,</hi> as is groundleſsly pretended; is there no Proportion between Offences? Is there no Diſtinction between Puniſhments? Muſt we be put to ſtarve, or to ſeek our Bread in a new Country, or in a new Manner of Life, for one Contempt? If theſe Things are to be tolerated, and to eſcape a publick Rebuke, and a private Recompenſe, hard will be the Caſe of Lawyers, who are ſworn, <hi>To uſe their Offices according to their Learning and Diſcretion.</hi> Yet, by this Rule, we muſt not be permitted the Uſe of either. Inſtead of conſulting our Law Books, and doing what we think conſiſtent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, for the Benefit of our Clients, we muſt ſtudy in GREAT MEN'S CAUSES, only <hi>what will PLEASE the Judges, and what will moſt flatter Men in Power.</hi> Inſtead of doing, what our Honour and a good Conſcience, and our Client's Safety demand of us, we muſt do only <hi>what will leaſt hazard the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Support of our Families, and ſave our ſelves, om Wives and our Children, from</hi> 
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003864_0015_100265C170555250"/>
               <hi>Starving.</hi> Is this a Condition fit for theſe to continue in, whoſe Buſineſs it is to defend the Rights of the People? If the <hi>Lawyers</hi> are not ſafe in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Duty, can their <hi>Clients</hi> be ſafe in Truſting them? If we are to be <hi>Slaves,</hi> is it poſſible that the Country can be <hi>free?</hi> Surely, never was an Act of Oppreſſion, under the Colour of Law, ever done within this Colony, that cryed louder for the Animadverſion and ſevere Reſentment of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of a free People than this!</p>
            <p>¶ 35. Theſe Judges might, with as much Juſtice, have burnt all our Law Books, as to have deprived us of the Uſe of them; and have deſtroyed our Deeds, and taken away our Houſes and our Lands, as to have taken away the Liberty of Exerciſing our Employments, which were as dearly bought as any Thing we enjoy. We came not to them but by the Way of an expenſive Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſeveral Languages, Arts and Sciences; our Abilities for them were the Purchaſe of many Years hard and coſtly Labour; we were duly admitted to our Practice, we ever uſed it with Fidelity and a good Conſcience, and with what Acceptance, and Eſteem of our Country, we doubt not but that a Thouſand Witneſſes can declare. What we had thus gotten, could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be taken from us, but for ſome notorious Crime, which our worſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hitherto have not laid to our Charge. And we may venture to ſay, that we ſtill have, notwithſtanding the Act of theſe Juſtices, as much Right to live and maintain our Families by our Callings, as any Merchant, Huſbandman or Tradesman in the Country. And we have as good a Title to be relieved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Injury done to that Right, as any other Men. It would doubtleſs have been eſteemed a crying Grievance, if theſe Gentlemen had ordered the Warehouſe of any Merchant in Town to be ſtopped up, and diſabled him from any farther carrying on of his Trade, whereby he ſupported and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Family; or if they had ordered the Farm and Inſtruments of Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to be taken from any Huſbandman in the Country, or if we ſuppoſe that they had only diſabled him from Improving his Lands, and raiſing Bread for himſelf and his Family; if they had block'd up the Way to a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's Mill, or broke down his Dam, and hindred him from grinding; if they had taken away the Tools of a Carpenter, or ſhut up a Tanner's Pits, and ſpoiled his Leather; and reduced theſe Men with their Wives and Children to a Neceſſity of Periſhing for Want of Subſiſtance; and all this, not for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done any unlawful Act, but, for doing their Duty, and that which they were bound to perform by all poſſible Obligations, both ſacred and humane: We ſay, if our Judges had done all or any of theſe things, the Injuſtice of ſuch Proceedings would have lain open to every Man's Obſervation; but no leſs than all this is contained in the Injury of which we complain, and much more, in that not only our ſelves and our innocent Families are great Sufferers, but the publick Adminiſtration of Juſtice is greatly obſtructed, and great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Perſons, who are our Clients, are much injured, either in the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or Defence of their juſt Rights by this Arbitrary Proceeding, and we doubt not, but that it has appeared to a Demonſtration, from what has been ſaid, that the Act of theſe Judges in debarring us from our Practice, meerly for having tendered an Exception to their Commiſſions, is alſo, in its Nature and Tendency, deſtructive to the Liberties and Properties of the People of this Colony.</p>
            <p>¶ 36. We are clearly of Opinion, that when Judges act uprightly and do juſtly, they have a Right to all the Honour due to their Stations: But when they act otherwiſe, in plain Defiance of Common Law and Common Senſe, 
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003864_0016_10020659DF3DA288"/>
the injured have a Right to complain; and if the Injury be of a publick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have a Right to demand the Aid of the Repreſentatives of a free People againſt them.</p>
            <p>¶ 37. Perhaps theſe Gentlemen, who have done us this Wrong, and whom we accuſe of having greatly injured their Country thereby, may buoy up themſelves in their Wealth, their Power, their Friends, and Alliances, and may think, that under the Umbrage of theſe, they may do what they p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               </gap>, and not be called to any Account.</p>
            <p>¶ 38. But, Mr. <hi>Chairman,</hi> no Man is too great for the Notice or above the Reach, of the Repreſentatives of a free People. If our General Aſſembly will but exert that Authority that they have, by Law, a Right to, they may make the haughtieſt Sinner tremble before them; an Inquiry into the Conduct of publick Officers is properly their Buſineſs; and a publick Reſentment of their Miſconduct (permit us to ſay it) is moſt certainly their Duty.</p>
            <p>¶ 39. The Parliament in <hi>England</hi> has always been thought the proper Court to animadvert on the Miſconduct of the Judges. In ſtead of repeating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But we humbly requeſt, that this Houſe would come to ſuch Reſolutions upon this Caſe, as they ſhall think juſt and neceſſary, for the Preſervation of the Rights and Liberties of the People; that ſuch Meaſures may be taken, as, that we may be reſtored to the Liberty of our Practice; that our Clients may have that Service from us, which they have a Right to demand; and the Publick Adminiſtration of Juſtice, that Help which we are able to afford; and that we may have the Means of common Juſtice, for Recovering ſuch Damages from theſe Gentlemen as we have ſuffered, or ſhall ſuffer, until we are reſtored to our Employments.</p>
            <p>¶ 42. Theſe Things, by Law, we think we have an undoubted Right to demand; and as Members of the Community repreſented in this General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, we conceive we have a Right to have redreſs'd in this Way; and have no reaſonable Proſpect of ſpeedy Relief in any other. If we had, we ſhould not have waited for the Sitting of the General Aſſembly. We deſire nothing from this honourable Houſe, which is not in their Power to beſtow, and which, from the Juſtneſs of our Cauſe, we hope we have the higheſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect. We truſt that no Power or Intereſt (<hi>that we expect will be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to us</hi>) will be able to ſmother or ſtifle our Complaint, or delay the Relief we ſeek for. The Duty that we owe to our Country, our Clients, and our Families, demanded this Application. And if we have any Ways err'd in the Matter or Manner of it, we hope the Importance of the Cauſe, and our great Sufferings, will excuſe it.</p>
            <p>¶ 43. 'Tis not long ſince one of us, had the Honour to be called upon, to give an Opinion upon an important Point before this Houſe; what Influence that Service may have had upon the Cauſe of the preſent Complaint, is hard for us to determine; but our Hope is, that our Country, whoſe Good we have always ſincerely conſulted;
<note n="*" place="margin">Here Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that that Opinion was demanded and given upon his <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi>
               </note> and as we have been called upon, have publickly ſerved, will not deny us its Protection, nor ſuffer us to be cruſhed for our faithful Adherence to its Intereſts and honeſt Diſcharge of our Duty.</p>
