            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO weep over the tomb of the patriot—to drop a tear to the memory of thoſe unfortunate citizens, who fell the firſt ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to tyranny and uſurpation is noble, generous and humane. Such are the ſentiments that influence you, my countrymen, or why through ſucceſſive periods, with heartfelt ſenſations, have you attended this ſolemn anniverſary, and paid this ſad tribute to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your ſlaughter'd brethren. Nor is the circle contracted—The moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the creation ſhare the grief, and, ſoft pity beaming in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, like <hi>the daughters of Iſrael,</hi> annually lament the fate of others, and weep over the miſeries of their country. <note n="†" place="bottom">Judges 11th, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To commemorate the deaths of thoſe men who fell unhappy victims to bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal violence—To ſhow the dangerous tendency of ſtanding armies in populous cities in time of peace, the origin of this fatal cataſtrophe—to trace its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and effects, as they have been, and are now diſplay'd, in different parts of America, I take to be the deſign of this day's ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>It appears to me needleſs to enter into the nature and ends of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to evince that ſtanding armies are a ſoleciſm in ſuch a conſtitution. Such ſentiments are founded in nature, and have for ages, under different forms, and different meridians, been fully diſplay'd by men who knew the rights of nature and mankind. The names of LOCK, SYDNEY &amp; HAMPDEN have long been illuſtrious, and my countrymen are too well acquainted with their writings, not to venerate their memories. Nor can I forget the ſame ſentiments which have charm'd you from the lips of men, who have ſpoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me on the ſame occaſion, whoſe characters will be ever dear, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of whoſe patriotiſm and virtue exhibited in the moſt critical ſituations, poſterity will ever wonder at and revere.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, to confirm this point by logical concluſions muſt be an uſeleſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe of time. Even a crown lawyer, whoſe ſentiments are not always friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the rights of mankind will tell us, <q>In a land of liberty, it is extremely
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015725_0005_0F9B2AAF50452558"/>dangerous to make a diſtinct order of the profeſſion of arms. In abſolute monarchies this is indeed neceſſary for the <hi>ſafety of the prince,</hi> and ariſes from the <hi>main principle</hi> of their conſtitution, which is, governing <hi>by fear:</hi> but in free ſtates, the profeſſion of a ſoldier, taken <hi>ſingly</hi> and <hi>merely</hi> as a profeſſion, is juſtly an object of jealouſy. The laws therefore, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of theſe kingdoms, know no ſuch thing as a <hi>perpetual, ſtanding</hi> ſoldier. <note n="†" place="bottom">Blackſtone's Commentaries, Vol. 1ſt.

            <p>Arguments exiſting in theory, however the mind may be captivated, do not always convince, and conſequences traced from the ſame ſource are ſeldom intereſting. But when we find the apprehenſions of the greateſt and beſt of mankind, who actuated by a principle of benevolence, felt for the common intereſts, fully diſplay'd in awful and tremendous effects, we then ſtart from our lethargy, and like the ſenſitive plant, ſhrink from approaching danger! ſuch is the caſe with reſpect to the ſubject before us. Philoſophers and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſhewn how dangerous ſtanding armies <hi>muſt</hi> be in a free ſtate, and every page in the volume of mankind confirms the melancholy account.</p>
            <p>Speculative writers may indeed tell us, that the ſeeds of diſſolution exiſt in every body politick—that like the body natural it muſt decay and die—and that the ſame cauſes which brought the empires of <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction will ſap every other government on earth. <note n="‖" place="bottom">See Beilz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rius by M. Maimontall.</note> For my own part I am no fataliſt, and <hi>nil deſperandum pro republica,</hi> is to me a much preferable, and more generous motto. And inſtead of enumerating their many vices and corruptions as the <hi>original cauſe,</hi> I think a little acquaintance with hiſtory will inform us, that they are not merely the original cauſe, but <hi>conſequences</hi> reſulting from the fatal meaſure, we are conſidering. In abſolute monarchies, where the military is the principal engine of government, we are not to look for a confirmation of this argument. But in republics, till the introduction of a ſoldiery diſtinct from the citizens, we find them as remote from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, luxury, and the other black catalogue of vices as any human ſyſtem can attain to. But when ſtanding troops were introduced, they immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Depravity of manners—a diſlike to virtue and manly ſentiment—effeminacy, and thoſe groſſer vices, too indelicate to be mentioned in this place, ſtalk'd like daemons through their cities. Witneſs, ye republics, that were once great and illuſtrious, but are now no more! witneſs O Boſton! for ye were too well acquainted with the melancholy truth!</p>
            <p>We will now confirm the ſentiment by a brief inſpection into ſome parts of hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> were a republic that in a ſhort fright of years, exhibited the moſt glorious ſpectacle, that ever appeared to mankind; and, as one obſerves, the age they liv'd in, ſeem'd to be the golden period of human nature. In
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015725_0006_0F9B2AB003BB4AB0"/>every branch of war or peace, in every ſpecies of ſcience they excelled, and were at once fear'd, admir'd and venerated by the other nations of the world. Yet this heroic confederacy was originally reduced from this glorious ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the arts of <hi>one</hi> man. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Piſiſtratus.</note> Under the idea of a guard, from an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of attendants, he increaſed to that ſtretch of power as proved the fatal ſtab to the vitals of his country. The bank thus broken down, the tide ſwell'd toorapid to be ſtemm'd, and virtue, freedom and the laws all fell a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Similar was the ſituation of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Although not ſo univerſally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed as the <hi>Greeks</hi> yet from the expulſion of their kings, to the time of <hi>Marius,</hi> they evinced to what a prodigious greatneſs mankind may arrive when actuated by the principles of liberty, virtue and honor. Influenced by ſuch motives, no wonder their actions were conformable; and while the moſt rigid inflexibility preſided at home, the Roman eagle ſlew to the remoteſt corner of the globe.</p>
            <p>Can we then ſuppoſe when we view the characters which appeared on the ſtage at this period—when we conſider how remote they were from thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which have been prevalent in powerful monarchies, and how carefully they watch'd the ſacred altar of freedom, that they themſelves muſt remain a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monument of the conſequences of this fatal meaſure. Such is the caſe. Marius in new modelling the legions, and replacing the citizens who ſerved in them with foreign mercenaries laid the horrid foundation. The door was now open for one <hi>too powerful citizen</hi> after another, until <hi>Caſar,</hi> loſing every check, and laughing at the impotent anathemas of the ſenate, with the diſtant legions march'd to Rome, and formed a new aera in their hiſtory. From this period weare charmed no more with illuſtrious actions, and the laſt remains of dignity, ſunk in the Roman world. So true is it, that when a people loſe their liberty, they at once become fit ſubjects of every thing baſe and infamous.</p>
            <p>We have thus far produced inſtances of the fatal effects of armies thus kept up, which have ended in the utter ſubverſion of the laws and government of two of the moſt memorable republics in antient ſtory. We will now ſhift the ſcene, and while we ſhow their dangerous tendency in ſtates of a more modern date, we will exhibit an illuſtrious example through what ſcenes of danger, hardſhips and blood the determined ſpirit of honor, and attachment to freedom will carry a people.</p>
            <p>Previous to mentioning the ſituation of the <hi>united provinces,</hi> I muſt remark how very ſimilar their circumſtances were to ours. We ſhall ever find it an unalterable maxim of princes, who in time of peace keep up a ſtanding force, however they may call them the <hi>protectors of law,</hi> the end is <hi>to ſubvert</hi> thoſe laws and render the conſtitution uſeleſs. Such was the mode of conduct of <hi>Phillip
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015725_0007_0F9B2AB0D5FE3020"/>the ſecond</hi> of Spain, to the low countries, and ſuch the procedure of a ſimilar character, <hi>George the third,</hi> of Britain, influenced by as deſpicable a minſtry. The former, as ſir William Temple obſerves, "thinking it not agreeing with his greatneſs," (an army being now in the bowels of their country) "to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their diſcontents, or be limited by their ancient forms of government," pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to deſpiſe the one and overturn the other. New courts judicatory were appointed, new offices eſtabliſhed <hi>depending abſolutely on the king.</hi>

            <p>What was the conſequence?—could it be ſuppoſed a generous people would ſit down tamely, and kiſs the rod that laſh'd them? a different mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct enſued. The duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was ſent with a powerful army, the very forcible plea of tyrants, and the moſt ſhocking cruelties were committed. Here let humanity ſpread her veil, nor let the tender breaſt heave with anguiſh at ſuch ſcenes. But ſhocking as they are, they flow as naturally from this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed engine of oppreſſion, as beams of light from the ſun. For as the ſame ſenſible writer obſerves, <q>So great antipathy ever appears between citizens and ſoldiers; while one <hi>pretends to be ſafe</hi> under laws, which the other pretends <hi>ſhall be ſubject</hi> to his ſword and his will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But terrible as the many executions of their moſt illuſtrious patriots appear'd to them, while the land was drench'd in its richeſt blood;—however affecting the ſight of confiſcations, impriſonments, and the numberleſs cruelties that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them, they were not daunted. That God who hateth oppreſſion, and delighteth in the happineſs of his creation, inſpired them with ſentiments, that carried them through innumerable hardſhips, till after having expended immenſe treaſures and blood for better than threeſcore years they laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a rich, free and flouriſhing people: Providence hereby giving an inſtructive leſſon to poſterity in every age, who are contending for all that is dear and ſacred, to purſue the glorious object undaunted; knowing that as liberty is a plant tranſplanted from the gardens of heaven, its divine parent will ſtill cheriſh it, and in ſpite of oppoſition it will flouriſh, it will live forever.</p>
            <p>Such, my friends, have been the methods uſed by enterpriſing men, in former ages, to carry into effect their ambitious deſigns, and found their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the ruins of their country. But in our day, theſe meaſures have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſyſtematical. They are in fact part of the conſtitution. To take a view of the different powers in <hi>Europe,</hi> and compare them with the ſtate of ancient republics, under great and wiſe legiſlators, who ſeem'd to be raiſed up for the benefit of the age they lived in, and the admiration of poſterity, we muſt drop the tear of ſenſibility at the contraſt. Where is the kingdom that does not groan under the calamities of military tyranny?—let us pauſe a while on the moſt eminent of them.</p>

In the large Empire of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the effects are glaring. Even the ſhadow of Liberty has evaniſhed. Of ſo great importance is the Military, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting Officer can go through their Villages, and pitch upon the ableſt of the Inhabitants as he would chuſe his Cattle. And even a Father has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in his own houſe, for the eſcape of a Child, while by order of the Officer, his own Sons have been his goalers. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

            <p>Perhaps there is no Nation in any part of the world, more happy than <hi>France,</hi> in every luxury of life. But amid this profuſion of plenty, the Farmer exhibits the moſt wretched ſpectacle in nature. Supported by the gleanings of the field, the fruits of his labor go to the ſubſiſtence of the Soldiery. Thus diſpirited and depreſſed, he contents himſelf with the refuge of his ground, while after his greateſt exertions, another will reap the fruits of his honeſt induſtry. The moſt obdurate breaſt muſt melt at ſuch ſcenes, and execrate the effects of ſtanding Armies.</p>
            <p>Look into the ſituation of <hi>Poland.</hi> Under the direction of that great Man, <note n="†" place="bottom">John Sobieslci.</note> famous for his victories againſt the Turks, they were brave and virtuous, and proved the bulwark of Chriſtendom. But under the Saxon line, this ſpirit, not ſuiting their plan of government, was awed by Electoral troops, and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed. The conſequences are now ſeverely experienced by them, and while in this depreſſed State they are an object of deſire to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> their Country is a ſcene of bloodſhed and miſery.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to mention <hi>England,</hi> or the idle farce of an annual Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for the ſupport of ſtanding Troops, which is nothing but an inſult on the ſenſe of that Nation. The more virtuous among them, if the flame of liberty has not entirely expired, eaſily ſee through the guiſe, and in the death of <hi>Allen</hi> and others, wantonly butchered by a mercenary Soldiery, can too clearly read the fate of themſelves and poſterity.</p>
            <p>The melancholy part of this ſubject muſt give pain to every humane breaſt. This is natural. But theſe ſcenes more directly affect other nations; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may pity the unhappy ſufferers, there is a kind of pleaſure we feel that we ourſelves are not immediately intereſted. And would to God, it had ever remained ſo. O my Country! with what heart-felt ſatisfaction, ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, if oppreſſion had never ſtretched her baleful wings to this once happy clime! That that liberty which an illuſtrious ſet of Men, of whom the world was not worthy, purchaſed at ſo dear a rate, might have deſcended unimpaired to lateſt poſterity. But is this the caſe? Has this ſcourge of mankind, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015725_0009_0F9B2AB33A9CD648"/>Armies, never interrupted our proſperity?—If ſo, why is this Deſk hung with the ſable covering of Death! Why am I ſurrounded by ſo many of my fellow-citizens, who liſten to the tale of woe! Yes, my Countrymen, we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are deeply intereſted; and this ſame engine of oppreſſion, which has thrown mighty Republics from their foundations, has attempted and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to ſpread the ſame horrid conſequences in America. And in its uſual mode of conduct, has been attended with every ſpecies of cruelty, ſome of them unheard of before; but which your firmneſs, under God, has hitherto, and I pray ever may ſurmount.</p>
            <p>The ſhocking ſcene of that dreadful night, the fatal effects of which we are ſtill weeping over, is beyond deſcription. No one perhaps, if it is taken in every view, that was not a ſpectator, can conceive it. When I conſider the many inſults, abuſes and violences, this unhappy Town was expoſed to for months previous to this melancholy tragedy—and when the tumult of contrary paſſions was thus naturally excited, to ſee a brutal ſoldiery, ſcattering promiſcuous death through a defenceleſs unarmed multitude, till yonder ſtreet was crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the blood of its Citizens, while a tender Mother, frantic with grief, pours forth the anguiſh of her heart over a beloved ſon, now incapable of any returns of gratitude, all this exhibits a ſcene, which the diſtreſſed heart may painfully feel, but which the tongue cannot expreſs. Let the breaſt then ſtill continue to beat. Theſe, my friends, are virtuous, generous feelings, and do honor to humanity. May we ever retain them. May this Inſtitution, ſacred to the memory of our murdered Brethren, be ever carefully preſerved. Yes, ye injured Shades! We will ſtill weep over you, and if any thing can be more ſoothing, WE WILL REVENGE YOU.</p>
            <p>This glaring ſpecimen of cruelty rouſed the Citizens, and in convincing colors diſplayed the effects of ſtanding Armies in time of peace. But however our exertions were then ſucceſsful, however the ſtorm ſubſided, it was but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary. While the Scales of Juſtice were held in palſied hands, and the moſt ſhocking barbarities were the higheſt merit, an additional force only was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. That arriving, the maſk was thrown off, and a ſtill greater ſcene of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and deſtruction, opened in our adjacent villages.</p>
            <p>But ſuch proceedings, however alarming at that period, were ſoon loſt in more dreadful and diſtreſſing operations. The Heights of Charleſtown too awfully convinced us of the melancholly truth, and poſterity, while with tears of compaſſion, they ponder the tranſactions of that day, muſt execrate the cauſes which produced them. In any ſituation, the relicts of ſlaughtered Citizens are objects of pity, and the ſympathizing ſpectator will ever drop a tear over them. But there may be inſtances, when the leſſer ſtreams of affection, are abſorbed in a ſtill greater ſea of woe. Such are the ſentiments that muſt ſtrike every
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015725_0010_0F9B2AB3C0405C90"/>breaſt, when we reflect, ILLUSTRIOUS WARREN! on thy death—A death, which whole hecatombs of ſlaughtered enemies, ſtrowed around thy Corpſe, can never repay. Here, Ye minions of power! Ye who are dead to the calls of honor and public virtue, are willing to wade to Station, through the blood of your Brethren, here behold a Spectacle that muſt harrow your inmoſt ſoul. You, my Countrymen, with the moſt pleaſing ſenſations, have attentively liſtened, while, like us, he was weeping over the unhappy fate of others. You have kindled into rage, while he has ſet before you the dangerous nature and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſtanding Armies, and prophetically pointed out to you ſtill greater events. How affecting! That he who could lament the fate of others, muſt be himſelf deplored;—and that he, who could ſo feelingly paint the effects of this horrid meaſure, muſt himſelf fall one of the firſt ſacrifices to it!</p>
            <p>But it is not ſufficient to drop a tranſient tear to the memory of departed Heroes, or to pay an Eulogy to their characters. The happineſs of ſuch Men, who, after having expired in the arms of Liberty and Virtue, are now ſharing the higheſt degree of felicity, cannot be increaſed by our praiſes: No, my friends, the beſt way to expreſs our affection for ſuch great and good Men, is to rouſe and revenge them. To hurl ſtill fiercer bolts of vengeance on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Soldiery, who inſtead of affording the laſt honors, ſacred to the dead, and which a generous Enemy will ever regard,—after grinning with helliſh pleaſure on the mangled Corpſe, which alive could ſtrike terror into their boldeſt heart, lodged it in a promiſcuous grave; that ſince they could not prevent his name and reputation being immortal, his Remains might be hid forever.—O Britain! Thou haſt, and ſhall ſtill weep tears of blood for this!</p>
            <p>Are not ſuch Inſtances, my Countrymen, very convincing proofs of the fatal effects of ſtanding Armies, in time of peace. In ſuch a period they originated, and from the fifth of March 1770, through every degree of violence and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, to the preſent day, it is but one connected ſcene.</p>
            <p>After ſuch exhibitions of cruelty and carnage, what can we ſuppoſe too bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, too infamous for ſuch an army? Can we wonder to ſee our houſes in flames? Our altars raſed to the ground, or converted to a much more horrid uſe, than the Jewiſh temple? It poſſible they have even exceeded; and the armies of Britain ſeem to be held up as a ſtanding evidence, how far the ſpirit of tyranny and oppreſſion can operate.</p>
            <p>We ſhudder when the faithful page of hiſtory opens to our view the conduct of armies, fluſh'd with victories, ſacking towns, burning villages, and perpetrating murders, with all the other dreadful concomitants. But if we look into the conduct of the Britiſh army in the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> and ſome part of the State of <hi>New-York,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:015725_0011_0F9B2AB47A8D8C38"/>we ſhall find inſtances of all theſe crimes, and perhaps in ſome places inſtances even beyond them. To ſee the third City in a neighbouring State, wantonly conſumed by an enemy, who not having ſpirit or ability, to meet us in the field, deſcend to theſe little mean methods of exciting error—To ſee the ravages in the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> and the garden of America that wantonly defaced,—Does not the blood beat high!—Do we not preſs forward to exterminate ſuch Barbarians from the face of the earth!—But to mention ſtill greater ſcenes of cruelty—Does not the ear tingle, when it hears the ſhrieks of helpleſs Virgins, dreadful victims to luſt and barbarity; while the grey hairs and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive groans of an aged parent, witneſs to his daughter's ſhame, plead in vain. Can any thing ſwell this complicated ſcene of woe? It <hi>can</hi> receive addition. Theſe monſters exceed even the moſt barbarous nations. With them the aſhes of the dead have ever been ſacred. But under the patronage of a Britiſh Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and his General, ſouffing the tainted gale, they have ranſacked the ſilent repoſitories, and the remains of one that was once amiable and captivating, flung about as food for the birds of the air.<note n="*" place="bottom">Delauncey's Form.</note> O God where is thy vengeance! O Virtue, Honor, Religion, Humanity, where, where are ye fled!</p>
            <p>Theſe, my Countrymen, are not the flights of fancy, not the dictates of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. They are ſolid, though very affecting realities. Can we then wiſh a re-union with ſuch a people? Can we ever familiarly ſhake hands with a nation, who leaping every barrier, are thus wantonly ſporting with our diſtreſſes, and bathing themſelves in the blood of our countrymen? May America never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch mean daſtardly ſentiments! For my own part, if I may be indulged, I would intreat, I would conjure, every one, who as a parent feels for the welfare of his poſterity, to imitate the example of the renowned Carthagenian.<note n="†" place="bottom">

No one, I think, can ſuppoſe theſe thoughts proceed from rage or paſſion. They are the cool dictates of my heart. I love my Country; her diſtreſſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me; nor from this moment do I ever wiſh a reconciliation with a Power, whoſe proſperity muſt be founded on my utter deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I have now, my Countrymen, endeavor'd to exhibit the fatal effects of ſtanding armies in time of peace; not from abſtract reaſoning, but as they exiſt in fact, and now prevail in our diſtreſſed land. Here I would remark, that it is ſtanding armies in <hi>time of peace,</hi> and the <hi>conſequences</hi> thence reſulting, that we are now deprecating. Armies in defence of our Country, unjuſtly invaded, are neceſſary, and in the higheſt ſenſe juſtifiable. We, my friends, attacked by an arbritary tyrant, under the ſanction of a force, the effects of which, we have attempted to illuſtrate, have been obliged to make the laſt ſolemn appeal. And I cannot but feel a pleaſing kind of tranſport, when I ſee America, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted by the many trying ſcenes, that have attended her, ſtill baffling the efforts of the moſt formidable power in Europe, and exhibiting an inſtance, unknown in hiſtory. To ſee an army of veterans, who had fought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in different quarters of the globe—headed by a General tutor'd in the field of War, illuſtrious by former victories, and fluſh'd with repeated ſucceſſes, threatning, with all the pomp of expreſſion, to ſpread havock, deſolation and ruin around him; to ſee ſuch a Soldiery and ſuch a General, yielding to an hardy race of men, new to the field of war; while on the one hand it exalts the character of the latter, convincingly proves the folly of thoſe, who, under pretence of having a body of troops, bred to war, and ever ready for action, adopt this dangerous ſyſtem, in ſubverſion of every principle of lawful govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here, if after having depictured ſcenes of ſo diſtreſſing a nature, it may not appear too deſcending, I could not forbear ſmiling at the Britiſh General and his Troops, who not willing to reflect on their preſent humiliating condition, affect the air of arrogant ſuperiority. But Americans have learnt them, that Men, fighting on the principles of Freedom and Honor, deſpiſe the examples that have been ſet them by an Enemy;—and though, in the field, they can brave every danger in defence of thoſe principles, to a vanquiſhed enemy they know how to be generous:—But that this is a generoſity not weak and unmeaning, but found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on juſt ſentiments, and if wantonly preformed upon, will never interfere with that national juſtice, which ever ought, and lately has been properly exerted.</p>
            <p>But while, with the warmeſt gratitude to Heaven, we view our late ſucceſſes, and are at a loſs to expreſs our acknowledgment to the ILLUSTRIOUS HERO, who was the inſtrument, and whoſe Name, to remoteſt ages, will be ever dear to theſe New-England States, let us not forget our ſituation. There is an Army, and a very powerful one, ſtill exiſting in the Heart of America. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Reputation of paſt Succeſſes ſhould animate every inhabitant of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to fly to Arms; and by one general Exertion utterly expel this laſt, this only
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015725_0013_0F9B2AB798F35C10"/>remaining power of Great Britain on the Continent. Ye, to whom the ſacred, the important Syſtem of Government is committed—Ye Men of Senſe and Virtue—Ye Patriots, who feel an affection for your Country and Poſterity, let me conjure you to ſeize the preſent opportunity, happier than we could ever have expected, and which once omitted may never be again in our power.</p>
            <p>I would not pretend to inſinuate, that this is the <hi>only</hi> point which ought to be under <hi>immediate</hi> conſideration, by a wiſe People or their <hi>Delegates.</hi> But this I will venture to affirm, that unleſs this is the <hi>governing ſentiment,</hi> in every deliberation, every other thing is ſuperfluous. Let us then riſe ſuperior to every private local attachment. As we are embarked on one broad bottom of univerſal Freedom, let us attend to this moſt preſſing occaſion; an occaſion providentially offered for future Security and Happineſs, If a royal army, tho' weak in its number, can thus inſult us unpuniſhed, the moſt ſlender imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can eaſily foreſee what muſt be the effects of a ſtill greater force. I wiſh that the preſent generation, I wiſh that poſterity may not feelingly reproach our inactivity.</p>
            <p>Shall the frequent Calls of our EXALTED GENERAL, who ſeems to have been raiſed up by Heaven, to ſhow to what an height Humanity may ſoar; who generouſly ſacrificing affluence and domeſtic caſe, wiſhes to ſhare with you in every danger and diſtreſs, ſhall his frequent calls be in vain?—Remember, my Countrymen, the eyes of the Good and Great, in every Clime, are upon the preſent conteſt. Liberty, diſguſted at ſcenes of cruelty and oppreſſion, has leſt her ancient altars, and is now hovering to fix her laſt reſidence in America. Our exertions have hitherto been great and ſucceſsful. Let not the aſhes of WARREN, MONTGOMERY, and the illuſtrious Roll of Heroes who died for Freedom, reproach our inactivity and want of ſpirit, in not <hi>compleating</hi> this grand Superſtructure; the Pillars of which have been cemented with the richeſt Blood of America. May that ſame Ardor, which has rendered America famous, ſtill continue, and looking forward to thoſe happy days of Liberty and Peace, which, our Poſterity ſhall enjoy, let us exult at the thought, that future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, while they reap the glorious Fruits of our Struggles, will riſe up and call us Bleſſed.</p>
