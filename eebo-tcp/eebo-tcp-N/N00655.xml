            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000797_0005_0FAA525FADA63BC8"/>'Tis well known, That among the chief Works of the Moſt High, Created by the Son of God, at the Firſt Beginning of Time, there were His <hi>Good</hi> ANGELS: <hi>Angels,</hi> which are Spiritual and Rational Subſtances, Created by the Lord, for His own Immediate Service and Honour. None Deny, None Diſpute, the Exiſtence of thoſe <hi>Good Angels,</hi> but men that are under a more than ordinary Poſſeſſion of <hi>Evil</hi> Ones.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has given it, as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that <hi>Future State,</hi> wherein He will make us Happy for ever, Math. 22.30. <hi>They are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> And if we Hope, to be <hi>Happy</hi> in that <hi>Future State,</hi> we muſt endeavour to Anticipate it, by being very <hi>Holy</hi> in our <hi>Preſent State.</hi> But the way for us, to be very <hi>Holy,</hi> is to Reſemble, and Imitate, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God in Heaven,</hi> while we are on Earth, as far as we are able. Every <hi>Holy man</hi> does a <hi>Little</hi> of This; and <hi>how much</hi> of it, was done by that <hi>Holy man,</hi> who is now gone to Live, and Praiſe, and ſee CHRIST, among the <hi>Angels</hi> for ever, may be propoſed with ſome Advantage unto the <hi>Exhortation,</hi> wherein I have a <hi>few Things to Preach unto the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my <hi>Exhortation</hi> muſt be introduced, with a Report of that <hi>Glory,</hi> which the Martyr <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> while he was yet on Earth, attain'd unto.</p>
            <p>There being occaſion to chooſe <hi>Deacons</hi> in the Primitive Church, that ſo they who were to give themſelves continually unto the <hi>Ministry of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000797_0006_0FAA52601B126F68"/>
the Word,</hi> might be Releaſed, by the faithful Cares of thoſe <hi>Deacons,</hi> from Secular Encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>One</hi> of them was the Bleſſed <hi>Stephen</hi>; who being the Firſt that arriv'd unto the <hi>Crown of Martyrdome</hi> for our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the New-Teſtament, had in the Name of <hi>Stephen,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>A Crown,</hi> a notable Specification, of the <hi>Event</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> which will attend all our <hi>Sufferings</hi> for the Lord.</p>
            <p>It was then an Age of many <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and ſuch a <hi>meaſure</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> poſſeſſed this Excellent man, that by the <hi>Impulſe</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> He could, with all Aſſurance, perceive when the <hi>Spirit</hi> was going to work <hi>Miracles,</hi> and apply himſelf to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by ſome wonderful <hi>Actions</hi> of his own. This Illuſtrious Worker of <hi>Miracles,</hi> was Accuſed before the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for ſaying, That it was the Deſign of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>City,</hi> and alter the <hi>Rites,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had, from God, commanded unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When he appear'd before the <hi>Council</hi> to anſwer this Accuſation, 'tis here ſaid, <hi>They ſaw his Face, as it had been the Face of an Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Face of an Angel,</hi> we have a Remarkable Account, in what we read about one of the <hi>Angels,</hi> in Mat. 28.3. His <hi>Countenance was like Lightning.</hi> And we read concerning a Great man, who had got the <hi>Face of an Angel,</hi> by being much with the <hi>Angels,</hi> in Exod 34.10. <hi>Behold,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000797_0007_0FAA5260E9DBF140"/>
the skin of his Face ſhone.</hi> If we carry the paſſage now before us, unto the Higheſt ſenſe, which it would lay claim unto, we are to ſuppoſe, That ſuch a <hi>Splendor</hi> was diſcernible upon the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Stephen</hi>: And ſurely, if they who diſcerned it, had not had the <hi>Heart of a Devil</hi> in them, they durſt not have gone on, to Abuſe a <hi>man,</hi> that Appeared before them, with the <hi>Face of an Angel.</hi> Alas, the more of an <hi>Angel</hi> there is in any <hi>man,</hi> the more <hi>Stones</hi> will the <hi>Devil</hi> procure to be thrown at ſuch a <hi>Man!</hi> But, behold, the <hi>Agreeableneſs</hi> of the matter; <hi>Stephen</hi> was perſecuted for vilifying of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and, behold, at this very Time, he is vindicated with a <hi>Shine</hi> upon his <hi>Face,</hi> like that once upon the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Things here ſpoken by <hi>Stephen,</hi> were thoſe very Things, which the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi> had formerly ſpoken unto the <hi>Prophet Daniel</hi>; and behold, the Aſpect of an <hi>Angel</hi> adorns him, in his Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>We may from hence, take Leave to Obſerve,
That a <hi>Saint on Earth,</hi> may arrive to thoſe Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhall make him Look like an <hi>Angel of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Angelical Excellencies,</hi> a Degree whereof, poor <hi>man,</hi> ſorry <hi>man,</hi> ſinful <hi>man,</hi> even while ſuch, may very much attain unto.</p>
            <p>But now, this CASE calls for our Attention;
What are thoſe Excellencies, that would make a Saint, Look like an <hi>ANGEL</hi>?</p>
            <p>And the General Anſwer hereunto is, The <hi>Excellencies of Holineſs</hi>

A man may not wiſh to <hi>Shine</hi> like <hi>Stephen,</hi> in this World, and have a <hi>Face,</hi> that may dazzle the Spectators. Or, what would it avail, if a man could make a Glare on his <hi>Face,</hi> by ſmearing it with ſome of the <hi>Noctilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's</hi> invented by the <hi>Modern Chymiſtry</hi>? A <hi>Devil</hi> has before now, pretended unto ſuch a <hi>Face.</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>Face,</hi> but the <hi>Grace,</hi> of an <hi>Angel,</hi> which is here to be Aſpired after. It were a Fooliſh, and a Faulty Thing, for any man, to be ambitious, of wearing in this World, ſuch a Figure, as that in Dan. 10.6. <hi>His Body like the Beryl, and his Face as the Appearance of Lightning, and his Eyes as Lamps of Fire. Immortality</hi> it ſelf, is one of the <hi>Angelical Excellencies.</hi> But, while we are among <hi>Mortals</hi> here, we muſt ſubmit unto the Laws of <hi>Mortality,</hi> and be willing to <hi>Dy,</hi> When, and How, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign God ſhall order it. There are alſo, thoſe Flights of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and thoſe Heights of <hi>Power</hi> among the <hi>Angelical Excellencies</hi>; wherein, 'tis not for us, to Dream of being <hi>Like</hi> them, until we are become, <hi>The Children of the Reſurrection</hi> It was the Ruine of our <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> to imagine, in Gen. 3.5. They <hi>might be as Elohim!</hi> No, this cannot be, until our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has by a <hi>New Birth</hi> brought us into that <hi>World to come,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000797_0009_0FAA52626BDED5C0"/>
where, the <hi>Wiſe Converters of many to Righteouſneſs,</hi> will be thoſe, who ſhall <hi>Shine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever!</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will make <hi>us</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>New World.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Angels</hi> now turn and move all the <hi>Wheels</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> are they that ſhall <hi>Receive the Kingdom that cannot be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Secondly, The <hi>Excellencies of Holineſs,</hi> [For, the <hi>Saints,</hi> are the <hi>Excellent!</hi>] Theſe are They, wherein the Imitation of the <hi>Angels</hi> by <hi>men,</hi> may be very far proceeded in. The <hi>Angels</hi> of God, are ſtyled, in Mat. 25.31. <hi>The Holy Angels</hi>; and in Dan. 4.17. <hi>The Holy Ones.</hi> 'Tis not as they are <hi>Mighty Angels,</hi> but as they are <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> that we muſt propound our coming to Look like unto them. Theſe <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> never did, and never will Sin againſt their God; but are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Serving of Him; <hi>They Serve Him Day and Night in His Temple!</hi> And it may be, the <hi>Bright Garments,</hi> wherein theſe <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, may be an Emblem of their <hi>Holineſs</hi> and their <hi>Purity.</hi> Now it hath been the <hi>Will of God in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt concerning us,</hi> that there ſhould be ſet before us, the Greateſt Exemples of <hi>Holineſs</hi> for our Imitation. And hence, as we have the Greater <hi>Exemple</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST Himſelf given unto us, to Direct and Excite and Promote our <hi>Holineſs,</hi> with a Charge, <hi>To be Holy, as He that hath called us is Holy</hi>; So, we have alſo the <hi>Exemple</hi> of the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> given unto us, That
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000797_0010_0FAA526327703CB8"/>
we may ſtrive as far as may be, to be Like unto them in their <hi>Holineſs.</hi> Hence when the Pſamiſt of old ſaw the <hi>Angels</hi> praiſing of God, he cryed out, <hi>O my Soul, do Thou ſo too</hi>! Yea, ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters Judge, That when the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Stephen</hi> Look'd like an <hi>Angel,</hi> it was no more than what you and I may <hi>thro' Chriſt who ſtrengthens us,</hi> reach unto. <hi>q d.</hi> The <hi>Conſolations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God, ſo filled him, that he diſcovered not the leaſt <hi>Conſternations</hi> in his <hi>Face</hi>: His <hi>Face</hi> was as Joyful, and Serene, as if he had ſtood free from all the <hi>Sorrows</hi> of this World, among the <hi>Angels</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>I remember the Apoſtle Enjoins the <hi>Woman</hi> in the Church to have a covering on her Head, in Token of Subjection to her <hi>Husband; Becauſe of the Angels.</hi> [2 Cor. 11.10.] Why, if you turn to the Beginning of the ſixth Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> you'l find the <hi>Angels</hi> before their Superiour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the <hi>Temple</hi> aſſuming a <hi>Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> out of the Reverence which they pay unto Him. Hence then, ſays the Apoſtle, it becomes <hi>Women</hi> to take <hi>Example</hi> by the <hi>Angels</hi>; let them conſider, how the <hi>Angels</hi> behave themſelves in the Preſence of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, who is the Grand Repreſentative of the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God; and let them in their <hi>Habit</hi> ſhow ſome Analogy to the <hi>Habit</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi>: betokening their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>man,</hi> who is under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God, while <hi>They</hi> the <hi>Women,</hi> are ſo of the <hi>man.</hi> But I only touch
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000797_0011_0FAA5263B21040F0"/>
on this gloſs, by the by. What I inſiſt on, is, That the <hi>Angelical Example</hi> is to be imitated.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we ſhall, as long as we Live in this World, come far ſhort of the <hi>Original,</hi> when we go to Write after the <hi>Angelical Example.</hi> In this <hi>Preſent Evil World,</hi> we cannot approach near to the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the <hi>Good Angels</hi>: Much of Sin, and Fault, &amp; Folly, will unavoidably cleave unto us: That <hi>Leproſy</hi> will never wholly out of the <hi>Walls,</hi> until the <hi>Clay-houſe</hi> be utterly demoliſhed: There will be as much Diſtance between the <hi>Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>Us,</hi> as between <hi>Giants</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Gloworms,</hi> as between the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and the <hi>Hyſop</hi> that <hi>Grows out of the Wall</hi>; Thus it will be, until we come at length to dwell [And, <hi>Oh! Why do we no more Long for it!</hi>] with the <hi>Innumerable Company of Angels,</hi> in another World.</p>
            <p>However, to Attempt the Imitation, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to be <hi>Excellent.</hi> Particularly in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> If a man could have his <hi>Eye</hi> upon the <hi>Face of God</hi> continually, would not that procure the <hi>Face of an Angel</hi> for him? It would make a man Look like an <hi>Angel,</hi> if he were Looking unto God, in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt continually. Of the <hi>Angels</hi> there is that Account given, in Mat. 18.10. <hi>In the Heavens, they do always behold the Face of my Father which is in the Heavens.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> do converſe with GOD continually. And, why may not we preſs after a converſe with GOD, a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000797_0012_0FAA52648B5EFED8"/>
little Emulating the <hi>Angelical</hi>? To be <hi>Heavenly-minded,</hi> by having the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in our minds, and by being <hi>in the Fear of God all the Day Long; This</hi> were to be as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are! Oh! That we were thus, <hi>Filled with all the Fulneſs of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, We may have a continual <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of GOD in our minds. In every <hi>Place,</hi> we may Apprehend GOD Wherever we are, we may Subſcribe to that Article of the Ancient Faith, in Pſal. 139.7. Lord, <hi>Whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence</hi>? What if we ſhould never be from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Awe of ſuch a Thought as that, <hi>The Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent God obſerves all my wayes!</hi> And we may Apprehend GOD, in every <hi>Thing.</hi> We need not ſtay at any <hi>Second Cauſes</hi>; but we may with a <hi>Spiritualized Soul,</hi> Soar up to ſome Notice of <hi>God</hi> in all. Upon all the Works of <hi>Creation</hi> we may ſay, <hi>The Finger of God is here!</hi> And we may make the Poſitions of the <hi>Pauline</hi> Philoſophy, in Acts 17.24, 28. <hi>God made the World, and all Things therein; In Him we Live and Move and have our Being.</hi> Upon all the Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> we may ſay, <hi>This comes from that God, whoſe Kingdome Ruleth over all.</hi> And we may make the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions once taught by our Lord, no doubt alluding to the <hi>Two Birds,</hi> whereof one was to be <hi>killed,</hi> the other to be <hi>Let Looſe into the Open Field,</hi> at the cleanſing of the <hi>Leper,</hi> in Mat. 10.29. <hi>Two Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, one of them ſhall not fall on the Ground without our Father.</hi> To be Led unto ſome Notice of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000797_0013_0FAA526536837D78"/>
GOD continually, This, O This, it is <hi>Angelical.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> What is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but <hi>Godlineſs</hi>? This were a little of the <hi>Angelical Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Our continual <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of GOD, may bring a continual <hi>Dedication</hi> to GOD, upon all that we <hi>Have,</hi> and all that we <hi>Do.</hi> If we <hi>Glance</hi> at <hi>Inferiour Ends,</hi> yet we may not <hi>Stop</hi> there: All our <hi>Ends</hi> are to be Swallowed up in GOD. We ſhould not, with any patience conſent unto it, that any but GOD, ſhould have our <hi>Strength,</hi> our <hi>Time,</hi> our <hi>All.</hi> Whatever <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> are beſtow'd upon us, we may put them under that Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>David</hi> had, in Pſal. 30. <hi>Tit. Dedicated Things.</hi> All our <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> all the Powers of our <hi>Spirits,</hi> all the Members of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> our <hi>Credit,</hi> our Deſireable <hi>Friends</hi>; we may contrive with our ſelves <hi>What Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may GOD have out of theſe Things!</hi> And Improve them no farther, than as <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> whereby GOD may be <hi>Acknowledged.</hi> Yea, and our daily <hi>Actions</hi>; may we not be driving a <hi>Trade</hi> for GOD in all? As 'tis ſaid, in 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</hi> So, our <hi>Eating,</hi> our <hi>Drinking,</hi> our <hi>Sleeping,</hi> what is it for? We may diſtinctly ſay, <hi>I do This, that I may be ſupported in the Service of God.</hi> Thus, our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> our <hi>Travels,</hi> our <hi>Viſits,</hi> and our Exerciſes of <hi>Religion,</hi> we may thus Ennoble them, <hi>I do This, I will do it carefully and cheerfully, becauſe God hath Commanded my doing of it.</hi> A <hi>Dedication</hi> to GOD, is the proper meaning of <hi>Holineſs:</hi> And very <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:000797_0014_0FAA5265F58D7900"/>
would be our <hi>Holineſs,</hi> if we could be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and conſtant in ſuch Acts of <hi>Dedication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; Our continual <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of GOD, may produce our continual <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in GOD, under all His <hi>Diſpenſations.</hi> Whatever <hi>Enjoyments</hi> are by God conferred upon us, where lies the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> where the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of them? Truly, we may come to Reliſh our <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> only <hi>ſo far</hi> as we have ſomething of GOD in them. It was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Pſal. 37 4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord.</hi> Yea, And what if we ſhould have no <hi>Delight,</hi> but the <hi>Lord?</hi> Let us ponder with our ſelves, over our <hi>Enjoyments; In theſe Enjoyments I See God, and by theſe Enjoyments I Serve God</hi>! And now, Let all our <hi>Delight</hi> in, and all our Value and Fondneſs, for our <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> be <hi>Only,</hi> or <hi>Mainly,</hi> upon ſuch a <hi>Divine Score</hi> as <hi>This.</hi> As far as any of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> Lead us unto GOD, ſo far let us Reliſh it, Affect it, Embrace it, and Rejoyce in it; <hi>O Taſt, and Feed upon God in all</hi>; and Ask for Nothing, no, not for <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf, any further than as it may help us, in our <hi>Seeing,</hi> and our <hi>Serving,</hi> of our GOD. And then, whatever <hi>Afflictions,</hi> do lay Fetters upon us, Let us not only Remember, that we are concerned with GOD therein, but let our concernment with GOD procure a very profound <hi>Submiſſion</hi> in our Souls. Be able to ſay, with him, in Pſal. 39.9. <hi>I opened not my mouth, becauſe Thou didſt it.</hi> In all our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> Let us Remark the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of that GOD, before whom, <hi>Why ſhould a Living man Complain for the Puniſhment of his Sin</hi>?
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000797_0015_0FAA5266B4077928"/>
the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of that GOD, <hi>whoſe Judgments are Right</hi>; the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of that GOD, who <hi>Puniſhes us leſs than our Iniquities do deſerve.</hi> Let us behave our ſelves, as having to Do with none but GOD, in our <hi>Afflictions:</hi> And let our <hi>Afflictions</hi> make us more conformable unto GOD; which Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being Effected, Let us then ſay, <hi>'Tis Good for me that I have been Afflicted.</hi> Sirs, what were this, but a pitch of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> almoſt <hi>Angelical</hi>! Oh! Mount up as with the <hi>Wings of Eagles,</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi>; be not a ſorry, puiny, Mechanick ſort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> any longer; but <hi>Reach Forth</hi> unto theſe things, that are thus before you!</p>
            <p>But, in fine, 'Tis our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is, <hi>The Face of God. That</hi> is His <hi>Name,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Old Teſtament; and in this <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
