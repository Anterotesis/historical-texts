            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>All which are diſtinctly put forth (when he ceaſeth extraordinarily to work) in the Day of Chriſt's Power; and whoever look for actual Salvation and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt, let them ſeek for Mercy and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in this Way, out of which, they ſhall never find it; let them begin at Conviction, and deſire the Lord to let them ſee their Sins, that ſo, being affected with them, and humbled under them, they may, by Faith, be enabled to receive Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo be bleſſed in him. It is true, Chriſt is applied to us next<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Faith, but Faith is wrought in us in that Way of Conviction and Sorrow for Sin; no Man can or will come by Faith to Chriſt, to take away his Sins, unleſs he firſt ſee, be convicted of, and laden with them.

Now the Text ſaith, the Lord begins not thus with ſome one or two, but with the <hi>World</hi> of God's Elect, who are to be called home by the Miniſtry of the Word; which our Saviour ſpeaks (as any may ſee who conſiders the Scope) purpoſely to comfort the Hearts of his Diſciples, that their Miniſtry ſhall be thus effectual to the World of Jews and Gentiles; and therefore cannot ſpeak of ſuch <hi>Conviction</hi> as ſerves only for to leave Men without Excuſe, for greater Condemnation; (as ſome underſtand the Place) for that is a poor Ground of Conſolation to their ſad Hearts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall hereafter prove that there can be no Faith without Senſe of Sin and Miſery; and now there can be no Senſe of Sin without a precedent Sight or Conviction of Sin; no Man can feel Sin, unleſs he doth firſt ſee it; what the Eyes ſee not the Heart rues not. Let the greateſt Evil befall a Man, ſuppoſe the burning of his Houſe, the Death of his Children, if he doth not firſt know, ſee and hear of it, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take it to Heart, it will never trouble him; ſo let a poor Sinner lye under the greateſt Guilt, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Wrath of God, it will never trouble him until he ſees it and be convinced of it, Acts 2.37. <hi>When they heard this they were pricked;</hi> but firſt they heard it, and ſaw their Sin, before their Hearts were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. they firſt <hi>ſaw their Nakedneſs,</hi> before they were <hi>aſhamed</hi> of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The main End of the Law is to drive us to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the <hi>End of the Law,</hi> then the Law is the Means ſubſervient to that End, and that not to <hi>ſome,</hi> but to all <hi>that believe;</hi> now the Law tho' it drives us to Chriſt by Condemnation, yet in order it begins with Accuſation. It firſt accuſeth, and ſo convinceth of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and then condemneth. It's Folly and Injuſtice for a Judge to Condemn and bring a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005059_0012_10169560F635E248"/>
to Execution before Accuſation and Conviction; and is it Wiſdom or Juſtice in the Lord to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? And therefore the Spirit in making uſe of the Law for this End, firſt convinceth, as it firſt accuſeth and lays our Sins to our Charge. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Look as Satan when he binds up a Sinner in his Sin, he firſt keeps him (if poſſible) from the very Sight and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; becauſe ſo long as they ſee it not, this Ignorance is the Cauſe of all their Woe; why they feel it not, why they deſire not to come out of it; the Lord Jeſus (who came to untie the Knots of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8.) begins here, and firſt convinceth his, and makes them ſee their Sin, that ſo they may feel it, and come to him for Deliverance out of it. O conſider this, all you that dream out your Time in minding only Things before your Feet, never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Evils of your own Hearts; you that heed not, you that will not ſee your Sins, not ſo much as aſk this Queſtion, What have I done? What do I do? How do I live? What will become of me? What will be the End of theſe my fooliſh Courſes? I tell you if ever the Lord ſave you, he will make you ſee what you cannot, what you now will not; he will not only make you to confeſs you are Sinners, but he will convince you of Sin, this ſhall be the firſt Thing the Lord will do with thee.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. But you will ſay, <hi>What is that Sin which the Lord firſt convinceth of?</hi> Which is the ſecond Thing to be opened. I anſwer in theſe three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>

The Lord Jeſus by his Spirit doth not only convince the Soul in general, that it is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſinful; but the Lord brings in a convicting Evidence of the Particulars; the firſt is learnt more by Tradition (in theſe Days) by the Report and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment

of every Man, rather than by any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conviction of the Spirit of Chriſt; for what Man is there almoſt but lies under this Confeſſion that he is a Sinner? the beſt ſay they are Sinners, <hi>and if we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive ourſelves,</hi> and <hi>I know I am a Sinner;</hi> but that which the Spirit principally convinceth of, is ſome Sin or Sins in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: The Spirit doth not arreſt Men for Offences in general, but opens the Writ, and ſhews them the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cauſe, the particular Sins, Rom. 3.9. <hi>We have proved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that Jews and Gentiles are under Sin,</hi> but how doth the Apoſtle (being now the Inſtrument of the Spirit, in this Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction) convince them of this? Mark his Method, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10, to 18, wherein you ſhall ſee it done by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration of Particulars; Sins of their Natures, <hi>there is none Righteous;</hi> Sins of their Minds, <hi>none underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> Sins in their Wills and Affections, <hi>none ſeek after God;</hi> Sins in their Lives, <hi>all gone out of the way;</hi> Sins of Omiſſion of good Duties, <hi>there is none that doeth good,</hi> their <hi>Throats, Tongues, Lips,</hi> are <hi>Sepulchres, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, poiſonful,</hi> their <hi>Mouths full of Curſing,</hi> their <hi>Feet ſwift to ſhed Blood,</hi> &amp;c.

I Anſwer, In Variety of Men there is much Variety of ſpecial Sins, as there is of Diſpoſitions, Tempers and Temptations; and therefore the Lord doth not convince one Man at firſt of the ſame Sins of which he doth another Man, yet this we may ſafely ſay, uſually (tho' not always) the Lord begins with the Remembrance and Conſideration of ſome one great, if not a Man's ſpecial and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sin; and thereby the Spirit diſcovers gradually

all the reſt: That Arrow which woundeth the Heart of Chriſt moſt, the Lord makes it fall firſt upon the Head of the Sinner that did ſhoot it againſt Heaven, and convinceth, and as it were hits him firſt with that: How did the Spirit convince thoſe 3000, thoſe Patterns of God's converting Grace? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. Did not the Lord begin with them for one principal Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> their Murder and Contempt of Chriſt, by embruing their Hands in his Blood? There is no Queſtion but now they remember'd other ſinful Practices, but this was the <hi>Imprimis,</hi> which is ever accompanied with many other <hi>Items,</hi> which are then read in God's Bill of Reckonings, where the firſt is ſet down, <hi>Iſrael would have a King,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.19. <hi>Samuel,</hi> for a Time, could not convince them of their Sin; herein what doth the Lord do? ſurely he will convince them of Sin, before he leaves them, and this by ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thunder as ſhall make their Hearts ake; and how is it now? What Sin do they now ſee? They firſt ſee the Greatneſs of that particular Sin; but this came not to Mind alone, but they cry'd out, 1 Sam. 12.19. <hi>We have added unto all our Evils this, in asking to our ſelves a King.</hi> Look upon the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> John 4. The Lord Chriſt indeed ſpake firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her about himſelf the Subſtance of the Goſpel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Worth of this Water of Life; but what good did ſhe get until the Lord began to convince her of Sin, and how does he that, he tells her of her ſecret Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhe lived in, <hi>the Man that ſhe now had was not her Huſband;</hi> and upon the Diſcovery of this, ſhe ſaw many more Sins; and hence <hi>Verſe</hi> 29, ſhe crys out, <hi>Come ſee the Man that told me all that ever I did in my Life.</hi> And thus the Lord deals at this Day; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter preacheth againſt one Sin, it may be Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Ignorance, Contempt of the Goſpel, Neglect

of ſecret Duties, Lying, Sabbath-breaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is thy Caſe, ſaith the Spirit unto the Soul, remember the Time, the Place, the Perſons with whom you lived in this ſinful Condition; and now a Man begins to go alone, and to think of all his former Courſes how exceeding Evil they have been; it may be the Lord brings upon a Man a ſore Affliction; and when he is in Chains, crying out for that, the Lord ſaith to him as to thoſe, Jer. 30.15. <hi>Why cryeſt thou for thy Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For the Multitude of thine Iniquities I have done this;</hi> it may be the Lord ſometimes ſtrikes a Man's Companion in Sin dead, by ſome fearful Judgment; and then that particular Sin comes to mind, and the Lord reveals it arm'd with a Multitude of many other Sins, the Cauſes of it, the Fruits and Effects of it: As the Father whips a Child upon occaſion of one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Fault, but then tells him of many more which he winked at before this, and tells him, Now, Sirrah, remember ſuch a Time, ſuch a froward Fit, ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful Behaviour, ſuch a reviling Word you ſpake, ſuch a Time I called, and you ran away, and would not hear me, and you tho't I lik'd well eno' of theſe Ways, but now know that I will not paſs them by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord deals with his, and hence it is many Times, that the Elect of God civilly bro't up, do hereupon think well of themſelves, and ſo remain long unconvinced of their woful Eſtates, the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to fall into ſome foul, ſecret, or open S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To this Purpoſe doth the Spirit work: For, Beloved, the great Means whereby Satan overthrew Man at firſt in his Innocency, was this Principle, altho' thou doſt eat, and ſo ſin againſt God, yet thou ſhalt not die, Gen. 3.4. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> the Serpent doth not ſay, <hi>Ye ſhall not die,</hi> for that is too groſs an out-facing of the Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. but ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die;</hi> that is, there is not ſuch abſolute Certainty of it; it may be you ſhall live, God loves you better than ſo, and is a more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father than to be at a Word and a Blow. Now look as Satan deceived and bro't our firſt Parents to Ruin, by ſuggeſting this Principle; ſo at this Day he doth ſow this accurſed Seed, and plant this accurſed Principle in the Soil of every Man's Heart by Nature; they do not think, they cannot believe they are dead Men, and condemned to die, and that they ſhall die eternally for the leaſt Sin committed by them; Men nor Angels cannot perſwade them of it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Equity of it, that God ſo merciful will be ſo ſevere, for ſo ſmall a Matter; nor yet the Truth of it, for then they think no Fleſh ſhould be ſaved; and thus when the old Serpent hath ſpit his Poiſon before them, they ſup it up, and drink it in, and ſo Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, nay, Millions of Men and Women are undone. The Lord Chriſt therefore when he comes to ſave a poor ſinner, and raiſe him up out of his Fall, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Soul by his Spirit, and that with full and mighty Evidence, that it ſhall die for the leaſt Sin, and

Now the Soul is glad to enquire of the Miniſter, Oh tell me what ſhall I do? I once tho't my ſelf in a ſafe and good Condition as any in the Town or Country I lived in; but now the Lord hath let me hear of other News; die I muſt in this Eſtate, and 'tis a wonder of Mercies I am ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alive to this Day. There is not only ſome blind Fears and Suſpicions that it may poſſibly be ſo, but full Perſwaſions of Heart, die I muſt, die I ſhall in this Eſtate: For if the Spirit reveal Sin, and convince not of Death for Sin, the Soul under this Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, being as yet rather ſenſual than ſpiritual, will make a light Matter of it, when it ſees no ſenſible Danger in it, but when it ſees the bottomleſs Pit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, everlaſting Fire before it, for the leaſt Sin, now it ſees the heinous Evil of Sin; the Way of Sin, tho' never ſo peaceable before, is full of Danger now, wherein it ſees there are endleſs Woes and everlaſting Deaths that lie in wait for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. And now ſaith the Spirit you may go on in theſe ſinful Courſes as others do, if you ſee meet, but O conſider what will be the End of them; what is it to enjoy the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin for a Seaſon, and to be tormented for ever for them in the Concluſion, for be aſſured that will be the End: And hence the Soul ſeeing it ſelf thus
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005059_0022_1016957C3290BF78"/>
ſet apart for Death, looks upon it ſelf in a far worſe Eſtate than the brute Beaſts, or vileſt Worm upon the Earth; for it thinks, when they die there is an End of their Miſery, but Oh then is the Beginning of mine for ever: Hence alſo ariſe thoſe Fears of Death and of being ſuddenly cut off, that when it lyes down, it trembles to think I may never riſe again, becauſe it is convinced, not only that it deſerves to die, but that it is already ſentenced for to die: Hence alſo the Soul juſtifies God, if he had cut him off in his Sin; and wonders what kept him from it, there being nothing elſe due from God unto it: Hence laſtly, the Soul is ſtopt and ſtands ſtill, goes not on in Sin as before; or if he doth, the Lord gives it no Peace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. Why doth the Horſe go on in the Battle? becauſe it ſees not Death before it; but now the Soul ſees Death and therefore ſtops: O remember this all you that never could believe that you are dead condemned Men, and therefore are never troubled with any ſuch Tho'ts in your Minds; I tell you that you are far from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and therefore far from Salvation: If God ſhould ſend ſome from the Dead to bear Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſecure World concerning this Truth, yet you will not believe it, for his Meſſengers ſent from Heaven are not believed herein; wo be to you if you remain unconvinced of this Point.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But you will ſay, How doth the Lord thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Sin, and wherein is it expreſs'd; which is the third Particular.</p>

In one Word, I know no Man, tho' never ſo bad, though his Sin be never ſo grievous, but he hath ſomething to ſay for himſelf, and ſomething in his Mind to leſſen and extenuate Sin: But, Beloved,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005059_0024_1016958204CFC408"/>
when the Spirit comes to convince, he ſo convinceth as that he anſwers all theſe, pulls down all theſe Fences, tears off all theſe Fig-Leaves, ſcatters all theſe Miſts, and pulls off all theſe Scales from the Eyes, ſtops a Man's Mouth, that the Soul ſtands before God, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing O Lord, Guilty, Guilty; as the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> told them, Jer. 2.23. <hi>Why doſt thou ſay, I am Innocent? look upon thy Way,</hi> &amp;c. ſo the Spirit ſaith, why doſt thou ſay thy Sin is ſmall? It is <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> (as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23.) which is <hi>Rebellion, and as the Sin of Witchcraft,</hi> and is that a ſmall Matter? The Spirit of Conviction by the clear Evidence of the Truth, binds the Underſtanding that it cannot ſtruggle againſt God any more, and hence let all the World plead to the contrary, nay, let the Godly come to comfort them in this Eſtate, and think and ſpeak well of them, yet they cannot believe them becauſe they are certain that their Eſtates are woful: Hence alſo we ſhall obſerve the Soul under Conviction, inſtead of excuſing Sin, it aggravates Sin, and ſtudies to aggravate Sin, Did ever any deal thus wickedly, walk thus ſinfully, ſo long, againſt ſo many Checks and Chidings, Light and Love, Means and Mercies as I have done? And it is wonderful to obſerve that thoſe Things which made it once account Sin light, make it therefore to think Sin greater: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> my Sin is little, the more unkind thou (ſaith the Spirit) that wilt not do a ſmall Matter for the Lord: My Sin is common; the more ſinful thou, that in thoſe Things wherein all the World riſe up in Arms againſt God, thou joineſt with them: God ſpares me after Sin, the greater is thy Sin therefore that thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long in, againſt a God ſo pitiful to thee: The deareſt Sins are now the vileſt Sins, becauſe tho' they were moſt ſweet to him, yet the Spirit convinceth
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005059_0025_10169585F1C42490"/>
him they were therefore the more grievous unto the Soul of God: You poor Creatures may now hide, and colour, and excuſe your Sins before Men, but when the Lord comes to convince you cannot lie hid; then your Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. There is a real Light in ſpiritual Conviction, rational Conviction makes Things appear notionally, but ſpiritual Conviction, really: The Spirit indeed uſeth Argumentation in Conviction, but it goeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and cauſeth the Soul not only to ſee Sin and Death diſcurſively, but alſo intuitively and really: Reaſon can ſee and diſcourſe about Words and Propoſitions, and behold Things by Report, and to deduct one Thing from another, but the Spirit makes a Man ſee the Things themſelves, really wrapt up in thoſe Words: The Spirit brings ſpiritual Things as well as Notions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Man's Eye, the Light of the Spirit is like the Light of the Sun, it makes all Things appear as they are, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.20, 21.

                        </gap> from hey Eyes,</hi> (Luke 19.41.) Diſcourſe with many a Man about his Sin and Miſery, he will grant all that you ſay, and he is convinced that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is moſt wretched, and yet ſtill lives in all Manner of Sin; what is the Reaſon of it? truly he ſees his Sin only by Diſcourſe, but he doth not, nay cannot ſee the Thing Sin, Death, Wrath of God, until the Spirit come; which only convinceth or ſheweth that really. A Man will not be afraid of a Lion when it is painted on a Wall; why? becauſe therein he doth not ſee
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005059_0026_10169587B44DEC50"/>
the living Lion; when he ſees that he trembles. So Men hear of Sin, and talk of Sin and Death, and ſay they are moſt miſerable in Regard of both; yet their Hearts tremble not, are not amazed at theſe Evils, becauſe Sin is not ſeen alive, Death is not preſented alive before them, which is done by the Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction only, revealing theſe really to the Soul: And hence it is that many Men <hi>in ſeeing ſee not,</hi> (Iſai. 6.3.) how can that be? thus, in ſeeing Things notionally, they ſee them not really. And hence many that know moſt of Sin, know leaſt of Sin, becauſe in ſeeing it notionally, they ſee it not really. And therefore hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were it for ſome Men, Scholars and others, that they had no notional Knowledge, for this <hi>Light</hi> is their <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and makes them more uncapable of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conviction. The firſt Act of ſpiritual Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to let a Man ſee clearly that he is ſinful and moſt miſerable; the ſecond Act is to let the Soul ſee really what this Sin and Death is. O conſider of this; many of you know that you are ſinful, and that you ſhall die; but doſt thou know what Sin is, and what it is to die? If thou didſt, I dare ſay thy Heart would ſink; if thou doſt not, thou art a condemned Man, becauſe not yet a convinced Man. If you here aſk, how the Lord makes Sin real; I anſwer, by making God real: The real Greatneſs of Sin is ſeen by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding really the Greatneſs of God who is ſmitten by Sin; Sin is not ſeen becauſe God is not ſeen, John 3.11. <hi>He that doth Evil hath not ſeen God.</hi> No Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is the Cauſe why <hi>Blood toucheth Blood,</hi> (Hoſ. 4.4.) the Spirit caſts out all other Company of vain and fooliſh Thoughts, and then God comes in and appears immediately to the Soul in his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory, and then the Spirit ſaith, Lo, this is that God thy Sins have provoked. And now Sin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005059_0027_1016958998CD7108"/>
as it is, and together with this real Sight of Sin, the Soul doth not ſee painted Fire, but ſees the Fire of God's Wrath really, whither now it is leading, that can never be quench'd but by Chriſt's Blood: And when the Spirit hath thus convinced, now a Man begins to ſee his Madneſs and Folly in Times paſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I knew not what I did. And hence Queſtions, Can the Lord pardon ſuch a Wretch as I, whoſe Sins are ſo great? Hence alſo the Heart begins to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Sin and Death, becauſe it ſees them now as they are indeed, and not by Report only. A Man accounts it a matter of Nothing to tread upon a Worm, wherein there is nothing ſeen worthy either to be loved or feared; and hence a Man's Heart is not affected with it: Before the Spirit of Conviction comes, God is more vile in Man's Eye than any Worm; as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf in another Caſe, Pſal. 22. <hi>I am a Worm and no Man;</hi> ſo may the Lord complain, I am viler in ſuch a one's Eye than any Worm, and no God: And hence a Man makes it a Matter of Nothing to tread upon the glorious Majeſty of God, and hence is not affected with it; but when God is ſeen by the Spirit of Conviction, in his great Glory, then as He is great, Sin is ſeen great; as his Glory affects and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Soul, ſo Sin affects the Heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a conſtant Light; the Soul ſees Sin and Death continually before it; <hi>God's Arrows ſtick faſt in the Soul,</hi> and cannot be pluck'd out; <hi>my Sin is ever before me,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> (in his renewing the Work of Converſion.) For in effectual Conviction the Mind is not only bound to ſee the Miſery lying upon it, but it is held bound: It is ſuch a Sun-light as never can be quenched, tho' it may be clouded. When the Spirit of Chriſt darts in any Light to ſee Sin, the Soul would turn away from looking upon it, would
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005059_0028_1016958FC3149EB8"/>
not hear on that Ear, <hi>Felix</hi>-like. But the Spirit of Conviction ſent to make thoro' Work on the Hearts of all the Elect, follows them, meets them at every Turn, forceth them to ſee and remember what they have done; the leaſt Sin is now a Mote in the Eye, is ever troubling. Thoſe ghaſtly, dreadful Objects of Sin, Death, Wrath, being preſented by the Spirit near unto the Soul, fix the Eye to faſten here; they that can caſt off at their Pleaſure the Remembrance and Thoughts of Sin and Death, never prove ſound, until the Lord make them ſtay their Thoughts, and muſe deeply on what they have done, and whither they are going. And hence the Soul in lying down, riſing up, lies down &amp; riſes up with perplexed Tho'ts, What will become of me? The Lord ſometimes keeps it waking in the Night ſeaſon, when others are aſleep, and then it is haunted with thoſe Thoughts, it cannot ſleep; it looks back upon every Day and Week, Sabbath, Sermon, Prayer, Speeches, and thinks all this Day, this Week, &amp;c. the Goodneſs of the Lord and his Patience to a Wretch hath been continued; I ſin in all I do, in all my Prayers, in all I Think, the ſame Heart remains ſtill not humbled, not yet changed.</p>
                  <p>And hence you ſhall obſerve, that Word that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Sin firſt to it, it never goes out of the Mind; I think, ſaith the Soul, I ſhall never forget ſuch a Man, nor ſuch a Truth. Hence alſo if the Soul grow light and careleſs at ſome Time, and caſts off the Thoughts of theſe Things, the Spirit returns again, and falls a Reaſoning with the Soul, Why haſt thou done this? What Hurt hath the Lord done thee? Will there never be an End? Haſt not thou gone on long eno' in thy lewd Courſes againſt God, but that thou ſhouldſt ſtill add to the Heap? Haſt thou not Wrath enough upon thee already? How ſoon may the Lord ſtop thy

Haſt thou but one Friend, a patient, long-ſuffering God, that hath left thy Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Excuſe long ago, and therefore could have cut thee off, and doſt thou thus forſake him, thus abuſe him? Thus the Spirit follows; and hence the Soul comes to ſome Meaſure of Confeſſion of Sin: O Lord, I have done exceeding wickedly, I have been worſe than the Horſe that ruſheth into the Battle, becauſe it ſees not Death before it, but I have ſeen Death before me in theſe Ways, and yet go on, and ſtill Sin, and cannot but Sin: Behold me, Lord, for I am very vile. When thus the Spirit hath let into the Soul a clear, real, conſtant Light, to ſee Sin and Death, now there is a thoro' Conviction.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, In what Meaſure doth the Spirit communicate this Light?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore open the fourth Particular, <hi>viz.</hi>

I conceive the clear diſcerning of it is by the immediate and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Effect of it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo much as affects the Heart truly with Sin.</p>
                  <p>But if you aſk, <hi>What is that Senſe of Sin, and what Meaſure of this is neceſſary?</hi> That I ſhall anſwer in the Doctrine of Compunction.</p>
                  <p>Let not therefore any Soul be diſcouraged, and ſay, <hi>I was never yet convinced, becauſe I have not felt ſuch a clear, real, conſtant Light to ſee Sin and Death as others have done;</hi> conſider thou, if the End of Conviction be attained, which is a true Senſe and Feeling of Sin, thou haſt then that Meaſure which is moſt meet for thee, more than which the Lord regards not in any of his; but you that walk up and down with convinced Conſciences, and know your States are miſerable and ſinful, and that you periſh if you die in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet have no Senſe nor Feeling, no Sorrow nor Affliction of Spirit for thoſe Evils, I tell thee the very Devils are in ſome Reſpects nearer the Kingdom of God than you be, who ſee, and feel, and tremble; wo, wo to Thouſands that live under convicting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtries, whom the Word often hits, and the Lord by the Spirit oftens meets, and they hear and know their Sins are many, their Eſtates bad, and that Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

What is the End of that Light the Lord lets into the Underſtanding in other Things? Is it not that thereby the Heart might be affected thoro'ly with it? Why doth the Lord let in the Light of the Knowledge of Chriſt and of his Will?

If any ſay that the End of Conviction is to drive the Soul to Chriſt, I grant that this is the remote and laſt End of it, but the next End is Compunction.

I have known many that have come with Complaints, they were never humbled, they never felt it ſo, nor yet could tell the Time when it was ſo, yet there hath been &amp; many Times they have ſeen it by the Help of other Spectacles, and bleſt God for it. When they in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.17. complained, <hi>Lord, why haſt thou hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Hearts from thy Fear:</hi> Do you think there was no ſoftneſs nor ſenſibleneſs indeed? Yes verily, but they felt nothing but a hard Heart, nay, ſuch Hardneſs as if the Lord had plagued them with it by his own immediate Hand, and not born and bred with them only, as with other Men. Many a Soul may think the Lord hath left it, nay, ſmitten it with a hard Heart, and ſo make his Moan of it, yet the Lord hath wro't real Softneſs under felt Hardneſs, as many Times in Roprobates there is felt Softneſs, when within there is real Hardneſs. The ſtony-ground Hearers were plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and broken on the Top, but were ſtony at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Some Men may be wounded outwardly and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, this may eaſily be diſcerned. The Lord may wound others and they may bleed out; their ſorrow is mere inward and ſecret, and therefore cannot point with their Finger to their Wound as others can.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Rule.</hi> Do not think the Lord works Compunction in all the Elect in the ſame circumſtantial Work of the Spirit, but only in the ſame ſubſtantial Work: The Lord works a true ſenſe of ſin for Subſtance and Truth of it, yet there are many circumſtantial Works, like ſo many Enlargements and Comments upon one and the

This I ſpeak, becauſe you may the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Meaning of God's Servants in opening the Work of Humiliation. You may hear them ſay, the Soul doth this, and thinks that, and ſpeak another Thing; it may be every one does not ſo think in the ſame individual Circumſtances, and therefore are to be underſtood as producing only <hi>exemplum in re ſimili;</hi> ſomething like this or for the Subſtance of this is there wrought.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Rule.</hi> In this Work of Compunction we muſt not bring Rules unto Men, but Men to Rules; crook not God's Rules to the Experience of Men (which is fallible, and many Times corrupt) but bring Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rule, and try Men's Eſtates herein by that: For many will ſay, ſome Men are not humbled at all, never had any precedent ſorrow for ſin. God's Mercy only hath melted their Hearts, and Experience proves this, and many find this, who are ſincere and gracious Chriſtians. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>We are not in this or any other Point to be guided by the Experience of Men only, but attend the Rule; if it be proved, that according unto the Rule Men muſt be broken and affected with their ſin and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before Mercy can be truly apprehended or Chriſt accepted; What tell you me of ſuch or ſuch Men? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What is the Reaſon?</p>
                  <p>Truly the Cauſe was here, their firſt Wound and Sorrow for Sin was not right, as hereafter ſhall be made good; many Thouſands are miſerably deceived about their Eſtates by this one Thing, of crooking and wreſting God's Rules to Chriſtians Experience; let all God's Servants tremble and be wary here; wrack not the holy Scriptures, nor force them to ſpeak as thou feeleſt, but try all Things by them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Rule.</hi> Do not make the Examples of converted Perſons in Scripture Patterns in all Things of Perſons unconverted: Do not make God's Work upon the one, run Parallel with God's Work upon the other.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, That many in Scripture are converted to Chriſt without any ſorrow for ſin, and produce the Example of <hi>Lydia,</hi> whoſe Heart God ſweetly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to receive Chriſt; and the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. converted in the ſame Manner.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Theſe are Examples of Perſons converted to God before, who did believe in the Meſſiah, but did not know that this Jeſus was the Meſſiah, which they ſoon did when the Lord ſent the Means to revea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005059_0046_101695C141036640"/>
So that ſuppoſe here was no ſenſe or ſorrow for ſin, at this Time; doth it therefore follow they never had any when the Lord at firſt wro't upon them? Are theſe Examples in Perſons converted, fit to ſhew forth God's Work in Perſons unconverted? In ſome Things indeed they are Examples, in others not ſo: Their Examples of believing in Chriſt are not in that act Examples of ſorrow for Want of Chriſt. And yet, let me add, To ſay that God opened <hi>Lydia</hi>'s Heart to believe in Chriſt, and yet opened not her Heart to lament her Sin and Miſery in her Eſtate without Chriſt (ſuppoſe ſhe were without Chriſt) is more then can be proved from the Text; for it is ſaid, <hi>Her Heart was opened to attend unto the Things that were ſpoken by Paul:</hi> And can any think that <hi>Paul,</hi> or an Apoſtle, ever preached Chriſt without Preaching the Need Men had of him? And could any preach their Need of Chriſt, withing Preaching Men's undone and ſinful Eſtate without Chriſt? And do you think that <hi>Lydia</hi> was not made to attend unto this? Do you think that when <hi>Philip</hi> came to open the 53d of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to the Eunuch, that <hi>Chriſt was bruiſed for our Iniquities;</hi> that he did not let him underſtand the infinite Evil of Sin and Miſery of all Sinners, and of him in ſpecial, unleſs the Lord Jeſus was bruiſed for him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Rule.</hi> In Examples recorded in the Scripture of God's converting Grace, do not think they had no Sorrow for Sin, becauſe it is not diſtinctly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſet down in all Places: For the Scripture u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſets down Matters very briefly; it oftentimes ſuppoſeth many Things, and refers us to judge of ſome by other Places; as <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7. it is ſaid, <hi>Many of the Prieſts were obedient to the Faith;</hi> doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that they did immediately believe without

any Senſe of Sin? Look to a fuller Example, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and then we may ſee, as the one were converted to the Faith, ſo were the other, having a Hand in the ſame Sin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Paul,</hi> he was a <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, but the Lord received him to Mercy,</hi> and that <hi>God's Grace was abundant in Faith and Love:</hi> Doth it hence follow that <hi>Paul</hi> had no caſting down, becauſe not mention'd here? If we look upon <hi>Acts</hi> 9. we ſhall ſee it otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Rule.</hi> Do not judge of general and common Workings of the Spirit upon the Souls of any to be the Beginnings of effectual and ſpecial Converſion; for a Man may have ſome inward and yet common Knowledge of the Goſpel and Chriſt in it, before there be any ſorrow for ſin; yet it doth not hence follow that the Lord begins not with Compunction and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, becauſe common Work is not ſpecial and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Work; when the Spirit thus comes, he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins here, as we ſhall prove.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Rule.</hi> The Terrors, and Fears, and Senſe of Sin and Death, be in themſelves Afflictions of Soul, and of themſelves drive from Chriſt; yet in Hand of Chriſt, by the Power of the Spirit, they are made to lead, or rather drive unto Chriſt, which is able to turn Mourning into Joy, as well as after Mourning to give Joy; and therefore 'tis a vain Thing to think there is no need of ſuch Sorrows which drive Men from Chriſt; and that Chriſt can work well enough therefore without them; when as by the mighty Power and Riches of Mercy in Chriſt, the Lord by wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nay, killing his of all their carnal Security and ſelf-confidence, ſaves all his alive, and drives them to ſeek for Life in the Son.</p>

Elſe a Sinner will never part with his Sin; a bare Conviction of Sin doth but light the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to ſee Sin; Compunction burns his Fingers, and that only makes him dread the Fire, <hi>Cleanſe your Hearts ye Sinners, and purify your Hearts ye double-minded Men,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 4. Verſe 8.) But how ſhould this be done? He anſwers Verſe 9. <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep, turn your Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Mourning.</hi> So <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. the Prophet calls upon his Hearers to turn from their Sin unto the Lord; but how? <hi>Rend your Hearts, and not your Garments.</hi> Not that they were able to do this, but by what Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he requires of all in general; he thereby effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works in the Hearts of all the Elect in particular; for every Man naturally takes Pleaſure, nay, all his Delight and Pleaſure is in nothing elſe but Sin; for God he hath none, but that. Now ſo long as he takes Pleaſure in Sin, and finds Contentment by Sin, be cannot but cleave inſeparably to it: Oh 'tis ſweet, and it only is ſweet; for ſo long the Soul is dead in Sin. <hi>Pleaſure in Sin is Death in Sin,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6.

                  <p>'Tis true, I confeſs, a Man ſometimes may part with Sin without Sorrow; the unclean Spirit may go out for a Time, before he is taken, bound and ſlain

by the Power of Chriſt. But ſuch a kind of parting is but the waſhing of the Cup, 'tis unſafe and unſound, and the End of ſuch a Chriſtian will be miſerable; for a Man to hear of his Sin, and then to ſay, I'll do no more ſo, without any Senſe or Sorrow for it, would not have been approved by <hi>Paul,</hi> if he had ſeen no more in the careleſs <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (2 Cor. 7.10.) in tolerating the inceſtuous Perſon; but their Sorrow wro't this Repentance. No, the Lord abhors ſuch whoriſh wiping the Lips; and therefore the ſame Apoſtle, (1 Cor. 5.2.) when he reproves them for not ſeparating the Sinner, and ſo the Sin from them, he ſums it up in one Word, <hi>You have not mourned, that ſuch a one might be taken from you:</hi> Becauſe then Sin is ſevered truly from the Soul, when Sorrow or Shame, from Senſe and Feeling of the Evil of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins it. Not only Sin is oppoſite to God, but when the Lord Jeſus firſt comes near his Elect in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eſtate, they are then Enemies themſelves by Sin unto God. And hence it is they will never part with their Weapons, until themſelves be thoroughly Wounded: And therefore the Lord muſt wound their Conſciences, Minds and Hearts, before they will caſt them by. Now if there be no parting with, no Separation from Sin, but Sin is as ſtrong, and the Sinner as vile as ever before, hath Chriſt (who now comes to ſave his Elect from Sin) the End of his Work? What is the Man the better for Conviction, Affection to Chriſt, name what you can, that remains ſtill in his Sins? When the Apoſtle would ſum up all the Miſery of Men, he doth it in thoſe Words, (1 Cor. 15.17.) <hi>Ye are yet in your Sins:</hi> So I ſay, thou art convicted, but art yet in thy Sin; art affect with Chriſt, and takeſt hold of Chriſt, but art yet in thy Sin; <hi>he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his Sin, ſhall find Mercy.</hi>

Becauſe without this, no Man will either Care for Chriſt, or feel a Need of Chriſt; a Man may ſee a Want of Chriſt by the Power of Conviction, but he will never feel a Need of Chriſt but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Compunction. <hi>The Whole need not the Phyſician,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005059_0051_101695D0F45C53D0"/>
but they that are Sick.</hi> A whole Man may ſee his Want of a Phyſician, but a ſick Man only feels his Need of him, will prize him, ſend for him. By <hi>the Whole</hi> are not to underſtand ſuch as have no Need of Chriſt (for what Sinner but hath Need of him?) but ſuch as feel no Need of him: As by <hi>Sick</hi> cannot be meant ſuch as are ſinful and miſerable, for then Chriſt ſhould come actually to ſave all Men; but thoſe that did feel themſelves ſo, as a ſick Man that feels his Sickneſs; theſe only are the Men that feel a Need and Neceſſity of Chriſt; theſe only will come to Chriſt, and be glad of Chriſt, and be very thankful for their Recovery of Chriſt. And hence ariſeth the great Sin of the World in deſpiſing the Goſpel, not at all affected with the glad Tydings of it, becauſe they are not affected with their Sin and Miſery; or if they be affected but in Part with the Goſpel, it is becauſe they are not thoro'ly affected with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery before.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, that when the Lord called his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him, yet they would <hi>not come to him (Jer.</hi> 2.31.) becauſe they were <hi>Lords,</hi> and well eno' without him. Why did not they come to the Supper, being invited? It wat becauſe they had <hi>Farms</hi> and <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> to attend unto; they felt no Need of Coming, as the <hi>poor, lame, blind,</hi> and <hi>halt</hi> did, (<hi>Luke</hi> 14.) The Prodigal cares not for Father not Father's Houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he comes to ſee, <hi>Here I die, (Luke</hi> 15.17.) It is true, the Grace of the Goſpel draws Men unto Chriſt; but it is very obſervable, that the Goſpel reveals no Grace, but with Reſpect and in Reference unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Men in extream Miſery; the Goſpel ſaith not that Chriſt is <hi>come to ſave;</hi> but <hi>to ſave Sinners,</hi> and <hi>to ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> It reveals not this, that <hi>God juſtifies Men,</hi> but <hi>he juſtifies the Ungodly;</hi> it
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005059_0052_101695D4CF8CF8E8"/>
reveals not this, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8.) that <hi>Chriſt died for us,</hi> but that <hi>he died for them that were Weak, for Sinners, for Enemies.</hi> And if ſo, can any Man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that this News will be ſweet, unleſs Men ſee and feel the infinite Miſery of Sin, and the Fruits of it? Will not Men ſay or think, what great Matter is there in that? ſuppoſe we be Sinners and Enemies, yet we are well enough; (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.7.) before Chriſt comes a Man's Life lies in his Sin. Now ſuppoſe any ſhould proclaim to a Company of Men the great Favour of their Prince towards them, that he is ſuch a gracious Prince, as will take away all their Lives; will this be glad Tydings? Goſpel Grace cannot be ſet out, much leſs felt, but in Reference to Sin and Miſery, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.) which muſt be firſt felt, before it can be ſweet.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe Chriſt will never come but only unto ſuch as feel their Miſery; for you will ſay, a Man may come to Chriſt without it: I ſay again, If he doth (as he hath many Followers) yet Chriſt will not come to him, nor commit himſelf to him; (Mat. 9.13.) <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance;</hi> in which Place note, that as by the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> is not meant ſuch as are ſincerely ſo, but ſuch as think and find themſelves ſo; ſo by <hi>Sinners,</hi> is not meant all Manner of impenitent and hard-hearted Sinners, but ſuch as think and feel themſelves ſuch, and lament under it: Now God the Father ſent him only unto ſuch; he is ſent not <hi>to heal</hi> the hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>the broken-hearted;</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.18.) Indeed he is ſent to make Men broken-hearted, who have hard Hearts; but he is not ſent to heal them until then; the Lord leaves the Ninety nine that needs to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to wilder for ever; the one loſt Sheep, who feels itſelf ſo, and feels a Need of a Saviour to come

and find it out; who cannot come and find out him: The Lord Jeſus will come unto, and unto him only, leaving all the Ninety nine, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. This may laſtly appear, by conſidering the End of Man's Fall into ſin, and the publiſhing of the Law to reveal ſin; and of the Goſpel alſo in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto Sin and Miſery; why did the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Fall of Man? What was his great Plot in it? It is apparent this, that thereby Way might be made for the greater Manifeſtation of God's Grace in Chriſt. The Serpent poiſons all Mankind, that the Seed of the Woman might have the Glory of recovering ſome: This was God's laſt End: The Perdition of ſome (of themſelves) being but ſubordinate unto this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. Surely <hi>Adam</hi> might have glorified Grace if he had ſtood, and God had revealed his Grace in preſerving him (made mutable) from falling. But the Lord ſaw Grace ſhould not be ſufficiently advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to its higheſt Dignity by this, and therefore ſuffers him actually to fall, and that into an extream Depth of Miſery. Now conſider, Man's Fall in it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Mean of glorifying Grace, but rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures all the Glory of God; how ſhall the Lord at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his End then hereby? Truly if the Lord let Men ſee and feel their Fall and Miſery by it, now Grace offered will be accepted and glorified. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſends the Law to reveal ſin, and make it exceeding ſinful; and Death for ſin that this End might be attained, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. And therefore feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin and Death and Miſery being the Means, muſt precede the other as the End; and therefore as Grace may be ſeen by Conviction of Miſery, ſo the Sweetneſs of it only can be felt by feeling Miſery in this Work of Compunction.</p>

Let me open theſe particularly, that you may taſte and try the Truth of what I now deliver.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="unknown:005059_0055_101695DBD4C91B20"/>The Lord Chriſt therefore lets in this Fear, that look as the Lord when he came to conquer the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi> Exod. 23.27, 28. <hi>He ſent his Hornets before him,</hi> which were certain Fears, which made their Hearts faint in the Day of Battle, and by this ſubdued them; ſo the Lord Chriſt when he comes to conquer a poor ſinner that hath long reſiſted him, and would go on to his own Perdition, lets in theſe Fears, that the Soul ſhrinks in with the Thoughts of its woful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and crys out ſecretly, Lord what will become of me, If I die in this Condition? <hi>Paul</hi> (Acts 3.6.) trembles aſtoniſhed at his Miſery and Wickedneſs, and now he cries out; the Jaylor was very cruel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paul,</hi> (Acts 16.) but when the Lord Jeſus comes to reſcue him from this Condition, you ſhall ſee him trembling. The Lord hath let in that Fear, that now he is content to do any Thing to be ſaved from the Danger he ſaw he was now in; when a Man ſees Danger and great Danger near and imminent, now Man naturally fears it: Before Chriſt come, the Soul may ſee its Miſery, but apprehends it far off, and hoping to eſcape it, and hence doth not tear it; but when the Lord Jeſus comes, he preſents a Man's Danger, Death, Wrath, and Eternity near unto him, and hence hath no Hope to eſcape it, as now he is, and therefore doth fear; and ſeeing the Miſery exceeding great, he hath an exceeding great (tho' oft-times deep) Fear of it; as Men near Death, and apprehending it ſo, begin then to be troubled, and cry out when it is too late. The Lord Jeſus deals more mercifully with the Elect, and brings Death and Eternity near them before they draw near to it; whiles it is called to Day: The poor Jaylor began to think of killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when Fears were upon him, (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.) and ſo many under this ſtroke of Chriſt, have the ſame Tho'ts,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005059_0056_101695E136B11940"/>
becauſe they ſee no Hope; but this Meaſure is not in all, this Work is in all. <hi>Put them in fear, O Lord, that they may know they be but Men,</hi> (Pſal. 9, 20.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Fear comes, Men are above God, and think they can ſtand it out againſt him; the Lord therefore lets in this Fear to make them know they be but Men, and that as proud, and ſtout, and great as they are, yet that they are not above God, and that it is in vain to kick againſt the Pricks, and go on as they have done; for if they do, he will not endure it long: <hi>The Spirit of Bondage makes</hi> Men <hi>fear,</hi> before <hi>the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> comes, thoſe Fears therefore are ſuch, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, after they have received the <hi>Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> never have; and therefore they are ſuch as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Soul with ſome threatning of the Word, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Death and Perdition to him in that Eſtate: <hi>e. g. He that believes not is condemned already,</hi> thus the Word ſpeaks to Conſcience, <hi>John</hi> 3.17. Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt not ſaith a Man's own Conſcience, the Spirit Witneſſing with it, therefore thou art Condemned ſaith Conſcience; now the Spirit of Bondage, is the Teſtimony of God's Spirit Witneſſing to both the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Concluſion: Now this Spirit no Regenerate Man indeed ever hath after this Time, but the Fears he hath ariſe from another Principle of Corruption of Conſcience, and Malice of Satan thro' the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Spirit leaving him; not from any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Witneſs of the Spirit of any ſuch untruth, which yet is truth, while the Soul is under this Stroke and not Regenerate: Mark therefore diligently that this Fear is the Work of the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, and hence it follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That theſe Fears are not meerly natural, (as thoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.) ariſing from natural Conſcience only, which only accuſe of Sin, but never affect? but
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005059_0057_101695E2C5C70100"/>
they are ſupernatural, they are Arrows ſhot into the Conſcience by the Arm of the Spirit; ſo dreadful that no Word nor Meditation of Death and Eternity can beget ſuch Fears, but creates them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that they are clear Fears, (for the Spirit's Work is ever clear before he leaves it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13.) they are not blind confuſed Fears, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious and ſad Conjectures, whereby many a Man is afraid and much afraid and affrighted like Men in a Dream, that think they are in Hell, yet cannot tell what that Evil is which they fear; but they are clear Fears whereby they diſtinctly know and ſee that they are miſerable, and what that Miſery is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence it follows that they are ſtrong Fears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the almighty Hand of the Spirit ſets them on, and ſhakes the Soul; they are not weak Fears which a Man can ſhake off, or cure by weak Hopes, Sleep or Buſineſs, &amp;c. like ſome Winds that ſhake the Tree, but never blow it down: But theſe Fears ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Spirit preſenting the greateſt Evil in eternal Separation from God: hence no Evil in this World is ſo dreadful as this, I had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never been born than to bear it (ſaith the Soul) and hence caſts off all other Thoughts, and cannot be quiet; and hence it is that theſe Fears force a Man to fly and ſeek out for a better Condition. A Man like <hi>Lot</hi> lingers in his Sin, but theſe Fears like the Angel drive him violently out, the Lord ſaying to him, Away for thy Life, leſt thou periſh with the World, for thy ſins are come up to Heaven, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſins grown ſo many and great, that they are an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Burden for the Soul of God to bear any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? And hence you ſhall obſerve, if the Soul after ſad Fears grows bold and careleſs again, the Spirit purſues it with more Cauſe of Fear, and now the Soul crys out, Did the Lord ever elect thee? Chriſt ſhed his Blood to ſave his People <hi>from</hi> their ſins, thou liveſt yet <hi>in</hi> thy ſins, did he ever ſhed his Blood for thee? Thou haſt ſinned againſt Conſcience, after thou haſt been enlightned, and fallen back again, haſt thou not therefore committed the unpardonable Sin? Thou haſt had many a fair Seaſon of ſeeking God, but haſt dallied and dream'd away thy Time; is not the Day of Grace therefore now paſt? It is true, the Lord is yet patient and bountiful, and lets thee live on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mercy, but is not all this to aggravate thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt that great and dreadful Day of the Lord which is at Hand? Are there not better Men in Hell then thou art that never committed the like ſin? Thus the Spirit purſues with ſtrong Fears, till proud Man falls down to the Duſt before God. The Soul is now under Fears, not above them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot come out of theſe Chains, by the moſt comfortable Doctrine it hears, nor particular Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it by the moſt merciful Miniſters in the World, until the Lord ſay, as Lam. 3, 57. <hi>Fear not;</hi> the Lord only can aſſwage theſe ſtrong Winds, and raging Waters, in which there is no other Cry heard of this Soul thus toſſed with Tempeſts, but O I periſh? Only the Lord making Way for the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe in his Elect; drives them out to ſeek if there be any Hope, and ſo they are not properly deſperate Fears, yet as I ſay, ſtrong Fears, not alike extenſively, yet alike intenſively ſtrong in all; a ſmall Evil when Tidings is bro't of it he doth not fear, but if
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005059_0059_101695E74AA6DA38"/>
the Evil be apprehended great and near too, the very Suſpicion of it makes the Heart tremble; when a Houſe is on Fire, or a mighty Army entred the Land and near the City, Children that know not the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Evil fear them not; but Men that know the Danger are full of Fear. The Wrath of the Lord that fire thoſe Armies of everlaſting Woes, are great Evils, the blind World may not much fear them, but all the Elect whoſe Minds are convinced to ſee the Greatneſs of them, cannot but Fear, and that with ſtrong and conſtant Fears; nor is it Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but Duty, to fear theſe <hi>everlaſting Burnings.</hi> And hence the Soul in this Caſe wonders at the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the World, dreads the Terrors of the Lord that are near them, and uſually ſeeks to awaken all its poor Friends. I once tho't my ſelf well, and was quiet as you be, but the Lord hath let me ſee my Wo, which I cannot but fear; O look you to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord works this Fear in ſome in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in others in a leſſer Meaſure. O conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord hath thus affected your Hearts with fear; Oh, ſecure Times what will God do with us! Many of you having heard the Voice of the Lion roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet you tremble not. The Lord hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told you of Death and eternal Wo for the leaſt ſin, do you believe it, and yet fear it not? How art thou then forſaken of God? Many of you that like old Marriners can laugh at all foul Weather, and like Weather-Cocks ſet your Faces againſt all Winds; and if you be damned at laſt you cannot help it, you muſt bear it as well as you can, you hope to do it as well as others ſhall do: Oh! how far are ſuch from the Kingdom of God, the Lord not yet working nor pricking thy Heart ſo much as with Fear?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:005059_0060_101695EC851B6750"/>2. Sorrow and Mourning for Sin is the ſecond Thing wherein Compunction conſiſts. And look as Fear plucks the Soul from Security in ſeeing no Evil to come; to Sorrow takes off the preſent Pleaſure and Delight in ſin, in a greater Meaſure than Fear doth. The Lord therefore having ſmitten the Soul, or ſhot the Arrows of Fear into the Soul; it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grows exceeding ſad and heavy, thinking within it ſelf, What good do Wife or Children, Houſe or Lands, Peace and Friends, Health and Reſt do me? in the mean Time, condemned to die, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; it may be reprobated, never to ſee God's Face more: The Guilt and Power of ſin in Heart and Life living ſtill upon me? And hereupon the Soul mourns in the Day, and in the Night, deſires to go alone and weep; and there confeſſeth its Vileneſs before God, all the Days of Vanity, and Sins of Ignorance, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh what have I done! and ſeeks for Mercy, but not one ſmile, nothing but Clouds of Anger appear; and then thinks, if this Anger, the Fruit of my Sin, be ſo great, Oh what are my Sins, the Cauſe hereof! When the Angel had ſet out the Sin of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in making a League with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> (Judges 2.1.) and told them that they ſhould be <hi>Thorns in their Sides,</hi> they <hi>ſat down,</hi> (Verſe 4.) <hi>and lift up their Voice, and wept:</hi> ſo 'tis with a contrite ſinner. Note nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly that eminent Place of Scripture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.3. the Lord Chriſt is ſent <hi>to appoint Beauty for Aſhes, and the Oil of Joy for the Spirit of Heavineſs to them that mourn.</hi> Out of which Note theſe four Things for the Explication of this Sorrow or Mourning.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſuch a Mourning as is precedent unto ſpiritual Joy. And hence it is not ſaid, I will give the Spirit of Gladneſs to beget Mourning, (tho' the Lord doth ſo after Converſion) but this goes in order before that. <hi>Ephraim</hi> like, who ſeeing what an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005059_0061_101695EE1090EBC8"/>
Beaſt</hi> he had been, <hi>unaccuſtomed to God's Yoke, ſmites upon his Thigh,</hi> and <hi>bemoans</hi> himſelf, (Jer. 31.18.) It is God's Method (after his Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>le have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to ſad their Hearts, and then to turn Mourning into Joy; much more at firſt Beginning of God's Work upon the Soul, they ſhall firſt mourn, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſmite upon the Thigh: If God wounds the Soul for ſin, it ſhall ſmart, and bleed too, before God will heal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a great Mourning, becauſe it is called <hi>a Spirit of Mourning,</hi> Hoſ. 6.1, 2. As a <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> is a deep Slumber. When the poor Jews ſhall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their great Sin ſhall then be preſented before them, of curſing and crucifying the Lord of Life; as it was to thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. And by reaſon of this, there ſhall be <hi>a great Mourning,</hi> Zech. 12.11. that they ſhall deſire to go alone in ſecret <hi>every one apart,</hi> and take their Fill of Mourning, before the Lord <hi>open the Fountain of Grace,</hi> Chap. 13.1. It is not a Summer Cloud, or an <hi>April</hi> Shower, that is ſoon ſpent, but a great Mourning. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before this Spirit of Sorrow comes, a Man's Heart takes great delight in his ſin, 'tis his God, his Life, and ſweeter than Chriſt, and all the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore there muſt be great Sorrow, ſin muſt be made exceeding bitter. A Man that is very hungry and thirſty after his Luſt, muſt find ſuch Meat and Drink exceeding bitter, elſe he will feed on it. <hi>Solomon</hi> took great Content in Women, but what ſaith he when the Lord humbled him? <hi>I find a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more bitter than Death,</hi> Eccl. 7.26. Hear this you Harlots, and you that live in your wanton Luſts, the Lord will make your ſweet Morſels more bitter than Death to you, if the Lord ſaves you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the greateſt Evils are the Objects of this Sorrow, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin and Death. It is true, a Man may mourn for ſmaller Evils ſooner; but when the Spirit
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005059_0062_101695F0B6F89608"/>
ſets on the greateſt Evils, then they ſad much more. <hi>Mine Iniquities are too heavy to bear,</hi> Pſal. 38.1, 2. Why ſo? Many a Man can bear them without ſinking. True, but in the Elect the Spirit ſets on, loads the Soul herewith, <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. Becauſe the greateſt Evils lye upon the moſt tender Part of a tender Soul, preſſed down by the omnipotent Hand of Chriſt's Spirit: For now the Multitude of ſins more than the <hi>Hairs on the Head,</hi> (Pſal. 32.2, 3. and 40.12.) come now to Mind; as alſo the long Continuance in them, Cradle ſins. No ſooner, ſaith the Soul, did I begin to live, but I began to ſin. Obſtinacy alſo in them lies very heavy; I have had Warnings, Checks, Reſolutions againſt them, and yet have gone on, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19.) The Power of ſin alſo ſads it; that it is ſaid, Prov. 21.9. <hi>When the Wicked reign, the People mourn;</hi> ſo doth the Soul when it feels ſin reign. I cannot ſubdue it, nay, the Lord will not, that I fear, the Lord hath left me over to it. The Increaſe of Sin it feels, makes it mourn alſo (<hi>Dan.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.12.) I grow worſe and worſe, ſaith the Soul; the Leak comes in faſter than he can caſt it out. The Greatneſs of ſin makes it mourn: Was there ever ſuch a Sinner as I? And laſtly, the Senſe of Condemnation for ſin lies upon him; this is the Fruit of your evil Ways, ſaith the Spirit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> The Soul doth not let ſin paſs by it now as Water down the Mill, but being ſtop'd by Conviction and fear of the Evil of it, it ſwells high, and fills the Heart full of Grief and Sorrow, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Times it is overwhelmed therewith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſt will not be very ſweet, unleſs this Mourning under Miſery be very great; the healing of a cut Finger is ſweet, but of a mortal Wound is exceeding ſweet; a little Sorrow will
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005059_0063_101695F246E8EBC0"/>
make Chriſt ſweet, but great ſorrow under ſenſe of deadly Wounds is exceeding ſweet; and without this Chriſt hath not his Honour due to him, if he be not only ſweet, but alſo exceeding ſweet and precious.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is ſuch a ſorrow, as nothing but that that hath wounded the Soul can heal it. Let Men have the greateſt outward Troubles, outward Things can cure them; or elſe they will wear away. As if a Man be ſick, or in debt, Phyſick and Money can cure theſe; but this Wound, neither can, or ever ſhall be healed but by the Hand that wounded it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. And hence a Man can take no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Meat, Drink, Sleep, Friends, Mirth, nor Paſtime, while this Wound, this Sorrow laſts; for if any Thing elſe can heal it, it is not the right Wound or Sorrow the Lord breeds in his Elect. An adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heart indeed may be quieted with other Lovers; <hi>Cain</hi> can build away his Sorrow: Nay, I'll ſay more, this wounded Soul cannot comfort it ſelf by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, till the Lord come: <hi>David</hi> had a Promiſe of Pardon from <hi>Nathan,</hi> yet he cries out to the Lord <hi>to make him hear the Voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that his broken Bones might rejoice,</hi> Pſal. 51.8. Did not the Lord make him hear the Voice of Joy by <hi>Nathan:</hi> Yes, outwardly; but the Lord that had broke his Bones, muſt make him hear inwardly. Nay, when the Lord comes himſelf to comfort, much ado the Lord hath to make him hear it; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that <hi>hearkened not unto Moſes's Voice becauſe of their hard Bondage,</hi> that unleſs the Lord did invincibly Comfort, it would lie bleeding to Death, and never live. It muſt needs therefore be great Sorrow, which all the World, Men nor Angels can remove.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You may be confirmed in this, if laſtly you conſider the many Ways the Lord takes to beget
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005059_0064_101695F3F1F68318"/>
great Mourning, if the Soul will not be ſorrowful: As, ſometimes great Afflictions; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> muſt be taken in the Buſhes, and be caſt into Chains, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 53.11, 12.) Sometimes ſtrange Temptations, helliſh Blaſphemies, Is there a God? Are the Scriptures his Word? Why ſhould the Lord be ſo cruel as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate any of his Creatures, to torment it ſo long, &amp;c. Sometimes long Eclipſing of the Light of God's Countenance; no Prayers anſwered, but daily Bills of Indictment. And ſometimes it thinks it hears and feels a ſecret Teſtimony from God, that he never had a thought of Peace toward it, and that his Purpoſe is immutable. Sometimes it queſtions, Can God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins ſo great? Can it ſtand with his Honour to put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ud ſo much Wrong? Sometimes it feels its Heart ſo extream hard and dedolent, that it thinks the Lord hath ſealed it up under this Plague till the Judgment of the great Day. And ſometimes the Lord makes Melancholy a good Servant to him to further this Work of ſorrow. But thus the Lord rebukes many a hard-hearted ſinner, that will not bear the Yoke, nor feel the Load; and now the Lord turns the Beauty of the proudeſt into Aſhes, and withers the Glory of all Fleſh. Nay, ſometimes you ſhall obſerve the Lord tho' he comes not out as a <hi>Lion</hi> to rend, yet as a <hi>Moth</hi> he frets out by ſecret pinings and languiſhings, the ſenſeleſs ſecurity of Man, that he ſhall mourn to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe before he leave him. I do not mean by this, as if all Men had the like Meaſure of ſorrow; but a great ſorrow it is in all. Every Child is delivered by ſome Throws; thoſe that ſtick long in the Birth may feel them longer and very many.</p>
                  <p>Nor yet do I preſs a Neceſſity of Tears, or violent and tumultuous Complaints; the deepeſt Sorrows run with leaſt Noiſe. If a Man can have Tears for
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005059_0065_101695F8F267AFC0"/>
outward Loſſes, and none for ſins, 'tis very ſuſpicious whether he was ever truly ſorrowful for ſin; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as the greateſt Joys are not always expreſs'd in Laughture, ſo the greateſt ſorrows are not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in ſhedding of Tears; what the Meaſure of this great ſorrow is, we ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a conſtant Mourning, for ſo it is here called, <hi>a Spirit of Heavineſs;</hi> as that Woman that had a Spirit of Infirmity, and was bowed down many Years: <hi>Hannah</hi> conſtantly troubled, is called, <hi>a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a ſorrowful Spirit,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.12, 15. As <hi>the Spirit of Pride and Whoredom,</hi> Hoſ. 4.12. is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Frame, where tho' the Acts be ſometime ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the Spirit remains; ſo <hi>a Spirit of Mourning,</hi> ſuch ſorrow, as tho' the Acts of Mourning be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hindred, yet the ſpirit and ſpring remains; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites will mourn under Sin and Miſery, but what is it? It is <hi>the hanging down the Head like a Bull-ruſt,</hi> Iſai. 58.5. in bad Weather for a Day. Oh how many have Pangs and Gripes of Sorrow, and can quickly eaſe themſelves again! theſe Mourners come to nothing in the Concluſion: I grant the ſorrow and ſadneſs of Spirit may be interrupted, but it returns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and never leaves the Soul until the Lord look down from Heaven. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.48, 40, 50. The Cauſe continues, guilt and ſtrength of ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Effect contiues.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is ſuch a Sorrow as makes Way for Gladneſs, for ſo it is here ſaid, <hi>the Lord gives Beauty for</hi> theſe <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and hence it is no deſperate helliſh Sorrow, but uſually mixt with ſenſe of ſome Mercy, at leaſt common, and ſome Hope; not that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Object of Hope particularly (which is done in Vocation) but that the Lord may find out ſome way of ſaying it, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. which

I know it is in a greater Meaſure, and from ſome other Grounds after the Soul is in Chriſt; but this Sorrow there is for Subſtance, mentioned for the Reaſons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if Chriſt hate you, you ſhall mourn, but never till it be too late; if he love you, you muſt mourn now; how great and many are many of your ſins, how near is your Doom?

ſin in the Will which is mortified by a Spirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, after the Soul is emplanted into Chriſt; for Compunction, Contrition, Brokenneſs of Heart for ſin (call it what you will) is oppoſite to Hardneſs of Heart which is in every ſinner while Chriſt leave him; now in Hardneſs (as in a ſtone) there is, Firſt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs. Secondly, A cloſe cleaving of all the Parts together, whereby it comes to paſs that hard Things make Reſiſtance of what is caſt againſt them: ſo in Compunction there is not only ſenſibleneſs of the Evil of Sin and Death, by fear and ſorrow, but ſuch as makes a ſeparation of that cloſe Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sin and Soul: And hence it is that the Lord abhors all Faſtings, Humiliations, Prayers, Tears, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be of this ſtamp, and are accompanied with this Effect. The Lord flings the Dung of their <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sorrows,</hi> (Iſai. 58.5.) in their Faces, becauſe they did not <hi>break the Bands of Wickedneſs;</hi> to mourn for Sin and Miſery, and yet to be in thy ſin, is the Work of Juſtice on the damned in Hell, and all the Devils at this Day, that are pincht with their black Chains not looſened from them; and not the Work of the Grace of Chriſt in the Day of his Power, <hi>He that confeſſeth his Sin ſhall have Mercy;</hi> that is true, but remember the Meaning of that Confeſſion in the next Words, <hi>and forſaketh,</hi> he ſhall find Mercy, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13.) What is the End of the Mother in laying Wormwood and Gall upon her Breaſt, but that the Child by taſting the Bitterneſs of it might be weaned and have his Stomach and Will turned from it? What is the End of fear and ſorrow, but by this to turn away the Soul from ſin? This Point is weighty and full of Difficulty, of great Uſe, and worthy of deep Meditation, (<hi>Job</hi> 33.15, 16, 17.) For as the firſt Wound and ſtroke of the Spirit is, ſo it is in all
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005059_0068_101695FEE57124E0"/>
after-works of it, both of Faith and Holineſs in the Soul, if this be right, Faith is right, Holineſs is right; if this be imperfect, or naught, all is according to it afterward: The greateſt Difficulty lies here, to know what Meaſure of Separation from ſin the Spirit makes here; for after we are in Chriſt, then ſin is morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; how then is there any ſeparation of the Heart from it, before it doth fully believe; or what Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is there neceſſary? Here therefore I ſhall anſwer to the fourth and laſt Particular, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>What is the Meaſure of Compunction the Lord works in all the Elect?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So much Compunction or ſenſe of ſin is neceſſary as attains the End of it: Now what is the End of it? No other but that the Soul being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled might go to Chriſt (by Faith) to take away his ſin; the <hi>Finis proximus</hi> or next End of Compunction is Humiliation, that the Soul may be ſevered from ſin, as to renounce it ſelf for it; the <hi>Finis remotus,</hi> or laſt End is, that being thus humbled, it might go unto Chriſt to take away ſin: For, beloved, the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the World lies not ſo much in being ſinful under Guilt and Power of Sin as in being unwilling the Lord Jeſus ſhould take it away: This I ſay is the greateſt Hindrance of Salvation, John 3.19. and 5.40. <hi>O Jeruſalem wilt thou not be made clean?</hi> Jer. 13.27. that was their great Evil, they were not only <hi>polluted,</hi> but they <hi>would not be made clean:</hi> The Lord Jeſus therefore rolls away this ſtone from the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, beats down this Mountain; and becauſe it muſt firſt believe in Chriſt before it can receive Grace from Chriſt, it muſt come to Chriſt to take away ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord will do it; hence ſo much looſening from ſin as makes the Soul thus to come, is neceſſary. So much fear and ſorrow as looſens from ſin, and ſo
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005059_0069_1016960108BA4890"/>
much looſening from ſin as makes the Soul willing, as at leaſt not unwilling that the Lord Jeſus ſhould take it away, is neceſſary: For who ever comes to Chriſt, or is not unwilling Chriſt ſhould come to him to take away all his ſin, hath (whatever he thinks) ſome antecedent looſening and ſeparation from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Oh, ſaith a poor ſinner, when the Lord hath ſtruck his Heart, and he feels Guilt, and Terror, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrength of Corruption, if the Lord Jeſus would take away theſe Evils from me, tho' I cannot, Means cannot, that will be exceeding rich Mercy. The Lord doth not wound the Heart to this End, that the Soul ſhould firſt heal it ſelf, before it come to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but that it might ſeek out, or feeling its Need, be willing and deſirous of a Phyſician, the Lord Jeſus, to come and heal it. It is the great Fault of many Chriſtians, either their Wounds and Sorrows are ſo little, they deſire not to be healed; or if they do, they labour to heal themſelves firſt, before they come to the Phyſician for it; they will firſt make themſelves holy, and put on their Jewels, and then believe in Chriſt. And hence are thoſe many Complaints, What have I to do with Chriſt? Why ſhould he have to do with me that have ſuch an unholy, vile, hard, blind, and moſt wicked Heart? If I were more humbled, and more holy, then I would go to him, and think he would come to me. O for the Lord's ſake diſhonour not the Grace of Chriſt. It is true, thou canſt not come to Chriſt, till thou art loaden, and humbled, and ſeparated from thy ſin. Thou canſt not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into this Olive, unleſs thou be cut, and cut off too from the old Root<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet remember for ever, that no more ſorrow for ſin, no more ſeparation from ſin is neceſſary to thy Cloſing with Chriſt, than ſo much as makes thee willing, or rather not unwilling
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005059_0070_10169604EC0E8C98"/>
that the Lord ſhould take it away. And know it, if thou ſeekeſt for a greater Meaſure of Humiliation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to thy Cloſing with Chriſt than this, thou ſheweſt the more Pride therein, who wilt rather go into thy ſelf to make thy ſelf holy and humble, that thou mighteſt be worthy of Chriſt, than go out of thy ſelf, unto the Lord Jeſus, to take thy ſin away. In a Word, who thinkeſt Chriſt cannot love thee, until thou makeſt thy ſelf fair, and when thou thinkeſt thy ſelf ſo (which is Pride) wilt then think otherwiſe of Chriſt. The Lord therefore when he teacheth his People how to return unto him after grievous Sins, directs them to this Courſe, not to go about the Buſh to remove their Iniquities themſelves, or to ſtay and live ſecurely in their ſins, until the Lord did it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but bids them come to him and ſay, <hi>Take away Lord) all Iniquities,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1, 2, 3. You ſhall ſee <hi>Ephraim bemoaning himſelf,</hi> Jer. 31.18. But how? Doth he ſay he feels his ſins now all remov'd? No, but he deſires the Lord <hi>to turn him,</hi> and then (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall be turned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I ſhall never turn from this ſtubborn vile Heart, nor ſo much as turn to thee, to take it away, unleſs thou doſt turn to me, and then I ſhall be turned to purpoſe. What ſaith the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Church? <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let us go unto the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 6.1. They might object and ſay, Alas, the Lord is our Enemy, and wounds us, and hath broken us to Pieces, we are not yet healed, but lie dead as well as wounded; ſhall ſuch dead Spirits live? Mark what follows, True indeed, <hi>he hath wounded us,</hi> let us therefore go to him, that he may <hi>heal</hi> us, and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two Days he will revive us.</hi> The Lord requires no more of us than thus to come to him. Indeed after a Chriſtian is in Chriſt, labour for more and more ſenſe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005059_0071_101696079BF81C48"/>
of ſin, that may drive you nearer and nearer unto Chriſt. Yet know before you come to him, the Lord requires no more than thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp; as he requires no more than this, ſo 'tis his own Spirit (not our Abilities) that muſt alſo work this; and thus much he will work, &amp; doth require of all whom he purpoſeth to ſave. If thou wilt not come to Chriſt to take away thy ſins, thou ſhalt undoubtedly periſh in them. If the Lord work that ſorrow, ſo as to be willing the Lord ſhould take them away, thou ſhalt be undoubtedly ſaved from them.</p>
                  <p>If you would know what Meaſure of Willingneſs to have Chriſt take away ſin is required; you ſhall hear when we come to open the fourth Particular in the Doctrine of Faith.</p>
                  <p>If you further aſk, <hi>How the Spirit works this Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Sin in the Work of Compunction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt works this by a double Act,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Moral.</item>
                     <item>2. Phyſical.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>As in the Converſion of the ſoul by Faith unto God, the Spirit is not only a moral Agent perſwading, but alſo a ſupernatural Agent, phyſically working the Heart to believe, by a divine and immediate Act; ſo in the Averſion of the ſoul from ſin, the Spirit doth affect the Heart with fear and ſorrow morally, but this can never take away ſin, as we ſee in <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> deeply affected and afflicted in Spirit, and yet in their ſin. And therefore the Spirit puts forth its own Hand phyſically or immediately, and his own Arm brings Salvation to us, by a further ſecret immediate Stroke, turning the iron Neck, cutting the iron ſinnews of ſin, and ſo makes the Diſunion or Separation. You think it is eaſy to be willing that Chriſt ſhould come and take away all your ſins; I tell you the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Arm of the Lord that inſtructed <hi>Jeremy</hi> in a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005059_0072_1016960B8E9D93C0"/>
ſmaller Matter, can only inſtruct you here; both theſe Acts ever go together, according to the Meaſure mentioned; the latter cannot be without the firſt, the firſt is in vain without the latter.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But what Evil in Sin doth the Spirit morally affect the Heart with, and ſo phyſically turn it from Sin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He affects the ſoul with it as the greateſt Evil: by <hi>Sin</hi> I mean not as conſidered without <hi>Death,</hi> (for at this Time the Soul is not ſo ſpiritual, as that <hi>Sin,</hi> without Conſideration of <hi>Death,</hi> and the Wrath due to it ſhould affect it) but Sin and Death, ſin arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Wrath, ſin working Death, pricks the Heart as the greateſt Evil, and ſo lets out that Core at the Bottom, as may fit the Soul for healing.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Spirit make a Man feel ſin truly, the Soul feels it as it is; it is not the Name and Talk of the Danger of ſin that trouble it, but the Spirit (ever making Things real) loads the Soul with it indeed, and as it is; now it is the greateſt Evil, and therefore ſo it feels ſin. Believe it, you never felt ſin indeed as it is, if you have not felt it thus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Elſe no Man will prize Chriſt as the greateſt Good, without which no Man ſhall have him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Elſe a Man will live and continue in ſin. If ſin had been a greater Evil to <hi>Pilate</hi> than the Loſs of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friendſhip, he would never have crucified Chriſt. If ſin had been a greater Evil to <hi>Jehu</hi> than the Loſs of his Kingdom, he had never kept up the two Calves. If ſin were a greater Evil than Poverty, Shame, Grief in this World, many a Profeſſor would never loſe Chriſt and a good Conſcience too, for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Gain, Profit or Honour. Beloved, the great Curſe and Wrath of the Lord upon all Men in the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005059_0073_1016960D173CEDC8"/>
World almoſt is this, that the greateſt Evils ſhould be the leaſt of all felt; and the ſmalleſt Evils moſt of all complained of. What is Death that only ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates thy Soul from thy Body, to ſin that ſeparates God bleſſed for ever from thy Soul? (<hi>Acts</hi> 3.16.) And therefore the Lord Jeſus will remove this Curſe from whom he ſaves.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. But you will ſay, <hi>What is that Evil the Soul ſees at this Time, that thus affects the Heart with it, as the greateſt Evil?</hi> This is the laſt Difficulty here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a threefold Evil eſpecially ſeen in ſin:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Evil of Torment and Anguiſh.</item>
                     <item>2. The Evil of Wrong and Injury to God.</item>
                     <item>3. The Evil of Separation of the Soul from God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The firſt may affect Reprobates, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> who were ſore diſtreſſed when they felt the Anguiſh of Conſcience by ſin.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is only in thoſe who are actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, called, and ſanctified, who lament ſin as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and a God reconciled to them, and as it is againſt the Life of God begun in them; and hence they cry out of it as <hi>a Body of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third, the Elect feel at this firſt ſtroke and wound which the Spirit gives them; the Anguiſh of ſin indeed lies ſore upon them, but this <hi>much more. Chriſt is come to ſeek that which is loſt,</hi> Luke 15.7. The Sheep is loſt, when, firſt, it is ſeparated and gone from the Owner; ſecondly, when it knows not how to return again, unleſs the Shepherd find it and carry it home: ſo that Soul is properly and truly loſt, that feels it ſelf ſeparated and gone from God, knowing not how to return to him again, unleſs the Lord come and take it upon his ſhoulders, and carry it in his Arms: This lies heavy upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005059_0074_1016960FCE83CE18"/>
gone from God, and wholly ſeparated from all Union to him, and Communion with him. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, John 16.9. that <hi>the Spirit convinces of Sin;</hi> how? <hi>becauſe they believe not in me,</hi> i. e. Becauſe they ſhall ſee and feel themſelves quite ſeparated from me; they ſhall hear of my Glory and Riches of Mercy, and that Happineſs which all that have me, ſhall and do enjoy; but they ſhall mourn that they have no Part nor Portion in theſe Things; they ſhall mourn that they live without me, and that they have lived ſo long without me.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs many other Conſiderations of the Evil of ſin now come in, but this is the main Channel where all the other Rivulets empty themſelves. And hence it is that the Soul under this ſtroke is in a ſtate of ſeeking only, yet finds nothing; it ſeeks God and Chriſt, and therefore feels a Want, a Loſs of both by ſin; for the End of all the Fears, Terrors, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, &amp;c. upon the Elect, is to bring them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to God, and into Fellowſhip with God, the only Bleſſedneſs of Man. Now if the Soul ordained and made for this End ſhould not feel its preſent Separation from God by ſin, and the Bitterneſs of the Evil of it, it would never ſeek to return again to him as to his greateſt Good, nor deſire ever to come into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom again; for look as ſin wounds the Soul, ſo the Soul ſeeks for healing of it; if only the Torment of ſin wound, eaſe of Conſcience from that Anguiſh will heal it: ſo if ſeparation from God wounds the Heart, only Union and Communion with God will heal it, and comfort it again. The Lord Chriſt therefore having laid his Hand upon the Soul to bring it back to himſelf firſt, and ſo to the Father, being deſigned to gather in all the Outcaſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thoſe he ever makes to feel themſelves Out-caſts, as caſt
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:005059_0075_1016961176D71FA0"/>
away out of God's bleſſed Sight and Preſence, that ſo they may deſire at laſt to come home again: Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, not made for this End, have not this ſenſe of ſin, the Means of their return. And hence it is that the Souls of thoſe God ſaves, are never quiet untill they come to God, and have Communion with him; but they mourn for their Diſtance from him, and the Hiding of his Face, until the Lord ſhine forth again; Whereas every one elſe tho' much troubled, yet ſits down contented with any little odd Thing that ſerves to quiet them for the Time, before the Lord return to them, or they enter into their Reſt, in that ineffable Communion with him.</p>
                  <p>Let me now make Application of this, before I proceed to open the next Particular of Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>USE 1. This may ſhew us the great Miſtake of two ſorts;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as think there is no Neceſſity of any ſenſe of Miſery before the Application of the Remedy or their Cloſing with Chriſt; becauſe, ſay they, where there is Senſe there is Life: (all Senſe and Feeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from Life) and where there is Life, there is Chriſt already. And hence it is that they would not have the Law firſt Preached in thoſe Days, but the Goſpel; the other is to go round about the Buſh.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that for my own Part this Doctrine (of ſeeing and feeling our Miſery before the Remedy) is ſo univerſally received by all ſolid Divines both at Home and Abroad, that I meet with; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion ſo croſs to the Holy Scriptures, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Experience of the Saints, and the Preaching of the other ſo abundantly ſealed to be God's own Way by his rich Bleſſings on the Labours of others of his Servants faithful to him herein; that were it not for the ſake of ſome weak and miſled, I would not dare
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005059_0076_10169613F9FEAE00"/>
to queſtion it; the Lord himſelf ſo expreſly ſpeaking, that <hi>he came not to call the Righteous, but</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary only <hi>to heal the ſick,</hi> who know and feel their ſickneſs chiefly <hi>by the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.20. Doſt thou think therefore, that there is ſpiritual Life where ever there is any ſenſe? Then I ſay, the Devils &amp; Damned in Hell have much ſpiritual Life, for they feel their Miſery with a Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>As for the Preaching of the Goſpel before the Law to ſhew our Miſery; it is true, that the Goſpel is to be look'd at, as the main End; yet you muſt uſe the Means, before you can come to the End, by the Preaching of the Law, or Miſery in deſpiſing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, End and Means have been ever good Friends, and you may join them well together, you cannot ſever them without Danger. I do obſerve that the Apoſtles ever uſed this Method: <hi>Paul</hi> firſt proves <hi>Jews and Gentiles to be under Sin,</hi> in almoſt the three firſt Chapters of the <hi>Romans,</hi> before he opens the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Juſtification by <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> I do not obſerve that ever there was ſo clear and manifeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of Man's Miſery, as by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who bro't in the cleareſt Revelations of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. I do not read in <hi>Moſes,</hi> or in all the Prophets, ſuch full and plain Expreſſions of our Miſery as in the new Teſtament: <hi>The Worm that never dies; the Fire that never goes out; the Wrath to come, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſuredly they tho't this no Back-Door, but Faith the Door to Chriſt, and this the Way to Faith. To ſay that a Man muſt firſt have Chriſt and Life, before he feel any ſpiritual Miſery, is to ſay, that a Chriſtian muſt firſt be healed, that he may be ſick; cured, that he may be wounded; receive the Spirit of Adoption, before he receive the Spirit of Bondage; and that he may receive the Spirit of Bondage to fear again.</p>

Mark thoſe Men that deny the Uſe of the Law to lead unto Chriſt, if they do not fall in Time to oppoſe ſome main Point of the Goſpel. For it is a righteous Thing but a heavy Plague, for the Lord to ſuffer ſuch Men to obſcure the Goſpel, that in their Judgments zealouſly diſlike this Uſe of the Law. You muſt preach the Remedy; that is true: But you muſt alſo firſt preach the Wo and Miſery of Men, or rather ſo mix them together, as the Hearts of Hearers may be deeply affected with both; but firſt with their Miſery. It argues a great Conſumption of the Spirit of Grace, when Chriſtians lives are preſerved only by Alchermys and choice Cordials, Notions about Chriſt, nay, choice ones too, or elſe the old and ordinary Food of the Country will not down. I tell you, the main Wound of Chriſtians is want of deep Humiliations and Caſtings down; and if you believe it not now, it may be Peſtilence, Sword, and Famine ſhall teach you this Doctrine, when the Lord ſhall make theſe Things wound you to the very Heart, and put you to your very Wits End, that were not, that would not in ſeaſon be wounded at the Heart with ſin.</p>
                  <p>Are we troubled with too many wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in theſe Times, that we are ſo ſolicitous of Coining new Principles of Peace? What is every Man by Nature, but a Kind of an infinite Evil? All the ſins that fill Earth and Hell, are in every one Man's Heart, for ſin in Men is endleſs; and canſt not thou endure to be caſt down? Nothing is ſo vile as Chriſt to a Man not humbled, and can you eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prize him, and taſte him, without any caſting down?</p>

Such as think there is a Neceſſity of Senſe of Miſery by the Work of the Law, before Chriſt can be received; but they think there is no <hi>ſuch Feeling</hi> of Miſery, as hath been mentioned; but that it is common to the Reprobate as to the Elect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that in ſenſe of ſin there is no ſuch ſpecial Work of the Spirit as ſeparates the Soul from ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes unto Chriſt, but that this is done after the Soul is in Chriſt by Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> in Sanctification, being firſt juſtified by Faith.</p>
                  <p>This is the Judgment of many holy and learned; and therefore ſo long as there is no Diſagreement in the Subſtance of this Doctrine, it ſhould not trouble us; only let it be conſidered, whether what is ſaid, is not the Truth of Chriſt; and if it be, let us not caſt it aſide.

The Gardiner's Knife may immediately cut off a Cyen from a Tree, thereby taking away all its Power to grow there any more, before it hath a Power to bring forth any Fruit, which is wro't only by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting it into another Stock: New Creation (which is at firſt Converſion) may well be without habitual Graces that are but Creatures.</p>

ſuch a ſubject; like a <hi>white Paper,</hi> fitted immediately to take the Impreſſion of <hi>God's Image;</hi> but ſince, by his Fall, ſin is fallen like a mighty <hi>Blot</hi> upon the Soul, whereby a Man not only wants Grace, as the dark Air doth light, but alſo <hi>reſiſts Grace,</hi> John 14.17. Hence this Reſiſtance muſt be firſt taken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord introduce his Image again. To ſay that a Man can of himſelf diſpoſe himſelf unto Grace, was <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> in <hi>Aquinas</hi> his Time: Yet ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is neceſſary, ſaith <hi>Ferrius;</hi> not unto actual Grace, or that which wro't upon a Man, <hi>per modum actus,</hi> (as he ſaith) but unto the Reception of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or ſanctifying Grace, it being in the Soul <hi>per modum formae,</hi> no Form being introduced but into <hi>materiam diſpoſitam,</hi> i. e. Matter fitted or prepared, or into ſuch a Veſſel which is immediately capable of it.</p>
                  <p>There is in Man a double Reſiſtance againſt Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of a holy Frame of Grace, by original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which is oppoſite to original and renewed Holineſs, or to this holy Frame.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is taken away in that which we call the Spirit of Sanctification, after Faith; the ſecond is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away not only in the Act of it, (as by Terrors it may be in Reprobates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.2.) but in ſome Meaſure in the inward Root and Diſpoſition of it, only in the Elect) there being (as hath been ſaid) no more Separation from ſin, at this Time required, then ſo much as may make the Soul come to the Lord to take it away, or at leaſt not unwilling, nor reſiſting the Lord, when he comes to do it himſelf.</p>

Whether alſo there are not two Things in effectual Vocation:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is not Chriſt, that Good, the Term to which the Soul is firſtly called?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is not Sin and World, that Evil, the Term from which the Soul is called? I ſuppoſe 'tis evident, that the Soul is effectually called, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and firſtly turned from Darkneſs to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God. Firſt from Darkneſs, then unto Light; firſt from the Power of Satan, then unto God; as is evident by the Apoſtles own Words, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. where he methodically ſets down the wonderful Works of Chriſt's Grace by his Miniſtry; the firſt is <hi>to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from Satan's Power unto God,</hi> which are the two Parts of Vocation, <hi>that they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sins</hi> in Juſtification, (Vocation being a Means to this End) that they may receive <hi>an Inheritance</hi> in Glorification <hi>among ſuch as</hi> being juſtified <hi>are ſanctified</hi> alſo <hi>by Faith in his Name.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that he was to return Men to Light and unto God, and ſo turn them from Darkneſs and from the Power of Satan, (tho' this is true in ſome ſenſe) but he was firſt to turn from Darkneſs and Satan, and ſo to return them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Light, and God in Chriſt. For how is it poſſible to be turned unto Chriſt, and yet then alſo to be turned to Sin and Satan? Doth it not imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to be turned toward Sin, (which is ever from Chriſt) and yet to be turned toward Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? All Divines affirm generally, that in the Working of Faith, the Lord makes the Soul <hi>willing</hi> to have Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2, 3. but withal they affirm, that of unwilling he makes willing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005059_0083_101695478FD158D0"/>
it follows, that the Lord muſt firſt remove that Unwillingneſs, before it can be willing, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be both willing and unwilling together.</p>

Is not this the Death of moſt, if not all wicked Men living? How many are there that claſp about Chriſt, and yet prove Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt; fall from Chriſt ſcandalouſly or ſecretly afterwards? What is the Reaſon of it? Certainly if the Lord had cut them off from their ſin, they had never fallen to everlaſting Bondage in ſin again; but there the Spirit of God forſook them, the Lord not owning ſo much Love to them.

                  <p n="1">1. If Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin go before original Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. then Imputation of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs before renewed Sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To place Sanctification before Juſtification, is quite croſs to the Apoſtle's Practice, (which is our Pattern) who firſt ſought <hi>to be found in Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.9. (in the Work of Union) <hi>not having his own Righteouſneſs</hi> in the Work of Juſtification (which in order follows that) <hi>that he may</hi> then <hi>know him in the Power of his Death and Reſurrection</hi> in Sanctification (here comes in Sanctification) <hi>if by any Means he might attain to the Reſurrection of the dead</hi> in Glorification, (the laſt of all.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is quite croſs to the Apoſtle's Doctrine, which makes Juſtification the Cauſe of Sanctification, and therefore muſt needs go before it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. As Sin goes before ſpiritual and eternal Death, ſo Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs goes before ſpiritual Life in Sanctification, and eternal Life in Glory: The Lord holds forth Chriſt in the Goſpel firſt as our Propitiation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and then in comes <hi>dying to Sin, and living to God</hi> in Sanctification, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1. Holineſs is the End of our actual Reconciliation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Sanctification go before Juſtification by Faith, then a Chriſtian's Communion with Chriſt, goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Union to him by Faith; but our Union is the Foundation of Communion, and it is impoſſible there ſhould be Communion without ſome precedent Union. 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Chriſt is made Righteouſneſs and Sanctification;</hi> unto whom? read the Beginning of the Verſe, and then you ſhall ſee, it is only to thoſe <hi>that be in Chriſt,</hi> which is by Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="unknown:005059_0088_1016952EA588DB30"/>Let none ſay here (as ſome do) that we have Union to Chriſt, firſt by the Spirit, without Faith, in order going before Faith: For underſtanding of which, let us a little conſider of our Union unto Chriſt; our Union to Chriſt is not by the eſſential Preſence of the Spirit, for that is in every Man, as the Godhead is every where, in whom we live and move. This is common to the moſt wicked Man, nay, to the vileſt Creature in the World. Hence it follows that our Union is by ſome Act of the Spirit peculiar to the Elect (who only ſhall have Communion with Chriſt) working ſome real Change in the Soul, (for of real, not relative Union I now ſpeak) this Act cannot be thoſe firſt Acts of the Spirit of Bondage, (for they are common unto Reprobates) they are therefore ſuch Acts as are eſſential unto the Nature of Union. Now look as Diſ-union, is the Disjunction or Separation of divers Things one from another; ſo Union is the Conjunction or joining of them together, that were before ſevered. Hence that Act of the Spirit in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to Chriſt, can be nothing elſe but the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the Soul unto Chriſt, or the Conjunction of the Soul unto Chriſt, and into Chriſt, by bringing it back to him, that before this lay like a dry Bone in the Valley ſeparated from him. Thus, 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joined,</hi> or (as the Word ſignifies) <hi>glewed to the Lord, is one Spirit with him.</hi> The Spirit therefore brings us to the Lord Chriſt, and ſo we are in him. Now <hi>the Coming of the Soul to Chriſt,</hi> what is it but <hi>Faith? John</hi> 6.35. Our Union therefore is by Faith, not without it: for by it only we that were once ſeperated from him by Sin, and eſpecially by <hi>Unbelief,</hi> Heb. 3.12. are now come not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as Iron unto the Load-ſtone, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. but (which is moſt near) into him, as Branches into the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:005059_0089_1016951D53C68000"/>
Vine, and ſo grow one with him; and hence thoſe Phraſes in Scripture <hi>to believe in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>into Chriſt,</hi> I ſpeak not this as if we were united to Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit on his Part; (for the Conjunction of Things ſeveral muſt be mutual, if it be firm) I only ſhew that we are not united before Faith by the Spirit unto Chriſt; but that we are by Faith (wro't by the Spirit) whereby on our Part we are firſt conjoined unto him: And then on his Part he by the Perſon of the Spirit is moſt wonderfully united unto us. The Spirit puts forth Variety of Acts in the Soul; as it acts us to good Works, 'tis <hi>the Spirit of Obedience;</hi> as it infuſeth Habits of Grace, ſo 'tis <hi>the Spirit of Sanctific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                        </gap>;</hi> as it aſſiſts us continually, and guides us to our End, and witneſſeth Favour, 'tis <hi>the Spirit of Adoption;</hi> as it works fears of Death and Hell, 'tis <hi>the Spirit of Bondage;</hi> but as it draws us from Sin to Chriſt, ſo 'tis <hi>the Spirit of Union;</hi> and therefore to imagine Union before and without Faith by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is but a Spirit indeed, which when you come to feel it, you ſhall find it a Nothing, without Fleſh, or Bones, or Sinews. As our Marriage Union to Chriſt muſt have Conſent of Faith on our Part, wro't by the Spirit, or elſe the Lord Jeſus is a vain Suitor to us; ſo now the Spirit on Chriſt's Part muſt apprehend our Faith; and dwell in us, who otherwiſe ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly go a Whoring from him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Vocation is not all one with Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may appear thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vocation is before Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. But Sanctification is not before Juſtification, as we have proved, and therefore they are not the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sanctification is the End of Vocation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. therefore it is not the ſame with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:005059_0090_1016953032D51B78"/>3. Faith is the principal Thing in Vocation: the firſt Part of it being God's Call, the ſecond Part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Anſwer to that Call, or in Coming at that Call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. Now Faith is no Part of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſtrictly taken, becauſe it is the Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our Juſtification and Sanctification, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Our <hi>Hearts</hi> are ſaid <hi>to be purified by Faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. not our Lives only in the Acts of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Purity, but our Hearts in the habitual Frame of them. Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul. We paſs from Death to Life,</hi> John 5.24. therefore it is no Part of our ſpiritual Life: <hi>You will not come to me</hi> (which is Faith) <hi>that you may have Life,</hi> John 5.40. and 6.50, 51. therefore Faith is the inſtrumental Means of Life, and therefore no Part of our Life: As Faith comes by Hearing, and therefore Hearing is no Part of Faith; ſo Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication comes by Faith, and therefore is no Part of Sanctification: All our Life both of Juſtification and Sanctification is laid up in Chriſt our Head; this Life according to God's great Plot ſhall never be had but Coming to Chriſt for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. elſe Grace and Chriſt ſhould not be ſo much honoured, Rom. 4.16. <hi>It is of Faith, that it might be of Grace;</hi> Sanctification therefore is the Grace applied by Faith, Faith the Grace applying; by Coming to Chriſt for it, we have it; and therefore have it not, when firſt we come.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry to be thus large in leſs Practical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet I have thought it not unuſeful, but very comfortable to a poor Paſſenger, not only to know his Journey's end, and the Way in general to it, but the ſeveral <hi>Stadia</hi> or Towns h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005059_0091_101695201F731620"/>
in theſe Days fall very foully into Erroneous Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in their Judgments, the immediate ground of many Errors in Practice; the Objections made againſt what hath been delivered, are for the Principal of them Anſwered; the main end (my Beloved) of Propounding theſe Things is, that you would look narrowly to your Union, Oh take heed you miſs not there: If you cloſe with Chriſt, believe in Chriſt, and yet not cut off your Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> that Spirit of Reſiſtance of Chriſt, you are utterly and eternally undone. <hi>This is the Condemnation of the World,</hi> not that Men love Darkneſs wholly, and hate Light, but <hi>that they love Darkneſs more than Light;</hi> not that <hi>the unclean Spirit</hi> is not <hi>gone out,</hi> but that he is not ſo caſt out, as <hi>never to return</hi> again; the Wound of all Men, yea the beſt of Men that profeſs Chriſt, and yet indeed out of Chriſt, lies in this: they were never Severed from their Sin by all their Prayers, Tears, Fears, Sorrows; and hence they never truly come to Chriſt; and hence Periſh in their Sin.</p>
                  <p>Trouble me no more therefore in aſking Whether a Chriſtian is in a State of Happineſs or Miſery in this Condition? I Anſwer, he is preparatively Happy, he is now paſſing from Death to Life, though not as yet wholly paſſed: nor yet, whether there is any ſaving Work before Union? I Anſwer, No; for what is ſaid, is one neceſſary Ingredient to the working up of our Union, as cutting off the Branch from the old Stock, is neceſſary to the Ingrafting it into the new; indeed, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> nor do I ſay that this Work doth pleaſe: <hi>i. e.</hi> it doth not pacify God, (for that is proper to Chriſt's perfect Righteouſneſs received by Faith) yet as it is a Work of his own Spirit upon us, it is pleaſing to him; (as the after-work of Sanctification is) though it neither
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005059_0092_10169535E7BA8458"/>
doth pacify him; nor do I ſee how this Doctrine is any way oppoſite to the free offer of Grace, and Chriſt, becauſe it requires no more Separation from Sin, than that which drives them unto Chriſt; nay, which is leſs, that makes them (by the Power of the Spirit) not Reſiſt, but Yeild to Chriſt; that he may come unto them and draw them: You cannot Repent nor Convert yourſelves; <hi>Be converted therefore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>that ye may receive Remiſſion of Sins;</hi> and in this offer the Spirit works; and verily he that can truly receive Chriſt without that ſenſe of Miſery as Separates him from his Sin, (as explained to you) let him believe notwithſtanding all that which is ſaid; and the God of Heaven ſpeak Peace to him; his Faith ſhall not trouble me, if he be ſure it ſhall not one Day deceive himſelf.</p>

To feel the Evil of thy hard Heart; no ſurer Token of Reprobation than Hardneſs, if continued in; eſpecially for thy Heart to grow hard under or after ſoftening Means, at it was in <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> 2. To look up to the Lord in all Ordinances, that he would take it away.</p>

What if the Lord had ſmitten you with a <hi>Spirit of Slumber,</hi> as thoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. would not your Eſtate have been then lamentable? And have you no Hearts to acknowledge his unſpeakable Goodneſs in awakening of you, in ſhaking the very Foundations? Doſt thou think that any ever had ſuch a hard Heart as thou haſt? Doſt not ſay ſo in ſecret before the Lord ſometimes? Oh then what rich Grace is this to give thee any Senſe and Feeling of thy Sin and Danger by it, tho' it be never ſo little in thine Eyes!

were meerly imaginary, or worldly and deſperate; but ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 7.7. <hi>I thank God I made you ſorry.</hi> Suppoſe thy Sorrow ſhould be only in Regard of the Puniſhment of Sin, yet this is the Lord's Goodneſs to make thy Heart ſo far ſenſible; that once did go like a Beaſt to the Slaughter, fearing no Danger at all; the very Means to prize Favour from God, is to feel Wrath, (as well as Sin) and the very Reaſon why the Lord hath let thee feel thy Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment heavy, is, that thy Soul might feel the Evil of Sin, by conſidering that if the Fruits be ſo bitter, what then is the Cauſe? <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.15.

Humiliation (in this Place) is that Work of the Spirit whereby the Soul being broken off from Self-Conceit, and Self-Confidence in any Good it hath or doth, ſubmitteth unto, or lieth under God, to be diſpoſed of as he pleaſeth, I <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41. That look as Compunction cuts the Sinner off from that Evil that is in him, ſo Humiliation cuts it off from all high Conceits and Self-Confidence of that Good which is in him, or which he ſeeks might be in him, and ſo the Soul is abaſed before God.</p>

When the Lord hath wounded the Hearts of his Elect, this is the immediate Work of their Hearts, (if the Lord prevent them not by his Grace, as many Times he doth) they look to what Good they have, or if they find little or none, then they ſeek for ſome in themſelves, that thereby they may heal their Wound, becauſe they think thus, that as their Sins have provoked God to anger againſt them, ſo if now they can reform and leave thoſe Sins, or if not, repent and be ſorry for them; if now they pray, and hear, and do as others do, they have ſome Hope that this will heal their Wound, and pacify the Lord towards them; when they ſee there is no Peace in a ſinful Courſe, they will therefore try if there be any to be found in a good Courſe: And look as <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſaw his own Shame and Nakedneſs, hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from God in the Buſhes, and covered his Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Fig-Leaves; ſo the Soul not being able to endure to ſee its own Nakedneſs and Vileneſs, not knowing Chriſt Jeſus, and he being far to ſeek, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſhould come before the Lord,</hi> ſhould they bring <hi>Rivers of Oyl,</hi> or <hi>Thouſands of Lambs,</hi> or <hi>the firſt born of their Body to remove the Sin of their Soul? Paul</hi> did account theſe Duties <hi>Gain,</hi> Phil. 3.7. and ſet them at a high Rate, becauſe he thought that God did ſo himſelf: When the Lord hath wounded the Soul, the firſt Voice it ſpeaks, is, What ſhall I do? Do; ſaith Conſcience, leave thy Sins, do as well as others, do with all thy Might and Strength, pray, hear, and confer, God accepts of good Deſires, and requires no more of any Man but to do what he can. Hence the Soul plies both Oars, tho' againſt Wind and Tide, and ſtrives, and wreſtles with his ſins, and hopes one Day to be better, and here he reſts. And obſerve it, look as Sin in his greateſt Evil, ſo the caſting away of his Sins, and ſeeking to be better, is very ſweet to him; and being ſo ſweet, reſts in what he hath, and ſeeks for what he wants, and ſo hopes all will be well one Day, and ſo ſtays here; altho' (God knows) it be without Chriſt, nor cannot reſt on him, tho' he hath heard of him a thouſand Times. And hence it is if they cannot do any Thing to eaſe themſelves, then their Hearts ſink, or it may be quarrel with God, that he makes them no better. But, Beloved, it is wonderful to ſee how many Times Men reſt in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they have and do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But while it is thus with the Soul, he is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Chriſt; for he that truſts to other Things to ſave him, or makes himſelf his own Saviour, or reſts in his Duties without a Saviour, he can never have Chriſt to ſave him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. it is ſaid, the Jews loſt Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, <hi>becauſe they ſought it not by Faith,</hi> but ſought Salvation by their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>He that maketh Fleſh his Arm,</hi> (as all Duties and Endeavours of Man be, when truſted to) the

Lord ſaith, <hi>Curſed be that Man,</hi> Jer. 17.5, 6. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord doth not leave his Elect here; he that is married unto the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. cannot be matcht unto Chriſt, till he be firſt divorced, not from the Duties themſelves, but from truſting to them, and reſting in them. And therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.19. <hi>I thro' the Law am dead to it, that I might live unto God.</hi> He that truſteth to Riches, cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, no more than a Camel thro' a Needle's Eye, becauſe it is too big for ſo narrow a Room: ſo he that truſteth to his Duties and Abilities, is too big to enter in by Chriſt; the Lord muſt cut off this Spirit, and lay it low, and make it ſtoop as vile before God, before it can have Chriſt in this Eſtate; the Lord muſt not only cut it off from this Self-Confidence in Duties, but alſo ſo far forth as that the Soul may lie under God, to be diſpoſed of as he pleaſeth. And the Reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a Soul is unwilling to ſtoop, is unhumbled; and he that is ſo, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his Part reſiſt God, but the Lord alſo reſiſts him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7, 8. And hence you ſhall obſerve, many a one hath lain long under Diſtreſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe they have either reſted in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which could not quiet, or becauſe they have not ſo caſt off their Confidence in them, ſo as to lie down quietly before God, that he may do what he will with them; being ſo long Objects of God's Reſiſtance, not of his Grace.</p>

down: For we are firſt <hi>Created in Chriſt</hi> (which is by God's Omnipotent immediate Act) <hi>unto Good Works,</hi> before we do from ourſelves, or by the Power of Faith, put forth Good Works, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. Theſe Acts of Self-confidence may not be ſtirring in all Chriſtians; but in all Men there is this Frame of Spirit, never to come to Chriſt, if they can make any thing elſe ſerve to heal them or ſave them; and therefore the Spirit cuts off this ſinful Frame in part in all the Elect; he hews the Roughneſs and Pride of Spirit off, that it may lie ſtill upon the Foundation it is now prepared for. Now tho' the Spirit works this, yet 'tis not without the Word; the Word it works chiefly by, is the <hi>Law,</hi> Gal 3.19. <hi>I thro' the Law am dead to it,</hi> (i. e. from ſeeking any Life or Help from it) <hi>that I might live unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Law doth this by a four-fold Act,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By diſcovering the ſecret Corruptions of the Soul in every Duty, which it never ſaw before; it once tho't, I ſhall periſh for my Sin, if I continue therein, without Confeſſion of them, or Sorrow for them; but it alſo did think that this Confeſſion, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Trouble for Sin will ſerve to ſave it, and make God to accept of it: But the Law (while the Soul is earneſtly ſtriving againſt his Sin) diſcovering that in all theſe there is nothing but Sin, even ſecret Sins it did never ſee before, hereupon it begins thus to think, Can theſe be the Means of ſaving me, which being ſo ſinful, cannot but be the very Cauſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of me? I know I muſt periſh for the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What made <hi>Paul alive without the Law?</hi> You ſhall find, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. it was becauſe he did not know that <hi>Luſt,</hi> or the ſecret Concupiſences and firſt Riſings of the Soul to ſin, were <hi>Sin;</hi> he ſaw not theſe
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005059_0103_1016962C36099288"/>
ſecret Evils in all that which he did: And hence he reſted in his Duties, as one alive without Chriſt: But the Lord by diſcovering this, let him ſee what little Cauſe he had to lift up his Hand, for any good he did: ſo it is here, when the Soul ſees that all its Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is a menſtruous Cloth, polluted with ſin: now thoſe Duties which, like Reeds, it truſted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, run into the Hand, nay, Heart of a poor Sinner; and therefore now it feels little Cauſe of reſting on them any longer: Now it ſees the infinite Holineſs of God by the exceeding Spiritualneſs of the Law, it begins to cry out, How can I ſtand or appear before him with ſuch continual Pollutions?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By irritating or ſtirring up of original Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in making more of that to appear than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that if the Soul thinks, all I do is defiled with ſin, yet my Heart is good, and ſo it reſts there; the Lord therefore ſtirs that Dunghill, and lets it ſee a more helliſh Nature than ever before, in that the holy and bleſſed Command of God (to its feeling) makes it worſe, more rebellious, more averſe from God: Rom. 7.9, 10, 11. <hi>When the Commandment came, Sin revived,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and that <hi>which was for Life was Death to him, Sin taking occaſion by the Law;</hi> and hence <hi>Paul</hi> came <hi>to be ſlain and die</hi> to all his Self-Confidence. It was one of <hi>Luther</hi>'s firſt Poſitions in oppoſing the Pope's Indulgences, that <hi>Lex &amp; voluntas ſunt duo averſarii ſine gratia irreconciliabiles:</hi> For the Law and Man's Will meeting together, the one holy, the other currupt, make fierce Oppoſition when the Soul is under any lively Work of the Law; and by this Irritation of the Law, the Lord hath this End in his Elect, to make them feel what wretched Hearts they have, becauſe that which is in it ſelf a Means of Good, makes them (thro' Man's Corruption) more
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005059_0104_10169672A2B32208"/>
vile to their own Feeling than ever before; and hence comes thoſe ſad Complaints on a Soul under the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Hand of Chriſt, I am now worſe than ever I was, I grow every Day worſe and worſe, I have loſt what once I had, I could once pray, and ſeek God with Delight, and never well, but when one Duty was done, to be in another; but now I am Worſe, all that Joy and Sweetneſs in ſeeking of him, and in holy Walking, is gone; I could once mourn for ſin, but now a hard Heart takes hold of me, that I have not ſo much as a Heart to any Thing that is good, nor to ſhed a Tear for the greateſt Evil. It is true, I confeſs you may grow (to your Feeling) worſe and worſe, and it is fit you ſhould feel it, that the Lord hereby might pull down your proud Heart, and make you lie low; it is the Lord's glorious Wiſdom to wither all your Flowers, which refreſhed you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, that you might feel a Need of him; and therefore I ſay the Lord pulls away all thoſe broken Planks the Soul once floated and reſted upon, that the Soul may ſink in a holy Deſpair of any Help from any Good it hath; the Lord ſhakes down all Building on a ſandy Foundation: And then the Soul cries out, It is ill reſting here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By loading, tiring, and wearying the Soul by its own Endeavours, until it can ſtir no more; for this is in every Man by Nature; when he ſees that all he doth is ſinful, and all he hath, his Heart and Nature to be moſt ſinful; yet he will not yet come out of himſelf, becauſe he hopes tho' he be for the preſent thus vile, yet he hopes for future Time his Heart may grow better, and himſelf do better than now; and hence it is that he ſtrives, and ſeeks, and endeavours to his utmoſt to ſet up himſelf again, and to gain Cure to all his Troubles by his Duties: Now the Law,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005059_0105_10169630214AEB30"/>
whoſe Office is to command, but not to give Strength, and the Spirit that ſhould give Strength withdrawing it ſelf, becauſe it knows the Soul would reſt therein without Chriſt; hence it comes to paſs that the Soul feeling it ſelf to labour only in the Fire and Smoke, and to be ſtill as miſerable and ſinful as ever before, hereupon it is quite tired out, and ſits down weary, not only of its Sin, but of its Work, and now crys out, I ſee now what a vile and undone Wretch I am, I can do nothing for God or for my ſelf, only I can ſin and deſtroy my ſelf; all that I am is vile, and all that I do is vile, I now ſee that I am indeed poor, and blind, and miſerable, and naked; and the Truth is, Beloved, here comes in the greateſt Dejections of Spirit; for when the Lord ſmites the Soul for ſin, it hopes that by leaving of ſin and doing better it may do well; but when it ſees that there is no Hope here of healing the Breach between God and itſelf, now it falls low indeed: And I take this to be the true Meaning of Matth. 11.28. <hi>Ye that labour, i. e,</hi> you that are wearied in your own Way, in ſeeking reſt to your Souls by your own hard Labour or Works (as the Greek Word ſignifies) and are tired out therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo are now <hi>laden</hi> indeed with Sin, and the heavy Preſſure of that, finding no Eaſe by all that which you do: <hi>Come to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and you ſhall</hi> then <hi>find reſt unto your Souls:</hi> The Jews ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, ſeeking I ſay, if by any Means they might eſtabliſh it, loſt Chriſt: The Lord therefore will make his Elect know they ſhall ſeek here for Eaſe in vain; and therefore tires them ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Reſt in his Duties and Endeavours, as he once expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he ſhould, but ſees Sin and Weakneſs, Death and Condemnation wrapping him about (like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Weeds) in all he doth, then his Heart ſinks, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and falls off further from Chriſt by Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and grows ſecretly impatient that there ſhould be no Mercy left for him, becauſe it thinks now the Lord's eternal Purpoſe is to exclude him; for if there were any Thoughts of Peace towards him, he ſhould have found Peace before now, having ſo earneſtly and frequently ſought the Lord, and having done ſo much, and forſaken his ſinful Ways, according to his own Commandment from him; and hence it is you ſhall find it a certain Truth, that the Soul is turned back as far from God by ſinking diſcouraging Sorrow for ſin, as ever it was to a ſtate of Security by the Pleaſures of ſin; and hence ſometimes it thinks it is in vain to ſeek any more, and hence leaves off Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and if Conſcience force them to it, yet it ſinks again, becauſe it's Foot is not eſtabliſh'd upon the Rock Chriſt, but upon the Weakneſs of the Waters of it's own Abilities and Endeavours; what therefore ſhould the Soul do in this Caſe, to come to God? It knows not, it cannot; fly from him it dare not, it ſhall not; the Spirit therefore by revealing how equal and juſt it is for the Lord never to regard or look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it more, becauſe it hath ſinned and is ſtill ſo ſinful, makes it hereby to fall down proſtrate in the Duſt be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the Lord, as worthy of nothing but Shame and Confuſion, and ſo kiſſeth the Rod, and turns the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now the Soul is indeed humbled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſubmits to be diſpoſed of, as God pleaſeth; thus the Church in her Humiliation, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. having in the former part of the Chapter, <hi>drunk the Wormwood and the Gall,</hi> at laſt lies down and profeſſeth, <hi>it is the Lord's Mercy, it is not conſumed;</hi> and Verſ. 29. <hi>he puts his Mouth to the Duſt, if there may be any Hope;</hi> and Ver. 39. <hi>Why ſhould a living Man complain, for the Puniſhment of his Sin?</hi> You think the Lord doth you Wrong, and neglects your Good and his own Glory too, if he doth not give you Peace and Pardon, Grace and Mercy, even to the utmoſt of your aſking, and then think you have good Cauſe to fret, and ſink, and be diſcouraged: No, no, the Lord will pull down thoſe Mountains, thoſe high Tho'ts, and make you lie low at his Feet, and acknowledge that it is infinite Mercy you are alive, and not conſumed; and that there is any Hope or Poſſibility of Mercy, and that you are out of the nethermoſt Pit: And that if he ſhould never pity you, yet he doth you no Wrong, but that which is equal and juſt, and that it is fit your ſinful forward Wills ſhould ſtoop to his holy, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and good Will, rather than it ſhould ſtoop and be crooked according unto yours.

much as makes you come for Reſt in Chriſt, ſo much is neceſſary, and no more. If any can come without being thus laden and weary in ſome Meaſure, let them come and drink of the Water of Life freely; but a proud Heart that will make it ſelf its own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, will not come to the Lord Jeſus to be his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; he that will be his own Phyſician, ſo long cannot ſend out for another. Nay, let me fall one Degree lower, if the Soul cannot come to Chriſt, (as who feel not themſelves unable when the Lord comes to draw?) and find not the Lord Jeſus coming unto them, to draw them, and compel them in; yet if the Soul be ſo far humbled, as not to reſiſt the Lord, by quarrelling with him, and at him, as unworthy of the leaſt Smile, as worthy of all Frowns; verily the Lord will come to it, and no more is requiſite than this, and thus much certainly is: For thus the whole Scripture runs, <hi>He gives Grace to the humble,</hi> James 4.6. <hi>I dwell with the contrite and humble,</hi> Iſa. 57.16. <hi>The poor afflicted ſhall not always be forgotten,</hi> Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Reſiſtance of the Lord, by a ſecret Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs that the Lord ſhould work Grace: Now this the Lord removes in Compunction, and no more Brokenneſs for Sin or from Sin is neceſſary there than that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Reſiſtance of the Lord by ſinking Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and a ſecret Quarrelling with him, in Caſe the Soul imagines he will not come to work Grace, or manifeſt Grace. Now this the Lord takes away in Humiliation; and no more is neceſſary here, than the Removal of the Power of this which makes the Soul in the Senſe of its own infinite Vileneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs not to quarrel at the Lord, and Devil-like grow fierce and impatient before and againſt the Lord, in Caſe he ſhould never help it, never pity it, never ſuccour it; <hi>the Lord will not forſake for ever,</hi> if the Soul thus <hi>lies down,</hi> and <hi>puts its Mouth in the Duſt,</hi> Lam. 3.30, 31.</p>
                  <p>Which Conſideration is of unſpeakable Uſe and Conſolation, to every poor empty Nothing, that feels it ſelf unable to believe, and the Lord forſaking it, from helping it to believe.

                     </gap>hriſtian that cannot come to Chriſt, you ſhall ſee firſt or laſt ſhall ſee Cauſe to lie down, and be ſilent, and not quarrel, tho' the Lord ſhould never come to him. And that this is neceſſary, may appear thus: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord ſhould not advance the Riches of his Grace; the Advancement of Grace cannot poſſibly be without the Humiliation and Abaſement of the Creature; the Lord not only ſaves, but calls Things that <hi>are not,</hi> that <hi>no Fleſh might Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Otherwiſe the Lord ſhould not be Lord and Diſpoſer of his own Grace, but a ſinful Creature who quarrels againſt God, if it be not diſpoſed of, not as the Lord will, but as the Creature will. If a Stranger comes to our Houſe, and will have what he wants, and if he hath not, he quarrels and contends with the Maſter of the Houſe, what would he ſay? Away proud Beggar, doſt think to be Lord of what I have? Doſt draw thy Knife to ſtab me, if I do not pleaſe thee and give thee thy aſking? No, thou ſhalt know that I will do with my own as I ſee good, thou ſhalt lie down on the Duſt of my Threſhold before I give thee any Thing. So 'tis with the Lord, <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> It is his principal Name, <hi>I will be merciful to whom I will be merciful;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will not believe me, yet believe the Lord's Oath, Iſai. 45.23. <hi>Unto me ſhall every Knee bow,</hi> and do you come to lord it over him, and quarrel,

and fret, and ſink, and grow ſullen, and vex, if the Lord ſtoop not unto your Deſires? No, no, you muſt and ſhall lie upon his Threſhold, nay he will make thee lay thy Neck upon the Block, as worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but cutting off; then when this <hi>Valley is filled, all Fleſh ſhall ſee the Glory of the Lord,</hi> Iſai. 40.5. Thus Humiliation is neceſſary in this Meaſure men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Not that I deny any ſubſequent Humiliation, after a Chriſtian is in Chriſt, ariſing from the Senſe of God's Favour in Chriſt, than which nothing makes a Chriſtian of an evangelical Spirit more aſhamed of himſelf: Yet I dare not exclude this which is ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, ariſing from the Spirit of Power immediately ſubduing the ſoul to Chriſt, that it may be exalted by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. It is true, all Things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Life and Godlineſs are received by Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. yet Faith itſelf is a ſaving Work, which is not received by another precedent Faith. Faith therefore is to be excepted, not only as begotten in us, but as it is in the begetting of it in the Conviction and Humiliation of every Sinner.</p>
                  <p>USE 1. Hence ſee what is the great Hindrance between the Mercy of God, and the ſoul of many a Man; if it be not ſome ſin and Hardneſs of Heart under it, whereby he cares not for Chriſt to deliver him, then 'tis Pride of Spirit, ariſing from ſome Good he hath, whereby he feels no Need of Chriſt, hoping his own Duties ſhall ſave him, or elſe is above Chriſt, and not under him, willing to be diſpoſed of by him. And hence the Lord makes this the High-way to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40. if firſt they ſhall <hi>confeſs their Sin,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>humble themſelves,</hi> (both which I know the Lord muſt work) then <hi>he will remember his Covenant.</hi> Look as it is with a Veſſel before it can be fit for Uſe, it muſt firſt paſs thro' Fire, and the Earth and Droſs

That the Lord hath kept you (it may be a long Time too) from Sight and Senſe of his peculiar Love; one would wonder why the Lord ſhould hide his Love ſo much, ſo long, from thoſe to whom he doth intend it; the great Reaſon is, becauſe there is in many a one a Heart deſirous of his Love, and this would quiet them if they were ſure of it: They never come to be quieted with God's Will, in caſe they think they ſhall never partake of his Love: But are above that, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſiſt, and quarrel with that, unhumbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, the Lord therefore intending to beſtow his Favour only upon a humbled Sinner, he will therefore hide his Face until they lie low, and acknowledge themſelves worthy of nothing but Extremity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, unworthy of the leaſt Mercy: The People of God, Lam. 1.16. cry out that <hi>the Comforter which ſhould refreſh their Soul, was far from them:</hi> What was God's End in this?

The Cauſe is in my own ſelf, and therefore if he never comfort me, nor ſpeak a good Word unto me, yet he is righteous, but I am vile; and you will find this certain, that as the Lord therefore humbles that he may exalt, ſo the Lord never refuſeth to exalt (in hiding his Face) but it is to humble. And is this the worſt the Lord aims at, and will you not be thankful? Why are you then diſcouraged when you find it thus with you? Do not ſay the Lord never dealt thus with any as with me; ſuppoſe that; the Reaſon then is, becauſe the Lord ſees, never had any ſuch an high Heart as thou haſt; but Oh be thankful, that notwithſtanding this, he will take the Pains to take it down.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lord having wounded and humbled his Elect, and laid them down dead at his Feet, they are now as unable to believe as they were to humble their own Souls; and therefore now the Lord takes them up in his Arms, that they lean and reſt on the Boſom of their Beloved by Faith. After <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſpoken roughly to his
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:005059_0122_1016968B8BAE99C0"/>
Brethren, and thereby brought the Blood of their Brother to Remembrance, and ſo had humbled them, and then he can contain no longer, but diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, and tells them, I am <hi>Joſeph</hi> whom you wickedly ſold, yet fear not; ſo doth our Saviour car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it towards his Elect, when he laid them low: Now is the very Seaſon for him to advance the Glory of his Grace, he cannot now contain himſelf any longer; but having torn and taken away that Vail of Sin and of the Law from off their Hearts, now they ſee the Lord with open Face, even the End of that which was to be aboliſhed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. The Explication of the great Work, is of exceeding great Difficulty; nothing more ſtirring than Faith in a true Chriſtian, becauſe he lives by it, yet it is very little known; as Children in the Womb, that know not that Navel-ſtring by which they principally live: I ſhall therefore be wary, and leaving larger Explications, acquaint you with the Nature of Faith, in this brief Deſcription of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FAITH</hi> is that gracious Work of the <hi>SPIRIT,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an humbled Sinner receiveth <hi>CHRIST;</hi> or whereby the whole Soul cometh out of itſelf to <hi>CHRIST,</hi> for <hi>CHRIST</hi> and all his Benefits, upon the Call of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in his <hi>WORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I open this Particular, give me Leave to premiſe ſome general Conſiderations; Faith is the Complement of effectual Vocation, which begins in God's Call, and ends in this Anſwer to that Call; the Lord prevents a poor humbled Soul, with his Call, either not knowing how, or not able, or not daring to come; and then the Soul comes, and hence <hi>Men called,</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> are all one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.24, with 33. Many a wounded Sinner will be ſcrambling after Chriſt, from ſome general Reports of him, before the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005059_0123_10169648EC4C0AC8"/>
Day and Hour of God's glorious and gracious Call Now for any to receive Chriſt, or come to Chriſt, before he is called, is Preſumption; to refuſe Chriſt when called, is Rebellion, to come and receive when called, is properly and formally Faith, and that which the Scripture ſtiles, the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.5. And now Chriſt at this Inſtant is fully and freely given, on God's Part, when really and freely come unto and taken on our Part.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>receiving of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> are for Subſtance the ſame, tho' the Words be divers; the holy Ghoſt uſeth to expreſs one and the ſame Thing in Variety of Words; that our Feebleneſs might the better underſtand what he meaneth. And hence in Scripture, <hi>believing, coming, receiving Chriſt, rolling, truſting, cleaving to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> ſet out one and the ſame Thing; and therefore it is no Wonder if our Divines have different Deſcriptions of Faith in Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Words; which if well conſidered, do but ſet out one and the ſame Thing: And I do conceive they do all agree in this Deſcription I have now mentioned; I know there are ſome who tread awry here, whom I ſhall briefly note out, and ſo paſs on to what we intend,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Papiſts, with ſome others of corrupt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at leaſt of weak Apprehenſions among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deſcribe Faith to be nothing elſe but a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Aſſent to a divine Truth, becauſe of a divine Teſtimony: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> To aſſent to this Truth, That Chriſt is come, that he is the Son of God; that he was dead and is riſen again, that he is the Saviour of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to confirm this they produce <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is granted that this Aſſent is in Faith, for Faith always hath Reſpect to ſome Teſtimony; for Man by his Fall hath loſt all Knowledge of divine and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:005059_0124_1016968D271D88D8"/>
ſupernatural Truths; hence God reveals them in his Word; hence Faith ſees them and aſſents to them, becauſe God hath ſpoken them: To ſee and know Things by Viſion, is to ſee Things in themſelves intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itively and immediately; but to ſee Things by Faith is to ſee them by and in a Teſtimony given of them, John 20.20. <hi>Bleſſed is he that hath not ſeen, (i. e.</hi> Chriſt immediately) <hi>but believed, i. e.</hi> his Teſtimony, and on him in it; this Aſſent therefore is in Faith (for we muſt believe Chriſt before we can believe in him) but this comprehends not the whole Nature of Faith; I mean of that Faith we are now ſpeaking of; <hi>viz.</hi> as it unites us to Chriſt, and poſſeſſeth us with Chriſt. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Deſcription placeth Faith only in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whereas 'tis alſo in the Will, as the Words, <hi>truſting, rolling, &amp;c.</hi> intimate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Aſſent is meerly general, without particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application, which is ever in true Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is ſuch a Faith as the Devils may have, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. and reprobate Men may have, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. There is a wilful refuſing of the known Truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the Papiſt's Aim to vilify Faith hereby, by deſcribing it by that which is one Ingredient in it, but excluding that which is principal; thoſe Phraſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>believing Chriſt is come in the Fleſh,</hi> 1 John 4.3. and that <hi>he is the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 16.16. as if this were the only Object to Faith, are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood excluſively, excluding other Acts of Faith, which the Scripture in other Places, ſets down clearly; but incluſively, as ſuppoſing them to be contained herein: For as we in our Times deſcribing Faith by relying upon Chriſt for Salvation, do not exclude hereby our believing that he is the Meſſiah; but we include it,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005059_0125_1016964A76094468"/>
or ſuppoſe it, becauſe that is not now queſtioned, the Truth of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſpel being ſo abundantly cleared; ſo in thoſe Times, they deſcribed Faith by one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Act, to believe that he was the Son of God, and come into the Fleſh, becauſe this was the main and principal Thing in Queſtion then: And if the Lord had not ſet our Faith by other Acts in Scripture, we ſhall not vary from our Compaſs in ſuch Expreſſions in the Word in theſe Days: For their Faith then is exemplary to us now; becauſe the Word doth more fully ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t it out in more ſpecial Acts, hence we ſet it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by them; for 'tis evident, as the Jews did believe in a Meſſiah to come, ſo they did alſo believe and look for all Good from him, John 4.25. <hi>He will teach us all Things when he comes;</hi> and therefore their Faith did not confine itſelf to that hiſtorical Act that a Meſſiah ſhould come, or that this was the Meſſiah, but they did expect and look for all Good from him: And hence the Apoſtle expounding this Saying, <hi>viz.</hi> believing that Chriſt is dead and riſen again, we ſhall hereby be ſaved: Rom. 10.9, 10. <hi>If thou believeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with thine Heart</hi> this Truth, <hi>thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Now <hi>to believe with the Heart,</hi> as it doth not exclude Aſſent, ſo it neceſſarily includes the Acts of the Will and Affections in relying upon him, and coming to him. And hence, when <hi>Peter</hi> had made that Confeſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. Chriſt tells him, <hi>Thou art Peter; i. e.</hi> a Stone reſting upon the Rock, (as ſome good Interpreters expound it) and therefore <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith did not exclude theſe principal Acts of reſting on Chriſt, cleaving to Chriſt, but did include and ſuppoſe them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some run into another Extream, and make Faith nothing elſe, but a Perſwaſion or Aſſurance that Chriſt died for me in particular, or that he is
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005059_0126_1016969174806630"/>
mine. That which moves ſome thus to think, is the univerſal Redemption by the Death of Chriſt; they know no Ground or Bottom for Faith but this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Chriſt died for thee, and hence makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption univerſal: And hence the <hi>Arminians</hi> boaſt ſo much of their <hi>Quod unuſquiſque tenatur credere,</hi> &amp;c. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a falſe Bottom, for Chriſt hath not died for all, becauſe he hath not prayed for all, <hi>John</hi> 17.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is a ſandy Bottom and Foundation, which when a Chriſtian reſts upon, it ſhakes under him, when the Soul ſhall think, tho' Chriſt hath died for me, yet no more for me, than for <hi>Judas,</hi> or Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Reprobates now in Hell. Indeed after Faith, a Chriſtian is bound to believe it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>I conceive therefore thoſe holy Men of ours who have deſcribed Faith by Aſſurance, have not ſo much aimed at a Deſcription of what Faith is in it ſelf, as it poſſeſſeth us with Chriſt; but of what Degree and Extent it may be, and ſhould be in us; they deſcribe it therefore by the moſt eminent Act of it, in full Aſſurance: And therefore conſult with the Authors of this Deſcription, and enquire of them, Is there no Doubting mixt with Faith? Yes, ſay they, Man's Doubtings ſometimes are even unto a Kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but then (ſay they) it ſhould not be thus. The Papiſts commend Doubtings, and deny Aſſurance, place Faith in a general Aſſent; our Champions that were to wreſtle with them, maintained it to be a particular Application, (and not only a general Aſſent) and that with a full Aſſurance of Perſwaſion, which being the moſt eminent Act of Faith, excludes not other inferior Acts of it, which as they are before it, ſo may poſſeſs the Soul with Chriſt without it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005059_0127_1016964D8A1158C8"/>
withal, it is certain, that there is no true Faith, but it hath ſome Aſſurance, of which afterward.</p>
                  <p>Let me now come to the Explication of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription given, where note theſe five Things.</p>

                     <p>Faith is a gracious Work of the Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit therefore is the efficient Cauſe or principal Workman of Faith; the Spirit doth not believe, but cauſeth us to believe; 'tis not <hi>Principium qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What do you tell me of Mercy? ſaith the Soul) 'tis Mercy which I have continually reſiſted, deſperately deſpiſed; why do you perſwade me to believe? Alas I cannot; 'tis true, all that which you ſay is true, if I could believe, but I cannot ſee Chriſt, I cannot come at Chriſt, I ſeek him in the Means, but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes me there, and I am left of God deſolate; and

here, Beloved, the Soul had not formerly ſo many Excuſes for its Sin, as now it hath Clouds of Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt believing; the Spirit therefore takes faſt hold of the Souls of all the Elect, draws them unto Chriſt; and therefore it is called <hi>the Spirit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. and that by an omnipotent and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Power, Iſai. 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> That the Soul muſt and ſhall believe now. <hi>Compell them to come in,</hi> ſaith the Lord of the Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. This the <hi>Arminians</hi> will not believe, for (ſay they) the Queſtion is not, Whether we are enabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by Grace? but, Whether it be after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by this Means, <hi>viz. modo irreſiſtibilli?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore theſe Reaſons, to clear this Point,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whence doth our Call and Coming to Chriſt ariſe, but from God's immoveable and unchangeable Purpoſe? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. The Lord therefore muſt either alter his Purpoſe, or prevail with the Soul to believe, and over-power the Heart thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is not Chriſt Jeſus bound by Office and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the Father to bring in all his loſt ſcattered Sheep, that ſo the Father and he may be glorified in them? John 10.16. <hi>Other Sheep I have, thoſe I muſt bring home, and they ſhall hear my Voice.</hi> You that complain you cannot believe, nay, that you have no Heart to believe, the Lord muſt fetch you in; and you ſhall hear the Bridegroom's Voice with Joy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is not the Act of believing wrought by a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Power? <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.18, 19. <hi>I create the Fruit of the Lips Peace, Peace to him that is near, and afar off:</hi> And is not a creating Voice irreſiſtable, though there be nothing for it to work upon? So tho' you have no Ability, Heart, Head,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:005059_0129_10169652709030A0"/>
or Strength to believe, yet the Lord will create the Fruit of the Lips of God's Meſſengers, Peace, Peace.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Doth not the Lord let in that infinite and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Sweetneſs of Grace, when he works the Soul to believe, ſtanding in extream Need of that Grace, that it cannot but come and cleave to it? Pſal. 63.2.3. <hi>I long to ſee thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, for thy Loving-kindneſs is better than Life;</hi> it is impoſſible for a Man to cleave to his Life? Much more to that which is better than Life: The Light is ſo clear, it cannot but ſee and wonder at Grace; the Good is ſo ſweet, it cannot but taſte and accept what God ſo freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7. And therefore the poor <hi>Canaani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Woman, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. could not be driven away, tho' Chriſt bid her in a Manner be gone; but ſhe made all the Objections againſt her Arguments for her (as uſually Faith doth, when under this Stroke of the Spirit) <hi>the Violent take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force;</hi> the Spirit puts a Neceſſity upom them, and irreſiſtably over-powers them, and this is the Cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>And is not this matter of great Conſolation to all thoſe who feel themſelves utterly unable to Believe? You think the Lord would give Peace and Pardon, Life and Mercy, if I could Believe; Oh conſider the Lord hath undertaken in the Covenant of Grace to work in all his the Condition of the Covenant, as well as to convey the good of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. He hath done this for others by an irreſiſtable Power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. Look up to Jeſus the author and finiſher of your Faith, He came out of his Father's Boſom, not only to give Life by his Death, but to enable his to Eat and Cloſe with him by Faith, that they might <hi>never Die, John</hi> 6.50. So that the Lord may work it in thee; it is true alſo, he may not, yet
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:005059_0130_10169696F6121250"/>
it is unſpeakable Comfort to conſider, that if the Lord had put it over unto thee to Believe, it is certain thou ſhouldſt never have Believed, but now the Work is put into the Hand of Chriſt; that which is impoſſible to thee, is poſſible, nay eaſy, with him; he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thee, when thou canſt not apprehend him: This is exceeding ſweet when the Body is Sick, and Soul is Deſerted, incredible things to be Believed, are Propounded, an impoſſible Work to thy Weakneſs Urged, upon Pain of God's ſoreſt and moſt unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wrath; to conſider it is not in me, but in the Lord's own Hand, and it is his Office, his Glory to work Faith, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>to ſhew Mercy unto them that are ſhut up,</hi> not only <hi>under Sin,</hi> but alſo <hi>Unbelief;</hi> Rom. 11.32. But why hath the Lord made thee feel thy inability to Believe? Truly the end of our Wants is not to make us Sin and ſhift for our ſelves, but to ask and ſeek for Supply, and the end of the continuance of thoſe Wants is, that we ſhould continue to aſk and ſeek. And doſt thou think thou ſhalt ſeek to the Lord by his own Hand to create Faith, and fetch thee in, and will not the Lord take his time to work it? <hi>He that Believes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 10.11. <hi>ſhall not be aſhamed;</hi> why ſo? <hi>Becauſe the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who is over all, is rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> ver. 12. If thou haſt not a Heart ſhut up from aſking of it; the Lord who hath Power, hath not a Heart ſhut up towards thee from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>But withal be thankful exceedingly, all you whoſe Hearts the Lord hath drawn and overcome; he came to his own People the <hi>Jews,</hi> and would oft have gathered them, but they would not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he forſook them, and left their Habitations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate; Oh how oft would the Lord have gathered

you, and you would not! yet the Lord hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken you, but called you in whether you would or no; the Lord hath taken many a Man at his firſt Word, and left him at his firſt Repulſe, ſhaken off the Duſt of his Feet againſt him preſently, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14. without any more Entreaties to accept of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet thou haſt not only refuſed, but even cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Son of God, yet he hath not been driven from thee, but his Bowels have been oft kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when he hath been ready to give thee up: When thou haſt been under the Hedges, and in the high Ways that lead to Death, and didſt never think of him, nor didſt deſire him, yet he hath compelled thee to come in; he hath made thee feel ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Work of Faith lies upon him, both to begin and finiſh; he muſt gather in all his loſt Sheep, and therefore he hath put forth an irreſiſtable Power of his Spirit upon thy Heart, which muſt carry thee Captive after him.</p>

to take Poſſeſſion by Faith of what is your own; doſt thou ſeriouſly will Chriſt, and reſolve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to give the Lord reſt, until he give thee reſt in him? Then ſee Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will let him take of the Water of Life.</hi> Doſt thou thirſt after Chriſt? Then read Iſai. 55.1, 2, 3.

It is the great Sin of many Saints, when they do thirſt, and believe, and come to Chriſt, and ſo are under the Promiſe of Grace; yet they think it Preſumption now to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and take Poſſeſſion of all thoſe Treaſures that be in Chriſt, but look that the Lord ſhould firſt make them feel, and then they will believe; whereas Faith ſhould now receive and drink in abundantly of the Fulneſs of Chriſt: Shall it be accounted Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any Man to eat his own Bread, and drink his own Drink, and put on his own Cloaths?

Verily this Hedge Faith, this Bramble Faith, that catches hold on Chriſt, and pricks and ſcratches Chriſt by more Impenitency, more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him, is meer Preſumption, which ſhall one Day be burnt up, and deſtroyed by the Fire of God's Jealouſy. Fie upon that Faith that ſerves only to keep a Man from being tormented before his Time. Your Sins would be your Sorrows, but that your Faith quiets you. But if Faith be accompanied with Repentance, Mourning for Sin, more Eſteem of God's Grace in Chriſt, ſo that nothing breaks thy Heart more than the Thoughts of Chriſt's unchangeable Love to one ſo vile, and this Love makes thee love much, and love him the more; as thy Sin encreaſeth, ſo thou deſireſt thy Love may encreaſe, and now the Stream of thy Thoughts run, how thou mayeſt live to him that died for thee. This was <hi>Mary</hi>'s Faith, who ſat at Chriſt's Feet weeping, waſhing them with her Tears, and <hi>loving him much, becauſe much was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;</hi> who tho' ſhe was accounted a preſumptuous Woman by <hi>Simon;</hi> and Chriſt himſelf ſuffered in his Thoughts, for ſuffering of her to come ſo near unto him; yet the Lord himſelf clears her therein, and juſtifies her before God and Man: Many a poor Believer thinks, If I ſhould Believe, I ſhould but preſume, and ſpin a Spider's Web of Faith out of my own Bowels: And hence you ſhall obſerve, this not Believing ſtops up the Work of Repentance, Mourning and Love, and all chearful Obedience in them; and on the contrary, if they did believe, it would be with them as themſelves think many Times, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is the ſecond Thing in the Deſcription of Faith, the Soul of an humbled Sinner is the Subject or Matter of Faith. I do not mean the Matter out of which Faith is wrought, (for there is nothing in Man out of which the Spirit begets it) but that wherein Faith is ſeated. I mean alſo the Habit of Faith, not the Principle of it; for that is out of Man in the Lord Jeſus, who is therefore called <hi>our Hope,</hi> as well as <hi>our Strength;</hi> the Soul therefore is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, called <hi>the Heart,</hi> Rom. 10.9. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.21. For we cannot go or come to Chriſt in this Life with our Bodies, we are <hi>here abſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. but the Soul can go to him, the Heart can be with him, as the Eye can ſee a thouſand Miles off, and receive the Species or Image of the Things it ſees into it, ſo the Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Faith, can ſee Chriſt afar off, it can long for, chooſe, and reſt upon the Lord of Life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the lively Image of Chriſt's Glory in it; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Chriſt were preſent upon Earth, the Soul (not the Body) only could truly receive him; Chriſt comes to the Elect only by his Spirit, and hence on Spirits only are fit to receive him and cloſe with him.

deaf to all God's Calls, their Spirits ſee not, taſte not, feel not; it is therefore the <hi>Soul</hi> that is the Subject of Faith: And, I ſay, it is an <hi>humble empty</hi> Soul which is the Subject; for a full, proud, broken Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot, nay, will not, receive Chriſt, as we have proved; and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 14. the Servant is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bid the <hi>poor, halt, and blind, and Lame to come in;</hi> they would not make Excuſes as others did: They that were ſtung to Death with <hi>fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> were the only Men that the <hi>braſen Serpent</hi> was lifted up for them <hi>to look upon,</hi> and to be <hi>healed,</hi> John 3.14. And therefore the Promiſe doth run, <hi>If any Man lack Wiſdom, let him aſk it,</hi> but <hi>if any Man want Wiſdom,</hi> Jam. 1.5. ſo if any Man want Light, want Life, want Peace, Pardon, want Chriſt and his Spirit, let them aſk, and the Lord will give, away with your Money if you come to theſe Waters to buy, and take <hi>freely: If any Man would be wiſe, let him be a Fool,</hi> (ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle) an empty Nothing: A Soul in a periſhing, helpleſs, hopeleſs Condition, is the Subject of Faith; ſuch only feel their Need of Chriſt, are glad at the Offer of Chriſt, and therefore ſuch only can and will receive Chriſt, and come unto Chriſt by Faith: And truly if we had but Hearts, the Conſideration of this might be Ground of great Comfort and Confidence unto all God's People, whoſe Souls come unto Jeſus Chriſt; for that which was in <hi>Thomas,</hi> John 21. is in all Men naturally, if we could ſee Chriſt with our Eyes, and feel him with our Hands, and embrace him (as <hi>Mary</hi> did) with our Arms, if we could hear himſelf ſpeak, we could <hi>then believe</hi> as they ſaid, <hi>if he will come from the Croſs,</hi> ſo we ſay, if he will come down from Heaven thus unto us, we will <hi>then</hi> believe; if we want this, we fear we may be at laſt deceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

we want Senſe, and cannot come to cloſe with our Eyes and Hands the Objects of our Faith; but Oh conſider this Point, we are made Partakers of Chriſt's Life and Salvation by him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. only yet certainly by Faith. Now this Faith is not by ſeeing him with our Eyes, coming near to him with our Bodies, but coming to him with our Souls; the Soul is the Seat of Faith. Now this you may do, tho' you never thus ſaw him, <hi>whom though you ſee not, yet believing you rejoice,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. This Coming of the Soul to Chriſt, doth make a firmer Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and Chriſt, than if thou wert bodily preſent with him in Heaven. For many touched and crowded him, that never were truly united to him, or received Virtue from him. If our Souls were in the third Heaven with Chriſt, who of us would then doubt of our Portion in him? I tell you, if your Souls go out of Sin and Self, unto Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and there reſt, this makes you nearer to him, than if your Souls were under his Wing in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heavens. The poor Sea-Man when he is near dangerous Shores, when he cannot go down to the Depth of the Sea to faſten his Ship, yet if he can caſt his Anchor twenty or forty Fathom deep, and if that holds, this quiets him in the foreſt Storms; when we are toſſed and cannot come to Chriſt with our bodily Preſence, yet if our Souls can come, if our Faith, our Anchor, can reach him, and knit us to him, this ſhould exceedingly comfort our Hearts.</p>

our ſelves, you ſee great Eſtates are conveyed and ſurrendred by Bond and Writings. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. when they received <hi>the Word,</hi> they received <hi>Chriſt.</hi> John 15.7. <hi>If my Words abide in you, i. e.</hi> If I abide in you by my Words, you ſhall be fruitful.</p>
                     <p>By the Word let thine Eye pitch upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: do not only account the Promiſe true, but with <hi>Sarah, Heb.</hi> 11.11. account <hi>him</hi> Faithful who hath promiſed; and then let thy Heart roll it ſelf upon that Grace and Faithfulneſs revealed in this Word, lean upon the Breaſt of this Beloved: And thus the Soul by the Chariot Wheels and Wings of the Word, is Poſſeſſor of Chriſt in it, and carried up to Chriſt's Croſs, as dying, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. and from thence to his Glory in his Kingdom by it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. As a Man that gives a great Eſtate by ſome Writing to us, we believe it as if he were preſent; and by this we do not only believe the Writing to be true, but the Man to be faithful and loving to us; and hereupon our Hearts are carried after the Man himſelf, tho' afar off from us. Thus we aſcend to Chriſt in the Cloud of Faith; as <hi>Jacob,</hi> tho' he could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, yet as ſoon as he was perſwaded <hi>Joſeph</hi> was yet alive, his Spirit preſently revived, and it was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with him, before his Body came to him: So 'tis with Faith; the Soul goes unto Chriſt, before our Bodies and Souls both together ſhall have immediate Communion with him.</p>

                     <head>III. The Form of Faith.</head>
                     <p>This is the third Thing in the Deſcription of Faith; the coming of the whole Soul out of itſelf unto Chriſt is the Form of Faith, and that wherein the Life and Eſſence of it conſiſts, and which doth difference it from all other Graces of the Spirit. The firſt Act of Faith, as it unites us to Chriſt, is not Aſſurance that

he is mine, but a coming to him with Aſſurance that hereby he is become mine. <hi>Come unto the Waters,</hi> and <hi>ſo buy Wine and Milk,</hi> Iſai. 55.1, 2. <hi>i. e.</hi> now make them your own. The <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> ſhall not <hi>have reſt,</hi> unleſs they come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. Faith doth nothing for Life, (for that is the Law of Works) it only receives him who hath done all for it, it comes out of all it hath or doth, (like <hi>Abraham</hi> that left his Servants behind him, when he went up to God in the Mount) unto Chriſt for Life. Conceive it thus; <hi>Adam</hi> had a Principle and Stock of Life in himſelf, in his own Hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to live by this, to live of himſelf, and from himſelf, and therefore had no Need nor Uſe of Faith; he lived by the Law of Works; which the Apoſtle ſets in a direct Oppoſition to the Law of Faith; but <hi>Adam</hi> being now fallen, hath loſt his Life, and became not like the Man that fell among Thieves betwixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> ſtript, wounded, and half dead, but <hi>wholly dead,</hi> Eph. 2.1. ſo that let any Man ſeek Life from himſelf, it's impoſſible he ſhould live: For if there had been a Law that could have given Life, our Righteouſneſs ſhould have been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. Hence it follows, if any Man will have Life, he muſt go out of himſelf to another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord of Life for it, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. and 6.27, 28, 29.</p>
                     <p>Now obſerve it, this very Coming, this very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul to Chriſt, (a Grace which <hi>Adam</hi> neither had, nor had Power to uſe) is Faith; the Spirit of Chriſt moving or drawing the Soul, the Soul is thence moved, and ſo comes to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.64, 65. The Soul by Sin is averted from God, and turns his Back upon God; the Turning or Coming of the Soul (not unto Duties of Holineſs, for that is
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:005059_0140_101696A4B465F890"/>
Obedience properly, but) unto God, in Chriſt again, is properly and formally Faith. All Evil is in Man's ſelf, and from himſelf; all Man's Good is in Chriſt, and from Chriſt. The Souls of all God's Elect, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Things, forſake and renounce themſelves, in whom and from whom is all their Evil, and come unto Chriſt, in whom and from whom is all their Good. This Motion of the Soul between theſe Extreams, thro' that vaſt and infinite Diſtance that is between a ſinful wretched Man and a bleſſed Saviour, is Faith; for by Faith principally we <hi>paſs from Death to Life,</hi> John 5.24. The Soul of a poor Sinner wounded and humbled; ſometimes knows not Chriſt, and then crys out, as thoſe Acts 2.37. <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> Whither ſhall I go? Sometimes dares not, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cannot, it hath no Heart to ſtir or come, it therefore looks up, and longs, and goes unto the Lord to draw it, like poor <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>Oh turn me Lord, and then I ſhall be turned,</hi> Lam. 5.21. and this is the loweſt and leaſt Degree of Faith. But at ſome other Time, the Soul mourning for Want of the Lord, the Lord comes unto it with great Clearneſs, Glory and Sweetneſs of Grace and Peace; and hence the Soul cannot but come and cloſe with him, and cry, <hi>Rabboni,</hi> and ſay, Oh Lord, is it thy good Pleaſure to have Reſpect to ſuch a Clod of Earth, to render ſuch Riches of Grace to one ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and to bid, nay, to beſeech me to come and take? Lord, behold I come: This is Faith. Would you have a Proof of it? Conſider therefore theſe Particulars, 1. Conſider theſe Scriptures: John 6.35. <hi>I am the Bread of Life, he that cometh to me ſhall never Hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall never Thirſt.</hi> Where you ſee <hi>Coming to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt</hi> are all one. So John 7.37. <hi>In the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005059_0141_10169661D9A49340"/>
laſt Day of the Feaſt the Lord Chriſt crys out with much Vehemency, If any Man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> Now in the next Verſe our Saviour expounds this <hi>Coming;</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>He that believeth on me, out of his Belly,</hi> &amp;c. So to come to Chriſt, as upon this to drink in of Chriſt's Fulneſs, is believing in Chriſt. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> and then in rendering the Reaſon of this, explains what he meant by <hi>Faith, viz.</hi> to be our Coming unto God, upon a double Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>believing</hi> firſt <hi>that he is,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him diligently,</hi> or (which is all one) who do come unto him. So John 1.12. <hi>So many as received him,</hi> (which is all one with Coming) <hi>he adopted them as Sons, even to them that believe in his Name.</hi> And hence we ſhall obſerve, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not attribute our Righteouſneſs and Life to our believing <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, but to our believing <hi>on</hi> Chriſt, <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, (a Phraſe peculiar to heavenly Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and therefore not found in any human Writer) becauſe it is not the bare believing of a Teſtimony that ſaveth us, unleſs we ſo believe it, as to believe in Chriſt, which cannot be but by Coming to him, and as it were in him, or into him, our Union with Chriſt being made compleat hereby.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That upon which the Lord promiſed Life, and Salvation, and Mercy, cannot be Works, but Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. but thro' out all the old and new Teſtament, the Lord promiſeth Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Commers, or to them that return, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>John</hi> 5.40.</p>

3.12. and 10.38. <hi>John</hi> 6.64, to 69. and 12.37, to 40. The Lord's great Plot is to gather all his Elect under the Wings of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9, 10. and therefore calls them to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them by the Voice of the Goſpel. The coming under them therefore can be nothing elſe but Faith, the proper Obedience to the Goſpel, as Works are under the Voice of the Law. Thus Faith is the Coming of the Soul to Chriſt. But you will ſay, Did not many come to Chriſt that were never ſaved by him?</p>
                     <p>Yes, many came to him with their bodily Preſence, that were excluded from him, <hi>John</hi> 6.36.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, Do not many Men's Souls come, are not many Men's Hearts moving towards Chriſt, and yet excluded from Chriſt? Do not many cry, Lord, Lord? Are not many enlightned and taſte of this heavenly Gift, and yet fall away? I confeſs 'tis very true; and therefore it is ſet down in this Deſcription of Faith, that it is the coming of the whole Soul unto Chriſt. Never did any yet come to Chriſt, and receive him with their whole Souls, with all their Hearts, but they had Fruition of him, and Bleſſedneſs by him; Faith therefore is not the coming of the Soul, but the coming of the whole Soul unto Jeſus Chriſt; and this you may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in upon theſe Grounds.</p>

Oh, Beloved, what is the Reaſon, that many a Man's Faith doth him no Good, derives no Life, Spirit, Blood, Efficacy, Peace, Power from the Lord Jeſus? Is it becauſe Chriſt is a dry Chriſt, and unwilling to communicate? No, no, the Wound is in their Faith, that Pipe is laid but half Way to him, they fall one Foot ſhort of him, their Souls come, but their whole Souls do not come to him, and hence they never reach Chriſt; they lie not in Chriſt, and therefore receive not from Chriſt, Chriſt is precious, (here their Souls come) but not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious, <hi>Preciouſneſs</hi> it ſelf, as the Word is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.

the Miſtery of Mercy in the Goſpel; but when the Will adheres and claſps about that infinite and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Good it ſees, then it is perfected and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. And this is the Reaſon, why ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith (as it is called) doth not look only to a bare Teſtimony and Aſſent unto it, as human Faith doth; becauſe in the Goſpel not only divine Truth is propounded to the Mind to aſſent unto; but an infinite and eternal Good is offered to the Heart and Will of Man to embrace, and thence it is that it is not ſufficient for a Chriſtian to believe God or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt, but he muſt alſo believe in him, or elſe he cannot be ſaved; the Object of believing of him being <hi>verum,</hi> or Truth; the Object of the ſecond, <hi>bonum,</hi> or Good: Take heed therefore a poor loſt Sinner, undone in its own Eyes for ever, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do, unleſs it be to lie down, and lie ſtill at God's Feet as worthy of nothing but Hell; what doth the Lord now do? The Lord Chriſt by his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel firſt lets in a new Light, and it ſees the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus there bleeding before its Eyes, and held forth as a Propitiation to all that believe, to all that come to him; the Mind ſees this Myſtery, this exceeding rich Grace and free Mercy, and thinks happy are they that ſhare in this Mercy, but will the Lord look upon ſuch a Nothing as I? Can ſuch infinite Treaſures be my Portion? The Lord therefore calls and bids them come away and enter into the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it: Thy Sins indeed are great, ſaith the Lord, yet remember, blood-thirſty <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> was pardoned; nay, remember my Grace is free, for whoſe Sake I invite thee: I beſeech thee to come in, thy Wants indeed are many, yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou haſt therefore the more Need and Cauſe to come, and that it is I that have made thee

Hereupon the Heart and Will come, and reſt, and roll themſelves upon theſe Bowels, and there reſt, thus the whole Soul comes, and this I ſay again is Faith. Juſt as it is with the Load-ſtone drawing the Iron, who would think that Iron ſhould be drawn by it? But there is a ſecret Vertue coming from the Stone which draws it, and ſo it comes and is united to it; ſo who would think that ever ſuch an iron, heavy, earthy Heart, ſhould be drawn unto Chriſt; yet the Lord lets out a ſecret Vertue of Truth and Sweetneſs from himſelf, which draws the Soul to Chriſt, and ſo it comes.</p>

that they may find reſt at laſt in Chriſt. When thus the Soul is entred into Reſt, the whole Soul is drawn here, and this is the great Reaſon why many Men famous in their Generations and Times in the Eyes of others for Faith; yet rotten at the Heart, and thence turn Apoſtates, one proves covetous, another ambitious, another voluptuous, another grows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, another grows contentious, another grows formal. What is the Reaſon of this? Verily they did reſt upon Chriſt, but did never find reſt in Chriſt, and therefore their whole Soul never came to him: Chriſt after ſome Time of Profeſſion grew a dry and common Chriſt unto them, tho' at firſt they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at him, and he was very ſweet unto them; and hence they departed from him, as from an empty dry Pit in Summer time, where they found nothing to refreſh them: But the Lord Jeſus carries it towards all the Faithful; as <hi>Elkanah</hi> did towards <hi>Hannah;</hi> tho' ſhe was in a Fit, much vexed and troubled for want of Children, yet becauſe he loved her exceeding dearly, he quiets her again with this, <hi>Am not I better unto thee than ten Sons?</hi> So tho' they may be unquiet for ſome odd Fits for want of many Things, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt loved them, he brings them back unto their Reſt, ſaying, <hi>Am not I better than all Friends, all Creatures, all Abilities, all ſpiritual and created Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies;</hi> and hereby they find Reſt to their Souls in him again.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A double minded Man, who hath a double Heart, makes not a daily War againſt that Heart which carries him away from reſting only in Chriſt: For Chriſt quiets his Conſcience, and the World comforts his Heart. Chriſt gives him ſome reſt; and becauſe this is not full, his Heart runs out to the Creature, and to his Luſts for more; and ſo between them both he hath reſt, and he is quieted with this, becauſe he feels what he ſought for: And therefore he muſt have Chriſt, elſe his Conſcience cannot be quiet, and he muſt needs have his Luſts, his Eaſe, and this World too, elſe his Heart is moſt unquiet; but let him have both, he is now quiet, Micah 3.11. <hi>The Prieſts teach for Hire,</hi> (there the World quiets them) <hi>yet they will lean upon the Lord too,</hi> becauſe this alſo comforts them; what do they now do?

                     <p n="2">2. All the Out-runnings of the Hearts of the Faithful, and their Diſquietneſs of Spirit thereby, make them to return to their Reſt again, and give them the more Reſt in the Concluſion: <hi>David</hi> was a Bird out of his Neſt for a Time, and therefore when he conſidered how the Lord had <hi>ſaved his Eyes from Tears, his Soul from Hell,</hi> returns again, and ſaith, <hi>Return to thy Reſt, O my Soul,</hi> Pſal. 25.13.

of a Believer's coming unto Chriſt: The End of Faith is ſometimes expreſt by a general Word <hi>Life, John</hi> 5.40. but you muſt remember that hereby is meant the Lord of Life firſt, and ſo all the Bleſſings of Life. The Falſeneſs and Hypocriſy of Chriſt's Followers appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. <hi>you ſeek me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for Loaves,</hi> that was their End; as many a one in theſe Days if they be in outward Miſery, ſeek to Chriſt for outward Mercy, Corn in Time of Famine, Health in Time of Sickneſs, Peace upon any Terms in Time of War; and if they be in any inward Diſtreſs, now they ſeek to Chriſt for Comfort and Quiet, and ſo like many ſick Patients deſire the Phyſician, not to have him married to them, but for ſome of his Phyſick only, to be healed by him: But what ſaith our Saviour to theſe Perſons, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Labour not for the Meat that periſheth,</hi> what ſhould be the End of their Labour then?

Conceive of this thus: God in Chriſt is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Object of Faith under a double Notion: Firſt, as Sufficient, in being all we want unto us: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Efficient, in communicating all to us, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all for us. In the firſt Reſpect, he is <hi>El-ſhaddai,</hi> in his Promiſe; in the ſecond Reſpect he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Exod. 6.3. in making good his al-ſufficient Promiſe; hence Faith comes to him for a double End, firſt, that he would give himſelf and be all to it; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he would communicate all his Bleſſings, and the Benefits alſo, and ſo do all for it. For in the

of Chriſt? Iſai. 9.6, 7. <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given;</hi> in the receiving therefore of Chriſt by Faith, what ſhould the Soul aim at, but that it may have the Son himſelf, and ſo all his Benefits with him?</p>

I am ſure the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirms it, 1 John 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, he that hath not the Son, hath not Life:</hi> Faith therefore muſt come for Chriſt himſelf: As in Marriage the Woman conſents firſt to have the Man, and ſo to have all other Benefits that neceſſarily follow upon this.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Happineſs of all the Saints conſiſts in two Things: Firſt, Union to Chriſt; Secondly, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt.

In one Word, Faith firſt buys the Pearl it ſelf, and then ſeeks to be enriched by it; it finds <hi>the Treaſure of Grace,</hi> Glory, Peace, Mercy, Favour, Reconciliation in Chriſt, but then buys the <hi>Field</hi> it ſelf, that it may have the Treaſure alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44.

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:005059_0157_101696BF1E776C58"/>
and Faith deſires firſt to have him, and be for ever with him, <hi>and ſo</hi> to partake of that Glory: The Lord's great Plot is firſt to perfect the Saints in Chriſt, Col. 2.10. <hi>Ye are compleat in him;</hi> then to make them like to Chriſt by communicating Life, Grace, Peace, Glory from him. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1, 2.

Then look that God ſhould ſhortly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee out of his Sight; aſſuredly you that Want or Deſpiſe the Benefits coming from him, ſhall never have Part nor Portion in him at the great Day of Account; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Saviour <hi>to ſave Men from their Sins;</hi> not <hi>to ſave Men and their Sins; Chriſt</hi> is King and Prieſt of his Church, <hi>holy and ſeparated from Sinners,</hi>

                     <p>Let all deluded Familiſts tremble at this, that in advancing Chriſt himſelf, and free Grace, aboliſh and deſpiſe thoſe heavenly Benefits which flow from him, unto all the Elect.

                     <p>Oh come, come therefore unto the Lord Jeſus for Chriſt himſelf, and for all his Benefits; I ſay for <hi>all</hi> his Benefits.

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005059_0159_101696C1CCF828F0"/>
between the Faith of the Elect and the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, (and if I miſtake not, the principal) the Elect cloſe with Chriſt for that End, for which the Father offers him, which is, that they might poſſeſs his Son, and all his Benefits, and therefore come poor and empty for all; the Reprobate come not for all, but for ſo much and no more than will ſerve their own Turn; in Miſery they would have Chriſt to deliver them, but what care they for ſpiritual Mercies? In Trouble of Conſcience, or after their Soul falls into filthy Luſts and Sins, they come to Chriſt to forgive them and comfort them, but what care they for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and a new Nature? Some Sins they would have Chriſt ſave them from, but they regard not Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all; they cannot come to Chriſt, that all the Powers of Darkneſs may be perfectly ſubdued, that their own Sins, and Selves, Conceits, and Wills may be led away Captive by this mighty Conqueror; that Chriſt in all his Authority, Grace, Peace, Life, Glory, might be forever advanced in them and by them.</p>
                     <p>It was <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Complaint in his Time of many of his Hearers, that <hi>Chriſtum aſſequi,</hi> to have Chriſt was pleaſing to them; but <hi>ſequi Chriſtum,</hi> to follow Chriſt, this was heavy. To cloſe with Chriſt's Perſon, is ſweet to many; but to cloſe with his Will, and to come to him that he would give them a Heart to lie under it, this Benefit they deſire not. All Chriſt is uſeleſs and needleſs; but ſomething from Chriſt is precious to them: For the Lord Jeſus ſake, Beloved, take heed of this Deluſion. If any Thing have been bought for us at a dear Rate, and coſt much; if the Man ſhould offer to hold any Part of it back, we will not abate him any Thing, we will have it all, becauſe it coſt dear: I tell you, Pardon of Sin, Peace with

God, the Adoption of Sons, the Spirit of Grace, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to the End, the Kingdom of Glory, the Riches of Mercy, have been bought for you by a dear and great Price, the precious Blood of Chriſt; and therefore if the Juſtice of God ſhould hold back any Thing, or thy own Belief tell thee theſe are too great and many for ſo vile a Creature as thou art to enjoy, yet abate the Lord nothing; ſay thou art vile, yet Chriſt's Blood that bought not ſome, but all theſe, is very precious, and therefore take them all to thy ſelf, as thy Portion for ever, and <hi>bleſs the Lord,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> doth, Pſal. 16.7. <hi>that gave thee this Counſel.</hi> Whiles you are in Peace, it may be you may neglect ſo great Salvation; but the Time of Diſtreſs and Anguiſh may come wherein you may feel a Need of all, even of thoſe hidden Depths of Mercy above your Reach and Reaſon; and therefore, as Bees ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your Honey in Summer Time, and with <hi>Joſeph</hi> lay up in theſe Times of Plenty, wherein the exceeding Riches of Grace is opened and pour'd out at your Heels, for thoſe Times of approaching Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and for thoſe many Years of ſpiritual Deſertion and Diſtreſs, wherein you may think, Can it ſtand with the Honour of God to ſave ſuch a poor ſinful Creature as I am?

to a little Handful of poor Believers, not only in making them empty, but in keeping them ſo all their Days; and therefore come to the Lord poor, empty, naked, nothing, curſed in the Senſe or their Want of all Things, but for all Things, and then receive with Gladneſs, yet Boldneſs and holy Confidence, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pardon of ſome Sins, but of all; believe, anſwer not to ſome Prayers, but all.

It is a great Eaſe of Conſcience, when may a Chriſtian take a Promiſe without Preſumption as ſpoken to him, and given to him in particular? And the Rule is very ſweet, but certain: When he takes all the Scripture and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth it as ſpoken unto him, he may then take any particular proper Promiſe boldly; my Meaning is, when Chriſtian takes hold and wreſtles with God for the Accompliſhment of all the Promiſes of the new Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, when he ſets all the Commands before him, as his Rule and Compaſs and Guide to walk after, when he applies all the Threatnings to drive him nearer unto Chriſt the End of them; this no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite can do, this the Saints ſhall do, and by this may know when the Lord ſpeaks in any particular to them; go I ſay again therefore unto the Lord for all, and in the Senſe of all your Emptineſs be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly comforted, that tho' you do not find ſupply from Chriſt, yet you come unto the Lord Chriſt for it: It is a certain Rule, you ſhall not alway want that Good which you come to Chriſt to ſupply, nor always be maſtered with that Sin which you come to Chriſt with, to take away; only then beſure you come for <hi>all;</hi> otherwiſe you do not come truly: Come firſt for Chriſt himſelf, and then (as I ſaid) for <hi>all</hi> his Benefits.</p>

Now the Promiſes are not given to the Elect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without Chriſt, but firſt Chriſt is given, <hi>i. e.</hi> offered in the Goſpel and received by Faith, and then with him all Things alſo: And therefore the Scripture runs thus, Iſai. 55.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Come unto the Waters and drink, and then I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant,</hi> (which contains all the Promiſes) <hi>even the ſure Mercies of David:</hi> The Apoſtle expreſly diſputes the Caſe, and ſaith, <hi>Where a Teſtament is,</hi> (containing evangelical Promiſes) <hi>there muſt firſt be the Death of the Teſtator,</hi> Heb. 9.15, 16. to whom we muſt firſt <hi>come by Faith,</hi> before we can have Right to any Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22, 25. and 10.16, 17, 18, 22. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith,</hi> now <hi>we have Peace with God,</hi> nay, <hi>we have acceſs to God,</hi> nay, now <hi>we are of ſure ſtanding,</hi> now <hi>we hope in the Glory to come,</hi> Rom. 5.1, 2, 3, 4. all follows the firſt.</p>
                     <p>How ſhall a Chriſtian therefore live by Faith? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, firſt receive Chriſt and come to him for the End I mention; and then thou mayſt be ſure all other Things ſhall be given to thee. As for Example: Doſt want any temporal Bleſſing? Suppoſe it be Payment of Debts, thy daily Bread, Proviſion for thy Family, a comfortable Yoke-fellow, look now thro' the Scripture for Promiſes of theſe Things, and let thy Faith act thus: If God hath given me Chriſt, the greateſt Bleſſing, then certainly he will give me all theſe ſmaller Matters as may be good for me; but the Lord hath given me Chriſt, and therefore I ſhall not want, Pſal. 23.1. <hi>The Lord is my Shepard,</hi> ſaith

                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:005059_0168_10169715611CE9D8"/>1. The Nature of this Call, I ſhall open for your more diſtinct Underſtanding, in ſeveral Propoſitions, or Theſes.</p>
                     <p>Our Vocation or Calling is ever by ſome Word or Voice, either outward, or inward, or both; either ordinary or extraordinary; by the Miniſtry of Men, or by immediate Viſions and Inſpirations of God. I ſpeak not now of extraordinary Call, by Dreams and Viſions, and immediate Inſpirations, as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and others, before the Scriptures were penned and publiſhed: Nor of extraordinary Call, by the immediate Voice of Chriſt; as in <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome other of the Apoſtles; for thoſe are ceaſed now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. unleſs it be among People that want ordinary Means, &amp; elect Infants, &amp;c. whoſe Call muſt be more than by ordinary Means, becauſe they want ſuch Means; we ſpeak now of ordinary Call by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Voice in ordinary calling home of the Elect to Chriſt, is not by the Voice of the Law, (for the proper End of that is to reveal Sin and Death, and to caſt down a Sinner) but by the Voice of the Goſpel bringing glad Tydings; written by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and preached to the World. He hath <hi>called you by our Goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.14. <hi>Theſe Things are written that you might believe,</hi> John 20.31. <hi>By the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching, the Lord ſaves them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21, with 26. I mean Preaching at the firſt or ſecond Rebound, by lively Voice, or printed Sermons at the Time of Hearing, or in the Time of deep Meditation, concerning Things heard; the Spirit indeed inwardly accompanies the Voice of the Goſpel, but no Man's Call is by the immediate Voice of the Spirit without the Goſpel, or the immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit breathed out of free Grace without the Word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12, 13. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a Chriſtian ſhould be immediately called
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:005059_0169_101696CF6C621750"/>
without the Scripture, and the Scripture only given to confirm God's immediate Promiſe, as a Prince gives his Letter to confirm his Promiſe made to a Man before; (as <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> would have it) is both a falſe and dangerous Aſſertion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Voice of the Goſpel is the Voice of God in Chriſt, or the Voice of Jeſus Chriſt, altho' diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by Men, who are but weak Inſtruments for this mighty Work ſent and ſet in Chriſt's Stead; but the Call, the Voice is Chriſt's; it's the Lord's Call, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.6. It is certain ſome of the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Chriſt called the <hi>Romans</hi> by the Goſpel, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They were called by Chriſt Jeſus, the Dead hear his Voice and ariſe and live,</hi> John 5.29. 2 Theſ. 2.12, 13. And when the Time of Calling comes, they liſten to it as <hi>his</hi> Call: And hence it is ſtiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. becauſe the Lord Chriſt from Heaven ſpeaks, takes the written Word in his own Lips, as it were, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.1, 2. and thereby pierceth thro' the Ears to the Heart, thro' all the Noiſe of Fears, Sorrows, Objections againſt Believing, and makes it to be heard as his Voice; the Bowels of Chriſt now yern towards an humbled loſt Sinner, bleeding at his Feet, therefore can contain no longer, but ſpeaks and calls, and makes the Soul underſtand his Voice: So that this Call is not a mean Buſineſs, becauſe the Lord Jeſus himſelf now ſpeaks, whoſe Voice is glorious.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Subſtance of this Call, or the Thing the Lord calls unto, is to <hi>come unto him:</hi> For there is a more common Calling (or as ſome Term it a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling) of Men, as ſome to the <hi>Maſters</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20, 21, 24. or to <hi>Office in Church or Common-wealth,</hi> as <hi>Aaron, Heb.</hi> 5.4. and the Voice there is to attend unto their Work to which they are called. There is alſo a remote End of Vocation, which is to <hi>Holineſs,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.7. and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:005059_0170_1016971739369F28"/>
unto Glory alſo, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. But we now ſpeak of more ſpecial Calling, the next End of which is <hi>to come unto Chriſt,</hi> the Soul hath lived many Years without him, the Lord Jeſus will now have the loſt Prodigal to come home, to come to him: The Soul is <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>heavy laden,</hi> and the Lord Jeſus could Eaſe it without its Coming to him: But this is his Will, he muſt <hi>come to him for it:</hi> Matth. 11.27. Jer. 3.7, 22. <hi>I ſaid after ſhe had done theſe Things, Turn unto me, come unto me ye back-ſliding Children, and I will heal your Back-ſlidings.</hi> Jer. 4.1. <hi>If thou returneſt, return unto me.</hi> This Voice, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> is one of the ſweeteſt Words that Chriſt can ſpeak, or Man can hear, full of Majeſty, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Grace, and Peace: A poor Sinner thinks; Will the Lord ever put up ſuch Wrongs as I have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, heal ſuch a Nature, take ſuch a Viper into his Boſom? Do any Thing for me? If there be but one in the World to be forſaken, is it not I? The Lord therefore comes and calls, <hi>Come unto me, and I will pardon all thy Sins, I will heal all thy Back-ſlidings, I will be angry no more,</hi> Jer. 3.12, 13. <hi>Tho' thou haſt committed Whoredom with many Lovers, yet return unto me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3.1. Tho' thou haſt reſiſted my Spirit, refuſed my Grace, wearied me with thine Iniquities, yet come unto me, and this will make me amends; I require nothing of thee elſe but <hi>to come,</hi> Iſai. 55.1, 2. For God's Call is out of free Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. and therefore calls for no more but only to come up and poſſeſs the Lord's Fulneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Call <hi>to come,</hi> is for Subſtance all one with the Offer of Chriſt; which conſiſts in three Things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Commandment to receive Chriſt as preſent and ready to be given to it; as when we offer any Thing
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:005059_0171_101696D27AD38260"/>
to one another, it is by commanding them to take it, <hi>John</hi> 4.23. And this binds Conſcience to believe, as you will Anſwer for the Contempt of this rich Grace, at the great Day of Account.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Perſwaſion and Intreaty to come and receive what we offer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. For in ſuch an Offer wherein the Perſon is unwilling to receive and we are exceeding deſirous to give, we then perſwade; ſo doth Chriſt with us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Promiſe; to offer a Thing without a Promiſe of having it, if we receive it, is but a mock-offer; and hence you ſhall find in Scripture ſome Promiſe ever annexed unto God's Offer, which is the Ground of Faith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This Call or Offer hath three ſpecial Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is inward as well as outward, for the Lord calls Thouſands outwardly who yet never come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want an inward Call to come; an inward whiſpering ſtill Voice of God's Spirit: And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He that hath heard and learned</hi> (not of Man only, but) <hi>of the Father, cometh unto me,</hi> John 6.45. The Lord doth not ſtand at the outward Door only and call to open, but the Lord Jeſus comes in, he comes near unto the very Heart of a poor Sinner makes that underſtand, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. and the Lord makes his Grace glorious, and his Mercy ſweet unto the Hearts of his Elect; look (ſaith the Lord Jeſus) how I have left Thouſand Thouſands in the World, and have had greater Cauſe ſo to have left thee; but behold I am come unto thee, Oh come thou unto me.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a particular Call; for there is a general Call and Offer of Grace to every one, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. Now tho' this be a Means to make it particular, yet
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:005059_0172_10169718C6640068"/>
the Spirit of Chriſt which is wont to apply Generals unto Particulars particularly, makes the Call particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that the Soul ſees that the Lord in ſpecial means me, ſingles out me in ſpecial to believe; otherwiſe the Souls of the Elect will not be much moved with the Call of God, ſo long as they think the Lord offers no more Mercy to me than to any Reprobate; and therefore the Spirit of Chriſt makes the Call particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Iſai. 43.1. <hi>I have called thee by Name:</hi> John 10.5. <hi>He calleth all his Sheep by Name;</hi> not that the Lord calls any by their chriſten Name (as we ſay) as the Lord did extraordinarily call <hi>Samuel, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Paul, Paul,</hi> but the Meaning is, look as the Lord from before all Worlds writ down their Names in the Book of Life, and loves them in ſpecial; ſo in Vocation (the firſt Opening of Election) the Lord makes his Offer and Call ſpecial, and ſo ſpecial as if it were by Name; for the Soul at this Inſtant, feels ſuch a ſpecial Stirring of the Spirit upon it, which it feels now, and never felt before; as alſo its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe ſo ſpoken unto, and its particular Objections ſo anſwered, and the Grievouſneſs of its Sin in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Grace ſo particularly applied, as if God the only Searcher of Hearts only ſpake unto it, and ſo dares not but think and believe that the Lord meaneth me.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is effectual as well as inward and particular, Luke 24.33. <hi>Compel them to come in,</hi> John 10.16. Chriſt's <hi>other Sheep ſhall hear Chriſt's Voice,</hi> and thoſe he <hi>muſt</hi> bring <hi>home;</hi> for every inward Call is not effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. There came a Man in without his wedding Garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.6, 7, 8. whence our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Many are called, but few choſen;</hi> but this I now ſpeak of, as <hi>a Calling out of Purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8, 28. and therefore never leaves the Soul, until it hath real Poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and reſts there; this Call falls
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:005059_0173_101696D5444C20D0"/>
upon a Sinner humbled, not hard hearted; and hence the Call is effectual, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12, 13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.10, 11. It is ſuch a Call as was in Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. And hence the Soul cannot but come, and when 'tis come it cannot depart, like <hi>Peter, Lord, Whither ſhould we go?</hi> And therefore tho' it hath never ſo many Objections in coming to Chriſt, never ſo much Weakneſs or Heartleſſneſs to cloſe with Chriſt, yet the Lord brings it home, and there keeps it, and now it infinitely bleſſeth God that ever the Lord gave it an Eye to ſee, an Heart to come and ſeek after Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thus much of the Nature of this Call, now follows the Neceſſity of it, which appears in theſe three Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No Man ſhould come unleſs firſt called; as it is in Calling to an ordinary Office, ſo 'tis in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling much more unto ſpecial Grace; the Apoſtle ſaith Heb. 5.4. that <hi>no Man takes this Honour, but he that is called of God;</hi> ſo what hath any Man to do with Chriſt, to make himſelf a Son of God, and Heir of Glory thereby, but he that is called of God? What have we to do to take other Men's Goods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs called thereto? What have we to do to take the Riches of Grace and Peace, if not called thereto? 'Tis Preſumption to take Chriſt whiles uncalled, but not when you are called thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe no Man would come without the Lord's Call: Matth. 20.6, 7. <hi>Why ſtand ye here all the Day idle?</hi> The Anſwer was, <hi>No Man hath hired,</hi> or <hi>called us thereto.</hi> When there is an outward Call only, yet Men will not come in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be an effectual Call to bring Men home, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.5. and therefore you ſhall ſee many, let there be a legal Command, ſuppoſe to ſanctify a
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:005059_0174_1016971AD0D84180"/>
Sabbath, or to ſpeak the Truth; they have no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt Obedience unto this: But preſs them to believe, ſhew them God's Call for it, they have more Fears and Objections riſing againſt this than there be Hairs on their Head, becauſe the Soul would not cloſe with this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe no Man could come, unleſs called: John 6.44. <hi>No Man can come unto me, unleſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him;</hi> and how doth the Father draw any Man but by this Call? If the Lord ſhould not come and ſpeak himſelf, and make his Call the moſt joyful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and ſweeteſt Meſſage that ever came to it, it would ſay, I have no Heart, I cannot, I am not able, for Rom. 11.32. <hi>We are ſhut up under Unbelief;</hi> and therefore the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.5. muſt bring his Sheep home upon his Shoulders, elſe it will lie in the Wilderneſs of it's own Droopings; whereas when the Lord effectually ſpeaks, the Soul cannot but come.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Laſtly, How this Call is a Ground of Faith, and what Ground of Faith.</p>
                     <p>For Anſwer hereunto, I do not make this Call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without the Promiſe, the Ground <hi>on which</hi> Faith reſts, (for that is God's free Grace in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) but the Ground <hi>by which</hi> it reſts, or wherefore it reſts upon the Promiſe. The Mind ſees (1.) The Freeneſs of Mercy to a poor Sinner in Miſery; and this breeds ſome Hope the Lord may pity it. (2.) The Fulneſs and plenteous Riches of Mercy, and this gives very great Encouragement to the Soul to think: The Lord (if I come to him) ſurely will not deny me a Drop, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 130.7, 8. The Prodigal <hi>comes home</hi> becauſe of <hi>Bread enough in his Father's Houſe,</hi> tho' he was not certain he ſhould have any. (3.) The Preciouſneſs and Sweetneſs of Mercy makes the Soul long vehemently for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6, 7. and makes
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005059_0175_101696D80556CA70"/>
it ſet all other Things at a low Rate to enjoy it, but when unto all this the Lord ſends a ſpecial Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a ſpecial Meſſage on purpoſe, and calls it to come in, and accept of it, and take Mercy as its own, and that for no other Reaſon, but becauſe it is commanded and called to accept of it; this puts an End to all Doubts, all Fears, all Diſcouragements, and the Soul anſwers as thoſe, Jer. 3.22. <hi>Behold we come, thou art the Lord our God.</hi> As a Man in great Want of Bread, one comes and freely offers him Bread to preſerve his Life, the Man takes it; if you aſk him, Why do you take it? you are a poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low unworthy of it, never did one Hour's Work for it: He anſwers, 'Tis true, I am unworthy, but yet becauſe it is offered to me to preſerve Life, I gladly take it; the Man doth not promiſe abſolutely to me, that this Bread is mine, and ſhall feed me; but he tells me, If I do receive it, it ſhall certainly be mine to feed me; and this is the main Ground of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing it. Juſt ſo it is in Faith; aſk an humbled Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Why do you believe? Why do you take Chriſt as your own? Hath the Lord ſaid abſolutely that he is yours? No, ſaith the Soul, but the Lord freely offers himſelf to me, who am undone without him, and ſaith, if I do receive him, he ſhall be for ever mine, to give Life to me, and therefore I thankfully accept of him; this is the Ground of Faith. The Scripture ſets out this in a lively Similitude of a <hi>great Supper,</hi> to which many were <hi>invited;</hi> what was the Ground of their coming to it? Behold, all Things are ready if you come and eat, they are not yours if you do not come; but if you come at my Call and Invitation, then all Things ſhall be yours, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. And hence it is that they that came not, were excluded; they that came were received with Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="unknown:005059_0176_10169720FB2ED548"/>I know 'tis a Queſtion of ſome Difficulty among ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether an abſolute Teſtimony of actual Favour and Juſtification be not the firſt Ground of Faith? They that make Faith to be an abſolute Aſſurance of God's Favour, muſt of Neceſſity main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Aſſertion, and then theſe Things will follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a Chriſtian muſt be juſtified before he believe; for the Cauſe of Faith muſt go before Faith. This Propoſition, <hi>Thou art juſtified, reconciled,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Aſſertion the Cauſe of Faith: for no Propoſition can therefore be true, becauſe we are perſwaded that it is true, but it muſt firſt be true, before I am perſwaded of it; the Wall is not white becauſe my Eyes ſee it ſo, but it muſt firſt be white, then I ſee it ſo. Now to make actual Juſtification before Faith, is croſs to the whole Current of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>We believe that we might be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. we are not juſtified that we might believe. <hi>We paſs from Death to Life by Faith,</hi> John 5.24. We are not in a State of Life before Faith. <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſaw their Faith,</hi> Matth. 9.2. <hi>he</hi> then <hi>ſaid, Be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi> The Word ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already,</hi> John 3.18. and therefore (unleſs the Spirit's Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be croſs to the Word) it doth not ſay to one that believeth not, that he is abſolved already. <hi>To be juſtified by Faith,</hi> and to be <hi>juſtified by Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> is all one in the Scriptures Phraſe and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, 17. And therefore we may as well ſay that we are juſtified before and without Chriſt, as before and without Faith. And indeed this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of being juſtified by Faith, and by this Means to have Remiſſion of Sins, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> affirms to be the Doctrine of all the Prophets, Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets Witneſs, that whoſoever
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:005059_0177_101696DAC3AAE760"/>
believe in him, ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> Not that they had Remiſſion of Sins before they did believe. I know not any one Proteſtant Writer that maintains our Juſtification before and without Faith, except learned <hi>Chamier;</hi> who not knowing how to avoid the Blow of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s horned Argument, that if Faith be an Aſſurance of our actual Juſtification, then we are firſt juſtified before we believe; he affirms we are juſtified before Faith: And therefore that when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>we are juſtified by Faith,</hi> the Reaſon of that (ſaith he) is not becauſe our Faith do <hi>efficere juſtificationem,</hi> i. e. is a Cauſe (meaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental) of our Juſtification, but becauſe <hi>efficitur in juſtificatio,</hi> i. e. is wrought in a juſtified Perſon: But if that be the Reaſon of the Phraſe, we may affirm our Juſtification to be as well by Love, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and holy Obedience, as by Faith, becauſe theſe are wro't in a juſtified Perſon alſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then no Man's Miniſtry, nor the Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt from out of the Scriptures, can be any Ground of Faith, for before Faith no Miniſter of Chriſt can ſay to any Man in particular, or any Men in general, that they are already juſtified, and reconciled, and therefore believe it; but to deny that Doctrine which is opened out of the Scriptures by the Miniſters of Chriſt, to be the Ground of Faith, is expreſly croſs to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scriptures, and the End of the Miniſtry, and the Meſſengers of Chriſt, who have the Keys of Office given to them, that <hi>what they bind on Earth, is bound in Heaven; what they looſe on Earth, is looſed in Heaven; whoſe Sins they remit, they are forgiven, whoſe Sins they retain, they are retained,</hi> Matth. 16.16. John 20.23. Moſt excellent for this Purpoſe is the Apoſtle's Diſpute, Rom. 10. <hi>You need not go up to
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005059_0178_10169723EBB938D8"/>
Heaven, nor down to Hell, to fetch Chriſt himſelf to tell you whether you ſhall be juſtified and ſaved,</hi> ver. 6, 7. <hi>for the Word is nigh them,</hi> ver. 8. that opens Chriſt's Heart unto thy Heart: But what Word might ſome ſay is this? Is it not the internal Word of the Spirit only? The Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>It is that Word which we preach:</hi> Hereby you ſhall know whether you ſhall live or no; but what is that Word <hi>Paul</hi> preached? Is it not an abſolute Teſtimony that all your Sins are already pardoned by Chriſt, and therefore believe it? No, but <hi>if thou believeſt with thine Heart that God raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> ver. 9, 11, 12. What can be more full? Yet conſider that one Place more, John 17.20. <hi>I pray for all them that ſhall believe on me, through their Word.</hi> What is the Ground or Means of believing in Chriſt? It is ſaid here expreſly, <hi>Their Word:</hi> Is it not the Word of Chriſt, rather than the Word of the Apoſtles and of their Succeſſors, in the Doctrine they delivered, is it their Word? Truly that which they delivered, was the Word of Chriſt, and that which is opened from their Doctrine in the Scriptures is the Word of Chriſt, yet as they open it, and apply it, ſo 'tis their Word: And this Word is the Ground by which all that Chriſt prays for, do believe in Chriſt; the bare Word I grant cannot perſwade without the Spirit, yet the Spirit will not give Ground to Faith without the Word, but as by it, ſo upon it, will build the Souls of all the Elect, who are <hi>built upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt being the chief Corner-ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2.20. <hi>How can they believe without a Preacher,</hi> Rom. 10.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then when wicked Men and Reprobates are commanded to believe, (as they are commanded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. <hi>John</hi> 6.38, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.) they are

commanded to believe a Lie, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Sins are pardoned, and they actually juſtified; for if this Teſtimony be the Ground of Faith, then when they are commanded to believe, they are commanded to be perſwaded of this Teſtimony. But the Sins of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, eſpecially Reprobates, are not, nor never ſhall be forgiven; and therefore this cannot be the Ground of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

alſo, then I ſay, the Teſtimony of the Spirit (which of it ſelf is exceeding clear) is an obſcure and dark Teſtimony, becauſe it clears up the Praedicate of this Propoſition, <hi>Thou Believer art juſtified,</hi> it witneſſeth to a Man, <hi>Thou art juſtified;</hi> but clears not up the Subject of it; viz. <hi>Thou Believer:</hi> It makes a Man believe a Teſtimony without underſtanding the full Meaning of it; for the Spirit teſtifying to any Man <hi>Thou art juſtified;</hi> his Meaning is, <hi>Thou Believer art juſtified.</hi> And I do beſeech the God and Father of all Lights, that his poor People may be led into the Truth in this Particular; for want of Eſtabliſhment here, you little think how many Deluſions you may fall into about your ſpiritual Condition; I remember that when Satan came to overthrow the Faith of Chriſt, in his ſecond Temptation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. he brought a Promiſe out of the Scriptures to him, becauſe he ſaw he held cloſe to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and by this Promiſe ſought to lead him into Temptation; how ſo?

O take heed therefore of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Teſtimony from Word or Spirit without the Meaning of it, without knowing the Perſon thus and thus qualified, to whom it belongs; otherwiſe Satan will hurry you head-long to a World of Deluſions; and you ſhall find the Word of God appointed to

direct you, (thro' your Miſ-application of it) the Word of Satan, to deceive and damn you: Do not think that this is building Faith upon Works; but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they that believe in Chriſt are juſtified, reconciled, and ſaved, is building Faith upon God's Promiſe; yea, and his free Promiſe too; For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>It is of Faith, that it might be of Grace,</hi> Rom. 4.16. It is believing to have the End by the Means, not the End without the Mean of Faith. It is true, we may ſee God's Favour and Love to us in the Cauſe as well as in the Effects of Sanctification; but what is that Cauſe? The meritorious Cauſe is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and the inſtrumental Cauſe of applying this, is our Faith; ſo that as we are juſtified by Faith, ſo ſeeing this, we may ſay aſſuredly with <hi>Paul, Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. It is true, we cannot ſee our Juſtification by Faith, nor the Work of Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſhining of the Spirit into our Hearts; but the Queſtion is not, whether the Spirit helps us to ſee our juſtified Eſtate, but by what Means; by what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Word we come to ſee it; which we may ſay is not by any ſuch abſolute Teſtimony: Thou art juſtified already, and therefore believe; but if thou believe and come to Chriſt, here is then Pardon of Sin, Peace with God, yea, all the Bleſſings of Chriſt ready for thee, which God intends to give and never to take away, if thou thankfully receive what God freely offers, and as it were lays down at thy Feet. The Call of Chriſt therefore is the Ground by which we firſt believe; and that you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed farther herein, do but conſider the Glory and Excellency of this Ground.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a conſtant Ground of Faith, for if you come to Chriſt becauſe you have Aſſurance, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

you feel ſuch an ſuch Graces, and heavenly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of God's Spirit in you, you may then many a Day and Year keep at a Diſtance from Chriſt, and live without Chriſt; for the Feeling of Graces, and Aſſurance of Favour are not conſtant; but this Call is alway ſounding in thine Ears, <hi>Oh come,</hi> not only becauſe thou feeleſt Holineſs in thee, but come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe poor, hungry, empty, naked, loſt, blind, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, forſaken, full of Sin; there is not one Moment of the Day of Grace, but the Lord beſeecheth thee to receive this Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. This is an open Door to Chriſt at all Times, an open Harbour to put in at in all Storms, a heart-breaking Word: Oh thou toſſed with Tempeſts and not comforted, come unto me, and thou ſhalt find reſt to thy Soul. Many aſk, How ſhould I come to Chriſt, ſeeing that I have no Promiſe belonging to me? What have Dogs to do with Children's Bread? Be it ſo, yet God's Call, Command, Beſeechings to come in, ſhould be Ground unto thee to come; as a poor Beggar, that hath no Promiſe abſolutely given him of Relief, yet if a rich Man ſends to him, and bids him come to the Door and wait, he thinks he hath good Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="2">2. It is a ſure Ground againſt all Fears, all Doubts of Preſumption, all Senſe of Unworthineſs and of the Greatneſs of the Good promiſed, &amp;c. For the Saints have many Fears whereby they dare not come, they fear they may preſume, they ſee themſelves moſt vile, and unworthy of the leaſt Smile; the Benefits are ſo exceeding great, to which they are called, that they think it is too good for them, &amp;c. But, Beloved, when the Soul ſees evidently the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites me, perſwades me, commands me, waits for me, ſtrives with me, that I would come in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:005059_0183_101696E55AF32798"/>
his Grace is free, therefore requires no more but only to <hi>come and take, come and drink:</hi> This forceth the Soul to confeſs, I am ſure it is no Preſumption to obey the Call of Chriſt; and what tho' I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and this Good is exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet if it be the Lord's Grace to call ſuch a poor Wretch to receive and accept of it, why ſhould I not rather thankfully receive it, than out of my own Head ſuperſtitiouſly refuſe it? But this I am ſure and certain of, the Lord calls me thus to do; if God ſhould ſpeak from Heaven to you to come unto his Son, it is not ſo ſure a Ground as the Call of God from out of the Oracle of his Word, in the bleſſed Goſpel of his dear Son.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a ſtrong Ground, and of great Power and Efficacy to force the Soul to come; for you may object, no Man can believe, or ſhould believe, and come of himſelf. I ſay ſo too; but how would you have the Spirit of Chriſt enable you to come? Verily, it is by this Call, and therefore, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. when the Lord ſaid, <hi>Return ye back-ſliding Children,</hi> they preſently anſwered, <hi>Lord we come. The Dead ſhall hear this Voice of the Son of God, and live,</hi> John 5.25. <hi>Thou ſaidſt, Seek ye my Face, my Heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Lord, thy Face will I ſeek.</hi> Oh iron, ſtony, adamantine Heart, that canſt hear ſo ſweet a Voice as this Word <hi>Come,</hi> and yet not be overcome!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Call honours Grace moſt, for what more free than for the Lord to ſay, <hi>Come and take of the Water of Life freely?</hi> What more free, than for a rich Man to enquire of his Debtor only to receive ſo many Thouſands of him to pay his Debts, and to ſet him up again? Verily Brethren, as the Lord honours his Grace by commanding us to come, ſo we honour it, when thro' the mighty Power of the ſame Call we do come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="unknown:005059_0184_10169729D282BD30"/>Thus much for Explication of this Call; now let me put an End to it in a Word of Application.</p>
                     <p>USE. Let this perſwade all Sorts of Perſons, young and old, one and another, to whom the Goſpel is ſent, to come unto Jeſus Chriſt; for thoſe that God calls ſhould come: But the Lord calls (at leaſt outwardly) all Sorts of Perſons; nay every individual Perſon to come in: <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Paul</hi> told the ſtout Jaylor, <hi>If thou believeſt thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> And look as the Law ſpeaks particularly to every Man, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods,</hi> &amp;c. ſo doth the Goſpel alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. that ſo every Man might look upon himſelf as ſpoken to in particular. And indeed if there were not ſuch a particular Call, then Men ſhould not Sin by refuſing the Goſpel, nor ſhould the Lord be angry for ſo doing, but their Sin and <hi>Condemnation</hi> is great that ſo do, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. And the Lord is more <hi>wroth</hi> for this Sin than any other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.10, 11, 19. In one Word, either the Lord would have thee (whoever thou art) to receive Chriſt, or to reject, and ſo deſpiſe Chriſt; and if the Lord would have you reject him, he would then have you ſin, and continue in it, which cannot ſtand either with the Honour of God's Holineſs, or of his rich Grace; I ſhall therefore open two Things,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Set down Means to enable you to come.</item>

                     <p>The Means.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Conſider, who it is that doth call you; is it Man or Miniſters think you? You might never come then; no, it is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf that calls you by them: Why do many diſcouraged Spirits refuſe to come? It is becauſe they think deceitful Men, or
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:005059_0185_101696E84D7C6098"/>
charitable Men call them, but the Lord hath no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto them: Oh fooliſh Conceit! I tell you their Miniſtry is not an Act of their Charity, wiſhing well to the Salvation of all, but it is an Act of Chriſt's Love and ſovereign Authority, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. So that what they do, it is in <hi>Chriſt's Stead,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. If Chriſt was preſent, he would call thee to him with more Bowels than any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Miniſter can: And I aſſure you, <hi>to receive</hi> them, is to <hi>receive Chriſt;</hi> to <hi>deſpiſe them,</hi> is to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe Chriſt,</hi> John 13.20. and therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. altho' the Apoſtles preached to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> yet it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt came</hi> and preached to them. <hi>If any Miniſter preached any other Doctrine of Grace than what Chriſt hath delivered, let him be accurſed:</hi> But if they publiſh his Mind and his Call, look upon them as if the Lord himſelf called unto you, leſt the Lord accurſe you, and all their Miniſtry to you; the Lord Jeſus did not caſt off the Jews for crucifying of him and ſhedding his Blood, until the Goſpel of Grace publiſhed by his Meſſengers, came to them, and that was rejected; then <hi>Paul</hi> waxed bold, and ſaid, <hi>Becauſe you put away the Word from you, we leave you,</hi> Acts 13.46.</p>
                     <p>Oh Beloved, if you did believe Chriſt called you poor Prodigals (that have run Riot, and ſinned againſt him as much as you could) home unto him; ſuppoſe Chriſt was preſent, would it not draw you in? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he was with thee in the Chamber, where thou art crying after him, or in the Church, where thou art waiting for him, and he ſhould appear viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine Eyes, open his Boſom, and Bowels, and Blood before thee, and calling unto thee to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I do beſeech thee and intreat thee by all theſe Tears I have ſhed for thee in the Days of my Fleſh,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:005059_0186_1016972C99BFB0A8"/>
by all thoſe bitter Agonies I have ſuffered for thee, by all theſe tender Bowels which have been rowled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether toward thee, come unto me, embrace me, lay thy wearied Head in this bleſſed Boſom of mine, crucify me no longer by thy Sins, tread me not under foot by thy Unbelief any more; and I will pardon all thy Sins tho' as red as Crimſon, I will heal thy curſed Nature, I will carry thee in my own Bowels up to Glory with me, where all Sins and Tears and Sorrows ſhall be aboliſhed, &amp;c. Who would not come in to him? Let me ſee that Man that hath a Heart of Adamant that would not melt and come in at this; Oh my Beloved, this very Call is done as really by Chriſt in his Miniſters now, tho' not ſo viſibly and immediately as I now deſcribe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed how you refuſe to hear him that <hi>ſpeaks from Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12.25.</p>
                     <p>Conſider whom the Lord calls and that is <hi>thee</hi> in particular, whoever thou art, to whom the Goſpel of Chriſt is ſent: For if you think Chriſt calls ſome only that are ſo &amp; ſo deeply humbled only to come, and not unto you in particular, you will never come in; but we have proved this, that the Lord calls all in general, and conſequently each Man particular, the Conſideration of this may bring you in; Men fear to commit Murder and Steal, &amp;c. but you fear not Unbelief; but the Apoſtle bids you <hi>fear</hi> that, <hi>for the Goſpel is preached</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto you, as well as unto theſe that fell by Unbelief,</hi> Heb. 4.1, 2. Do not ſay, he calls me indeed, but it is no more than what he doth to Reprobates; true, in the outward Call it is ſo; yet upon this Ground you may think the Lord commands not, calls not you, to ſanctify a Sabbath, or to honour God's Name, becauſe this is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Reprobates as unto you; do not ſay, I am
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:005059_0187_101696EA0DE5C8F8"/>
not able to come, and therefore I am not called; no more are you able to attend the Rules of the moral Law: Yet you look upon them as appertaining to you, and becauſe you cannot do them, you intreat the Lord to enable you, and ſo becauſe you cannot come, you ſhould look up to the Lord to draw you: And verily many Times the great Reaſon why the Lord doth not draw you, is, becauſe you do not deeply conſider that he doth really affectionately call you: Do not ſay, I am a dry Tree, the Lord cannot look upon me, whoſe Condition is worſe than ever I heard or read of; yet remember the Lord ſpeaks to ſuch, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.3, 4, 6, 7. Look not thou to thy barren and dead Heart, but <hi>give Glory unto God,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20. and receive his Grace with more Thankfulneſs than any elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none ever ſo miſerable as thy ſelf; you young Men hear this, tho' you have ſpent the Flower of your Years in Vanity, Madneſs, and filthy Luſts, yet the Lord calls you in to him: You old Men, grown gray headed in Wickedneſs, tho' it be the laſt Hour of the Day in your Life, yet behold the Lord would hire you, and calls you to come in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foreſt Wrath of a long provoked God break out upon you: You that have deſpiſed God's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, crucified the Lord Jeſus afreſh, embrued your Hands in his Blood, ſcorned and hated the Saints, and the Word of God's Grace; hear what <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſaith, Prov. 1.22, 23. <hi>Return ye Scorners:</hi> Oh conſider, thou that art ignorant of Chriſt, that never <hi>ſought</hi> after Chriſt many a Year together, that have <hi>continually provoked him to his Face,</hi> how the Lord calls you, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.1, 2, 3.

I tell you he could have gone to others that would have given his Goſpel better Welcome than it hath had from you; he could have gone to many Kings and Princes, and out of that golden Metal have made himſelf Veſſels of Honour, rather than out of ſuch baſe Mould as thou art made of; he could have honoured himſelf in thy Ruin, as in many Millions of other Men, and loſe nothing by thee neither, he could have been bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without you in the Boſom of his Father; or is it becauſe thou haſt done any Thing for him? Alas! Thou haſt not returned him thy Nut-ſhells, thou haſt not had ſo much as a Form of Religion, thou haſt done as much Miſchief to him as thou couldſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.5. Thou haſt wearied him with thine Iniquities, and made him ſerve with thy Sins, and haſt ſadded his Heart exceedingly by ſtrange Impenitency, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.24.

<pb n="190" facs="unknown:005059_0195_101696F44CF5BBD8"/>
as we are no ſooner Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and Branches of that Root by natural Generation, but we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately contract the Guilt of his Sin, and ſo original Pollution; ſo we are no ſooner made Branches of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by Vocation, and ſo united unto Chriſt by Faith, but immediately we have the Imputation of his Righteouſneſs to our Juſtification, after which we receive in order of Nature (not Time) our Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; there is no Truth more neceſſary to be known than this, it being the principal Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. The Law ſhewing how a Man may be juſt and live; but it hath not the leaſt Word how a ſinful Man may be juſt and not die, this is proper to the Revelation of the Goſpel: Let me therefore give you a Taſte of the Nature of it.</p>
                  <p>Our Juſtification is wrought by a double Act. 1. On God the Father's Part, he by a gracious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence abſolves and acquits a Sinner, and accepts of him as righteous. 2. On God the Son's Part, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the paſſing of this Sentence by his Satisfaction imputed and applied. The Father being the Perſon principally wronged, hath chief Power to forgive, yet in Juſtice he cannot acquit, nor in Truth account a Man unrighteous as righteous, unleſs the Son ſtep in and ſatisfy; <hi>for whoſe Sake he forgives;</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> So that our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is wholly out of our ſelves, and we are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive in it. Juſtification is not to make us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly juſt, as the Papiſt's Dream; but it is a Law-Term, and is oppoſed againſt <hi>Condemnation,</hi> Rom. 8.33. Now look as <hi>Condemnation</hi> is the Sentence of the Judge, condemning a Man to die for his Offences, or Sin; ſo <hi>Juſtification</hi> is the Sentence of God the Father, abſolving a Man from the Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:005059_0196_1016973C0B2437F8"/>
of Sin for the Sake of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: That you may more particularly underſtand me, take this Deſcription of it.</p>
                  <p>JUSTIFICATION is the gracious Sentence of GOD the FATHER, whereby, for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of CHRIST, apprehended by Faith, and imputed to the Faithful, he abſolves them from the Guilt and Condemnation of all Sin, and accepts them as perfectly Righteous to eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Let me open the Particulars herein briefly in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Queries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What it is in general <hi>to juſtify?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis to paſs Sentence of Abſolution; to pronounce a Sinner righteous; 'tis God's Pardon, Remiſſion of Sins; this appears from the Oppoſition mentioned it ſtands in unto Condemnation, as a Judge Pardons a Man when he ſaith he ſhall live; or as a Man manifeſtly forgives another when he gives him a Promiſe, or a Bill of Diſcharge; ſo that (note this by the Way that) our Juſtification is not God's eternal Purpoſe to forgive, but it is God's Sentence publiſhed, a Sinner is juſtified intentionally in Election, but not actually 'till this Sentence be paſt and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; the only Difficulty here is, Where this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced; for Anſwer whereof note, that there is but a double Court wherein 'tis paſſed; 1. Publickly in the Court of Heaven, or in the Court-Rolls of the Word; (for there is no other Court of Heaven where God ſpeaks, but this.) 2. Privately, in the Court of Conſcience. By the firſt we are juſtified indeed from perſonal Guilt; by the ſecond we feel our ſelves juſtified by the Removal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Guilt. The firſt is expreſly mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. The ſecond is expreſly ſet
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:005059_0197_101696F7507FCCF8"/>
down alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.4. The firſt is the Cauſe and Foundation of the ſecond; the ſecond ariſeth from the firſt: Otherwiſe, Peace of Conſcience is a meer Deluſion: The firſt is ſometimes long before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. as the Sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Word is ſometimes long before a Man feels that Sentence in his own Conſcience; the ſecond comes in a long Time after in ſome Chriſtians: The firſt is conſtant and unchangeable; the ſecond very changeable: He that hath Peace in his Conſcience to Day, may loſe it by to Morrow. So that you are not (in ſeeking the Teſtimony of our Juſtification) to look for a Sentence from Heaven immediately pronounced of God, but look for it in the Court of his Word, (the Court of Heaven) which tho' we hear not, ſometime, yet it rings and fills Heaven and Earth with the Sound of it, <hi>viz. There is no Condemnation to them that believe:</hi> For hereby the Lord mercifully provideth for the Pence of his People more abundantly. As when a poor Creditor is acquitted, or a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor pardoned, I beſeech you (ſaith he) let me have an Acquittance, a Diſcharge, a Pardon under your own Hand, and this quiets him againſt all Accuſers: So 'tis here; the Lord gives us an Acquittance in his Word, under his own Hand and Seal, and ſo gives us Peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who is it that juſtifieth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis <hi>God the Father,</hi> Rom. 8.34. <hi>Father forgive them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And hence Chriſt <hi>is an Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 John 2.2. All the three Perſons were wronged by Sin; yet the Wrong was chiefly againſt the Father, becauſe his Manner of Working appear'd chiefly in Creation, from the Righteouſneſs of which, Man fell by Sin. The Father forgives primarily by ſovereign Authority;
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:005059_0198_10169740577F4DF8"/>
the Son of Man Chriſt Jeſus forgives by immediate Diſpenſation and Commiſſion from the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.6. the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors forgive miniſterially, <hi>John</hi> 21.23. The Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives by granting Pardon, the Son by procuring, the Miniſters (where the Spirit alſo is) by publiſhing or applying Pardon: So that this is great Conſolation, that God the Father the Party chiefly incenſed, 'tis he that juſtifieth, 'tis he that paſſeth this gracious Sentence, and then who can condemn?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why doth the Father thus juſtify?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis meerly his Grace, and out of Grace. And hence I call it his <hi>gracious Sentence,</hi> Rom. 3.24. <hi>juſtified freely by his Grace.</hi> What is his <hi>Grace?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expounds it to be not our Grace, or Works of Grace, (altho' wro't by Grace) but <hi>his own Names Sake,</hi> Iſai. 43.25. In ſome Reſpect indeed it is juſt for God to forgive, <hi>viz.</hi> in Regard of Chriſt's Satisfaction, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. The Mercy Seat and the Tables of the Law in the Ark, may well ſtand together, but that Chriſt was ſent to ſatisfy Juſtice, and that thy Sins were ſatisfied for, and not anothers; thus it's wholly of Grace. If therefore you think the Lord pardons your Sins becauſe you have been leſs Sinners than others; or if you think the Lord will not pardon your Sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are greater Sinners than any elſe, you ſin exceedingly againſt the Riches of God's Grace in this Point.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What is the Mean by which the Father doth thus juſtify?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis for the Satiſfaction or by the Price of the Redemption of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and 5.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. for Mercy would, but Juſtice could not forgive, without Satisfaction for the Wrong done.
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:005059_0199_10169770B5978350"/>
Hence Chriſt ſatisfies, that Grace and Mercy might have their full Scope of forgiving. So that, neither Works before Converſion, which are but gliſtering Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. nor Works of Grace in us after Converſion, can be the Cauſes of our Juſtification: For <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was juſtified and ſanctified, yet <hi>had not whereof to boaſt,</hi> but <hi>believed in him that juſtified the Ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>We</hi> that believe <hi>have believed, that we might be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. 'tis therefore the Price of Chriſt's Redemption which doth procure our Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. But underſtand this aright, for this Price is not applied to each particular Man as the <hi>common Price,</hi> redeeming all, (for then every Believer ſhould be accounted a Saviour and Redeemer of all) but as the Price of thoſe Souls in particular, to whom it is ſpecially intended, and particularly applied. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is ſufficient to juſtify all to whom it is imputed, but it is no further imputed than to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the End of Imputation, <hi>viz.</hi> to juſtify and ſave me in particular, not to make me a Head of the Church or a common Saviour: It argues a Man weakly principled, that denies the Neceſſity of Chriſt's Satisfaction to our Juſtification, becauſe forſooth every Believer ſhould then be a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Satisfaction</hi> I underſtand, the whole Obedience of Chriſt unto the very Death, which is both active and paſſive, by which we are juſtified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. That Righteouſneſs of Chriſt (wro't in his Satisfaction) is imputed, which ſatisfies the Law and divine Juſtice, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, to 4. which is both active and paſſive: The very Reaſon why the Law requires perfect Obedience of us, which we cannot poſſibly bring before God, is, that we might ſeek for it in Chriſt, that fulfilled all Righteouſneſs: And
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:005059_0200_10169786F140CF78"/>
therefore he is called <hi>the End of the Law for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Rom. 10.3, 4. And it is ſtrange that any ſhould deny Juſtification by Chriſt's active Obedience, upon this Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that <hi>by the Works of the Law</hi> (which ſatisfy the Law) <hi>ſhall no Sinner be juſtified;</hi> and yet withal ſay, that we are juſtified by that which ſatisfies the Law.</p>
                  <p>This Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not that of the Godhead, (for then what need was there for Chriſt to do or ſuffer?) but that which was wrought in the Manhood. And hence it is finite in it ſelf, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Value in that it was the Righteouſneſs of ſuch a Perſon. This Righteouſneſs of God may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two Ways, Firſt, Abſolutely, in it ſelf, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Reſpectively, as done for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt's abſolute Righteouſneſs is not imputed to us, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is Mediator, Head of the Church, having the Spirit without Meaſure (which is next to infinite) &amp;c. for tho' theſe Things are applied for our Good, yet they are not imputed as our Righteouſneſs; and therefore the Objection vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which ſaith we cannot be juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, becauſe it is of ſuch infinite Perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reſpective or diſpenſative Righteouſneſs which ſome call <hi>juſtitia fide juſſoria,</hi> is that whereby Chriſt is juſt <hi>for us</hi> in fulfilling the Law, in bearing God's Image, we once had, and have now loſt by Sin; and thus we are truly ſaid to be as righteous as Chriſt by Imputation, becauſe he kept the Law for us: And here obſerve, that the Queſtion is not, whether all that Chriſt did and had is imputed to us as our Righteouſneſs, but whether all that he did <hi>pro <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>bis,</hi> for us, as a Surety in fulfilling the Law, be not <hi>for Subſtance,</hi> our Righteouſneſs; and therefore to think that we are not juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:005059_0201_10166680441E3300"/>
becauſe then we are juſtified by his working of Miracles, preaching of Sermons, which Women are not regularly capable of, is but to caſt Blocks before the Blind; ſo that tho' Chriſt doth not beſtow his perſonal Wiſdom and Juſtice upon another, yet what hinders, but that <hi>that</hi> which Chriſt doth by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Righteouſneſs for another, the ſame ſhould ſtand good for him for whom it is done? For thus it is in ſundry Caſes among Men; Chriſt's eſſential Righteouſneſs, infinite Wiſdom, Fulneſs of Spirit without Meaſure, &amp;c. is not imputed to us; yet theſe have conſpired together to do that for us, and ſuffer that for us, by which we come to be accounted righteous before God: He ſhall be called <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. This Righteouſneſs therefore imputed to us juſtifies us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. we are ſaid to be made <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> not the Righteouſneſs of God whereby <hi>he is juſt,</hi> but whereby <hi>we are juſt;</hi> oppoſed to the Righteouſneſs of Man which is called <hi>our own Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.3. and 1.17. Not Righteouſneſs <hi>from</hi> him (as the Papiſt's dream) but Righteouſneſs <hi>in</hi> him; nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by Chriſt only, but Righteouſneſs in Chriſt; this imputed juſtifies; as Sin imputed condemns.</p>

Now Faith above all other Graces believes the Word; and a Believer ſaith, I believe I am Righteous before God, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I feel it ſo in my ſelf, but becauſe God ſaith I am ſo in his Son, ſo that you are not juſtified before you believe; nor then only, when you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed many holy Duties, but at the firſt Inſtant of your cloſing with Chriſt, you are then to ſee it, and by Faith to admire God's rich Grace for it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What is the Extent of this Sentence?</p>

                  <p n="1">1. He abſolves them from all Guilt and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Sin, ſo that in this Senſe, <hi>he ſees no Iniquity in Jacob,</hi> Chaſtiſements they may now have after Juſtification, but no Puniſhments; Croſſes not Curſes; ſuch as deſtroy their Sins, no Puniſhments to deſtroy their Souls: Hence thoſe Phraſes in Scripture, <hi>Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sins as a Miſt, blotting them out, remembring them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o more, ſetting them out as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt:</hi> For Chriſt being made Sin for his People, and this being imputed, he <hi>aboliſhing all Sin, by one Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> Heb. 10. Hence all are forgiven; and hence it is that there can be no Suit in Law againſt a Sinner, the Law being ſatisfied, and the Sinner abſolved; nay, hence Sin is condemned, and the Sinner ſpared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. as Chriſt died for us, ſo he was acquitted for us, and we in him; we in him in Redemption,

we by him in actual Faith and Application. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Sins, paſt, preſent, and to come, are actually forgiven at the firſt Inſtant of believing, I will not, dare not determine; this is ſafe to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Sentence of Pardon of all thy Sins is at an Inſtant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. but not the Senſe nor Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Pardon: Actual Sentence of Pardon, not actual Application of Pardon, till they be actually committed, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. and 10.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. There is a Pardon of Courſe (ſome ſay) for Sins of Infirmities, I ſay there is alſo a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Courſe for Sins of Wilfulneſs, all Manner of Sins; but not Senſe of Pardon always.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He accepts and accounts us perfectly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. Faith <hi>is accounted for Righteouſneſs,</hi> not the Act of Faith; as the <hi>Arminians</hi> would, but the Object of it apprehended by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. The Lord accounts us as Righteous thro' Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as if we had kept all the Law, ſuffered all the Puniſhments for the Breach of it; <hi>Who can lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect,</hi> whom God hath <hi>juſtified?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Satan may anſwer, Yes I can, for the Law ſaith, <hi>The Soul that ſins muſt die:</hi> Chriſt anſwers, but I have died for him, and ſatisfied the utmoſt Farthing to Juſtice in that Point: True, my Satan ſay, here is Satisfaction for the Offence, but the Law muſt be kept alſo; the Lord Chriſt anſwers, I am the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs, I am perfectly holy and righteous, not for my ſelf, (for I am a common Perſon) but for this poor Sinner who in himſelf is exceedingly and wholly polluted; and hence the Lord covers Sins, as well as pardons Sins; <hi>cloaths</hi> us with Chriſt, as well as remits Sin for Chriſt's Sake; and as we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinners by Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s legal Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:005059_0204_1016978B25BDC228"/>
ſo are we accounted Righteous by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>'s legal Righteouſneſs, and that unto eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18. Thus you ſee <hi>the Nature,</hi> now the Lord opens your Eyes to ſee <hi>the Glory</hi> of this Privilege; you that never felt the heavy Load of Sin, the Terrors of a diſtreſſed Conſcience ariſing from the Senſe of an angry God, cannot prize this Privilege; but if you have, you cannot but ſay as he did, <hi>O bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe Sin is covered;</hi> and again, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man to whom the Lord imputes no Sin,</hi> Pſal. 32.12. The Lord pity us; how many be there in theſe Times, that know there is no Juſtification but by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and yet eſteem it not? Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give you one Glimpſe of the Glory of it in theſe Particulars,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is the Righteouſneſs by which <hi>a Sinner</hi> is Righteous: The Law ſhews you how a Man may be Righteous, but there is not the leaſt Tittle of the Law, which ſhews you how <hi>a Sinner</hi> may become Righteous, this never could have entred into the Thoughts of Angels how this could be; it is croſs to Senſe and Reaſon, for a Man accurſed and ſinful in himſelf, to be at that very Time bleſſed and righteous in another; to ſay, <hi>Lord, Depart from me, for I am a ſinful Man,</hi> Luke 5.8. is the Voice of natural Conſcience awakened, not only concerning God out of Chriſt, but even when God appears in Chriſt as he did then to <hi>Peter;</hi> but that the Lord ſhould become our Righteouſneſs, when we think no Sinners like our ſelves, no Caſes, no Afflictions, no Deſertions like ours; who can believe this? Yet thus it is; the very Scope of the fourth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 4.5. is not to ſhew how a juſt Man may be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but how <hi>a Sinner</hi> may; our own Duties, Works,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:005059_0205_10169745DF729920"/>
and Reformation, may make us at the beſt but leſs ſinful, but this Righteouſneſs makes a Sinner ſinleſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this a Sinner is Righteous before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of God: What Man that hath Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Conſcience, but trembles exceedingly when he conſiders the Judgment Seat of God, and of his ſtrict Account there? But by this we can look upon the Face of the Judge himſelf with Boldneſs. <hi>It is God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemn?</hi> Rom. 8.32. Can Chriſt condemn? He is our Advocate. Can Sin condemn? Why did Chriſt die and was made Sin then? Can Satan condemn, if God himſelf juſtify us? If the Judge acquits us, what can the Jaylor do? Can the Law condemn? No, the Lord Chriſt hath fulfilled it for us, to the utmoſt: Oh the Stings that many have, ſaying, What ſhall I do when I die and go down to the Duſt? May not the Lord have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt me at the Day of Reckoning that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, nor got cancelled? O poor Creatures! Is Chriſt now before God without Spot? Hath he cleared all Reckonings? Verily as he is before him, ſo are you; thro' that Righteouſneſs which is in him for you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this you have perfect Righteouſneſs, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Righteous, as Chriſt <hi>the Righteous,</hi> 1 John 2.1, 2, and 3.7. All yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

What ſincere Soul but eſteems of perfect Holineſs more than of Heaven it ſelf? Oh conſider thou haſt it (in this Senſe I now ſpeak of) in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this you have continual Righteouſneſs. What doſt thou complain of daily? Is it not becauſe thou

                  <p n="5">5. By this you have eternal Righteouſneſs, that never can be loſt: If the Lord ſhould make thee as perfectly Righteous as once <hi>Adam</hi> was, or Angels in Heaven are, and put on thy royal Apparel again, thou waſt in danger of loſing this, and of being ſtript naked again; but now the Lord hath put your Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into a ſafer Hand which never ſhall be loſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By this you pleaſe God, and are more amiable before him, than if you had it in your ſelf; Do not ſay this is a poor Righteouſneſs, which is thus out of thy ſelf in another; why do you think Righteouſneſs in your ſelf would be beſt? Is it not becauſe hereby you think you ſhall pleaſe God? Suppoſe thou hadſt it, yet thy Righteouſneſs ſhould be at the beſt but Man's Righteouſneſs, but this is called <hi>the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> which cannot but be more pleaſing to him, than that in thy ſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.

I tell you when you bring this Offering of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, the Lord had rather have that, than all you can do, you bring that which pleaſeth him more, than if you bro't your own. For aſk thy own Conſcience, if it be poſſible for the Righteouſneſs that is done by thy ſelf to be more pleaſing to God, than the Righteouſneſs of the Son of God, the Lord of Glory himſelf, done and perfected for thee.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. By this you glorify him perfectly in an Inſtant, for you continue to do all that the Law requires that Inſtant you believe.

truly the Works of the Law, as our Obedience in Way of Doing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this you glorify God's Juſtice; whatever Juſtice requires to be done or ſuffered, you give it unto God by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this you glorify Grace and Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. for by this Means Mercy may over-bound toward you, and you may triumph in it as ſure and certain to you. What a bleſſed Miſtery is this! Doth it not grieve you that you cannot glorify God in your Times and Places? Behold the Way, if thou canſt not do it by Obedience, thou mayſt by Faith: And thereby make Reſtitution of all God's Glory loſt and ſtolen from him by thy Diſobedience to him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By this you have Peace in your Conſciences; by this, Chriſt's Blood is ſprinkled upon them, and that cools the burning Torments of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. The Commers unto the levitical Sacrifices and Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, (Types of this Offering of Chriſt) could not thereby be perfected and be without the guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Sin: None of your Duties can pacify Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but as they carry you hither to this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: but the Commers to this have no more Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conſcience for Sin, I mean they have no juſt Cauſe to have any; this <hi>Rain-bow</hi> appearing over your Heads, is a certain Sign of fair Weather, and that there ſhall be no more <hi>Deluge</hi> of Wrath to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm thee.</p>

If the Wicked that apply this Righteouſneſs preſumptuouſly ſay, Let us Sin that Grace may abound, and make no other uſe of Forgiveneſs, but to run in Debt, and ſin with a Licenſe?

For is not Sin the Cauſe of God's Anger? Muſt not Sin therefore be firſt removed in our Juſtification, before we can have God's Anger allayed in our Reconciliation? So that as in our Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification the Lord accounts us juſt, ſo in our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation (himſelf being at Peace with us) he accounts us Friends; indeed our meritorious Reconciliation is by Chriſt's Death; as the King's Son who procures his Father's Favour toward a Malefactor, who yet lies in cold Irons and knows it not; and this is before our Juſtification or Being, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. but actual and efficacious Reconciliation, whereby we come to the Fruition and Poſſeſſion of it, is after our Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. Chriſt is a Propitiation by Faith, and here the Malefactor hath Tidings of Favour, if he will accept of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15, 17. and of this I now ſpeak: God and Man were once Friends, but by Sin a great Breach is made, the Lord only bearing the Wrongs is juſtly provoked, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.2, 3. Man that only doth the Wrong is notwithſtanding at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:005059_0211_1016974E668E29B8"/>
with him, and will not be intreated to accept of Favour, much leſs to repent of this Wrong, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. the Lord Jeſus therefore heals this Breach, by being Mediator between both; he takes up the Quarrel, and firſt reconciles God to Man, and Man to God, <hi>in himſelf,</hi> in Redemption, and after this reconciles God and Man <hi>by himſelf</hi> in (or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon) our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>This Reconciliation conſiſts in two Things chiefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In our Peace with God, whereby the Lord lays by all Acts of Hoſtility againſt us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Love and Favour of God. I do not mean God's Love of <hi>Good-will,</hi> for this is in Election, but his Love of <hi>Complaiſency</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> for 'till we are juſtified, the Lord behaves himſelf as an Enemy and Stranger to us who are polluted before him, but then he begins thus to love us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22. A Gardiner may intend to turn a Crab-tree Stock into an Apple-tree, his Intention doth not alter the Nature of it until it be actually ingraffed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So we are <hi>by Nature the Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 1.3. The Intention of God the Father, or his Love of Good-will, doth not make us Children of Favour and Sons of Peace, until the Lord actually call us to and ingrafft us into Chriſt, and then as Chriſt is <hi>the Delight of God,</hi> ſo we in him are loved with the ſame Love of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.1, 2. Peace with God, and Love of God, are different Degrees of our Reconciliation: A Prince is at Peace, or ceaſeth War, againſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, yet he may not bring the Rebel before him, into his Boſom of ſpecial Favour, Delight, and Love; but the Lord doth both, towards us Enemies, Strangers, Rebels, Devils, in our Reconciliation with him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Oh conſider what a bleſſed Eſtate this is to be at Peace with God: It was the Title of Honour the
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:005059_0212_101697953512DA60"/>
Lord put upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be <hi>the Friend of God,</hi> Iſa. 41.8. I am not able to expreſs what a Priviledge this is, 'tis better felt than ſpoken of; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, Pſal. 90. <hi>Who knows the Greatneſs of his Wrath;</hi> ſo I may ſay, Who knows the Greatneſs of this Favour and Love?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God ſhould be pacified with thee after An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, this is exceeding glorious, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 12.1, 2. What is Man that the Lord ſhould viſit him, or look upon him, tho' he never had ſinned? But to look upon thee, nay to love thee, after Provocation by Sin, after ſuch Wrath, which like Fire hath conſumed Thouſand Thouſands, and burnt down to the Bottom of Hell, and is now and ever ſhall be burning upon them; Oh bleſſed are they that find this Favour!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Lord ſhould be pacified wholly and thoro'ly, that there ſhould be no Anger left for you to feel. The poor afflicted Church might object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe ſweet Promiſes made here, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. that ſhe left no Love: You are miſtaken, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> ver. 4.

into, this is wonderful: Thoſe whom Men love they forſake, if their Love be abuſed; or if their Friends be in Affliction, they then bid them good Night; but the Lord's Love and Favour is everlaſting, Iſai. 9.7. <hi>The Mountains may depart out of their Places, and the Hills caſt down to Valleys, but the Lord's Kindneſs never ſhall, never can; he hath hid his Face a little Moment,</hi> Iſai. 45.10. whiles thou didſt live in thy Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, but now, <hi>with everlaſting Mercy will he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee;</hi> nay, which is more, <hi>the abounding of thy Sin</hi> is now the Occaſion <hi>of the abounding of his Grace,</hi> Rom. 5.20. thy very Wants and Miſeries are the very Cauſes of his Bowels and tender Mercies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16. Oh what a Priviledge is this? Did the Lord ever ſhew Mercy and Favour to the Angels that ſinned? Did not one Sin caſt them out of Favour ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly? Oh infinite Grace, that ſo many Thouſand Thouſands every Day guſhing out of thy Heart againſt Kindneſs and Love, nay the greateſt deareſt Love of God, ſhould not incenſe his ſoreſt Diſpleaſure againſt thee! The Lord that poured out all his Anger upon his own Son for thee, and for all thy Sins, cannot now pour out, nay he hath not one Drop left, (though he would) to pour out upon thee for any one Sin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Lord ſhould be thus pacified with Enemies; a Man may be eaſily pacified with one that offends him a little, but with an Enemy that ſtrikes at his Life, (as by every Sin you do) this is wonderful, yet this is the Caſe here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Lord ſhall be pacified, even with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, by ſuch a wonderful Way as the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7, 8. this is ſuch Love, as one would think the infinite Wiſdom of a bleſſed God could have deviſed no greater; by this (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) he <hi>commended</hi> and ſet out <hi>his Love,</hi> which tho' now it

                  <p n="6">6. That being thus pacified, you may come into God's Preſence with Boldneſs at any Time, and aſk what you will: I wonder what he can deny you if he loves you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. and which is yet more, that now all Creatures are <hi>at Peace with you,</hi> Job. 5.23. is when the Captain of the Army is pacified, none of his Soldiers muſt hurt or ſtrike that Man; nay, that hereby all your Enemies ſhould be forced to do Good to you; <hi>Oh Death where is now thy Sting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have oft wondered, If Chriſt hath born all our Miſeries and ſuffered Death for us, why then ſhould we feel any Miſeries or ſee Death any more? And I could never ſatisfy my own Heart by any Anſwers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, better than by this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Lord ſhould aboliſh the very being of our Miſeries, they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed then do us no hurt; but neither could they then do us any good; for if they were not at all, how could they do us any good? Now the Lord Jeſus hath made ſuch a Peace for us, as that our Enemies ſhall not only not hurt us, but they ſhall be forced (himſelf ordering of them) to do much good unto us; all your Wants ſhall but make you Pray the more, all your Sorrows ſhall but Humble you the more, all your Temptations ſhall but Exerciſe your Graces the more; all your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Deſertions ſhall but make you long for Heaven, and to be with Chriſt the more: It is now part of your Portion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Lord of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to account us <hi>juſt</hi> in our Juſtification is much; but for the Lord to account us hereby as <hi>Friends,</hi> this is more: But to account us <hi>Sons</hi> alſo, this is a higher Degree and a farther Privilege; and hence our Adoption follows our Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:005059_0216_1016979E3A62BF30"/>
And if Adoption, then the Spirit of Adoption much leſs doth not precede Faith. By Chriſt's active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (our Divines ſay) we have right unto Life; by Adoption we have a farther right; the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys not the other; for a Man may have right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Thing upon ſundry Grounds: We know there are two Sorts of Sons: 1. Some by Nature, born of our own Bodies, and thus we are not Sons of God, but Children of Wrath. 2. Some by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are taken out of another Family, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted freely of us as our Sons; and thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was for a Time the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter. And of this Son-ſhip by Adoption I now ſpeak, the Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us out of the Family of Hell to be his adopted Sons. Chriſt is God's Son by eternal Generation, <hi>Adam</hi> by Creation; all Believers are Sons by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now Adoption is two-fold,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. External, whereby the Lord takes a People by outward Covenant and Diſpenſation to be his Sons, and thus all the Jews were God's <hi>firſt-born,</hi> Exod. 4.22. and unto him did <hi>belong the Adoption,</hi> Rom. 9.4, 5. And hence their Children were accounted <hi>Sons,</hi> as well as Saints, and <hi>holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. but many fall from this Adoption, as the Jews did.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Internal, whereby the Lord out of everlaſting Love to particular Perſons in ſpecial, he takes them out of the Family of Satan, and by internal Love and ſpecial Account reckons them in the Number of Sons; makes them indeed <hi>Sons,</hi> as well as calls them ſo, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.5. <hi>Iſaac</hi> by ſpecial Promiſe was <hi>accounted for the Seed,</hi> Rom. 9.8. and of this we now ſpeak. Now this is double,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Adoption begun, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1, 2. now we are the Sons of God. To ſome of which, (tho' Sons indeed) yet the Lord behaves himſelf toward them for ſome Time, and for ſpecial Reaſons, as unto <hi>Servants,</hi>
                     <pb n="212" facs="unknown:005059_0217_10169758A5444498"/>
exerciſing them with many Fears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2. Some Spirits will not be the better for the Love of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but worſe; and therefore the Lord keeps a hard Hand over them: to others, the Lord behaves himſelf with more ſpecial Reſpect, in making them cry with more Boldneſs, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15, 16. who will be more eaſily overcome, and bent to his Will, by Love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Adoption perfected, when we ſhall receive all the Privileges of Sons, not one excepted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. where we are ſaid <hi>to wait for our Adoption, the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Bodies;</hi> by the firſt we are Sons, but not ſeen nor known ſuch, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1, 2. By the ſecond, we ſhall be known before all the World to be ſuch: We now ſpeak principally of Adoption begun, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are Sons in God's Account, and by real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Spirit of Sons: The Manner of this Adoption is thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God loves Jeſus Chriſt with an unſpeakable Love, as his only Son, and as our elder Brother.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence when we are in Chriſt his Son, he loves us with the ſame Love, as he doth his own Son.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence the Lord accounts us Sons, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6. God's Love is not now toward us as to <hi>Adam</hi> his Son by Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately diffuſed upon us; but in loving his own Son immediately, hence he loves us, and hence adopts us, and accounts us Children.</p>
                  <p>Oh that the Lord would open our Eyes to ſee this Privilege; <hi>Behold it,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 3.1. Stand amazed at it, that Children of Wrath ſhould become the Sons of the moſt high God; for a Beggar on the Dunghil, a Vagabond, Runnagate from God, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, a Stranger to God, whom the Lord hath no Cauſe to think on, to be made a Son of God almighty.</p>
                  <p>If Sons, then the Lord doth prize and eſteem you as Sons: If a Man hath twenty Sons, he eſteems the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:005059_0218_1016979FC85675E0"/>
pooreſt, leaſt, ſick Child he hath, more than all his Goods and Servants, unleſs he be an unnatural Father; I tell you that the leaſt of you, the pooreſt and moſt feeble Believer, is accounted of God, and more eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than all his Houſhold-ſtuff; than Heaven, Earth, and all the Glory in it, and all the Kings and great Men in the World, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.4, 5, 6. not becauſe thou haſt done any Thing worthy of this, but only becauſe he accounts thee freely as his Son.</p>
                  <p>If Sons, then the Lord ſurely will take Care for you as for Sons; a godly Father hath a double Care of his Children. Firſt, of their Temporal, Secondly, and chiefly of their eternal Eſtate: We are ready to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Times of Want, what we ſhall eat, drink, how we ſhall live; Oh conſider, art thou a Son of God, and will not he that <hi>feeds the Ravens, and cloaths the Lillies,</hi> Mat. 6.31, 32. provide for thee? Yes verily, he will take Care for thy temporal Good. It is true, you may be bro't into outward Straits, Wants, Miſeries, yet then the Lord is thereby plotting for thy eternal Good, for hence come all God's Corrections, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8. the Lord took all they had from them by their Enemies in War, and carried them away Captive into a ſtrange Land, yet <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.5. this was for their Good; we think the Lord many Times takes no Care for us, and ſo make him of a worſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the ſavage Beaſts, or bloody Men toward their young, but this is certain, he never denies any Thing to us in outward Things, but it is to further our eternal Bliſs with him, to do us Good in our latter End: What ſay godly Parents? It is no Matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of my Children, when I am dead, if the Lord will but give them himſelf to be their Portion; if at laſt they may ſee the Lord in Glory: Do not wonder then if the Lord keeps you ſhort ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="unknown:005059_0219_1016975A2E0EB5E0"/>If Sons, then he loves you as Sons, as a Father doth his Sons; you think the Lord loves you not, becauſe you do not alway feel his Love, nor know his Love; is thy Son not thy Child, becauſe while it is young, it knows not the Father that begat it, or becauſe thou art ſometime departed from it, and haſt it not alway in thine own Arms? <hi>Iſrael ſaith, My God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me and forgotten me,</hi> Iſai. 49.14. and yet no Mother tenders her Child, as the Lord did them; you think becauſe you have ſo many Sins &amp; Afflictions one upon another, that the Lord loves you not: Judge righteouſly, hath thy Child no Father becauſe it is ſick long together, and therefore kept under a ſpare Diet? No, he knows our Mould, and that we are but Duſt, and freely chuſes us to be his Sons, and hence loves notwithſtanding all our Sins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32, 33. If he ſees <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning his Stubbornneſs, as well as his Sickneſs and Weakneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. doth not the Lord profeſs, <hi>Is he not my only Son?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If <hi>Sons,</hi> then we are <hi>Heirs and Co-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Sons by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not always Heirs, but all Sons by Adoption are: We are Heirs with Chriſt, the Lord Chriſt as our elder Brother managing all our Eſtate for us, becauſe unable to do it our ſelves: We are <hi>Heirs,</hi> 1. <hi>Of the Kingdom of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4, 5.2. Heirs of all this viſible <hi>World,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22. not that we have the whole World in our own Hand (it would be too cumberſome to us to manage) but the Lord gives us the Rent of it, the Bleſſing and Good of it, tho' it be poſſeſſed by others. 3. We are Heirs of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 11.9. &amp; 6.17. whereby <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf comes to be our Inheritance and Portion for ever; and look as Chriſt was in the World and Heir of all, tho' trod under Foot by all, ſo are we; what can we deſire more?</p>

                     <pb n="215" facs="unknown:005059_0220_101697A2CDBB2300"/>5. If Sons, then we have, and ſhall ever have the Spirit of Sons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. And what are we the better for this Spirit? Truly hereby, Firſt, we cry unto him, we are enabled to pray, who could not pray before, becauſe Guilt ſtopt our Mouths. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and this Spirit witneſſeth that we are the Sons of this Father: It is not ſaid that it witneſſeth <hi>to</hi> our Spirits, but it witneſſeth <hi>with</hi> our Spirits, i. e. our renewed Conſcience, thus; all Believers called and juſtified of God are Sons, but I am ſuch a Believer, therefore I am a Son, now the Spirit bears witneſs with us in every Part, both Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Concluſion, only it being the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt Witneſs, it teſtifies the ſame Thing our Conſciences do, but yet more clearly, more certainly, more comfortably &amp; ſweetly, raviſhing the Soul with moſt unſpeakable Peace and Joy, eſpecially in the Concluſion. I know there is a <hi>Noetick</hi> Teſtimony, but it is laſtly reſolved into this; I'll not now diſpute it, only this is certain; that this Teſtimony all the Sons of God have by Means of their Adoption. They may not indeed ſometime hear it; if they do they may object againſt it thro' the Unbelief in Part remaining in them; or if it be ſometimes ſuſpended, what you want in the Witneſs and Comfort of it, you have it in the Holineſs of it; and therefore the Spirit ſealing is called <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4.30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8. and is not this a great Privilege? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14, Thirdly, Hereby you are led and guided, and that continually toward your laſt End. For as if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, he ſhould have had the Spirit of God, this very Spirit to have kept him and all his Poſterity from falling at any Time from God, ſo Chriſt having ſtood for us, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us before God, ſends the immutable conſtant Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit in Adoption, which tho' it doth

                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>renewing of the whole Man,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. For as every Part and Faculty of Man is corrupt by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo they are renewed by the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> not that we are perfectly renewed in this Life

by Chriſt, as we are corrupt by <hi>Adam,</hi> but in Part in every Faculty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. and from hence ariſeth our ſpiritual Combat and Warfare with Sin, yea with all Sin; it is not becauſe of our Sanctification ſimply (for if it were perfect, we ſhould War and Wreſtle no more;) but from the Imperfection of it. And this renewal in Part, is in every Part, even in the whole Man: And as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> propagates Sin chiefly and radically in the Soul, eſpecially into the Heart of Man; and from thence it diffuſeth it ſelf like Leaven into the whole Lump of our Lives, ſo the Lord Jeſus chiefly communicates this Renewal into our Hearts, and thence it ſweetens our Lives; and hence it is called <hi>the inner Man,</hi> Rom. 7.22. Eph. 3.16. You ſee a little Holineſs in a Chriſtian; I tell you, if he be of the right Make, there is a Kind of infinite endleſs Holineſs within him from whence it ſprings, as there is a Kind of infinite endleſs Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ekneſs in a wicked Man, from whence his Sin ſpring: If a Man be outwardly holy, but not within, he is not ſanctified, no more than the painted Sepulchres of the proud Phariſees; if any Man ſay his Heart is good, tho' he makes no Shew in his Life, he ſpeaks not the Truth, if the Apoſtle may be believed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. for Sanctification is the Renewal of the whole Man, within and without; it is not for a Man to have his Teeth white, his Tongue tipt, and his Nails pared; no, no, the Lord makes all new where he comes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a Renewal unto the Image of God, or of God in Chriſt; an unſanctified Man may be after a Sort renewed in the whole Man, his outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation may be fair, his Mind may be <hi>enlightned,</hi> his Heart may <hi>taſte of the heavenly Gift,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5. he may have <hi>a Form of Godlineſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. he may have ſtrong Reſolutions within him unto Godlineſs,

And hence with the five fooliſh Virgins, may be received into the Fellowſhip of the Wiſe, and not diſcerned of them neither, till the Gate is ſhut; but they are never renewed in their whole Man <hi>after the Image of God,</hi> i. e. they do not know Things, and judge of them as God doth, they do not Love and Will Holineſs and the Means thereto, as God doth; they hate not Sin, as God doth; they do not delight in the whole Law of God, it is not writ in their Hearts, and hence they love it not as God doth: And this is the Cut of the Thread between a ſanctified and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Spirit; by Sanctification a Man is renewed unto God's Image, once loſt, but here again reſtored, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 24. <hi>John</hi> 1.16. we receive from Chriſt Grace for Grace, as the Seal on the Wax hath Tittle for Tittle, to that in the Seal it ſelf, we are changed into the ſame Image of Chriſt by beholding him in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, by Faith, 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>I delight in the Law of my God in my inward Man,</hi> Rom. 7.23. And hence a Chriſtian by the Life of Sanctification, lives like unto God; at leaſt hath a holy Diſpoſition and Inclination (the Habits of Holineſs) ſo to do, Gal. 2.19. <hi>I live unto God, he calleth us from Darkneſs into his marvellous Light, that we might ſhew forth his Vertues;</hi> and that this is true Sanctification, may thus appear; becauſe our Sanctification is oppoſed to our original Corruption, as our Juſtification to our original and contracted Guilt of Sin: Now as original Corruption is the defacing of God's Image by contrary Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sinfulneſs, ſo our Sanctification can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Removal of this Pollution, by the contrary Habits and Diſpoſitions to be like unto God again: Our Sanctification is to be holy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16. our Holineſs hath no other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Pattern but God's Holineſs, ſo that our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:005059_0225_1016976043186F48"/>
is not the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in Chriſt, for that is the Matter of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and therefore Sanctification muſt be that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs which is derived unto us from Chriſt, whereby we are made like unto him; and thus Chriſt is made <hi>Sanctification unto us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. There ſhould be no Difference between Chriſt our Righteouſneſs and Sanctification, if that Holineſs which is in Chriſt ſhould be <hi>both</hi> unto us. Hence alſo Sanctification is not the immediate Operation of the Spirit upon us, without created Habits of Grace abiding in us, as the Spirit that came upon <hi>Balaam,</hi> and mightily affected him for a Time, but left him as deſtitute of any Grace or Change of his Nature as the Aſs he rode on; no, no, it renews you unto the Image of God himſelf, if you be truly ſanctified. And therefore let all theſe Dreams of the <hi>Familiſts</hi> (denying all inherent Graces, but only thoſe which are in Chriſt, to be in the Saints) let them vaniſh and periſh from under the Sun, and the good Lord reduce all ſuch who in Simplicity are miſled from this bleſſed Truth of God. I will not now enter into the Depth concerning the Means of our Sanctification in Mortification by Chriſt's Death and Vivication by the Reſurrection of Chriſt: This may ſuffice for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Nature of it.</p>
                  <p>Only ſee and for ever prize this Privilege, all you bleſſed Souls, whom the Lord hath juſtified; thou haſt many ſad Complaints, what is it to me, if I be juſtified in Chriſt, and be ſaved at laſt by Chriſt, and my Heart remain all this while unholy &amp; unſubdued unto the Will of Chriſt; that he ſhould comfort me, and my holy Heart be alway grieving of him; what tho' the Lord ſave me from Miſery, but ſaves me not from my Sin; Oh conſider this Benefit. It is true, thou findeſt a woful, ſinful Nature within thee, croſs

Oh be thankful that the Lord hath not left thee wholly corrupt but hath begun to glorify himſelf in thee, and to bleſs thee in turning thee from thine Iniquities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this thou haſt a moſt ſweet and comfortable evidence of thy Juſtification and Favour with God; he that denies this, muſt (whatever Diſtinctions he hath) aboliſh many Places of Scripture, eſpecially the Epiſtles of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who had to do with ſome Spirits, that pretended Faith and Union to Chriſt, and Communion with him, and ſo long as it was thus, this was Evidence ſufficient to them of their juſtified Eſtates.

What a Vanity is this to ſay, that this is running upon a Covenant of Works? Is not Sanctification <hi>the writing of the Law in our Hearts,</hi> a ſpecial Benefit of the Covenant of Grace, as well as Juſtification? <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 12. and can the evidencing then of one Benefit of ſuch a Covenant by another, be a running upon the Covenant of Works? Is it a Truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> That he that is juſtified is alſo ſanctified, and he that is ſanctified is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſtified?

Tell me how will you know that you are juſtified?

Can the Spirit make the one clear to you and not the other?

And I do believe the Lord deprives many of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Saints from the Comfort of this Evidence; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they look only to this, and not unto Chriſt and their Juſtification by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. or elſe becauſe there is ſome ſecret Luſt or Guile of Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.1, 2. which the Lord by ſore and long Shakings about their Call and Sanctification, would firſt winnow out, or becauſe there is a perverſe Frowardneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby becauſe they feel not that Meaſure of Sanctification which they would, do therefore vilify, and ſo come to deny what indeed they have; becauſe they <hi>feel a Law of Sin in their Members, leading them away Captive;</hi> will not, with <hi>Paul,</hi> take Notice of the Law of their Minds, whereby that <hi>inner Man delights in the Law of God,</hi> and mourns bitterly <hi>under the Body of Death,</hi> by which they might ſee with <hi>Paul,</hi> that there is <hi>no Condemnation</hi> to ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. To conclude, whatever is the Cauſe of this Crookedneſs of Judgment, I do believe that the general Cauſe is, want of Attendance and ſtanding unto the Judgment of the Scriptures in this Controverſy: For if this was ſtood unto, Men would not produce their own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>viz.</hi> that they could never find any Evidence from Sanctification, but they have met with it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way, by the immediate Witneſs of the Spirit only; nor would Men cry it down, becauſe Grace being mixt with ſo much Corruption, it can hardly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and ſo will be alway left in doubts, and that

the Heart is deceitful, and many that have evidenced their Eſtates hereby, have been deceived: I confeſs thus the Popiſh Doctors argue againſt Aſſurance of Faith from the Scriptures without ſpecial and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revelation; but what is all this to the Purpoſe if the Scripture make it an Evidence? Away then with thy corrupt Experience, ſhall this be judge, or the Scriptures rather?

we have thus drawn near, and opened all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Moans before God, we have many Doubts, <hi>viz.</hi> Will the Lord hear ſuch a Sinner, and ſuch weak, and imperfect and ſinful Prayers? And therefore he alſo affirms, that we have <hi>Confidence</hi> and Aſſurance of being heard; but all this is <hi>by Faith in him:</hi> For look as Chriſt hath purchaſed all Bleſſings for us by his Death, and hence makes his Interceſſion for thoſe Things daily according to our Need: So we are much more to reſt upon, and make that Satisfaction, the Ground of our Interceſſion; becauſe Chriſt's Blood purchaſed this, therefore, O Lord grant this.</p>

Reaſon, becauſe he is a Prophet. A Servant comes in his Maſter's Name to aſk ſomething of another, when he comes, as from his Command; ſo alſo for his Maſter's Uſe: So when we pray for Chriſt's Sake, <hi>i. e.</hi> for his Ends, not our own; theſe ever prevail, Jam. 4.3. <hi>You aſk, and have not becauſe you aſk amiſs, to ſpend it on your Luſts, John</hi> 12.27, 28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18. this is to <hi>aſk in Truth,</hi> to act for a ſpiritual End; to make it our utmoſt End, ariſeth from a ſpecial, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, ſupernatural Preſence of the Spirit of Life: and conſequently a Spirit of Prayer which is ever heard. And hence you ſhall obſerve the leaſt Groan for Chriſt's Ends is ever heard; becauſe it is the Groaning of the Spirit, becauſe it is an Act of ſpiritual Life, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of which conſiſts in this, that it is <hi>for God,</hi> Gal. 2.19. the Lord cannot deny what we pray for for Chriſt's Ends, becauſe then he ſhould cruſh Chriſt's Glory: And therefore let a Chriſtian obſerve, when he would have any Thing of God that concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not to be ſolicitous ſo much for the Thing, as to gain Favour and Neerneſs to God, and a Heart ſubject unto God in a humble Contentedneſs, to be denied as well as to be heard, and he ſhall undoubtedly find the Thing it ſelf; a Luſt is properly ſuch a deſire (tho' for lawful Things) wherein a Man muſt have the Thing becauſe it pleaſeth him, as when <hi>Rachel</hi> aſked for <hi>Children;</hi> ſhe muſt have them, elſe ſhe muſt needs <hi>die: Give us Water that we may drink</hi> was their brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Cry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.1, 2. not that we may live to him that gives it: Holy Prayers or Deſires (oppoſed unto Luſts) are ſuch Deſires of the Soul, left with God, with Submiſſion to his Will, as may beſt pleaſe him; Now the Lord will hear the Deſires indeed of all that fear him, but not fulfil their Luſts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three are the eſſential Properties of ſuch

Prayer as is heard, or if you will, of that which is properly or ſpiritually Prayer: Fervency and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c. are excellent Ingredients; but yet the Lord may hear Prayer without them: It is true, the Lord may ſometimes not h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Oh therefore ſee and be perſwaded of this your Priviledge, that God will now hear every Prayer; many make a Queſtion, How may we know when the Lord grants out any Bleſſing as an Anſwer to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Many things are ſaid to this purpoſe; but the Simplicity and Plainneſs of the Anſwer lies in this, <hi>viz.</hi> If it be a Prayer, God hears it; if it be put up in Chriſt's Name, it is then a Prayer: And that you may believe this, and glory in this, conſider theſe Reaſons only, to confirm this truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Promiſe of Chriſt as in this place, <hi>John</hi> 14.13, 14. which was a Promiſe in ſpecial to to be accompliſhed when he came to his Kingdom; and therefore, tho' it is true, God's Grace is free, and

therefore you think the Lord may as well refuſe to hear you, as hear; yet conſider that by his Promiſe, he hath bound himſelf to hear.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe all Prayers put up in Chriſt's Name, Chriſt <hi>makes Interceſſion</hi> that they may be heard; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25 He hath laid down his Blood, that all our Prayers might be heard, (as we have proved) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, hence ariſeth the infinite efficacy of Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is built upon that which is Infinitely and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally worthy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe all Prayers of the Faithful ariſe from <hi>the Spirit</hi> of Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. becauſe as that which is for the Fleſh, is of the Fleſh; ſo that which is for the Spirit or for the ſake of Chriſt; for Spiritual ends, is ever of the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 7.18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe of the Glory of Chriſt, that the Father may be glorified in the Son: Cannot Chriſt be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unleſs he hears all Prayers? Yes he could, but yet his Will is to reveal his Glory by this means; ſo that tho' thou and thy Prayers be vile, and therefore deſerveſt no Acceptance, nor Anſwer, yet remember that his Glory is dear; it is the glory of Kings to hear ſome Requeſts and Petitions, but they cannot hear nor anſwer all; it is the glory of Chriſt to hear all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is able, without the leaſt diſhonour to himſelf thus to do.</p>
                  <p>Oh be perſwaded of this, how ſhould your Joy then, be full, how ſhould you then delight to be oft with him, how would you then encourage all to come unto him, how would you then be conſtrained to do any thing for him, who is ready to do all for you? but Oh Woe unto our Unbelief, for that which (the Apoſtle

'Tis true indeed, Obedience to the Law is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us now as it was of <hi>Adam;</hi> it was required of him as a Condition antecedent to Life, but of thoſe that be in Chriſt it is required only as a Duty conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to Life, or as a Rule of Life, that ſeeing he hath purchaſed our Lives in Redemption, and actually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us Life in Vocation and Sanctification, we ſhould now live unto him, in all thankful and fruitful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience according to his Will revealed in the moral Law.

We are not united to Chriſt our Life by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as <hi>Adam</hi> was to God by it, but by Faith: And therefore as all Action (in living Things) comes from Union, ſo all our Acts of Obedience are to come from Faith, from the Spirit on Chriſt's Part, and from Faith on our Part, which make our Union: <hi>Noah</hi> built by Faith, <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God by Faith, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and his Soldiers fought by Faith, <hi>Abraham</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, dwelt in his Tents, lived and died by Faith; they acted according to the Rule, but all by the Power of Faith. It is a weak Reaſoning, to imagine a Man is not bound to pay his Debts becauſe he is to go unto another for the Money: Obedience is our Debt we owe to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. tho' we are to go to Chriſt poor, and weak, and feeble, to enable us to pay: 'Tis true, Chriſt hath kept the Law for us, and are we therefore free from it as our Rule; No verily, Chriſt kept the Law for Satiſfaction to Juſtice, and ſo we are not bound to keep the Law; he kept the Law alſo for Imitation, to give us a Copy and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all Holineſs and glorifying God in our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and thus Chriſt's Obedience is ſo far from exempting us from the Law, as that it engageth us the more, having both Rule and Example before us, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him ought to walk as he walked,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15, 16.

It is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſome, that in the Preface to the moral Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1, 2. the Lord reveals himſelf to be <hi>the Lord their God which brought them out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> the very Scope of which Words, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to a reverend receiving and keeping that good Law: This Law all Nations are bound to obſerve, becauſe he is <hi>Jehovah the Lord;</hi> but to be <hi>thy God</hi> in ſpecial Covenant, and <hi>that redeemed thee from Egypt,</hi> and from that which was tipified by it, this belongs to none but unto them eſpecially, that are already the People of God; and therefore of all other People in the World, they are bound to receive it as their Rule: for Obedience doth not make us God's People, or God our God; But he is firſt our God, (which is only by the Covenant of Grace) &amp; thence it is, that being ours, and we his, we of all others, are moſt bound to obey.</p>
               <p>To conclude, they that ſtick in theſe Briars, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cry down the Law as a Chriſtian's Rule, becauſe by this Means a Chriſtian ſhall find no Peace; becauſe he is continually ſinning againſt this Law; the Law therefore, ſay they, will be always troubling of him.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. A corrupt Heart &amp; putrid Conſcience can have no Peace by the Law, Iſai. 57.21. <hi>There is no Peace to the Wicked,</hi> and it is good it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A watchful Chriſtian may, Pſal. 119.15. <hi>Great Peace have they that love thy Law. Hezekiah</hi> had it, when he deſired <hi>the Lord to remember how he had walked before him with a perfect Heart,</hi> Iſai. 58.1, 2, 3. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:005059_0256_101697DD484EADB0"/>
found it, <hi>the Teſtimony of his Conſcience</hi> bearing him Witneſs, was <hi>his rejoicing herein,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Chriſtian, ignorant of maintaining his Peace with God by Faith in his Juſtification, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Errors in his Obedience and Sanctification; if, I ſay, he wants his Peace, ſhall we therefore break the Law in Pieces? If a ſecure Chriſtian that walks looſely wants Peace, by the Accuſations of the Law, 'tis God's Mercy to him to give him no Peace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while he is at Truce with his Luſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Peace will end in diſmal Sorrow which is got by kicking againſt the Law, it is but daubing for a Man to keep his Peace by ſhutting his Eyes againſt the Way of Peace: A Servant may have Peace in his Idleneſs, by thinking that his Maſter requires no Work from him, and by hiding his Talent, yet what will the Lord ſay to him when his Day is ended, and he comes to reckon with him at Sun-ſet? Bring the Law into thy Conſcience in Point of Juſtification, it will trouble Conſcience: For there only Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, God's Grace, &amp; the Promiſe are to be looked on, and our own Obedience &amp; Holineſs laid by in the Duſt; but bring it before thee as a Rule of thy Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and as thy Copy to write after, &amp; to imitate, and aſpire after that Perfection it requires, it will then trouble thee no more, than it doth a Child, who having a fair Copy ſet him to write after, and knowing that he is a Son, is not therefore troubled, becauſe he cannot write as fair as his Copy; he knows if he imitates it, his Scribling ſhall be accepted: However, tho' his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may chaſtiſe him with Rods, if he be careleſs to imitate, yet he will never caſt him therefore off from being his Son. The Truth is this, it argues a moſt graceleſs, carnal, wretched Heart, for a Man to care by God's Rules, becauſe Attendance to them is his Trouble and Torment, which unto a gracious Heart
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:005059_0257_101697E367A379E8"/>
are Life &amp; Peace &amp; Sweetneſs; <hi>All the Ways of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to him, are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and her Paths Peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. And it is God's common Curſe upon them that love not the Truth in theſe Days, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sin is not their Sorrow, nor Breach of Rules their Trouble, that therefore the Obſervance of the Law, and Attendance unto Rules ſhall be their Burden and Trouble, they feel not the Plague in their own Hearts, and therefore Reproofs plague them, and Commands are a Plague and a Torment to them: Crooked Feet, and crooked Wills, make Men tread awry in ſuch corrupt Opinions.</p>
               <p>All the called Ones of God are therefore to live this Life of Obedience, and that out of Love, which I call the Life of Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. for elſe Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion avails nothing, nor Uncircumciſion, no nor Faith itſelf; unleſs it be of this Nature, as that it works by Love: There is much Obedience and external Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law in many Men, hut the principal Difference between theſe Formalities, and the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Saints, is Love; the Obedience of the one ariſeth from Self-Love, becauſe it pleaſeth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuits with their own Ends; the other from the Love of Chriſt, becauſe it pleaſeth him, and ſuits with his Ends, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein doth and ſhould this Life of Love appear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In theſe five Particulars,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In thinking and muſing much on Chriſt and upon his Love, any on what you ſhall do for him; he that ſaith he loves another, and yet ſeldom thinks on him, or will ſeldom give him a good Look when he meets him, certainly deceives himſelf; the leaſt Degree of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>e, appears in thinking on what we Love: becauſe the <hi>Loving-kindneſs of God</hi> was <hi>better than Life</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> hence he <hi>did remember him upon his Bed, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:005059_0258_101697E4F1F89658"/>
on him in the very Night,</hi> Pſal. 63.3, 6. They that <hi>fear the Lord, i. e.</hi> with a Son-like Fear, where Love is chiefly predominant, are ſuch as <hi>think upon his Name:</hi> Mal. 3.16. <hi>We have tho't of thy Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Oh Lord, in thy Temple,</hi> Pſal. 48.9. Thou that canſt ſpend Days, Nights, Weeks, Months, Years, and haſt thy Head all the Time ſwarming with vain Tho'ts, and ſcarce one living Tho't of Chriſt, and his Love, that didſt never beat thy Head, nor trouble thy ſelf in muſing, Oh what ſhall I do for him; nor in condemning thy ſelf becauſe thou doeſt ſo little, verily thou haſt not the leaſt Degree of this Life of Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſpeaking and commending of him: Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any Man ſhould love another and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, not ſpeak of him? If thou haſt but a Hawk or a Hound that thou loveſt, thou wilt commend it, and can it ſtand with Love to Chriſt, yet ſeldom or never to ſpeak of him nor of his Love; never to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him unto others, that they may fall in Love with him alſo? You ſhall ſee the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9, 16. when ſhe was aſked, <hi>what her Beloved was above others?</hi> She ſets him out in every Part of him, and concludes with this, <hi>He is altogether lovely. Becauſe thy-Loving-Kindneſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is better than Life, my Lips ſhall praiſe thee, and I will bleſs thee while I live,</hi> Pſal. 63.3, 4. Can it ſtand with this Life of Love, to be alway ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about worldly Affairs, or News at the beſt; both Week-Day and Sabbath-Day, in Bed and at Board, in good Company and in bad, at Home and Abroad? I tell you it will be one main Reaſon why you deſire to live, that you may make the Lord Jeſus known to your Children, Friends, Acquaintance, that ſo in the Ages to come his Name might ring, and his Memorial might be of ſweet Odour, from Generation to Generation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.18. If before thy Converſion eſpecially thou haſt poiſoned other by thy vain &amp; corrupt Speeches; after
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:005059_0259_101697E90F681F50"/>
thy Converſion thou wilt ſeek to ſeaſon the Hearts of others by a gracious, ſweet, and wiſe Communication of ſavory and bleſſed Speeches; what the Lord hath taught thee thou wilt talk of it unto others, for the Sake of him whom thou loveſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In being oft in his Company, and growing up thereby into a familiar Acquaintance with him; can we be long abſent from thoſe we love intirely, if we may come to them? Can we love Chriſt, and yet be ſeldom with him, in Word, in Prayer, in Sacraments, in chriſtian Communion, in Meditation and daily Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our own Hearts, in his Providences of Mercies, Croſſes and Trials? (For Chriſt is with us here, but thoſe two Ways, in his Ordinances or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, <hi>by his Holy Spirit) Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I have loved the Habitation of thy Houſe, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth,</hi> Pſal. 26.8. The Ground of which is ſet down, Verſe 3. <hi>Thy Loving-kindneſs is before mine Eyes. My Soul longeth for thee as in a Land where no Water is, that I might ſee thee, as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary;</hi> the Reaſon of it was, <hi>becauſe thy Loving-kindneſs is better than Life,</hi> Pſal. 63.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In doing much for him, and that willingly; did not <hi>Jacob</hi> love <hi>Rachel?</hi> How did he expreſs it? His <hi>ſeven Years</hi> Service, <hi>in Froſt and Snow, in Heat and Cold, by Day and Night</hi> were <hi>nothing</hi> to him, for her Sake whom he <hi>loved. Shall I ſerve the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) of what coſt me nothing?</hi> And when he had prepared many Millions for the Building of the Temple, yet he accounted it a <hi>ſmall Thing</hi> for his Sake whom he <hi>loved,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. he gave it out of his <hi>Poverty,</hi> as he ſpeaks: <hi>This is Love to keep his Commandments, and thoſe are not grievous,</hi> 1 john 5.3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſuffering and enduring any Evil for his Sake. I confeſs it is not every Degree of Love that will carry a Man hither; yet where there is great and ſingular
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:005059_0260_101697EBC3CEB758"/>
Love, <hi>for a good Man one may be willing to die,</hi> Rom. 5.7. aſſured if there be any Love to Chriſt, it will in Time increaſe to this Meaſure; it will think ten thouſand Lives too little to lay down for Chriſt's Sake, that laid down his precious Life for him: <hi>What tell you me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, of Bonds and Impriſonments? I am ready not only to be bound, but to die for the Sake of Chriſt at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; <hi>my Life is not dear to me,</hi> no more than a Ruſh at my Foot, <hi>that I may finiſh my Courſe with Joy. For thy Sake we are killed all the Day long,</hi> Rom. 8.36. I tell you the Love of Chriſt will make you fall down upon your Knees, &amp; bleſs the Lord that he will accept of ſuch a poor Sacrifice as thy Body is, tho' it be burnt to Aſhes; and thou wilt bleſs him again and again, that whereas he might have left thee in thy Sins to have trodden him and his Glory &amp; Grace under Foot, as he hath done Thouſands in the World; yet that he ſhould call thee to ſhare in this Honour, not only to do, but to ſuffer for his Sake.</p>
               <p>Now the good Lord perſwade all our Hearts unto this fruitful Obedience and Life of Love. Oh you young Men, you have a fair Time before you to do much for Chriſt in; how pleaſing will it be to him to ſee ſuch young Trees hang full of Fruit! You aged Men have now one Foot in your Grave, and you have forgotten the Lord Jeſus moſt of your Time, and your Time which now remains is very little, and then your Lamp is out, your Sun is almoſt ſet, and all your Work is yet to be done for Chriſt, O therefore awaken now at laſt before you awake when it is too late; you rich Men have Abilities, and wherewithal to ſet forward Chriſt's Kingdom in the Towns and Villages where you live; you poor Men may do much by ardent and inſtant Prayers Day and Night, for the Advancement of the Lord Jeſus. You Huſbands, Wives, Maſters,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:005059_0261_101697EE9430FDB8"/>
Servants, remember if you are not good in your Places, you are not good at all, whatever your Profeſſion be; a good Woman, but a froward Wife; a good Man, but a hair-brain'd curſt Huſband; a good Servant, but a very ſore Tongue; theſe cannot ſtand well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If you have any Love to Chriſt, the Life of Love will make you move beſt in your proper Place: Oh therefore love much, and ſo think much and ſpeak much of, and converſe much with, and do much, and ſuffer much for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; content not your ſelves with doing ſmall Things for him, that hath done and ſuffered much for you; if you can do but little, yet ſet God on Work by being fervent and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Prayer, not only that Chriſt may be honoured in your ſelves, but alſo in your Families, and in all Churches and Kingdoms of the World. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do much, yet maintain alive a <hi>Will</hi> to do much, which is <hi>accepted</hi> as if you did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.17. If thou art a poor Man, and haſt nothing to give, yet keep a Heart as liberal as a Prince; if you can do but little your ſelves, yet encourage others that they may, thou art not a Preacher called to convert Souls, yet do thou encourage the Meſſengers of Chriſt in their Work, by thy Prayers, Counſel, Help, and at the laſt Day the Coverſion of Souls ſhall be attributed unto thee, as well as unto them; if thou canſt not do any Good, yet prevent what Evil thou canſt in thy Place, to keep off Judgments, at leaſt to delay them; mourn thou for other Men's Sins, as if they were thine own, and ſo the Lord may pity and pardon them, and it may be convert them, who ſhall do more good it may be than ever thou canſt do: Let the Lord Jeſus be in thy Tho'ts the firſt in the Morning, and the laſt at Night; do what thou canſt, nay, go continually to him to enable thee to do more than thou of thy ſelf canſt, and mourn
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:005059_0262_101697F01CF698B8"/>
bitterly, and lament daily, what thou haſt not done, either thro' want of Ability or Will; remembring his Love to thee, that he came out of his Father's Boſom for thee, wept for thee, bled for thee, poured out his Life, nay, his Soul to Death for thee, is now riſen for thee, gone to Heaven for thee, ſits at God's right Hand, and rules all the World for thee, makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion continually for thee, and at the End of the World will come again for thee, who haſt loved him here, that thou mighteſt live for ever with him then.</p>
               <p>But is this <hi>our</hi> Life, in theſe evil and luke-warm Times? How many be there that believe in Chriſt, that they may live as they liſt? If to drink, &amp; whore, and ſcoff, and blaſpheme; if to ſhake a Lock, and follow every fond Faſhion; if to croſs and chringe before a Piece of Wood; if to be weary of the Word, and outwardly zealous for long Prayers; if to ſeek for Purity of Ordinances in Churches, and to maintain Impurity in Hearts, in Shops, in Families; if to ſet our Hearts upon Farms and Merchandizes, and ſo to be coveteous; if to ſet up our own Selves, and Parts, and Gifts, with a ſecret Diſdain of God's Miniſters; if to cry down Learning, and ſet up Ignorance, if to ſet up Chriſt, and deſtroy Sanctification &amp; Obedience; if to be a Sect-Maſter of ſome odd Opinions; if to crack the Nut of ſome ſuperlunary and monkiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and high-flown Speculations; if to hear much, and do little; if to have a Name to live, and yet dead at the Heart; if this be to live the Life of Love, we have many that live this Life; the Lord Jeſus wants not Love, if this be to Love: But Oh wo unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you thus requite the Lord, fooliſh People &amp; unwiſe! The Lord knows we may complain as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>every Man minds his own Things, and not the Things of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> none in Compariſon of that huge Number that think they are Religious end, if they be baptized,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:005059_0263_101697F1A7F06D20"/>
and ſay that they believe in Jeſus Chriſt: Verily the Time draws near wherein the Lord will come for <hi>Fruits</hi> from his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and if he finds it not, aſſuredly he will not be beholding to us for Obedience, he can raiſe his Glory out of other People; and there carry his Goſpel to them who ſhall <hi>bring forth the Fruits</hi> of it; the Lord will ſhortly <hi>lay his Ax unto the Root of</hi> our <hi>Tree;</hi> and if we will not ſerve the Lord in this good Land in the Abundance of Peace and Mercy, we ſhall ſerve our Enemies in Hunger, Cold, and Nakedneſs; if we will not ſerve <hi>him</hi> in Love, we muſt ſerve <hi>our Enemies</hi> in Fear; Do not think that the Lord will be put off with venerable Names and Titles, Shadows and Pictures; what is moſt Men's Profeſſion at this Day but a meer Paint? Which may ſerve to colour them while they live, but will never comfort them (unleſs Conſcience be aſleep) when they come to die. Oh, take heed of ſuch Formality: I can never think enough of <hi>David</hi>'s Expreſſion, Pſal 119.161. <hi>I have kept thy Commandments, and I love them exceedingly;</hi> ſhould he not have ſaid firſt, <hi>I have loved thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and ſo <hi>have kept them?</hi> Doubtleſs he did ſo, but he ran here in a holy and moſt heavenly Circle, I have kept them, and loved them; and loved them, and kept them: If we love Chriſt we alſo ſhall live ſuch a Life of Love in our Meaſure; and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments will be moſt dear, when himſelf is moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
