            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR SUSAN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOWEVER fond of novels and roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you may be, the unfortunate adventures of one of my neighbours, who died yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, will make you deſpiſe that fiction, in which, knowing the ſubject to be fabulous, we can never be ſo truly intereſted. While this lady was expiring, Mrs. C— V—, her near kinſwoman, related to me her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy hiſtory, in which I ſhall now take the liberty of intereſting your benevolent and feeling heart.</p>
            <p>MARIA KITTLE was the only iſſue of her parents, who cultivated a large farm on the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031837_0003_0FEECD84BAF53F18"/>
banks of the <hi>Hudſon,</hi> eighteen miles above <hi>Albany.</hi> They were perſons of good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities, improved by ſome learning; yet, conſcious of a deficiency in their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they ſtudied nothing ſo much as to render their little daughter truly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>MARIA was born in the year 1721. Her promiſing infancy preſaged a maturity of excellencies; every amiable quality dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through her liſping prattle; every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal grace attended her attitudes and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over her features. As ſhe advanced through the playful ſtage of childhood, ſhe became more eminent than a Penelope for her induſtry; yet, ſoon as the ſun declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe always retired with her books until the time of repoſe, by which means ſhe ſoon informed her opening mind with the principles of every uſeful ſcience. She was beloved by all her female companions, who, though they eaſily diſcovered her opening elegance of manners, inſtead of envying, were excited to imitate her. As ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made one in their little parties of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on feſtival days, it is no wonder that ſhe ſoon became the reigning goddeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſwains. She was importuned to
<pb facs="unknown:031837_0004_0FEE92FD40087BE0"/>
admit the addreſſes of numbers, whom ſhe politely diſcarded, and withdrew herſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while from public obſervation. However, the fame of her charms attracted ſeveral gentlemen of family from <hi>Albany,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on her retirement, ſoliciting her hand. But this happineſs was reſerved for a near relation of her's, one Mr. KITTLE, whoſe merits had made an impreſſion on her heart. He, although not handſome, was poſſeſſed of a moſt engaging addreſs; while his learning and moral virtues more particularly recommended him to her eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem. Their parents ſoon diſcovered their reciprocal paſſion, and highly approving of it, haſtened their marriage, which was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated under the moſt happy auſpices.</p>
            <p>MARIA was fifteen when married. They removed to his farm, on which he had built a ſmall neat houſe, ſurrounded by tall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, which gave it a contemplative air. It was ſituated on an eminence, with a green incloſure in the front, graced by a well cultivated garden on one ſide, and on the other by a clear ſtream, which, ruſhing over a bed of white pebble, gave them a high poliſh, that caſt a ſoft gleam through the water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:031837_0005_0FEECD9B02165CE0"/>Here they reſided in the tranquil enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that happineſs which ſo much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and innocence deſerved: the indigent, the ſorrowful, the unfortunate were always ſure of conſolation when they entered thoſe peaceful doors. They were almoſt adored by their neighbours, and even the wild ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages themſelves, who often reſorted thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for refreſhments when hunting, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt regard for them, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their virtues.</p>
            <p>In little more than a year they were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a daughter, the lovelier reſemblance of her lovely mother: as ſhe grew up, her graces increaſing, promiſed a bloom and underſtanding equal to her's; the Indians, in particular, were extremely fond of the ſmiling ANNA; whenever they found a young fawn, or caught a brood of wood-ducks, or ſurpriſed the young beaver in their daily excurſions through the foreſts, they preſented them with pleaſure to her; they brought her the earlieſt ſtrawberries, the ſcarlet plumb, and other delicate wild fruits in painted baſkets.</p>
            <p>How did the fond parents' hearts delight to ſee their beloved one ſo univerſally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed! When they ſauntered over the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031837_0006_0FEE9358601BDD28"/>
fields with the little prattler wantoning before them collecting flowers and purſuing the velvet eluſive butterfly, MARIA's cheek ſuffuſing with rapture, "Oh my dear," ſhe would ſay,
<q>we are happier than human beings can expect to be; how trivial are the evils annexed to our ſituation! may God avert that our heaven be limited to this life!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eleven years now elapſed before Mrs. KITTLE diſcovered any ſigns of pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: her ſpouſe ſilently wiſhed for a ſon, and his deſires were at length gratified; ſhe was delivered of a charming boy, who was named, after him, WILLIAM.</p>
            <p>A French and Indian war had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſometime before; but about eight months after her delivery, the ſavages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to commit the moſt horrid depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Engliſh frontiers. Mr. KIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE, alarmed at the danger of his brothers, who dwelt near <hi>Fort-Edward,</hi> (the eldeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt married to a very agreeable young woman) invited them to reſide with him during the war.</p>
            <p>They were ſcarce arrived when the enemy made further incurſions into the country, burning the villages and ſcalping the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031837_0007_0FEECD8050516228"/>
neither reſpecting age nor ſex. This terribly alarmed Mrs. KITTLE; ſhe began to prepare for flight, and the next evening after receiving this intelligence, as ſhe and Mr. KITTLE were buſily employed in pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up china and other things, they were accoſted by ſeveral Indians, whoſe wigwams were contiguous to the village of <hi>Schochti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook,</hi> and who always ſeemed well affected to the Engliſh. An elderly ſavage under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to be prolocutor, and deſired the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to compoſe themſelves, aſſuring them they ſhould be cautioned againſt any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger. To inforce his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he preſented MARIA with a belt interwoven with ſilk and beads, ſaying,
<q>There, receive my token of friendſhip: we go to dig up the hatchet, to ſink it in the heads of your enemies; we ſhall guard this wood with a wall of fire— you ſhall be ſafe.</q>
A warm glow of hope deepened in MARIA's cheek at this— Then ordering wine to be brought to the friendly ſavages, with a ſmile of diffidence, "I am afraid," ſaid ſhe,
<q>neceſſity may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige you to abandon us, or neglect of your promiſe may deprive us of your protection.</q>
—"Neglect of my promiſe!"
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031837_0008_0FEECD9E0AAAD5C0"/>
retorted he with ſome acrimony:
<q>No, MARIA, I am a true man; I ſhoot the arrow up to the Great Captain every new moon: depend upon it, I will trample down the briars round your dwelling, that you do not hurt your feet.</q>
MARIA now retired, bowing a grateful acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment, and leaving the ſavages to indulge their feſtivity, who paſſed the night in the moſt vociferous mirth.</p>
            <p>Mrs. KITTLE, with a ſort of exultation, related the ſubject of their conference to her huſband, who had abſented himſelf on their firſt appearance, having formed ſome ſuſpicion of the ſincerity of their friendſhip, and not being willing to be duped by their diſſimulation. "And now," added MARIA ſmiling,
<q>our fears may again ſubſide: Oh my dear! my happineſs is trebled into rapture, by ſeeing you and my ſweet babes out of danger.</q>
He only ſighed, and reaching his arm round her poliſhed neck, preſſed her to his boſom. After a ſhort pauſe, "My love," ſaid he,
<q>be not too confident of their fidelity; you ſurely know what a ſmall dependence is to be placed on their promiſes: however, to appear ſuſpicious might be ſuddenly fatal to us; we will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031837_0009_0FEECD729D5E99B8"/>
therefore ſuſpend our journey to <hi>Albany</hi> for a few days.</q>
Though MARIA's ſoul ſaddened at the conviction of this truth; though her fears urged her to propoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate flight, yet ſhe acquieſced; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſupped with the family, this tender pair ſunk aſleep on the boſom of reſt.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning Mr. KITTLE a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, firſt impreſſing a kiſs on MARIA's ſoft cheek, as ſhe ſlumbered with her infant in her arms. He then awaked his brother, reminding him that he had propoſed a hunting match the preceding evening. "It is true," replied PETER,
<q>but ſince hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities have commenced ſo near us as the Indians inform, I think it rather impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to quit the family.</q>
—
<q>Come, come,</q>
replied the other,
<q>do not let us intimidate the neighbours by cloiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ourſelves up with women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>—
"I reject the thought," rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed PETER, "of being afraid." Then hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreſſed himſelf, while his brother charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their pieces, they left the houſe, and traverſed the pathleſs graſs for many hours without perceiving any thing but ſmall birds, who filled the fragrant air with melody. "PETER," ſaid Mr. KITTLE, caſting his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031837_0010_0FEECD6C9FB8B658"/>
eyes around the lovely landſcape,
<q>what a profuſion of ſweets does Nature exhale to pleaſe her intelligent creatures! I feel my heart expand with love and gratitude to heaven every moment, nor can I ever be grateful enough. I have health and competence, a lovely fond wife whoſe ſmile would calm the rudeſt ſtorm of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and two infants bloſſoming into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; all my ſocial ties are yet unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken—PETER, I anticipate my heaven— But why, my brother do you turn pale? what dreadful idea ſtiffens your features with amazement? what in God's name ails you, PETER? are you unwel? ſit down under this tree awhile.</q>
—To theſe interrogaties PETER replied,
<q>Excuſe my weakneſs, I am not unwel, but an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual horror chilled my blood; I felt as if the damps of death preſt already round my ſoul; but the vapour is gone off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I feel quite better.</q>
Mr. KITTLE cheered his brother, attributing his emotion to fear; who, by this time, having re-aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his compoſure, entered into diſcourſe with cheerfulneſs, refuſing to return home without having killed any thing.</p>
            <p>Then riſing, they proceeded through lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031837_0011_0FEECDCA3517CC00"/>
groves of pine, and open fields that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bend under the heavy hand of Ceres. At laſt, diſappointment and fatigue prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them to return home: they had gone farther than they apprehended; but paſſing along the bank of the river within a few miles of Mr. Kittle's, they eſpied a fat doe walking ſecurely on the beach, which Peter ſoftly approaching, levelled his piece with ſo good an aim that the animal dropped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at the exploſion. This ſeeming ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was, however the origin of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for immediately after, two ſavages appeared, directed in their courſe by the firing. Setting up a loud yell, they ran up to the brothers and diſcharged their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms. Mr. Kittle ſtarted back, but Peter received a brace of balls in his boſom. He recoiled a few ſteps back, and then ſunk down encompaſſed with thoſe deadly hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of which in the morning he had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment. Mr. Kittle ſtood awhile aghaſt, like a perſon juſt waked from a frightful dream; but on ſeeing the Indian advancing to tear the ſcalp from his dying brother, he ſuddenly recollected himſelf, and ſhot a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let through his head: then grappling with the other, who was loading again, he wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031837_0012_0FEECD4D9D4EE248"/>
his firelock from him, and felled him to the ground with the but-end of it. This was no time for reflection or unavailing la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the danger was eminent: ſo leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſavages for dead, with a mournful ſilence Mr. Kittle haſtened to throw the deer from off his horſe, and laid his bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brother acroſs him.</p>
            <p>When our ſouls are gloomy, they ſeem to caſt a ſhade over the objects that ſurround us, and make nature correſpondent to our feelings: ſo Mr. Kittle thought the night fell with a deeper gloom than uſual. The ſoft notes of evening birds ſeemed to be the reſponſes of ſavage yells. The echo of his tread, which he never before regarded, now rung diſmally hollow in his ears. Even the ruſtling of the winds through the leaves ſeemed attended with a ſolemnity that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him with cold tremors. As he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with his mournful charge, his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were alarmed for his dear Maria; he dreaded the agitation and diſtreſs this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture would throw her in: but it was unavoidable!</p>
            <p>The ſound of his horſe's feet no ſooner invaded the ears of Maria, than ſeizing a light, ſhe ſprung with a joyful impatience
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031837_0013_0FEECE12136C7538"/>
to the door, and was met by her partner pale and bloody, who endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent too ſudden a diſcovery of this calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But at the firſt glance ſhe comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole affair, and retiring a few ſteps, with the moſt exquiſite agony in her countenance, "Oh Mr. Kittle!" ſhe cried, claſping her hands together, "it is all over —we are betrayed—your brother is kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!"—"Too true, oh, too fatally true!" replied he, falling on his knees beſide her as ſhe ſunk down, "my angel! the very ſavages that ſolemly engaged to protect us have deprived him of life; but I am yet alive, my Maria, be comforted—I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly procure carriages, and before morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you and your innocents ſhall be beyond the reach of their malevolence."</p>
            <p>By this time the family had crouded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and with grievous wailings were inquiring the particulars of this ſad adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Mr. Kittle having related every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance with brevity, ordered the corpſe to be laid in a remote chamber, deſiring at the ſame time a horſe to be ſaddled for him. Then, more oppreſſed by his wife's griefs than his own, he led the diſconſolate fair to her chamber, where, being ſeated, ſhe ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031837_0014_0FEECD5F43C721F0"/>
demanded where he intended to go at that time of night. "Only," ſaid he, "to the village of <hi>Schochticook</hi> to hire a couple of waggons; I ſhall return in an hour I hope, with a proper guard to ſecure our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from this hoſtile place." Maria was ſilent; at length ſhe burſt into a flood of tears, which his endearments only augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then expoſtulating with him, "Is it not enough," cried ſhe, "that you have eſcaped one danger, but muſt you be ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eager to encounter others? beſides, you are ſpent with ſorrow and fatigue—let one of your brothers perform this ſilent expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—"It is impoſſible," replied the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der huſband; "how can I dare to propoſe a danger to them from which I would ſhrink myſelf? their lives are equally precious with mine: but God may diſappoint our fears, my love!" He would have continued, but his ſpouſe, riſing from her ſeat, interrupted him—"At leaſt, my dear, before you leave us give your lovely babes a farewel em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, that if fate ſhould—ſhould ſeparate us, <hi>that</hi> yet ſhall ſweeten our hours of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence." Here ſhe found herſelf claſped in her conſort's arms, who exclaimed, "My Maria! I love you paſſionately, and if the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031837_0015_0FEECD9C86031FA0"/>
leaſt ſhadow of danger did appear to attend this night's travel, for your ſake, for my bleſſed children's ſake I would decline it: but I have left the Indians lifeleſs, who no doubt attacked us from ſome private pique; nor will they be diſcovered until morning." —"Well then," Maria anſwered, "I no longer oppoſe you; forgive my fears."— Meanwhile as ſhe ſtept to the cradle for her ſuckling, the fair Anna, who was liſtening at the door anxious to hear her parents ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on this occaſion, quitted her ſtation and flew to them ſwift as light; dropping on her knees before her father, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in his face with the moſt attractive graces and the perſuaſive eloquence of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. Her neck and features were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly turned, her complexion fairer than the tuberoſe, and contraſted by the moſt ſhining ringlets of dark hair. Her eyes, whoſe brilliancy was ſoftened through the medium of tears, for a while dwelt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his countenance. At length, with a voice ſcarce audible, ſhe ſighed out, "Oh papa! do not leave us; if any accident ſhould happen to you, mamma will die of grief, and what will become of poor Anna and Billy? who will care for me? who will
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031837_0016_0FEECD8DC204DC68"/>
teach me when my papa, my mamma's papa is gone?"—"My ſweet child," replied he, embracing her and holding her to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, "there is no danger; I ſhall return in an hour, and before to-morrow you ſhall be ſafe on the plains of <hi>Albany,</hi> and my heart ſhall exult over the happineſs of my family."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Kittle now approached with her playful infant in her arms; but its winning actions extorted nothing but groans from her pained boſom, which was more ſtormy than Ontario-Lake, when agitated by fierce winds. Mr. Kittle perceiving this uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon emotion, gently took the child from her, and repeatedly kiſſed it, while new ſmiles dimpled its lovely aſpect. "Oh!" ſaid he to himſelf, "this gloom that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens Maria's ſoul is ſupernatural!—it ſeems dreadfully portentious!—Shall I yet ſtay?" But here a ſervant informing him that his horſe was ready, he bluſhed at his want of fortitude; and having conquered his irreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, after the moſt affecting and ſolemn parting, he quitted his houſe, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view it more!</p>
            <p>Maria then walked ſadly back again, and having aſſembly the family in a little hall,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031837_0017_0FEECDA6D1ED3FA8"/>
they cloſed and barred the doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mrs. Comelia Kittle, Maria's ſiſter-in-law, was far advanced in her pregnancy, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed her huſband's uneaſineſs for her; and they were debating in what manner to accommodate her at <hi>Albany,</hi> when the tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of feet about the houſe, and a yell of complicated voices, announced the Indians arrival. Struck with horror and conſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the little family crouded together in the center of the hall, while the ſervants at this alarm, being in a kitchen diſtant from the houſe, ſaved themſelves by a precipitate flight. The little Billy, frightened at ſuch dreadful ſounds, clung faſt to his mother's throbbing breaſt, while Anna, in a ſilent agony of amazement, claſped her trembling knees. The echo of their yells yet rung in long vibrations through the foreſt, when, with a thundering peal of ſtrokes at the door, they demanded entrance. Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpair ſat upon every face. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria and her companions gazed wildly at each other, till, upon repeated menaces and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to break open the door, Comelia's huſband, giving all for loſt, leiſurely advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the door. Comelia ſeeing this, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a great ſhriek, and cried out, "O
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031837_0018_0FEECD6F9D98F720"/>
God! what are you doing, my raſh, raſh, unfortunate huſband! you will be ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!" Then falling on her knees, ſhe caught hold of his hand and ſobbed out, "O pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty me! have mercy on yourſelf, on me, on my child!"—"Alas! my love," ſaid he, half turning with a look of diſtraction, "what can we do? let us be reſigned to the will of God." So ſaying he unbarred the door, and that inſtant received a fatal bullet in his boſom, and fell backward wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the agonies of death; the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled at this horrible ſpectacle, and hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in a corner, ſending forth the moſt piercing cries: in the interim the ſavages ruſhing in with great ſhouts, proceeded to mangle the corpſe, and having made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion round his head with a crooked knife, they tugged off his bloody ſcalp with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous triumph. While this was perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, an Indian, hideouſly painted, ſtrode ferociouſly up to Comelia, (who ſunk away at the ſight, and fainted on a chair) and cleft her white forehead deeply with his tomahack. Her fine azure eyes juſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then ſuddenly cloſing for ever, ſhe tumbled lifeleſs at his feet. His ſanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul was not yet ſatisfied with blood; he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031837_0019_0FEECDE9A8D60E48"/>
deformed her lovely body with deep gaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and, tearing her unborn babe away, daſhed it to pieces againſt the ſtone wall; with many additional circumſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal cruelty.</p>
            <p>During this horrid carnage, the dead were ſtripped, and dragged from the houſe, when one of the helliſh band advanced to Maria, who circling her babes with her white arms, was ſending hopeleſs petitions to heaven, and bemoaning their cruelly loſt ſituation: as he approached, expecting the fatal ſtroke, ſhe endeavoured to guard her children, and with ſupplicating looks, implored for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The ſavage attempted not to ſtrike; but the aſtoniſhed Anna ſheltered herſelf behind her mamma, while her blooming ſuckling quitting her breaſt, gazed with a pleaſing wonder on the painted ſtranger.— Maria ſoon recognized her old friend that preſented her with the belt, through the loads of ſhells and feathers that diſguiſed him. This was no time, however, to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, by reminding him of his promiſe; yet, gueſſing her thoughts, he anticipated her remonſtrance. "Maria," ſaid he, "be not afraid, I have promiſed to protect you; you ſhall live and dance with us around the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031837_0020_0FEECDA54D30F400"/>
fire at <hi>Canada:</hi> but you have one ſmall incumbrance, which, if not removed, will much impede your progreſs thither." So ſaying he ſeized her laughing babe by the wriſts, and forcibly endeavoured to draw him from her arms. At this, terrified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conception, ſhe exclaimed, "O God! leave me, leave me my child! he ſhall not go, though a legion of devils ſhould try to ſeparate us!" Holding him ſtill faſt, while the Indian applied his ſtrength to tear him away, knaſhing his teeth at her oppoſition; "Help! God of heaven!" ſcreamed ſhe, "help! have pity, have mercy on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant! O God! O Chriſt! can you bear to ſee this? O mercy! mercy! mercy! let a little ſpark of compaſſion ſave this inoffend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this lovely angel!" By this time the breathleſs babe dropt its head on its boſom; the wriſts were nigh pinched off, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him juſt expiring, with a dreadful ſhriek ſhe reſigned him to the mercileſs hands of the ſavage, who inſtantly daſhed his little forehead againſt the ſtones, and caſting his bleeding body at ſome diſtance from the houſe, left him to make his exit in feeble and unheard groans.—Then indeed, in the unutterable anguiſh of her ſoul, ſhe fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031837_0021_0FEECD681CF37FC0"/>
and rending away her hair, ſhe roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out her ſorrows with a voice louder than natural, and rendered awfully hollow by too great an exertion. "O barbarians!" ſhe exclaimed, "ſurpaſſing devils in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs! ſo may a tenfold night of miſery enwrap your black ſouls as you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the babe of my boſom, the comfort of my cares, my bleſſed cherub, of light and life—O hell! are not thy flames impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to cleave the center and engulph theſe wretches in thy ever burning waves? are there no thunders in Heaven—no avenging Angel—no God to take notice of ſuch Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven defying cruelties?" Then ruſhing to her dead infant with redoubled cries, and clapping her hands, ſhe laid herſelf over his mangled body; again ſoftened into tears and moans, ſhe wiped the blood from his ghaſtly countenance, and preſt him to her heaving boſom, alternately careſſing him and her trembling Anna, who, clinging to her with bitter wailings, and kiſſing her hands and face, entreated her to implore the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages for mercy. "Do, my angel mamma," ſhe urged, "do beg them yet to pity—beg them yet to ſave you for my poor, poor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa's ſake!—Alas! if we are all killed, his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031837_0022_0FEECDECB2788840"/>
heart will break!—Oh! they can't be rocks and ſtones!—Don't cry mamma, they will ſpare us!"—Thus the little orator endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conſole her afflicted mother; but their melancholy endearments were ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the relentleſs ſavages, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plundered the houſe of every valuable thing that was portable, returned to Maria, and rudely catching her arm, commanded her to follow them; but repulſing them with the boldneſs of deſpair, "Leave me, leave me," ſhe ſaid, "I cannot go—I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will quit my murdered child! Too cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in your mercies, you have given me life only to prolong my miſeries!"—Meanwhile the lovely Anna, terrified at the hoſtile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the enemy, left her mamma ſtruggling to diſengage herſelf from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and fled precipitately to the houſe. She had already concealed herſelf in a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, when Mrs. Kittle purſuing her, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted by flames, the ſavages having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the houſe. The wretched child ſoon diſcovered her deplorable ſituation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuffocated by the ſmoke, with piercing cries called for help to her dear, dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—Alas! what could the unhappy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent do? whole ſheets of flames rolled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031837_0023_0FEECDCBB9F645A8"/>
them, while in a phrenzy of grief, ſhe ſcreamed out, "O my laſt treaſure, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Anna! try to eſcape the devouring fire—come to me, my ſweet child—the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians will not kill us—O my periſhing babe! have pity on your mother—do not leave me quite deſtitute!" Then turning to the calm villains who attended her, ſhe cried, "Why do you not attempt to reſcue my ſweet innocent? Can your unfeeling hearts not bear to leave me one—a ſolitary ſingle one?" Again calling to her Anna, ſhe received no anſwer, which being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of her death, the Indians obliged Maria and her brother Henry to quit the houſe, which they effected with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the glowing beams falling around them and thick volumes of ſmoke obſcuring their paſſage. The flames now ſtruck a long ſplendor through the humid atmoſphere, and bluſhed to open the tragical ſcene on the face of heaven. They had ſcarce advanced two hundred yards with their reluctant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, when the flaming ſtructure tumbled to the earth with a dreadful craſh. Our trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers by inſtinct turned their eyes to the mournful blaze; and Maria, burſting afreſh into grievous lamentations, cried, "There,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031837_0024_0FEECD7589C678D0"/>
there my brother, my children are wrapt in arching ſheets of flames, that uſed to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled in my arms! they are entombed in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins that breathed their ſlumbers on my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom! yet, oh! their ſpotleſs ſouls even now riſe from this chaos of blood and fire, and are pleading our injured cauſe before our God, my brother!" He only replied in ſighs and groans; he ſcarcely heard her; horror had froze up the avenues of his ſoul; and all amazed and trembling, he followed his leaders like a perſon in a troubleſome dream.</p>
            <p>The diſtant flames now caſt a fainter light, and the northern breeze bent the columns of ſmoke over the ſouth horizon. Sad and benighted, they wandered through almoſt impenetrable ſwamps, forded the broad ſtream of <hi>Tomhanick,</hi> and the rapid river of <hi>Hoſack;</hi> they paſſed through deſerted ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, where the yelling of ſolitary dogs increaſed the ſolemnity of midnight, nor halted till the ſtars, emitting a feebler luſtre, preſaged the approach of day. Maria, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſorrow and fatigue, immediately ſunk helpleſs at the foot of a tree, while the ſavages (who were ſix in number) kindled a fire, and prepared their meal, (in a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſh)
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031837_0025_0FEECDEB2E6A6688"/>
which conſiſted only of ſome parched maize pulverized and enriched with the fat of bears fleſh. Obſerving Maria had fallen aſleep, they offered not to diſturb her, but invited Henry Kittle to partake of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt. He durſt not refuſe them; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed a few mouthfuls of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palatable food, and accepted of a pipe of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, he deſired leave to repoſe himſelf, which being readily granted, they ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his example, and ſunk aſleep, leaving two centinels to guard againſt ſurpriſe, which precaution they always make uſe of.</p>
            <p>I am, ſorry, dear Suſan, to quit Maria in this intereſting part of her ſtory; but order requires that we ſhould now return to her ſpouſe, whom we left on his way through the wood.</p>
            <p>The village of <hi>Schochticook</hi> is ſituated on a circular plain, ſurrounded by high hills, riſing in form of an amphitheatre. Mr. Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle had juſt gained the verge, when, chanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to caſt his eyes around, he perceived the whole ſouthern hemiſphere ſuddenly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with a bright blaze; however, being accuſtomed to the foreſt's being often fired to clear it from the underwood, he was not much ſurpriſed, but proceeded to deſcend
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031837_0026_0FEECD7892CBEF78"/>
the hill. On his arriving with the account of his brother's murder, the place was put in the higheſt commotion; the men fitting up their arms, and the women clamouring about them, highly importunate to be removed to <hi>Albany;</hi> but the night being very dark, this manoeuvre was deferred till morning; nor could Mr. Kittle prevail on a ſingle perſon to return with him during the darkneſs; he felt himſelf ſtrangely agitated at this diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and, refuſing to repoſe himſelf, with great impatience he watched the firſt orient beam of Phoſphor, which appearing, he ſat off for home with two waggons, and a guard of three Indians. As he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his late happy dwelling, his boſom dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the pleaſing hope of ſoon extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his beloved family from danger; he chid the ſlowneſs of the carriages, and felt impatient to diſſipate the apprehenſions of Maria, to kiſs the pendant tear from her eye, and preſs his ſportive innocents to his boſom. While theſe bright ideas play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round his ſoul, he lifted up his eyes, and through an opening of the woods, beheld his farm: but what language can expreſs his ſurpriſe and conſternation at ſeeing his habitation ſo ſuddenly deſolated! a loud ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031837_0027_0FEECD5994D82A98"/>
of amaze burſt from the whole company at ſo unexpected a view—the blood revolted from Mr. Kittle's cheek—his heart throbbed under the big emotion, and all aghaſt, ſpurring on his horſe, he entered the incloſure with full ſpeed.—Stop here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man! here let the fibres of thy heart crack with excruciating miſery—let the cruel view of mangled wretches, ſo nearly allied to thee, extort drops of blood from thy cleaving boſom! It did—it did. Uttering a deep groan, he fell inſenſible from his horſe, while his attendants, haſtening tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards him, were ſhocked beyond conception at the diſmal ſpectacle; and, ſtarting back with averted eyes from the dead, were thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtruck, not having power to move or ſpeak. After awhile two Indians (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to ſanguinary ſcenes, recovered themſelves firſt) took a blanket, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward to the mangled Comelia, threw it over her naked body; the others then timidly advanced, and Mr. Kittle open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes groaned again bitterly; then raiſing himſelf on his knees, with a look of unutterable anguiſh, he called upon his dear Maria. Alas! no voice but the ſolemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of his own cries was articulated to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031837_0028_0FEECD9232A23C08"/>
him: then riſing with an air of diſtraction, he ſtalked round the bloody ſcene, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the dead bodies; firſt uncovering the pale viſage of Comelia, he ſurveyed in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence her diſtorted features; but perceiving it was not Maria, he gently laid the cloth over again, and turning furiouſly, caught up his ghaſtly infant, whoſe little body was black with contuſions, and his ſkull horribly fractured. Almoſt fainting under his mournful load, and ſtaggering at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcovery, he depoſited it again on the bloody earth, and clapping his hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repeatedly with violence, "O hell! hell!" he cried, "you cannot inflict tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo exquiſite as thoſe I now ſuffer! how am I cruſhed to the center! how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am I degraded below the worms of the ſod! O my children! my children! where are you now? O my wife! my Maria! the beloved of my boſom, are you too fallen a ſacrifice? Why do I ſurvive theſe miſeries, my God? how can mortality ſupport them? Burſt—burſt my ſhrinking heart, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a wretch for not having died in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſuch lovely and innocent beings! Oh! why was I abſent in this fatal hour? why did not their groans vibrate on my ſoul
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031837_0029_0FEECE13D7295A10"/>
that I might have flown to their aid!" Thus wildly lamenting and wandering among the ſmoaking ruins, he picked up ſome of the calcined bones of his once beautiful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. At this ſight deſpair ſhook his ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, new agonies convulſed his features, and dropping the ſad evidence of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he extended his arms to Heaven, and roared out, "Revenge! great God! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge if thou art juſt and kind as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! Oh! that I had the power of an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel to thunder eternal horrors on the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wretches who have blaſted the bud of my happineſs who have darkened the brighteſt eyes that ever opened on the light!"</p>
            <p>The men here interfering, to conſole him obſerved, the bones were probably thoſe of his brother Peter; but on finding his ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton entire, Mr. Kittle inſiſted that it muſt have been Maria and Anna, who, having hid themſelves, had doubtleſs periſhed in the flames. Again, in the furious extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of paſſion, he tore the hair from his head, and caſting himſelf proſtrate on the aſhes, he gathered the crumbling bones to his boſom, while the big drops of anguiſh iſſued at every pore, till life, unable longer to ſuſtain the mental conflict, ſuſpended her
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031837_0030_0FEECD7B790F8758"/>
powers, and once more deprived him of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. His companions having laid him on a waggon, now conferred together in what manner to proceed, and apprehending an attack from the ſavages, they unanimouſly concluded to lay the dead bodies on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining carriage, and make the beſt of their way to <hi>Schochticook,</hi> which they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed with great ſilence and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>You may judge, my dear, what a panic the appearance of this mournful cavalcade ſtruck over the inhabitants of this defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs village. Mr. Kittle was gently laid on a bed, and being let blood, his reſpiration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs obſtructed, though he continued ſenſeleſs till his unfortunate family were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred. Six weeks elapſed before he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any degree of ſtrength; but even then he appeared pale and emaciated like a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lazarus; his diſpoſition was entirely changed, his looks were fierce, his attitudes wild and extravagant, and his converſation, which was formerly ſenſible, commanding attention by a muſical voice, now was inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, and his cadence deep and hollow, rather inſpiring terror than any pleaſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Thirſting for revenge, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031837_0031_0FEECD87A772B588"/>
that ſolitude only tended to corrode his moments with the blackeſt melancholy, he ſoon after entered the Britiſh ſervice in the capacity of gentleman volunteer, and ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized himſelf by his prudence and intrepidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, attracting the particular notice of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who being affected with his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, proffered their ſervices to him with ſo much friendſhip and candour, as obliged him to accept of them, and yet lightened the obligation.</p>
            <p>But doubtleſs, my dear, your generous ſenſibility is alarmed at my ſilence about Mrs. Kittle; I think we left her repoſing under a tree; ſhe was the firſt that awaked as the ſun began to exhale the cryſtal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules of morning, when half riſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining on her elbow, ſhe ſurveyed the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly landſcape around her with a deep ſigh; they were on an eminence that commanded an unlimited proſpect of the country every way. The birds were cheerful; the deer bounded fearleſs over the hills; the meadows bluſhed with the enamel of Flora; but grief had ſaddened every object in her ſight; the whole creation ſeemed a dark blank to the fair mourner. Again recollection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked the ſluices of her eyes, and her ſelf

complaints diſturbed her ſavage compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who, riſing and kindling up the dying embers, began to prepare their victuals, which they invited her to partake of. This ſhe declined with viſible deteſtation; and, turning to her brother with the dignity of conſcious merit in diſtreſs, "No," ſaid ſhe, "I will never receive a morſel from thoſe bloody hands yet dropping with recent mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!—let me periſh—let the iron hand of famine firſt pinch out my vitals, and ſend me after my children!" Notwithſtanding this, Henry added his ſolicitations that ſhe ſhould accept of ſome refreſhment, reminding her of her fatal reſolution, which could be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no otherwiſe than ſuicide. Finding this had no effect, he tried to touch her feelings on a ſofter key—"Remember, Maria," ſaid he, "you have a tender huſband yet living; would you wiſh to deprive him of every earthly conſolation? Would you add affliction to affliction, and after he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the ſorrowful obſequies of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to cruſh all his remaining hope by the news of your voluntary death? No, live my ſiſter! be aſſured he will ſoon get us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, when ſoft ſympathies ſhall waſh away your ſorrows; and after a few years,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031837_0033_0FEECDD6093F9978"/>
who knows but the ſmiles of a new lovely progeny may again draw a paradiſe of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs on you." Maria was affected, and half raiſing her eyes from the earth, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "O my brother! how conſoling do your words ſink on my heart! though my reaſon tells me your arguments are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and fallacious, yet it ſoothes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of my ſoul—I will try to live—perhaps I may again behold my dear—dear—dear huſband!" Here a flood of tears interrupted her.</p>
            <p>As this converſation was held in Engliſh, the ſavages were inquiſitive to know the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, at the ſame time enjoining them both never to utter a ſyllable in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, except in their own uncouth dialect, which, as they perfectly underſtood, they could not excuſe themſelves from. Henry then informed them that his ſiſter, objecting to their method of preparing food, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to prevail with them to indulge her in dreſſing her meals herſelf. This they readily granted, and farther to ingratiate themſelves in the priſoner's favour, they diſpatched a young Indian to hunt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges or quails in the groves adjoining them: He inſtantly returned with a brood
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031837_0034_0FEE9339BAC0E4C0"/>
of wood-pidgeons, ſcarcely fledged, which he preſented to Henry, who cleaned and broiled them on ſticks, with an officious ſolicitude to pleaſe his ſiſter, which ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with a look of gratitude, and taking a pigeon from the ſtick, began to eat more from complaiſance than inclination. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was delighted at her ready acquieſcence, and their repaſt being ended, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their tireſome journey with leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining than the preceding night. Maria was exempted from carrying a burden, yet ſhe found the fatigue almoſt intolerable. They continually paſſed through a ſcene of conflagration, the ſavages firing every cottage in their way, whoſe mournful blaze catching the dry fields of grain, would ſcorch off hundreds of acres in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and form a burning path for their deſtroyers. As the ſun advanced to his zenith, its rays beat fiercely on our travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, augmented by the crackling flames a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them; when meeting with a cool ſtream of water, Maria was commanded to ſit down (being over-heated) while the reſt approached the rivulet: the Indian that guarded Maria was ſtooping down to drink, when a loud ruſtling among the leaves and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031837_0035_0FEECDD78EF51230"/>
trampling of buſhes attracted his attention; he liſtened awhile ſeemingly much alarmed, then ſtarting up ſuddenly, he flew to Maria, and caught hold of her hair, aiming his hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet at her head: the conſequence was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and her fate ſeemed inevitable; yet, with a ſtoical compoſure, ſhe folded her arms acroſs, and waited the fatal ſtroke with perfect reſignation; but while the weapon was yet ſuſpended over her, chanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look around, he perceived the noiſe to proceed from a large deer, whoſe antlers were entangled in the branches of a thicket. Though an uncivilized inhabitant of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, he bluſhed at his precipitancy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the inſtrument of death to his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, after ſome heſitation made this apology: "Maria, this ſudden diſcovery is well for you; I thought we had been purſued, and we never ſuffer our priſoners to be re-tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; however, I was imprudent to attempt your life before there was a probability of your being reſcued:" then deſiring her to riſe and drink, he quickly ſhot the deer, his aſſociates helping him to ſkin it. Inſtead of quenching her thirſt ſhe ſat down pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive on the ſlowery margin, caſting her eyes careleſsly on the ſtream: ſhe knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031837_0036_0FEECD4F3760A6A8"/>
to eſteem her late deliverance from death a happy providence or protraction of miſery. Obſerving the ſpotted trout, and other fiſh, to dart ſportively acroſs the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe could not help exclaiming, "Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py! happy animals! you have not the fatal gift of reaſon to embitter your pleaſures; you cannot anticipate your difficulties by apprehenſion, or prolong them by recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; incapable of offending your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, the bleſſings of your exiſtence are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to you: Alas! I envy the meaneſt among ye!" A guſh of tears concluded her ſoliloquy; and being called to attend the company, ſhe aroſe, and they began their journey for the afternoon. Henry deſiring to have a piece of veniſon (having left it behind, ſeldom incommoding themſelves with more than the hide and tallow) they returned and obliged him with a haunch, which was very fat: at the next interval of travel he dreſſed it for himſelf and Maria. In the evening they croſſed the river ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what below <hi>Fort-Edward,</hi> in a canoe left hid under ſome buſhes for that purpoſe. They obſerved the moſt profound ſilence until they entered the woods again; but it was very late before they halted, which
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031837_0037_0FEECDF363FBE230"/>
they did in a deep hollow, ſurrounded by pines whoſe tops ſeemed to be loſt in the clouds. It was neceſſary here to light a fire, for the wolves howled moſt dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the whole foreſt rung with the cries of wild beaſts of various ſorts. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of hell could not have given Maria more diſmal ideas than her preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the horrid gloom of the place, the ſcowling looks of her murderous compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, the ſhrill ſhrieks of owls, the loud cries of the wolf, and mournful ſcreams of panthers, which were redoubled by diſtant echoes as the terrible ſounds ſeemed dying away, ſhook her frame with cold tremors— ſhe ſunk under the oppreſſion of terror, and almoſt fainted on Henry's arms; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, on perceiving the beaſts durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the light, but began to retire, ſhe became a little more aſſured, and helped Henry to erect a booth of pine branches, making a bed of the ſame materials in it while he prepared their ſupper: having ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and kindled a large fire in the front of her arbour, ſhe laid down and ſoon fell in a deep ſleep. She felt herſelf refreſhed by this unexpected repoſe, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſome alacrity, continued her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031837_0038_0FEECDA3C6A562B0"/>
hoping at laſt to arrive at ſome Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſettlement. Arriving at <hi>Lake-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,</hi> they raiſed a wigwam on the bank, expecting the coming of Indians from the oppoſite ſhore to carry them over.</p>
            <p>Here our unfortunate captives were ſtript of their habits, already rent to pieces by briers, and attired each with remnants of old blankets. In this new dreſs Mrs. Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ventured to expoſtulate with the ſavag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but it was talking to the ſtormy ocean; her complaints ſerved only to divert them; ſo retiring among the buſhes, ſhe adjuſted her coarſe dreſs ſomewhat decently, and then ſeating herſelf ſilently under a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tree, indulged herſelf in the luxury of ſorrow. Henry, ſenſible that they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more fortitude from him, and that if he ſunk under his adverſe fortune he ſhould be worſe treated, affected to be cheerful; he aſſiſted them in catching ſalmon, with which the lake abounds; an incredible quantity of wild fowl frequenting the lake alſo, he laid ſnares for thoſe of the leſſer ſort, (not being allowed fire-arms) and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo well, that his dexterity was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, and night coming on, they regaled themſelves on the fruits of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031837_0039_0FEECDF4E8DA05E8"/>
The night was exceedingly dark, but calm; a thick miſt hovered over the woods, and the ſmall ridgy waves ſoftly rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſhore, when ſuddenly a large me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor, or fiery exhalation, paſſed by them with ſurpriſing velocity, caſting on every ſide ſhowers of brilliant ſparkles. At ſight of this phaenomenon the Indians put their heads between their knees, crying out in a lamentable voice, "Do not! do not! do not!" continuing in the ſame attitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the vapour diſappeared. Henry, with ſome ſurpriſe demanded the reaſon of this exclamation; to which they replied, "What he had ſeen was a fiery dragon on his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to his den, who was of ſo malevolent a temper, that he never failed, on his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there, to inflict ſome peculiar calamity on mankind." In about five minutes after the earth was violently agitated, the waves of the lake tumbled about in a ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeeming to omit flaſhes of fire, all the while attended with moſt tremendous roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, intermixed with loud noiſes, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the exploſion of heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians perceived it was an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, they cried out, "Now he comes home!" and caſting themſelves in their
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031837_0040_0FEECD69A1162378"/>
former poſture, filled the air with diſmal howlings. This was a terrible ſcene to Maria, who had never been witneſs to ſo dreadful a convulſion of Nature before; ſhe ſtarted up and fled from her ſavage companions towards an eminence at ſome diſtance, where, dropping on her knees, ſhe emphatically implored the protection of Heaven: however, ſhe was followed by an Indian and Henry; the latter, highly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with her diſtreſſes, taking hold of her trembling hand, "But why, my ſiſter!" ſaid he, "have you fled from us? is the gloom of a foreſt more cheering than the ſympathiſing looks of a friend?" No, my brother!" replied Maria; "but the tho't was ſuggeſted to me, that the ſupreme God perhaps was preparing to avenge himſelf of theſe murderers by ſome awful and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgment, and I fled from them as Lot did from <hi>Sodom,</hi> leſt I might be involved in the puniſhment of their guilt." They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in Engliſh, which diſpleaſing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, he ordered them to return to the wigmam, threatening to bind Maria faſt if ſhe offered to elope again. The ſhock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, ſilence again ſpread through the realms of darkneſs, when a high wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031837_0041_0FEECDB160A2BC80"/>
from the north and chilled our half-naked travellers with exceſſive cold. The ſavages (whoſe callous ſkins were proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inclement weather) not caring to continue their fires, leſt they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and ſurpriſed by ſome Engliſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they paſſed here a very uncomfortable night; but the wind ſubſiding, and the ſky growing clear, the ſun roſe peculiarly warm and pleaſant, ſtreaming ten thouſand rays of gold acroſs the lake. Maria had ſcarcely performed her oraiſons, when the ſavages, forming a circle round her and Henry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dance in a moſt extravagant manner, and with antic geſtures that at another time would have afforded mirth to our travellers. Having continued their exerciſe ſome time, they incontinently drew out boxes of paint, and began to ornament their captives with a variety of colours; one having croſſed their faces with a ſtroke of vermilion, another would interſect it with a line of black, and ſo on until the whole company had given a ſpecimen of their ſkill or fancy.</p>
            <p>Soon after two canoes arrived, in which they paſſed over the lake, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly ſerene and pleaſant. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not far on their way before they
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031837_0042_0FEECDB2E80A0000"/>
were obliged to halt for two days, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Maria's inability to travel, her feet being greatly ſwoln and lacerated by the flinty path. At length, by eaſy ſtages, they came in view of an Indian ſettlement, when Maria's long unbent features relaxed into a half ſmile, and turning to Henry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Here my brother!" ſaid ſhe, "I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome of my own ſex, to whom <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Nature, no doubt, has taught humanity; this is the firſt precept ſhe inculcates in the female mind, and this they generally retain thro' life, in ſpite of every evil propenſity." As ſhe uttered this eulogium in favour of the fair, the tawny villagers, perceiving their approach, ruſhed promiſcuouſly from their huts with an execrable din, and ſell upon the weary captives with clubs and a ſhower of ſtones, accompanying their ſtrokes with the moſt virulent language; among the reſt an old deformed ſquaw, with the rage of a Tiſiphone, flew to Maria, aiming a pine-knot at her head, and would certainly have given the wretched mourner her quietus had ſhe not been oppoſed by the ſavage that guarded Mrs. Kittle: he at firſt mildly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with his paſſionate countrywo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but finding the old hag frantic, and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031837_0043_0FEECDB46D598EE0"/>
inſatiable of blood, he twiſted the pine-knot from her hand and whirled it away to ſome diſtance, then ſeizing her arm roughly and tripping up her heels, he laid her proſtrate, leaving her to howl and yell at leiſure, which ſhe performed without a prompter. —Maria was all in a tremor, and haſtily followed her deliverer, not caring to riſk another encounter with the exaſperated vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago. By this time the rage and tumult of the ſavages ſubſiding, the new-comers were admitted into a large wigwam, in the center of which blazed a fire. After they were ſeated, ſeveral young Indians entered with baſkets of green maize in the ear, which, having roaſted before the fire, they diſtributed among the company.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Kittle and her brother complaining of the bruiſes they met with at their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an old Indian ſeemed to attend with great concern; then leaving the place, in a little time returned with a bundle of aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic herbs under his arm, the juice of which he expreſſed by rubbing them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſtones with flat ſurfaces; this he gave them to drink, applying the leaves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. They inſtantly found relief from the medical quality of this extraordinary
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031837_0044_0FEECDBB08FFDD10"/>
plant, and compoſing themſelves to ſleep, expected a good night's repoſe; but they were miſtaken, for their entertainers grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intoxicated with ſpiritous liquors, which operating differently, it produced a moſt complicated noiſe of yelling, talking, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and quarrelling: this was a charm more powerful than the wand of Hermes to drive away ſleep: but grown familiar with ſorrow and diſappointment, Maria re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded this as a trifle, and when Henry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his concern for her, ſmiling, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "We muſt arm ourſelves with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, my brother! we can combat with fate in no other manner."</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to recapitulate minutely every diſtreſs that attended the priſoners in their tedious journey; let it ſuffice, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in paſſed through uncommon miſery, and imminent danger, they arrived at <hi>Montreal.</hi> —Here the ſavages were joined by ſeveral ſcalping parties of their tribe, and having previouſly freſh painted themſelves, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hideous pomp, and performed a kind of triumphal entry. The throng of people that came out to meet them, threw Maria in the moſt painful ſenſations of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but as the clamours and inſults of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031837_0045_0FEE930C85856FD8"/>
the populace increaſed, a freezing torpor ſucceeded, and bedewed her limbs with a cold ſweat—ſtrange chimeras danced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her ſight—the actings of her ſoul were ſuſpended—ſhe ſeemed to move mechanic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, nor recollected herſelf till ſhe found ſhe was ſeated in the Governor's hall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by an impertinent, inquiſitive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of people, who were inquiring into the cauſe of her diſorder, without attempting any thing towards her relief. Diſcovering her ſituation, ſhe bluſhingly withdrew to a dark corner from the public gaze, and could not help ſighing to herſelf, "Alas! but a very few days ago I was hailed as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of women—my fond huſband antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated all my deſires—my children ſmiled round me with filial delight—my very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants paid me the homage due to an angel —O my God! what a ſudden, what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable tranſition! I am fallen below con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt!" As ſhe thus moralized on her ſituation, an Engliſh woman (whom hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity more than curioſity had drawn to the place) approached Maria, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her tears and deep dejection, took hold of her hand, and endeavoured to ſmile; but the ſoft impulſes of nature were too
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031837_0046_0FEECDAA034BEAF8"/>
ſtrong for the efforts of diſſimulation—her features inſtantly ſaddened again, and ſhe burſt into tears, exclaiming, (with a heſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice,) "Poor, forlorn creature! where are thy friends! perhaps the dying moments of thy fond parent, or huſband, have been cruelly embittered with the ſight of thy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity! perhaps now thy helpleſs orphan is mourning for the breaſt which gave him nouriſhment! or thy plaintive little ones are wondering at the long abſence of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable mother!"—"Oh! no more! no more!" interrupted Maria; "your pity is ſeverer than ſavage cruelty—I could ſtand the ſhock of fortune with ſome degree of firmneſs, but your ſoft ſympathy opens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the wounds of my ſoul! my loſſes are beyond your conjecture—I have no parent, no ſportive children, and, I believe, no huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to mourn and wiſh for me!" Theſe words were ſucceeded by an affecting ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on both ſides: meanwhile the Indians teſtified their impatience to be admitted to the Governor by frequent ſhouts; at length his Excellency appeared, and having held a conference with the ſavages, they retired with his Secretary, and our priſoners ſaw them no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:031837_0047_0FEECDBC8EC937A0"/>After their exit the Governor turning round to Maria and Henry, demanded who they were? Mrs. Kittle's perplexity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her reply; but Henry, in a moſt reſpectful manner, gave him a ſuccinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their misfortunes. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or perceiving him ſenſible and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, interrogated him farther, but he modeſtly declined giving any political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. Obſerving that Maria ſuffered greatly in this interview, he ſoon conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, after having preſented ſeveral pieces of calicoes and ſtuffs to them, deſiring they would accept what they had occaſion for. Mrs. Kittle immediately ſingled out a piece of black calimanco with tears of gratitude to her benefactor; who, ſmiling, obſerved ſhe might chuſe a gayer colour, as he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſtreſſes were now over. Maria ſhook her head in token of diſſent, but could make no reply. He then diſmiſſed them, with a ſmall guard, who was directed to provide them with decent lodgings.</p>
            <p>Henry was accommodated at a baker's, while his ſiſter, to her no ſmall ſatisfaction, found herſelf placed at the Engliſh woman's who, on her arrival, had expreſſed ſo much good nature. She had ſcarcely entered,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031837_0048_0FEECDF66E96B260"/>
when Mrs. D—, preſenting her with a cordial, led her to a couch, inſiſting on her repoſing there a little, "for," ſays ſhe, "your waſte of ſpirits requires it."</p>
            <p>This tenderneſs, which Maria had long been a ſtranger to, relaxed every fibre of her heart: ſhe again melted into tears; but it was a guſh of grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that called a modeſt bluſh of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure and perplexity on Mrs. D—'s cheek. Being left alone, ſhe ſoon fell into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleep; and her friend having prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a comfortable repaſt, in leſs than an hour awaked her, with an invitation to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner—"And how do you find yourſelf, my ſiſter? ſaid ſhe inſtinctively, ſeizing Maria's hand and compreſſing it between her's; "may we hope that you will aſſiſt us in conquering your dejection?"—Maria ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed benignly through a chryſtal atmoſphere of tears, and kiſſing the hand of her friend, aroſe. Having dined, and being now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipped in decent apparel, Maria became the admiration and eſteem of the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The tempeſt of her ſoul ſubſided in a ſolemn calm; and though ſhe did not regain her vivacity, ſhe became agreeably converſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:031837_0049_0FEECDC381676000"/>In a few days, however, ſhe felt the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of an approaching fever. She was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at this, and intimating to Mrs. D— her fears of becoming troubleſome. "Do not be concerned," returned that kind crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; "my God did not plant humanity in my breaſt to remain there an inactive principle." Maria felt her oppreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by this generous ſentiment; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed found her friendſhip did not conſiſt in profeſſion, as ſhe inceſſantly tended her during her illneſs with inexpreſſible delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſolicitude. When ſhe was again on the recovery, Mrs. D— one day ordered a ſmall trunk covered with Morocco leath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be brought before her, and opening it, produced ſeveral ſets of fine linen, with ſome elegant ſtuffs and other neceſſaries.— "See, ſaid ſhe, "what the benevolence of <hi>Montreal</hi> has done for you. The ladies that beg your acceptance of theſe things, intend likewiſe to enhance the favour, by waiting on you this afternoon."—"Ah!" interrupted Maria, "I want them not; this one plain habit is enough to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of dreſs for me. Shut the cheſt, my dear Mrs. D—, and keep them as a ſmall compenſation for the immenſe trouble I have
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031837_0050_0FEECD60C8E55030"/>
been to you."—"If this is your real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent," replied her friend, (ſhutting the cheſt, and preſenting her the key) "return your gifts to the donors; and ſince you will reward me for my little offices of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, only love me, and believe me diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted, and I ſhall be overpaid."—"I ſee I have wronged your generoſity," anſwered Maria. "Pardon me my ſiſter, I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no more. I did not think you mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary—but—but—I meant only to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my heart of a little of its burden."— As this tender conteſt was painful to both parties, Mrs. D— riſing abruptly, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome buſineſs, promiſing to return again directly.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon Maria received her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants in a neat little parlour. She was dreſſed in a plain ſuit of mourning, and wore a ſmall muſlin cap, from which her hair fell in artleſs curls on her fine neck: her face was pale, though not emaciated, and her eyes ſtreamed a ſoft languor over her countenance, more bewitching than the ſprightlieſt glances of vivacity. As they entered, ſhe aroſe, and advancing, modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received their civilities, while Mrs. D— handed them to chairs: but hearing a well
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031837_0051_0FEECDFCF8196B70"/>
known voice, ſhe haſtily lifted up her eyes, and ſcreamed out in an accent of ſurpriſe, "Good Heaven, may I credit my ſenſes? My dear Mrs. Bratt, my kind neighbour, is it really you that I ſee?" Here ſhe found herſelf claſped in her friend's arms, who, after a long ſubſiding ſigh, broke into tears. The tumult of paſſion at length abating— "Could I have gueſſed, my Maria," ſaid ſhe, "that you was here, my viſit ſhould not have been deferred a moment after your arrival; but I have mourned with a ſiſter in affliction, (permit me to preſent her to you,) and while our hearts were wrung with each other's diſtreſs, alas! we inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after no foreign calamity." Being all ſeated, "I dare not," reſumed Maria, "aſk after your family; I am afraid you only have eſcaped to tell me of them."—"Not ſo, my ſiſter," cried Mrs. Bratt; "but if you can bear the recollection of your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, do oblige me with the recital." The ladies joined their entreaty, and Mrs. Kittle complied in a graceful manner.</p>
            <p>After ſome time ſpent in tears, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melancholy, tea was brought in; and towards ſun-ſet Mrs. D— invited the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to walk in the garden, which being
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031837_0052_0FEECD90AE589020"/>
very ſmall, conſiſted only of a parterre, at the farther end of which ſtood an arbour covered with a grape-vine. Here being ſeated, after ſome chat on indifferent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Maria denied Mrs. Bratt, (if agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the company) to acquaint her with the circumſtances of her capture. They all bowed approbation; and after ſome heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Mrs. Bratt began:—</p>
            <p>"My heart, ladies, ſhall ever retain a ſenſe of the happineſs I enjoyed in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Mrs. Kittle and ſeveral other ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons in the vicinage of <hi>Schochticook,</hi> where I reſided. She in particular cheered my lonely hours of widowhood, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing that ſhe thought might conduce to my ſerenity. I had two ſons; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the education of them to my leiſure hours. I accepted her advice, and found a ſuſpenſion of my ſorrows in the execution of my duty. They ſoon impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved beyond my capacity of teaching. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, my eldeſt, was paſſionately fond of books, which he ſtudied with intenſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This naturally attached him to a ſedentary life, and he became the conſtant inſtructive companion of my evening hours. My youngeſt ſon, Charles, was more vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031837_0053_0FEECE155CB3B7A0"/>
yet not leſs agreeable; his perſon was charming, his wit ſprightly and his addreſs elegant. They often importuned me, at the commencement of this war, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw to <hi>Albany;</hi> but, as I apprehended no danger, (the Britiſh troops being ſtationed above us, quite from <hi>Saratoga</hi> to the Lake) I ridiculed their fears.</p>
            <p>"One evening as my ſons were come in from reaping, and I was buſied in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a diſh of tea, we were ſurpriſed by a diſcharge of muſquetry near us. We all three ran to the door, and beheld a party of Indians not twenty paces from us. Struck with aſtoniſhment, we had no power to move; and the ſavages again firing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant my Charles dropped down dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide me. Good God! what were my emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! But language would fail, ſhould I attempt to deſcribe them. My ſurviving ſon then turning to me, with a countenance expreſſive of the deepeſt horror, urged me to fly. "Let us be gone this inſtant," ſaid he;
<q>another moment determines our ſate. O my mother! you are already loſt.</q>
But deſpair had ſwallowed up my fears; I fell ſhrieking on the body of my child, and rending away my hair, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031837_0054_0FEECDFE81D6AC30"/>
to recall him to life by unavailing laments. Richard, in the meanwhile had quitted me, and the moment after I beheld him mounted on horſeback, and ſtretching away to the city. The Indians fired a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley at him, but miſſed, and, I flatter myſelf that he arrived ſafe. And now, not all my prayers and tears could prevent the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from ſcalping my precious child. But when they rent me away from him, and dragged me from the houſe, my grief and rage burſt forth like a hurricane. I execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their whole race, and called for eternal vengeance to cruſh them to atoms. After a while I grew aſhamed of my impetuoſity: the tears began again to flow ſilently on my cheek; and, as I walked through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt between two Indians, my ſoul grew ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſick and groaned in me; a darkneſs, more ſubſtantial than Egyptian night, felt upon it, and my exiſtence became an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burden to me. I looked up to Heaven with a hopeleſs kind of awe, but I murmured no more at the diſpenſations of my God; and in this frame of ſullen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation I paſſed the reſt of my journey, which being nearly ſimilar to Mrs. Kittle's, I ſhall avoid the repetition of. And now
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031837_0055_0FEECDC6ECC28EA0"/>
permit me (ſaid ſhe, turning to the French ladies) to acknowledge your extreme good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me. I was a ſtranger, ſick and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and you took me in. You indeed have proved the good Samaritan to me, pouring oil and wine in my wounds."— "Huſh, huſh, (cried Madame De Roche,) you eſtimate our ſervices at too high a rate. I ſee you are no connoiſſeur in minds;— there is a great deal of honeſt hoſpitality in the world, though you have met with ſo little."</p>
            <p>"I now reject (interrupted Mrs. Bratt,) all prejudices of education. From my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy have I been taught that the French were a cruel perfidious enemy, but I have found them quite the reverſe."</p>
            <p>Madame De R. willing to change the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, accoſted the other ſtranger,—"Dear Mrs. Willis, ſhall we not be intereſted like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in your misfortunes?"—"Ah! do (added Madamoiſelle V.) my heart is now ſweetly tuned to melancholy. I love to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge theſe divine ſenſibilities, which your affecting hiſtories are ſo capable of inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."—Maria then took hold of Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis's hand, and preſſed her to oblige them. —Mrs. Willis bowed. She dropt a few
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031837_0056_0FEECDDF1DD469E0"/>
tears; but aſſuming a compoſed look, ſhe began:—</p>
            <p>"I am the daughter of a poor clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who being confined to his chamber by ſickneſs, for ſeveral years, amuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by educating me. At his death, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf friendleſs, and without money, I accepted the hand of a young man who had taken a leaſed farm in Penſylvania. He was very agreeable, and extravagantly fond of me. We lived happily for many years in a kind of frugal affluence. When the ſavages began to commit outrages on the frontier ſettlements, our neighbours, intimidated at their rapid approaches, erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſmall fort, ſurrounded by a high pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſade. Into this the more timorous drove their cattle at night; and one evening, as we were at ſupper, my huſband (being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on guard) inſiſted that I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him with the children (for I had two lovely girls, one turned of thirteen years, and another of ſix months.) My Sophia aſſented to the propoſal with joy.
<q>Mamma, (ſaid ſhe) what a merry woman the Captain's wife is; ſhe will divert us the whole evening, and ſhe is very fond of your company: come, I will take our
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031837_0057_0FEECDE0A288CE18"/>
little Charlotte on my arm, and papa will carry the lantern.</q>
I acceded with a nod; and already the dear charmer had handed me my hat and gloves, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body thundered at the door. We were ſilent as death, and inſtantly after plainly could diſtinguiſh the voices of ſavages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring together. Chilled as I was with fear, I flew to the cradle, and catching my infant, ran up into a loft. Sophia follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me all trembling, and panting for breath caſt herſelf in my boſom. Hearing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians enter, I looked through a crevice in the floor, and ſaw them, with menacing looks, ſeat themſelves round the table, and now and then addreſs themſelves to Mr. Willis, who, all pale and aſtoniſhed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtood nor had power to anſwer them. I obſerved they took a great pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in terrifying him, by flouriſhing their knives, and gaſhing the table with their hatchets. Alas! this ſight ſhot icicles to my ſoul; and, to increaſe my diſtreſs, my Sophia's little heart beat againſt my breaſt, with redoubled ſtrokes, at every word they uttered.</p>
            <p>"Having finiſhed their repaſt in a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous manner, they laid a fire-brand in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031837_0058_0FEECDD2F97430E0"/>
each corner of the chamber, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, driving poor Mr. Willis before them. The ſmoke ſoon incommoded us; but we dreaded our barbarous enemy more than the fire. At length, however, the flames beginning to invade our retreat, trembling and apprehenſive, we ventured down ſtairs; the whole houſe glowed now like a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; the flames rolled towards the ſtairs, which we haſtily deſcended; but juſt as I ſat my foot on the threſhold of the door, a piece of timber, nearly conſumed through, gave way, and fell on my left arm, which ſupported my infant, miſerably fracturing the bone. I inſtantly caught up my fallen lamb, and haſtened to overtake my Sophia. There was a large hollow tree contiguous to our houſe, with an aperture juſt large enough to admit ſo ſmall a woman as I am. Here we had often laughingly propoſed to hide our children, in caſe of a viſit from the olive coloured natives. In this we now took ſhelter; and being ſeated ſome time, my ſoul ſeemed to awake as it were from a viſion of horror: I lifted up my eyes, and beheld the cottage that lately circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed all my worldly wealth and delight, melting away before the devouring fire.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031837_0059_0FEECDD48313C7E0"/>
I dropt a tear as our apoſtate firſt parents did when thruſt out from <hi>Eden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"The world lay all before them, where to chuſe their place of reſt, and Providence their guide. Ah, Eve! thought I, hadſt thou been like me, ſolitary, maimed, and unprotected, thy ſituation had been deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable indeed. Then preſſing my babe to my heart,
<q>How quiet art thou, my angel, (ſaid I;) ſure—ſure, Heaven has ſtilled thy little plaints in mercy to us.</q>
—
<q>Ah! (ſobbed Sophia,) now I am comforted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that I hear my dear mamma's voice. I was afraid grief would have forever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of that happineſs.</q>
And here ſhe kiſſed my babe and me with vehemence. When her tranſports were moderated,—
<q>How cold my ſiſter is, (ſaid ſhe) do wrap her up warmer, mamma; poor thing, ſhe is not uſed to ſuch uncomfortable lodging.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"The pain of my arm now called for all my fortitude and attention; but I forbore to mention this afflicting circumſtance to my daughter.</p>
            <p>"The cheerful ſwallow now began to uſher in the dawn with melody; we timid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared to quit our hiding place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031837_0060_0FEECE09A42DCB88"/>
turning round to the light, I caſt an anxious eye of love on my innocent, wondering that ſhe ſlept ſo long. But oh! horror and miſery! I beheld her a pale, ſtiff corpſe in my arms; (ſuffer me to weep, ladies, at the cruel recollection.) It ſeems the piece of wood that diſabled me, had alſo cruſhed my Charlotte's tender ſkull, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hapleſs babe was quiet. I could no longer ſuſtain my ſorrowful burden, but falling proſtrate, almoſt inſenſible at the dreadful diſcovery, uttered nothing but groans. Sophia's little heart was too ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible for ſo moving a ſcene. Diſtracted between her concern for me, and her grief for the loſs of her dear ſiſter, ſhe caſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beſide me, and with the ſofteſt voice of ſorrow, bewailed the fate of her beloved Charlotte—her ſweet companion—her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, laughing play-fellow. At length we roſe, and Sophia, claſping all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of my cherub in her arms,
<q>Ah! (ſaid ſhe,) I did engage to carry you, my ſiſter, but little did I expect in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing manner.</q>
When we came in ſight of the fort, though I endeavoured to ſpirit up my grieved child, yet I found my ſprings of action begin to move heavily,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031837_0061_0FEECE00073828E8"/>
my heart fluttered, and I ſuddenly fainted away. Sophia, concluding I was dead, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſo piercing a cry, that the centinel looking up, immediately called to thoſe in the fort to aſſiſt us. When I recovered, I found myſelf in a bed encircled by my kind neighbours, who divided their expreſſions of love and condolement between me and my child. I remained in the fort after this; but, ladies, you may think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft as I was of ſo kind a huſband and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing child, I ſoon found myſelf ſolitary and deſtitute. I wept inceſſantly; and hearing nothing from my dear Willis, I at length reſolved to traverſe the wilds of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> in purſuit of him. When I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated this to my friends, they all ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed it; but finding me inflexible, they furniſhed me with ſome money and neceſſaries, and obtained a permiſſion from the Governor to let me go under protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of a flag that was on the way. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe that a cartel was drawn for an exchange of priſoners, I ſat out, fluſhed with hope, and with indefatigable induſtry and painful ſolicitude, arrived at <hi>Montreal,</hi> worn to a ſkeleton (as you ſee ladies) with fatigue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:031837_0062_0FEECE068792F700"/>"I omitted not to inquire of every offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, the names of priſoners who had been brought in. At length I underſtood that Mr. Willis had periſhed in jail, on his firſt arrival, of a dyſentery.—Here my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions terminated in deſpair. I had no money to return with, and indeed but for my Sophia no inclination—the whole world ſeemed dark and cheerleſs to me as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled region of Cimmeria, and I was nigh periſhing for very want, when Mrs. Bratt, hearing of my diſtreſs, ſought my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ſhe kindly participated my ſorrows, and too—too generouſly ſhared her purſe and bed with me. This, ladies, is the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a broken-hearted woman; nor ſhould I have intruded it in any other but the houſe of mourning."</p>
            <p>Here ſhe concluded, while the ladies ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally embracing her, expreſſed their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for the painful taſk ſhe had complied with to oblige their curioſity.— "Would to Heaven!" ſaid Madame De R. that the brutal nations were extinct, for never—never can the united humanity of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> compenſate for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelties of their ſavage allies."</p>
            <p>They were ſoon after ſummoned to an
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031837_0063_0FEECDBE13B0DCF0"/>
elegant collation; and having ſpent beſt part of the night together, the gueſts retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their reſpective homes.</p>
            <p>During two years, in which the French ladies continued their bounty and friendſhip to Mrs. Kittle, ſhe never could gain the leaſt intelligence of her huſband. Her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, after wandering through ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, would often return to her hands unopened. Deſpairing at length of ever ſeeing him, "Ah!" ſhe would ſay to Mrs. D—, "my poor huſband has undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſhed, perhaps in his fruitleſs ſearch after me, and I am left to be a long—long burden on your goodneſs, a very unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dependant."</p>
            <p>In her friend's abſence ſhe would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the kitchen, and ſubmit to the moſt menial offices; nor could the ſervants prevent her; however, they appriſed Mrs. D— of it, who ſeized an opportunity of detecting her at her labour. Being baffled in her humble attempt by the gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of her indulgent patroneſs, ſhe ſat down on the ſtep of the door, and began to weep. "I believe, good Mrs. D—," ſaid ſhe, "were you a hard taſk-maſter, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from theſe uſeleſs hands the moſt ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031837_0064_0FEECD624FA62638"/>
buſineſs, I could acquit myſelf with cheerfulneſs: my heart is like ice, that brightens and grows firmer by tempeſts, but cannot ſtand the warm rays of a kind ſun." Mrs. D— was beginning to anſwer, when hearing a tumult in the ſtreet, they both haſted to the door, and Maria, caſting her eyes careleſsly over the crowd, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant recognized the features of her long-lamented huſband, who ſprang towards her with an undeſcribable and involuntary rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but the tide of joy and ſurpriſe was too ſtrong for the delicacy of her frame: ſhe gave a faint exclamation, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out her arms to receive him, dropped ſenſeleſs at his feet. The ſucceſſion of his ideas was too rapid to admit deſcribing. He caught her up, and bearing her in the hall, laid his precious burden on a ſettee, kneeling beſide her in a ſpeechleſs agony of delight and concern. Meanwhile the ſpectators found themſelves wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected—the tender contagion ran from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to boſom—they wept aloud; and the houſe of joy ſeemed to be the houſe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. At length Maria opened her eyes and burſt into a violent fit of tears— Mr. Kittle, with anſwering emotions, ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031837_0065_0FEECE1742A08FC8"/>
accompanying her; then claſping his arms endearingly round her, "It is enough, my love," ſaid he, "we have had our night of affliction, and ſurely this bleſſed meeting is a preſage of a long day of future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; let me kiſs off thoſe tears, and ſhew by your ſmiles that I am indeed welcome." Maria then bending fondly forward to his boſom, replied, ſighing, "Alas! how can your beggared wife give you a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? ſhe cannot reſtore your prattling babes to your arms—ſhe comes alone! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! her preſence will only ſerve to remind you of the treaſures—the filial delights you have loſt!"—"God forbid," anſwered he, "that I ſhould repine at the loſs of my ſmaller comforts, when ſo capital a bleſſing as my beloved Maria is ſo wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to me." Here he was in civility o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to riſe and receive the compliments of Mrs. Bratt, Mrs. Willis, and Madame De R—, who, hearing of his arrival, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered juſt then, half breathleſs with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and joy. The company increaſed; an elegant dinner was prepared: in ſhort, the day was devoted to pleaſure; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſatisfaction more general—feſtivity glowed on every face, and complacency dimpled every cheek.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:031837_0066_0FEECDE228184840"/>After tea Maria withdrew in the garden, to give her beloved an account of what had befallen her during their ſeparation. The eloquence of ſorrow is irreſiſtible. Mr. Kittle wept, he groaned, while all impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned (with long interruptions of grief in her voice) ſhe ſtammered through her dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hiſtory; and yet ſhe felt a great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in pouring her complaints into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom whoſe feelings were in uniſon with her's —they wept—they ſmiled—they mourned, and rejoiced alternately, with an abrupt tranſition from one paſſion to another.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kittle, in return, informed her, that having thrown himſelf into the army, in hopes of ending a being that grew inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable under the reflection of paſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he tempted death in every action wherein he was engaged, and being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, gave him up to the blacked mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy. "This gloomy ſcene," he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, "would ſoon have been cloſed by ſome act of deſperation; but one evening, ſitting penſive in his tent, and attentively running over the circumſtances of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, a thought darted on his mind that poſſibly his brother Henry might be alive." This was the firſt time the idea of any one
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031837_0067_0FEECD568B4CF990"/>
of his family's ſurviving the general murder had preſented itſelf to him, and he caught at the flattering ſuggeſtion as a drowning wretch would at a plank. "Surely, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly," ſaid he, "my brother lives—it is ſome divine emanation lights up the thought in my ſoul—it carries conviction with it: I will go after him—it ſhall be the comfort and employment of my life to find out this dear brother—this laſt and only treaſure." Perſuaded of the reality of his fancy, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his deſign to a few of his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary friends; but they only laughed at his extravagance, and ſtrongly diſſuaded him from ſo wild an undertaking. Being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, he deſiſted; but ſhortly after, hearing that a company of priſoners (who were enfranchiſed) were returning to <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,</hi> he got permiſſion to accompany them. After a very fatiguing journey he arrived at <hi>Montreal,</hi> and was immediately introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the General Officer, who patiently heard his ſtory, and treated him with great clemency. Having obtained leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a few days in town, he reſpectfully withdrew, and turning down a ſtreet he inquired of a man who was walking before him, where lodgings were to be let? The
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031837_0068_0FEECD8AAF0B2EB0"/>
ſtranger turned about, civilly taking off his hat, when Mr. Kittle, ſtarting back, grew as pale as aſhes—"Oh, my God!" cried he, panting, "oh! Henry, is it you! is it indeed you! No, it cannot be." Here he was ready to fall; but Henry, with little leſs agitation, ſupported him; and a tavern being at hand, he led him in. The maſter of the hotel brought in wine, and they drank off many glaſſes to congratulate ſo happy a meeting. When their tranſports were abated, Henry ventured to tell him that his Maria was living and well. This was a weight of joy too ſtrong for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled powers—he ſtared wildly about.— At length, recovering himſelf, "Take care Henry," ſaid he, "this is too tender a point to trifle upon."—"My brother," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Henry, "be calm, let not your joy have a worſe effect than your grief—they both came ſudden, and it behoves a man and a chriſtian to ſhew as much fortitude under the one as the other."—"Alas! I am prepared for ſome woeful deception," cried Mr. Kittle; but, Henry, this ſuſpenſe is cruel."—"By the eternal God!" rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his brother, "your Maria, your wife, is in this town, and if you are compoſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031837_0069_0FEECE20C650A360"/>
you ſhall immediately ſee her."— Mr. Kittle could not ſpeak—he gave his hand to Henry, and while (like the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles friends) he believed not for joy, he was conducted to her arms, and found his bliſs wonderfully real.</p>
