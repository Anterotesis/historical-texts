            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE great Error that all Mankind are prone to, and which indeed ruins the larger Part of the World, is their placing their Happineſs in this Earth. The great Realities of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, ſtrike their Minds but weakly, and appear at a wide Diſtance, and a ſtrange Uncertainty to their unbelieving Hearts. But the Things preſent, and that are ſeen, the Objects that we converſe with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day, make a deep Impreſſion upon us. We fancy they are ſolid, and would fain believe they are laſting; nor do we care to detect their Falſhood and Treachery; their Vanity and Emptineſs. We have never been in the other World; and therefore we don't know how to reallize the Exiſtence of it: It appears to us a Novelty and a Dream. But the Earth we converſe with every
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004481_0004_100D540D8A9E1038"/>Day; we live upon it, and it is the conſtant Object of all our Senſes. We have been a long Time uſed to it; and the very firſt Impreſſions of our Infancy, have preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced us in its Favour. But the news of another World, comes to us by hear-ſay; and after we have been firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to this Earth, by our Sight and Familiarity. But above all, our Fall from GOD has brought a Cloud upon our Minds as to ſpiritual Matters, and rendered our Appetites after carnal Things raging and impetuous. We all need then the Addreſs of the Text, <hi>Set your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> They are the Words of an <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> they are then weighty and ſolemn: But they are the Words of the HOLY GHOST in the <hi>inſpired</hi> Apoſtle; they come then armed with divine Authority and Command, with the Power and Name of GOD. They are very plain and eaſy to be underſtood; and no Subtlety or Artifice can obſcure or elude the Evidence of the ſacred Law. They are agreeable to the Maxims of eternal Reaſon; and they are expreſſed in a very forcible and emphatical Manner. To render it beyond all Doubt or Heſitation, the Phraſe runs both Negative and Poſitive. <hi>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> All the Circumſtances tend to demand our moſt awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Attention, and ready Obedience.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE of the Words is this.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>It is the great Duty of Chriſtians, to withdraw their Affections from the Things of the Earth, and fix them on the Things of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling this Doctrine, need I go about to prove to you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the human Soul has in it many Affections?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This you feel in your ſelves; and your own Hearts, and your own Experience are beforehand with me.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004481_0005_100D53F12DD133C8"/>You are all conſcious to the Paſſions and Appetites of your own Minds. You know that you love and hate; deſire and abhor; rejoice and grieve, hope and fear. That you have ſuch Things as the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture and Philoſophy and common Life, call Affections, is a ſelf-evident Propoſition, and can need no Proof. To pretend a Demonſtration of it, would only be to obſcure it. I ſhall drop this then, and purſue another, alas! that it is ſo plain a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Our Affections are naturally ſet on the Things of Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need ſuch a Call as this of my Text, <hi>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> The Matter of Fact is plain in our ſelves, and has been ſo through all the Generations of Men, that this Earth ſtrangely allures and engroſſes our Affections. We feel in our Hearts a prevailing. Fondneſs to the Things we poſſeſs, and a prevailing Deſire to thoſe we expect. And we ſee the Caſe is the ſame with all about us, who are earneſt to get and to keep the vain Treaſures of the Earth: And it has been ſo from the firſt Ages even until now. All the Children of Men are born the Slaves of this World; and its Empire is univerſal and continuing, like that of Death. It has reigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Men from <hi>Adam</hi> even until now. If the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact is ſo plain then, what are the Reaſons? How comes it to paſs that our Affections are ſo linked to earthly and mortal Things? Alas, it is eaſily and ſadly accounted for. Our Fall from GOD has corrupted our Taſte, and blinded our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and brought us into this deluded and bewildered Condition. <hi>Adam,</hi> our firſt Father, ſat his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Things below; and now the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD has left us his Offſpring to do ſo too. He was led away by his Senſes to forget the Things which were above, and diſbelieve and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004481_0006_100D540F14A71048"/>his GOD. The forbidden Tree allured his <hi>Sight,</hi> and appeared <hi>fair to look upon:</hi> It tempted his <hi>Palate;</hi> and appeared <hi>good for Food:</hi> It excited his <hi>Deſire,</hi> and raiſed his <hi>Ambition: A Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe:</hi> So he <hi>took the Fruit of it, and did eat.</hi> Gen. iii. 6. Thus were our firſt Parents led away, and ever ſince then, the guilty Progeny have been cheated by their Senſes to place their Affection on earthly Things. The holy GOD immediately withdrew the Reſtraints of his SPIRIT, and gave up the Race to follow the Senſes which they choſe to follow. And now, the Fetters are made ſtrong upon many Accounts.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance, Earthly Things are the <hi>firſt</hi> we converſe with; and as they are beforehand with our Reaſon, they inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themſelves into our Affections, before we are aware of their Treachery and Falſhood. The Child learns to gratify his Senſes before he comes to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Reaſon; and the firſt Impreſſion is the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and laſts the longeſt. His firſt Acquaintance is with earthly Things; and therefore his Affections are placed upon them, before Reaſon can ſet a Guard upon his Mind.</p>
            <p>And as we converſe <hi>firſt</hi> with earthly Things, ſo we do it <hi>conſtantly;</hi> and this is another Reaſon why our Affections are fixed upon them. Earthly Things are ſenſible Things, and familiar to our Eyes every Day: And conſtant Familiarity begets Love. 'Tis a ſufficient Reaſon how we come to prefer the Things of Earth, before Things above: Becauſe Things temporal are ſeen, but Things eternal are inviſible. Things unſeen, are the Objects of our Faith; but the Things of this World, are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Sight and Senſe. Faith is the Evidence of Things not ſeen; the Subſtance of Things hoped for. But the Things below ſtrike us more immediately; they bribe our Senſes, and captivate our Souls. Hence
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004481_0007_100D53F349B3D748"/>'tis that we ſeek the Things which are below, and not the Things which are above. And need the Warning and Exhortation of the Text; <hi>Set your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very Expreſſion of the Text inſinuates the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of our Minds to earthly Things, and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to tranſfer them to heavenly. 'Tis becauſe one is <hi>below,</hi> the other <hi>above.</hi> 'Tis like panting up Hill, or ſliding gently down. The Things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are <hi>above,</hi> and we riſe to them with Pains and Labour; but the Things on Earth are about us, and beneath us, and we may ſit ſtill, or ſink down and enjoy them. So that in every Light the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appears evident, that our Affections are naturally ſet on Things below, and not on Things above.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>'Tis our Duty to ſet our Affection on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis our Duty for ſo has the Command of GOD made it. The Will of GOD is the Rule of our Duty. Whatever he enjoins immediately becomes our Duty. 'Tis enough to enforce our Obedience and Compliance, that GOD has given his Orders, and declared this to be his Will. A Thing may on other Accounts be our Wiſdom, and our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, our Honour and Safety, but 'tis the Command of GOD alone that can make it our Duty.</p>
            <p>And beſure this is the Caſe here: For GOD has commanded it at our Hands, that we ſet our Affections on the Things above, and not on the Things below. This is the great Deſign of the Law of God, to take our Affections off from Earth, and draw them up to Heaven. In the New-Teſtament this Matter is more fully explained, and more frequently and more ſtrongly inculcated. Here we are inſtructed, I. John ii. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Love not the World, neither the Things that are in the World; if any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him. For</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004481_0008_100D30B7C5A868F8"/>
               <hi>all that is in the World, the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World. And the World paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, and the Luſt thereof; but he that doeth the Will of GOD abideth for ever.</hi> 'Tis the Will of GOD then, that we ſet not our Affections on the Things of the World; and 'tis then our Duty not to do it. Rom. xii. 2. <hi>Be not conformed to this World; but be ye tranſformed by the renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and perfect Will of GOD.</hi> It is impoſſible to obey GOD; to comply with the Will of GOD, without proclaiming War with the World; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weaning our Affections and withdrawing our Friendſhip from it. James iv. 4. <hi>Know ye not that the Friendſhip of the World is enmity with GOD? Whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World is an Enemy of GOD.</hi> Thus the New-Teſtament, which has more fully brought Life and Immortality to Light, is, you ſee, full of the Matter.</p>
            <p>But the Old-Teſtament is not without ſufficient Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this too; and tends to lead our Affections from the Things of Earth to thoſe of Heaven. Indeed the Promiſes of the Old-Teſtament, do for the moſt part refer literally to the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> But they were ultimately regarded by the wiſe and good Men of thoſe Days, to ſignify the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the heavenly World. Hence the believing ancient Patriarchs, all along profeſſed that they were but <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims here,</hi> that they <hi>ſought a better Country, that is, an heavenly.</hi> They looked upon the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but as a Type of the heavenly; and applied the Promiſes in the Letter temporal, to Things ſpiritual and eternal. And this is the Spirit that breathes in the pious Patriarchs till the coming of their bleſſed SAVIOUR, whom they all regarded and lived upon in the Proſpects of Faith. They all believed a future World; a State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and eternal Rewards: And they withdrew their Affections from the Things below, and placed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004481_0009_100D53F58924E588"/>them on thoſe greater above. Is not this the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he <hi>choſe rather to ſuffer Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the People of GOD, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon?</hi> Is not this the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Job,</hi> when <hi>I know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth, and though after may Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee GOD?</hi> Is not this the Inſinuation of the Pſalmiſt, when he ſpeaks of the <hi>Men of this World, who have their Portion</hi> only <hi>in this Life:</hi> And what elſe could comfort him when he <hi>walk'd through the Valley of the Shadow of Death,</hi> but that he knew for him <hi>to die would be Gain.</hi> Even <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf, when he came to have his Eyes open, could wiſh to <hi>die the Death of the Righteous,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the <hi>Day of his Death was better than the Day of his Birth.</hi> So that upon the whole, all the ſacred Pages repreſent this bleſſed Truth to us, that there is a Reality in the Things above; that GOD therefore calls us to ſet our Affections on thoſe Things, and not on Things on the Earth: And that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this has been the Practice of good Men in all Ages, who have ſo underſtood the Duty and ſo perform'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> This does not forbid us <hi>having</hi> an Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Things below; but indulging an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affection. We may have an Affection for earthly Things, but we muſt not <hi>ſet</hi> them, muſt not <hi>ſix</hi> them upon theſe Things; muſt not ſet our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> not <hi>all</hi> of them as ONE; not <hi>wholly</hi> upon earthly Things. We may <hi>deſire</hi> worldly Good; but not too vehemently; but it muſt be with profound Submiſſion. We may love and be glad of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings; but it muſt be a ſubordinate Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt ſet looſe by them, and be willing to part with them. We muſt ſet a much <hi>higher</hi> Value upon the Things <hi>above;</hi> and look upon <hi>them</hi> to be by far better. This is the State of the Caſe: You may <hi>have</hi> an Affection for the good Things in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004481_0010_100D5413EC5891D0"/>the World but you muſt no <hi>ſet</hi> your Affection on theſe lower Things, but on Things above.</p>
            <p>It were high Ingratitude in us, to have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at all for the good Things which a bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous GOD, on this Earth gives us. 'Tis he that beſtows on us, our Riches, and our Relatives; our Health, and our Life; and it were Diſreſpect to the Giver to diſreliſh the Gifts. So an abſent Friend ſends us Tokens of his Friendſhip, by which we ſhould remember him: As it would be ſtrange that thoſe Marks of Affection ſhould be lov'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our Friend to the Prejudice of our Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him, ſo it would be baſe and ungrateful not to eſteem the Tokens and remember our Friend by them. Let us reliſh the Creature for GOD's Sake then, and there will be no Danger of an inordinate Affection.</p>
            <p>Some have made ſtrange Work with a Paſſage in the New-Teſtament, where our SAVIOUR tells the young Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Sell all thou haſt and give it unto the Poor,</hi> as though this were a Command that reached unto every Chriſtian, and a Rule to hold univerſally as a Criterion to try our Love to the World by. 'Tis a Wonder ſuch Genius's for Expoſition have not commented on that Paſſage in the Old-Teſtament, where <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and demonſtrated that a Man could not be a true Believer who did not deſtroy his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for Burnt-Offerings; for the Ground for both is pretty near the ſame. In one Caſe and the other, GOD gave a particular Command to try the Truth of Grace in the Heart of a particular Perſon, and all the Difference was, one ſtood the Trial, as every good Man would, and the other ſunk under it, as would be the Caſe of every Hypocrite. And had the young Man in the Goſpel with the ſincere unrelucting Heart of <hi>Abraham,</hi> given up his Poſſeſſions, no one can ſay how far they might have been given back again to him, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004481_0011_100D53F7120E5468"/>as <hi>Job</hi>'s Eſtate was doubled. However that may be, all we can infer from both the Stories is this, That if GOD does really call for all our outward good Things, a good Man ſo loves his GOD, that he would make a ready Surrender of them: And not that he is now oblig'd either to ſlay his Son, or give away all his Eſtate. It is plain this cannot be the Meaning in the latter Caſe, becauſe it is a Duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be perform'd: For how could every Man ſell all his Eſtate and give it to the Poor? Where would be the Poor to receive it! 'Twould indeed ſerve to level all Mankind, deſtroy all Order, and break up the Community: As though we ſhould contrive that the Body natural ſhould be all Hand, or all Eye: And then where were the Hearing and the Taſte?</p>
            <p>And yet, after all, nothing is more certain than this Truth, that the Man who has ever felt what a Work of Grace upon the Soul means, loves his GOD and his SAVIOUR beyond any Creature. And if he does not ſell all he has and give it to the Poor, 'tis purely becauſe he knows it would not pleaſe GOD; and if he ſacrifices not his only Son, 'tis purely becauſe GOD requires it not, but forbids it.</p>
            <p>But would you know whither this be the real Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of your Actions, and not the governing Love of the Idol-Creature, the beſt Way of diſcovering the Matter, will be, not to try your ſelves in Inſtances, where, as GOD has not commanded, ſo has no where promis'd to aſſiſt you: But to examine, do you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reluctance comply where his Commands are plain. 'Twas that young Man's Duty to ſell all. He cou'd not do it: 'Tis plain he was not a ſanctified Man. 'Twas <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Duty to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac:</hi> He ſet about it immediately: 'Tis plain he was truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Neither of theſe are Commands to you. So that if you are not aſſiſted to do Things which are not your Duty, you have no need of Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Reluctance. The Rule is, Do you do
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004481_0012_100D5416112A0718"/>what is your Duty? Do you chearfully give GOD his Dues out of your Eſtates? Do you give up this Part of your Gains with a peculiar Pleaſure, and far from any Regret? If you have the Teſtimony of your Conſciences here, you may be ſure that as your future Days ſo your Strength ſhall be. And your whole Eſtate, or your only Son you ſhall be enabled to part with, if ever GOD really demands them. GOD will either keep you from the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or make Way for your Eſcape, —All our Projections about future Tryals proceed from our vain Confidence as though our Strength was our own. — Take no Thought for the morrow, but do the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Day, and that is all GOD requires.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly explain'd and evinc'd the Duty to you; and I come now to improve and apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be exhorted, my beloved brethren, to ſet your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>CHRIST is above.</hi> Is not this a ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why you ſhould place your Affection there. Who is worthy of all your Love but he? The Creatures you are ſo fond of, were made by him, and derive all that is lovely in them from him. And if from his Fulneſs they have all received all their Graces, how ſuperiour muſt his Fulneſs be? Beſure then, if we are apt to ſet our Affections on Things below, we have infinitely higher Reaſon to ſet them on Things above; for CHRIST is there in his more abundant Glory. And ſo ſays the Apoſtle, in the preceeding Context, <hi>Seek thoſe Things which are above, where</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſitteth on the right Hand of GOD.</hi> CHRIST is above; and the right Hand of GOD is above; is not this then a Place worthy your Deſire and Choice? <hi>At his right Hand are Pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004481_0013_100D53F9B47C66C0"/>
2. Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth: <hi>For ye are dead, ſays</hi> the Context: Ye are dead? What a Shock does it give to our Security in earthly Enjoyments? We ſet our Affections on Things below: Alas! we muſt preſently be ſummon'd by Death to leave them all. So certain is it that we muſt die away from them, that it may be pronounced, we are already dead. Death <hi>has</hi> paſſed upon all Men, in that all have ſinned. In the <hi>Day</hi> thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely die. It proved true, becauſe in that <hi>ſame Day</hi> the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence took Place, and we became liable to Death: Dead in Law. Ye are dead then. 'Tis as certain you muſt be ſo, as if you were already dead. Set not then your Affection on the Things below. <hi>When GOD requires your Soul, whoſe ſhall all theſe Things be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſure this is not the principal Intention of the Text, when it ſays, <hi>Ye are dead,</hi> therefore ſet your Affection on the Things above, not on Things on the Earth. Ye are dead: that is, the corrupt Principle in you is dead. The reigning Power of your Luſts is dead; your inordinate Paſſions and Appetites are mortified and dead. You are dead to this World. By the Croſs of CHRIST the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World. And now why ſhould you revive the Dead Affections, and ſet them on Things below? Having eſcaped the Pollution of the World through Luſt, why ſhould you be again taken and entangled therein? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how the World treated your bleſſed SAVIOUR, and let the Croſs of CHRIST crucify the World to you. Let the Remembrance of his Sufferings wean you from the execrable Place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſays the Text, <hi>Your Life is hid with CHRIST in GOD.</hi> Is CHRIST your Life; the vital Principle of Thought and Action in you? Beſure we ſhould have our Hearts and Affections where our Life is. Where ſhould Life be, but it the Heart? the Seat of the Affections? Now
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004481_0014_100D54179CBCCBD8"/>CHRIST our Life is above, on the Throne, and in the Boſom of GOD. Our Affections ſhould be there too then: Our Life is hid with CHRIST in GOD. Your Life is hid indeed; but this Way you may diſcover it to others, by your Indifference to the Things of this World, and your Ardor to thoſe of another. Your Life is <hi>hid;</hi> laid up out of Sight. But O realize it; Look for a future Life. Remember <hi>this is not your Reſt,</hi> why then ſhould ſhould you terminate your Affection here?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Motive in the Context, is, <hi>If ye then be riſen with CHRIST, ſet your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> If we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to live among ſuch Objects and Enjoyments, it were more excuſable ſhould they ſeize our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but when we expect ſo different a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-State, what Madneſs is it, to circumſcribe our Acquaintance in ſuch narrow Limits? We are made for the Reſurrection-World, widely different from the preſent Scene of Things; why then ſhould we learn to love thoſe ſhort-liv'd Objects, and neglect the future and eternal ones? CHRIST is riſen: No Truth is more capable of Proof than this. And we are riſen with CHRIST, we ſhall as ſurely riſe, as if we were already riſen. <hi>For if the Dead riſe not, then is not CHRIST raiſed.</hi> — we are riſen in Type, in Earneſt and Pledge. 'Tis Folly then, 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Folly, to ſet our Affections on the World of Death, when we are made for the quite different Reſurrection-World. Nay, but further, <hi>Ye are riſen with CHRIST:</hi> It ſignifies a ſpiritual Reſurrection. A Reſurrection from a Death in Sin, and a Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Life of Holineſs. Here now is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>If ye then be riſen with CHRIST, ſet your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> If you have experienced this bleſſed Reſurrection with CHRIST; if you have been renewed, and brought into the Life of GOD, Oh feed the divine Life, and cheriſh it; by no Means ſtifle it by an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004481_0015_100D53FBD93293A8"/>Affection to the groſſer Things below. This Principle of Life in you, like a Flame, tends <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi> You ſmother it when you ſet your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Things below. 'Tis worſe in you to do ſo than for others: For the natural Man cannot diſcern to do at all otherwiſe. It is better not to have known and felt the Power of the Truth, than after that to diſobey it, and love the Things contrary to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another Motive in the Context is, <hi>when</hi> CHRIST <hi>who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in Glory; mortify therefore your Members, which are upon the Earth. Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</hi> The ſecond Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of CHRIST, and the Rewards which he will then beſtow on his Faithful, are a ſufficient Reaſon why we ſhould ſet our Affections and Expectations on Things future and above. CHRIST will appear the ſecond Time: Behold he comes, and his Reward is with him. He will give the Crown of Righteouſneſs in that Day. Wherefore, <hi>forgetting the Things which are behind,</hi> and calling our Affections back from them, <hi>let us reach forth to thoſe Things which are before, and preſs towards the Mark for</hi> this <hi>Prize.</hi> The <hi>Account</hi> we are to give <hi>to</hi> CHRIST our Judge, this methinks is a moſt awakening Motive to ſet looſe by the Things of this World, and ſet our Affection on the Things above. The <hi>Glory</hi> that we ſhall receive <hi>from</hi> CHRIST our Judge, this methinks ſhould raiſe our Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and attract our Deſires and fix our Affections; for when CHRIST who is our Life, ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in Glory. My Brethren, are we not ambitious of this Honour? Do we not long for this Glory? Is it not enough to call up and fire all our Affections? Are the Things below worthy to be Rivals here? Are they, think you, worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed? Think on the Appearance of CHRIST; on the Glory of CHRIST; and that you ſhall appear with him in Glory; and ſee if this has not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004481_0016_100D5419473E2040"/>Charm to draw your Affection from the Things below, and ſet them on Things above. If this will not do, conſider,</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Wrath of GOD cometh on the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> So ſays the Context very emphatically: Ver. 6. If your Affections are let looſe upon the Things below, they will lead you on to all exceſs of Uncleanneſs, for which Things ſake the Wrath of GOD cometh on the Children of Diſobedience. And is not here fair Warning againſt inordinate Affection? The Wrath of GOD, is it, do you ſuppoſe, a light Matter? Can you eaſily bear it? Dare you confront it with an intreped Air? Can you reſiſt, or can you eſcape? Nay, be not deceived, GOD is not mocked: It is indeed a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living GOD. Can thy Heart endure, or can thy Hands be ſtrong in the Day when he ſhall riſe up in his Vengeance and Flame! And this will be the amazing Danger, and this the ſwift Deſtruction that ſhall pour upon the Head of thoſe, who ſeek earthly Things and neglect heavenly. The Things on the Earth are dying Creatures; and thoſe who ſet their Affection on them, go down to the Dead: What wonder then, that they ſhould be gathered with the Congregation of the dead? GOD commands you to ſet your Affection on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth; You diſobey GOD, and you ſet up Creatures in the Throne of GOD, when you let your Love looſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Him. And will not this juſtly provoke GOD? For this Cauſe the Wrath of GOD cometh on the Children of Diſobedience.—Thus far I have confin'd my ſelf only to the Motives of the Apoſtle in the Context.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And to conclude, Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth: <hi>For the Things on Earth are temporal, but the Things above are eternal.</hi> This is the great and finiſhing Stroke of all: And though this Motive is not expreſſed in the Context,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004481_0017_100D53FDEE5B4F40"/>yet it is implied in it, and urged in innumerable other Places. The Things in this World are fading, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory and periſhing. Why ſhould we ſet our Eyes then, upon that which is not; or preſently will not be. Look upon the Things you are ſo fond of, in this Light, and ſee how worthleſs they are of your warm Affection. You have an Affection to <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Plenty;</hi> you look with Joy upon your large Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and let your Wiſhes looſe for more. Alas, <hi>Riches take themſelves Wings, and flee away as the Eagles towards Heaven.</hi> You have an Affection to the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Senſe and of Sin,</hi> and are very loath to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your Deſire and Choice. Alas, <hi>the Pleaſures of Sin are but for a Seaſon.</hi> You are fond of <hi>worldly Fame and Honour,</hi> and pant after Dignities and a great Name. Alas, <hi>Man being in Honour abideth not.</hi> You feel a glowing Affection to your <hi>Relatives,</hi> and your Heart beats with the Ardors of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> Alas, <hi>Lover and Friend muſt for ſake you, and your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> retire <hi>into Darkneſs.</hi> You deſire <hi>long Life,</hi> and love many Days that you may ſee Good. Alas, <hi>If by reaſon of Strength you ſhould reach fourſcore Years, yet, —'tis ſoon cut off, and we flee away.</hi> Thus you ſee how very temporary, how vaniſhing and tranſient are all Things here below! But now ſet your Affection on the Things above, and they will laſt boundleſs as your Wiſhes, and immortal as your Souls. The <hi>Riches</hi> there, are <hi>durable Riches.</hi> The <hi>Pleaſures</hi> are <hi>Pleaſures forevermore.</hi> The <hi>Honours</hi> are, <hi>Salvation by</hi> CHRIST <hi>with eternal Glory.</hi> The <hi>Inheritance</hi> is <hi>incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and fadeth not away.</hi> The <hi>Companions die no more: Death is ſwallowed up in Victory; there ſhall be no more Death:</hi> And ſo ſhall we all be <hi>forever with the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Rewards</hi> are an <hi>everlaſting Crown,</hi> and <hi>Life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, who would not try to ſet their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth? Who would not take Pains for the new Nature, that he might do this? Though you go through Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004481_0018_100D541C0E54AF98"/>and Labour in this great Work, and meet with many Oppoſitions, Temptations and Afflictions in it, yet remember and take Encouragement from that Word of GOD, which I leave with you, and conclude, II. Cor. iv. 17, 18. <hi>For our light Affliction which is but for a Moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory; while we look not at the Things which are ſeen, but at the Things which are not ſeen; for the Things which are ſeen, are temporal, but the Things, which are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi>
