            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE object of the preſent is merely to requeſt as the moſt particular favor you can confer on me, the moſt ſpeedy ſettlement of your accounts with the Royal Marine. Mr. Swanwick has repeatedly informed me that they are drawn out ready for your examination, and that nothing is wanting but your inſpection of the ſame and your ſignature: pray, oblige me ſo far as to deſpatch them.</p>
               <p>Permit me alſo to reiterate to you, Sir, my requeſt, reſpecting my accounts as Agent of the Royal Marine with the United States, and which it is my earneſt deſire as duty to get ſettled; my endeavours to attain this point have hitherto been fruitleſs, and in the mean while, I am daily held up as a public defaulter, a character too odious to be ſupported by any man of principle or feeling. Let me intreat you to renew your inſtructions to the public officers, ſo as every poſſible deſpatch may be given.</p>

I muſt have them, ſo as the vouchers may be ſubmitted to his Excellency, without delay: the neceſſity of the caſe, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, my intereſt and fortune are too deeply concerned, not to claim every exertion on your part. I requeſt you will honour me with an anſwer, and inform me when I ſhall poſitively receive ſaid accounts and vouchers. You muſt excuſe the earneſtneſs of my application, and I truſt you'll raze every poſſible obſtacle in the way. One thing more I muſt add, that without your accounts, I cannot proceed a ſingle ſtep further: my clerks are at full ſtop, and we are waiting till ſuch time we are enabled to proceed.</p>

               <p>AFTER what has paſſed in writing and converſation betwixt us, it is with very great reluctance I ſit down, to write you on the ſubject of my private and public accounts; but as you told me repeatedly yeſterday, that you wiſhed I ſhould indicate, in the firſt place, a mode of rendering the ſaid accounts, and, in the ſecond place, that I ſhould write you on the ſubject of depreciation, I ſhall now endeavour to expreſs my ideas on theſe two points, and, I hope, to your ſatisfaction and conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:044903_0004_101F4EF65F85F628"/>I want not that you ſhould, in any inſtance, depart from the uſual, exact, mercantile mode or manner in rendering my public or private accounts. In abiding by the rules laid down for the ſame, you will ſtate preciſely the day on which you have received or paid any <hi>money for me,</hi> either on behalf of the Royal Marine, or for my perſonal account with you. I doubt not that you'll admit this to be neceſſary in all accounts whatever, both in ſpecie and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental money; but much more ſo for the latter, and for the following reaſons:</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, without the preciſe date of the time when each tranſaction took place is ſpecified in the account, it would not be a true ſtatement or account thereof. Secondly, Without the preciſe date, no value can be fixed on the apparent ſum paid or received.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, if you will pleaſe to proceed to the examination of ſuch of your accounts, as have come to my knowledge, you'll clearly remark the neceſſity of altering and correcting them.</p>
               <p>I have already wrote you, and repeatedly told you of the abſolute neceſſity of ſeparating both the public and private tranſactions, which are perſonal to me, from thoſe which regard yourſelf. This is indiſpenſable, in order that each of us may be reſponſible for his own operations.</p>
               <p>In the public accounts, was I to ſettle finally with you on them, in the form they were firſt propoſed, I ſhould ultimately become reſponſible for your operations, and you for mine—this cannot be.</p>
               <p>In the private accounts, your tranſactions being blended with mine, the concerns of various other individuals being alſo blended with mine and yours, it is impoſſible to know from the dates that appear on them, what is the right of each individual, or to judge what is juſt to allow them, to you, or to me. One of the private accounts as propoſed, I ſuppoſe not rendered, much leſs ſettled betwixt us, bears no ſignature, no date for the balance that is apparent; tho' it is for a ſum not leſs than 551,514 pounds. The credit is compoſed of twenty-two articles, the debit of thirty-one, and notwithſtanding, there are only five dates on the debit, not one on the credit; tho' all the ſums are in continental ſpecie. This certainly cannot be an account on which a ſettlement can have been intended by you. However that may be, it would be folly indeed on my part, to admit it as it now ſtands, without the vouchers and accounts, on which it is grounded, will juſtify the preſent ſtatement of the tranſactions it relates to.</p>
               <p>Reſpecting the ſubject of depreciation, I know not why you deſired I ſhould write you on it; much leſs
<q>why you ſhould firſt have offered to me, to certify in writing, that you could not and would not grant any depreciation on your public accounts; nor, why you ſhould have argued yeſterday, that becauſe the King had made great ſavings, by the operations of the Royal Marine <hi>under my directions,</hi> you are not to account <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>me</hi> on his behalf, and make good depreciation, if any loſs has enſued: The propoſition you made to me, verbally, in anſwer to my letter of the 16th, and the argument you repeatedly urged to me yeſterday.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This propoſition, you well know, is of ſuch a nature, as cannot be accepted of by me; nor can you, on ſerious reflexion, indulge the thought one moment.</p>
               <p>As to the great ſavings made to the King by my operations in Boſton, ſurely they are not thoſe you ſeriouſly alluded to, in order to give them as reaſons, for not adjuſting your accounts on a proper footing, and making good all depreciation, in every caſe where it may be juſtly due. Thoſe operations are perſonal to me alone, and the King, thro' his ſecretaries of ſtate, was duly informed thereof. If the ſavings made thereon are now to be given up, by the mode of adjuſting and intermixing accounts, I ſhall perſonally loſe the merit of my own tranſactions, and the King be deprived of that ſhare of thoſe advantages to which my attention and induſtry has given him the faireſt title. Theſe reaſons, I am confident, are ſufficient to ground my earneſt requeſt, that my tranſactions in Boſton,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:044903_0005_101F4EF842387758"/>
be not any ways, or any longer, blended or connected in account with yours. I have too much reaſon to fear that the ſtatements thereof, intermixed with your accounts, might occaſion ſome erroneous inductions; which, I am certain, you never meant ſhould take place.</p>
               <p>The ſavings made for the King, by your operations, will beſt appear from the accounts, when they will ſtand alone, unconnected with any others; when they will be ſtated at the preciſe dates of receipt and payments, and not at the dates when the entries were made in your books. Let the advantages, gained thereon, be placed againſt the loſſes, ſuffered by depreciation; this is fair and juſt; this is all you certainly can mean or pretend to; and this needs no previous determination.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now add much on my private affairs, and the ſtatements that have been propoſed thereon; but, I muſt ſay, that I will not admit them, even for examination, without the tranſactions, perſonal to you, are clearly diſtinct from mine. Let them be joined to the vouchers belonging to them, and alſo with the accounts on which they are grounded, for my inſpection, and then I ſhall ſee and know what I may have further to ſay on them.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the reſult of your accounts with me, when your tranſactions for others, and mine with and for others, are ſeparated from your accounts with me, is immaterial at preſent. But it is of the utmoſt importance, to your honor and mine, that the ſettlement of accounts, which has been totally laid aſide for much too long a period, ſhould at leaſt now be finally adjuſted and ſettled betwixt us, without any further delay, for any poſſible reaſon. Without this, neither you nor I can receive or render that juſtice due to each of us, nor to thoſe, whoſe concerns have been entruſted to our good faith, care and management.</p>
               <p>As the vouchers, in ſupport of my perſonal tranſactions in Boſton, can be no longer of any uſe to you, as they are of the utmoſt conſequence, and neceſſary to the progreſs of my public accounts, I requeſt you'll be ſo kind as to ſend 'em to me, by a ſafe hand, ſo ſoon as you can conveniently collect them: and at the ſame time the original accounts of Thomas Ruſſell, Jon. Williams, and John Rowe, of Boſton, with me, and all others which may relate to my private or perſonal accounts and tranſactions; ſo as I may proceed to ſettle them by myſelf. I will return a regular diſcharge or receipt for the whole, if you deem it proper or neceſſary.</p>
               <p>You ſhewed me yeſterday in your hand a ſtatement, which you ſaid you had juſt then been making, in order to value the ſavings made on my Boſton tranſactions; which you found to amount to a very high ſum, indeed. But permit me to aſk you, Why all this unneceſſary trouble? Is it on my account? Surely you do not mean to claim for yourſelf thoſe ſavings? In order to eſtabliſh your right thereto, I have this morning, for the very firſt time, examined how your accounts, with me, did ſtand at that period. I arrived here, from Boſton, on the 24th day of December, 1778; I have, therefore, ſtated your private and public accounts with me, ſeparately, on the 31ſt day of December of that year. Their inſpection will elucidate whether or not the individuals, whoſe money and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty I had at my diſpoſal in Boſton, and the King, have or have not a juſt and indiſputable right to the ſavings I there made. I ſhall renounce all claims to theſe great ſavings, on their behalf, if you'll pleaſe to ſhow the ſmalleſt ſhadow or appearance of right to them.</p>
               <p>I earneſtly entreat you to weigh the above obſervations in your mind, and that you'll permit me to conclude by renewing to you the aſſurance of the ſincere attachment, with which I ſhall not ceaſe to remain,</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>BY your letter of this day, you aſk me this plain queſtion:
<q>Did you not deſire me, when I firſt agreed to aſſiſt you, to comprehend all the accounts of the Royal Marine, under your direction, in my accounts; without regarding whether the buſineſs had been performed by you or by me, or by your or my orders?</q>
I ſhall make you immediately as plain an anſwer.</p>
               <p>When you firſt agreed to aſſiſt me, I could not poſſibly have deſired you, to comprehend all accounts of the Royal Marine, under my direction, in your accounts; without regarding, whether the buſineſs had been performed by you or me, or by your or my orders. I ſay, it could not poſſibly be; becauſe, when you firſt agreed to act as my agent, no one operation had taken place, no one operation or buſineſs had been performed, either by you or me.</p>
               <p>I might make ſome further obſervations on this queſtion; but I will not enter into uſeleſs diſſertations or diſcuſſions.</p>
               <p>You muſt certainly mean to render me ſubſtantial juſtice; you muſt mean to render it to the King, and to all who have entruſted you with their concerns. My intentions are perfectly ſimilar to yours, and I do not mean any thing elſe, than to obtain it ſpeedily from you; as well as to render it alſo to you, in all poſſible caſes. On this ground let your accounts perſonal be ſtated ſeparately from thoſe perſonal to me, in the uſual, regular, mercantile mode or manner; ſo as they may be clearly underſtood, and our reſpective intereſts and concerns as eaſily eſtabliſhed: and we ſhall undoubtedly part hereafter on the ſame footing we have hitherto lived.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, I muſt repeat to you, that my Boſton tranſactions ſhall not be blended with yours. I affirm that I never intended, much leſs agreed to or conſented, that they ſhould be rendered by you at any one period. I never permitted they ſhould be anyways blended with your accounts; but in that very incomplete ſtatement of the then ſituation of the affairs, committed to my care, during Monſieur Gerard's reſidence here, which it was proper to let him have, for his information, before his departure for France.</p>
               <p>When I carried you the papers and notes I had made and drawn up in Boſton, on my return from thence, in December 1778, I pray'd you to oblige me ſo far, as to draw up an account of my tranſactions there, ſeparate and diſtinct from all others; to ſtate them in a ſeparate book or paper, and to keep the vouchers till I ſhould want or call for them: telling you, I ſhould think them ſafer in your hands than in mine, and that your ſtatement of my tranſactions, in a regular form, would, on a future day, aſſiſt my memory in redacting and rendering my accounts. This, Sir, you complied with; and, in conſequence thereof, you drew 'em up in one ſet of ſheets, which you gave me, ſome time afterwards, to keep for my direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:044903_0007_101F4EFCE34849A0"/>I have ſince then obſerved, that this account is thus entitled:
<q>Debtor, JOHN HOLKER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in Boſton, acc<hi rend="sup">t</hi> curr<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> with ROBERT MORRIS, Creditor.</q>
By this ſuperſcription it would almoſt appear, that I was accomptable to you, and not you to me; but I am convinced you do not think me quite ſo great a fool, as to have ever eſtabliſhed you Agent General over myſelf: however, I overlooked the ſuperſcription and thought it was merely a method or form adopted, in order to eſtabliſh a regular account, that might ſerve for my future inſtruction at a later day.</p>
               <p>You'll pleaſe to obſerve, that the tranſactions therein related are either perſonal to me, or to the Chev. De Borda, Major of that fleet which the Count D'Eſtaing commanded. This obſervation, you muſt recollect, I made you, and gave it as a ſpecial reaſon for ſtating them diſtinctly from your other accounts, and for giving me up the papers, on which they were to be ſtated and redacted; you ſtill retaining the vouchers and my notes, for their and mine ultimate and additional ſafety.</p>
               <p>At the period, when M. Gerard mentioned his reſolution of returning to France, I then told you of the propriety of ſhewing him an account of the expenditures of the Royal Marine. You obſerved, in reply, that the buſineſs was only in train, and that it was utterly impoſſible that anything, like an exact account, could be produced: that, among other agents, M. Smith of Baltimore, in particular, had rendered none; tho' very heavy advances had been made him by you. I agreed, therefore, to the propoſition you then made, that a ſtatement ſhould be redacted of ſuch tranſactions only, as could then be ſupported by vouchers in your poſſeſſion. You obſerved, you would alſo make out a ſeparate account of my Boſton tranſactions, and that you would include the ſame therein. This laſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going part of this ſtory, is as near truth as I can remember. This ſaid account was afterwards inſerted in your public account; and, by one particular line or article, in conformity to the real and true ſpirit of my intentions, when you undertook to draw up for me the little book I have before mentioned. When this ſeparate account was drawn up, or about being drawn up, you told me that you had a great deal of trouble in redacting theſe accounts for me; that you had paid or received my bills drawn from Boſton on you, or in your favour; and, that a commiſſion, of two and a half per cent. would not be more than adequate for your time and trouble. You added, that I ought to pretend to as much, in order to defray my travelling expences, &amp;c. &amp;c. I did agree to allow a commiſſion of two and a half per cent. and, in conſequence of this imprudent conſent, it was ſo paſt and introduced in that form (tho' it is a very incomplete ſtatement of my Boſton tranſactions) among your other accounts. But, Sir, rather than this commiſſion ſhould any longer retard the redaction and ſettlement of my accounts, I agree that you ſhall paſs in your accounts a ſum equivalent to 5 per cent. on the amount of that particular account, which you ſo properly blended with your own, tho' I have repeatedly declared to you, and moſt ſeriouſly, that I will not partake of any copper thereof, nor of any other commiſſion whatever; and tho' I ſhall certainly credit the Chev. De Borda for two and a half per cent. on the ſaid amount, in favour of the King, becauſe I am ſenſible of the impropriety of my conſent to your propoſition; and, becauſe it is juſt, I ſhould not only refund the King, but alſo, if neceſſary and you ſhould inſiſt on it, ſuffer for the indelicacy of the tranſaction, ſo far as it regards me.</p>
               <p>All the above circumſtances muſt be preſent to your mind; you'll likewiſe recollect that immediately after you had agreed to be my agent in Philadelphia and alſo to aſſiſt me with your good advice, I entreated you three different times, to open a new ſet of books for all the tranſactions of the Royal Marine, in order to keep the accounts ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtinct from all others, and in order that I might have a daily recourſe to them, or produce them, to whom it might concern. If ever I thought it proper or neceſſary. This fact I ſtated fully to you the laſt time I ſaw you, and you told me you remembered it well; and, likewiſe the anſwer you made me at the time; which was, that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044903_0008_101F4F00E3E335C8"/>
it would be ſomewhat inconvenient and unneceſſary; becauſe you would hold yourſelf conſtantly ready to give me the accounts, when I ſhould want them, or any information I ſhould chuſe thereon.</p>
               <p>When I laſt ſaw you at your office, you ſhew'd me a number of papers relative, ſaid you, to the accounts of the Royal Marine, which would undoubtedly remove all my groundleſs and injurious ſuſpicions and prove that you had employed every dollar, or nearly every dollar, (I don't recollect poſitively the exact expreſſion) which you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the King's account. You muſt remember how forcibly I was ſtruck, on remarking the great number of tranſactions therein apparently ſtated; I told you that I had never ſeen them or heard of them, till you mentioned ſome ſuch an account in your laſt viſit to me; but, alſo, that I had forbid Mr. Turnbull repeatedly from blending his accounts with yours. You anſwered, that Mr. Turnbull, by whoſe actions I was naturally bound, being my agent, had received them, or copies of them, ſome time after you had declined my public buſineſs; that Mr. Swanwick had delivered them to him, himſelf, by your order, after your peruſal and examination of theſe ſaid accounts, and that I ſhould ſtill find them in Mr. Turnbull's poſſeſſion, in whoſe hands they had certainly remained ever ſince that time: all this you muſt well recollect, ſince it happened betwixt us the day before laſt. Now, Sir, on enquiry I find, that Mr. Turnbull did receive ſome ſuch papers; they were delivered to him by Mr. Swanwick, and retaken by him from Mr. Turnbull, one or two days afterwards. It may be eſſential, in order to remove all difficulties betwixt us, that I ſhould immediately ſee thoſe papers; I therefore requeſt you'll either entruſt me with the original draft, or with the copy preſented by Mr. Swanwick, who will be beſt able to give full information reſpecting them and this part of the buſineſs, ſince he was the redacter thereof. However this may be, why did not you communicate theſe accounts to me at that time, and why, after Mr. Swanwick retook them, have not all my accounts been ſettled for theſe three years paſt? Why have you not ſent me your accounts with Mr. Smith, in order to aſſiſt my operations and the examination of his accounts, when you knew that I had a perſon employed in Baltimore to ſettle them with him, &amp;c. &amp;c.? You muſt ſee that I can make queſtions alſo; but it is unneceſſary to anſwer them, wihout you chuſe it; for all I want is my public and perſonal accounts, and ſuch other papers which are ſo neceſſary to me, and which I claimed from you in my letter of yeſterday.</p>
               <p>It is not my deſire to elude any further preparatory queſtions from you; but, I muſt obſerve to you, that a long correſpondence will only occaſion delays in rendering and ſettling finally accounts betwixt us, which it is ſo incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on you and me to have done with.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU will receive with this letter, a ſtate of my accounts with you, both in your public and private capacity; together with ſuch obſervations as may ſerve to explain them fully, and if farther explanations ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, I will readily go into them. After a due examination of all theſe accounts, you will be able to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you was authoriſed to ſuppoſe that a deſire to withold a balance from you has influenced me to delay the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In your letter of the 24th of laſt month you aſk
<q>why have not all my accounts been ſettled for theſe three years paſt?</q>
To this queſtion I am now about to reply, without noticing what is ſaid on the ſame ſubject in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044903_0009_101F4F03A0097E08"/>
your previous letter of the 23d, or your ſubſequent letters of the 27th of laſt month, and of the 8th and 13th inſt. You will remember, Sir, that you introduced yourſelf to my acquaintance in the beginning of July, 1778, and preſſed me to undertake the tranſaction of your affairs. The conſideration held out to me was, that very great ſums of money would naturally come to my hands, and might be occaſionally employed in uſeful ſpeculations <hi>on our joint account,</hi> and that the commiſſion <hi>(alſo to be divided between us)</hi> would be very conſiderable. You will remember that I declined your propoſals (though urged upon me for ſeveral days) telling you that my private affairs called for my whole attention, that my public occupations for ſome time had prevented the ſettlement of old and important ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and that I ſhould not, without injury to myſelf and others, engage in new purſuits. You may remember, alſo, that you urged it as a kind of obligation, to take care of the intereſts of a King, who was in the act of affording ſuch generous aſſiſtance to my country, and called on me, if I would not act myſelf, to point out ſome perſon for whom I would be reſponſible. At length you drew from me <hi>my reluctant conſent</hi>; and whatever elſe may happen, I have at leaſt the pleaſure to reflect that the truſt repoſed in me, was faithfully executed, until it was delivered over in the ſpring of the year 1780, to the houſe of W. Turnbull and Comp.</p>
               <p>As you was not only agent for your ſovereign, but alſo for many individuals trading to this country, or ſpeculating in our public funds, the concerns which I engaged in for you, were both numerous and important. On ſome a commiſſion was charged, and on others it was not; but <hi>in every commiſſion you was by agreement to ſhare one half.</hi> For the proof of this I will, out of many other materials, ſelect only for the preſent, what is ſaid in your letter of the twenty-fourth of laſt month, and your letter of the nineteenth inſtant, explaining away the groundleſs aſſertion it contains as a miſtake. I muſt, however, obſerve, that the only objection you made to the half commiſſion, when Mr. Swanwick delivered you the account thereof, was, as to its value; and to me you never declared againſt taking it, until a converſation we had in the office of Finance in November or December laſt. You repeated the refuſal at your own houſe the 22d of laſt month, and the next day at my houſe: and then reminded me, in your letter of the 24th of laſt month, how frequently you had declared againſt taking this commiſſion. To me it is immateria whether you take it or not. I agreed to divide all commiſſions charged on the affairs tranſacted for you, both on account of the Royal Marine and on account of individuals; and have therefore rendered that account with the others, and credited you for the half which belongs to you. By the liſt of accounts annexed to this letter it will appear, that before the month of June, 1780, forty-one different accounts were delivered by me to you, and our tranſactions cloſed as far as the actual ſituation of things could well admit of. In the autumn of that year a ſettlement of your accounts was attempted, but it could not be effected; becauſe neither you nor I could obtain ſeveral of the neceſſary materials. I have many of your notes and other documents on this ſubject, but what you ſay in yours of the 25th of January, 1781, is ſufficient:
<q>I cannot obtain, notwithſtanding the moſt earneſt and repeated applications to the treaſury, the valuation of the proviſions furniſhed to the Royal Marine, by the Continental Commiſſaries, in the run of 1779. I intreat you to put on the ſame the preſent current value thereof, ſo as to cloſe and tranſmit your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with all poſſible convenient ſpeed. I ſhall hereafter ſettle the juſt valuation myſelf with the commiſſaries, and will underſtand with you thereon perſonally, if any difference ſhould ariſe.</q>
I muſt obſerve (in this place) that I do not like to render ſuch accounts, and ſtill leſs to come to a ſettlement <hi>in appearance,</hi> when the real ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains behind. It was not before the middle of May, 1781, that I obtained the account of Ephraim Blaine, one of the Continental Commiſſaries, and therefore I could not before that period have ſettled with you. But why did I not then make the ſettlement? I had then accepted the office I now hold, and was (in conſequence) obliged
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:044903_0010_101F4F0551A95108"/>
to refer all my former affairs to the direction of others. But if you had urged a ſettlement, even when I was moſt engaged, with half that ſolicitude and impetuoſity which you now have put en, I would have taken hours from my ſleep rather than have expoſed myſelf to the charges and ſuſpicions (which I have only diſcovered of late were in your mind) although in the event they will appear to be totally unfounded. As to what you ſay of the Chevalier de la Luzerne's application on the ſubject of your public accounts in his letter of the 4th October laſt, I will leave your own heart to make the comment. It is ſufficient for me to obſerve, that if you aſked this application with the view of urging me (perſonally) to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſettlement, you ought to have aſked it, when that gentleman firſt preſſed you on the part of his court. But you knew full well my willingneſs to ſettle with you at any moment, if it were poſſible to ſpare the time from my public avocations. Mr. Swanwick whom I had empowered to ſettle theſe as well as other of my accounts, laboured with you from time to time in the buſineſs, my books and papers were always open to you, and at your requeſt, on the ſixth of March laſt, he delivered to Mr. Betheder a number of rough ſtatements of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, ſome formerly made by me, others by himſelf, together with all the vouchers and alſo the account ſettled the 31ſt Auguſt 1779, in preſence of Monſr. Gerard. Theſe were detained until ſome time in November or December laſt, when you ſent a bundle or two of papers containing a part of them to my houſe.</p>
               <p>About that time you mentioned to me in my office, that I was indebted 169,000 <hi>Livres</hi> to the Royal Marine, and gave me to underſtand that you collected your information from Mr. Turnbull; you know my ſurpriſe on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I told you, it was impoſſible; but that as ſoon as Mr. Governeur Morris returned from New-york, and ſome immediate buſineſs of the office was diſpatched, I would attend to the ſettlement of thoſe accounts. On the 14th of January I received your letter, preſſing for a ſettlement; on the fifteenth I ſet about it, and (for the firſt time) opened the bundles of papers you had ſent to my houſe. To my very great ſurpriſe, I found that the rough drafts of my accounts were detained, and imperfect copies ſent, and that very improper remarks were made on thoſe accounts. In my letter of the 15th I aſked the original accounts, and, in anſwer to it, you mention a deſire that they ſhould now be rendered in a new form; which, by the remarks made by the perſon you had employed on my accounts, was done, I find, at his inſtigation. This requeſt I ſhall preſently have occaſion to take notice of; however on receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe originals, I was aſtoniſhed to find various ſcratches, notes and obliterations had been made in them (even in that which was ſigned by Monſr. Gerard and yourſelf). On the 22d day of January ('till which time you could not ſee me) I called on you and complained of this extraordinary conduct, which you could not defend. You then let me know (for the firſt time) your claim of depreciation; which you at the ſame time acknowledged you had never thought of 'till lately. I told you, I would never allow it. And in reply to your queſtion, "what will the King's miniſter ſay" I told you, I did not care, and offered to give a certificate under my hand, that I would not pay it. I requeſted you to come to my houſe the next day, that you might be convinced from my books how much you had injured me by ſuppoſing, I was in debt to the Royal Marine, and entertaining (as I had lately perceived you did) ſuſpicions unworthy both of you and me. You came and I opened my books to you, and begun an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of thoſe articles of my accounts againſt which objections had been made by the perſon you had employed to make obſervations on them; the firſt article we took up was Col. Mitchell's account, and finding all the objections to that account were unfounded, you grew tired of this mode of refutation, and ſeemed deſirous to get rid of it. I told you that I could with the ſame eaſe ſhew the folly and abſurdity of all the other objections; I then ſhewed you the rough draft of an account current with Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. which brought my accounts with the Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine to a cloſe, by transferring the balances to my accounts with that houſe, which had been done by your order. This ſeemed to alarm you, and you declated <hi>you had never ſeen that account.</hi> We had a good deal of converſation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:044903_0011_101F4F089E34C9C0"/>
which cloſed with my deſire that you would ſend the form in which you choſe to have your accounts rendered, and aſſign in writing the reaſons on which you aſked for depreciation. The objects of this requeſt were that (if poſſible) I might reduce the accounts to the required form, and that if you ſhould (on reflection) riſque the demand of depreciation, I might have an opportunity once for all to conteſt it. Before I quit the above mentioned converſation, it is proper to add, that in conſequence of what you then ſaid, and of what is contained in your letter of thy twenty fourth of January, I have enquired more particularly into the ſtate of facts, and I find that Mr. Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick delivered the account in queſtion to your ſaid agents Wm. Turnbull and Co. that it remained with them ſome months, that he received it back to correct the omiſſion of one or two trifling charges which were on their books againſt me, that he did not return it becauſe Mſſrs. Turnbull and Co. had entered it on their books, that they have delivered to Mr. Swanwick two ſtatements of accounts conformable to it, that Mr. Swanwick informed you he had delivered this account to Mr. Turnbull, that you applied for it to him, and (Mr. Turnbull tells me) that you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was furniſhed with a copy of it. This ſtate of facts which can be ſupported by the evidence of Mr. Swanwick and Mr. Turnbull—you may (if you pleaſe) contraſt with the declarations you have made in writing, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. On the twenty ſeventh of January Mr. Cottringer called on my part for ſome of thoſe vouchers delivered by Mr. Swanwick to Mr. Betbeder, but you not being at home he called again next day, <hi>and the vouchers confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially entruſted were refuſed.</hi> The foregoing true hiſtory contains the reaſons why your accounts have not yet been finally ſettled, and prepares the way for another point which of late you have much laboured.</p>
               <p>In your letter of the 23d of January laſt you tell me
<q>I will not admit the private accounts <hi>even for examination</hi> without the tranſactions perſonal to you are clearly diſtinct from mine.</q>
How does this agree with the aſſertion contained in your ſame letter?
<q>It is of the utmoſt importance <hi>to your honor and mine,</hi> that the ſettlement of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which has been totally laid aſide <hi>for much too long a period</hi> ſhould at leaſt now be finally adjuſted and ſettled betwixt us <hi>without any further delay for any poſſible reaſon.</hi>
                  </q>
I muſt leave you, Sir, to reconcile theſe and other things which do not conſiſt too well together, but <hi>I ſeriouſly aſſure you that I will not render my accounts in any other form than that in which they are now ſent.</hi> My reaſons are theſe: Firſt, theſe accounts agree with my books which can be ſupported by proper evidence; 2ly, if I rendered them in any other form, they might be invalidated by contraſting them with thoſe already in your poſſeſſion; 3ly, although I was very deſirous of indulging your wiſh on this occaſion, yet I cannot now do it, for the confidence I repoſed in you is gone; 4ly, the accounts, as rendered, contain that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial juſtice you ſpeak of, and therefore it is not neceſſary to change the form on that account. You may from the accounts in their preſent form make juſt ſuch ſtatements as you ſhall think proper, and if on comparing them, I find no eſſential difference, <hi>I will give a proper certificate thereof</hi>; but more I will not do.</p>
               <p>In your letter of the 23d January you obſerve, that the King, through his Secretaries of State, was duly informed of your operations in Boſton; that, by the mode of adjuſting and intermingling accounts, you ſhall perſonally loſe the merit of your own tranſactions, and that the ſavings made for the King, by my operations, will beſt appear from the accounts when they will ſtand alone. Whether the informations you gave to the King were well or ill founded, it is not my buſineſs to enquire; whether the ſtate of facts will or will not do you honor, I am no longer ſolicitous; but I hope they may. As to myſelf, I claim from the King neither thanks, nor honors, nor rewards. I ſhall never give myſelf a moment's concern, whether he gained or loſt in thoſe tranſactions, which I performed by your order; I owed him no duty, he had confided to me no truſt, nor conferred on me any authority; <hi>if he had, I would have executed his truſt with fidelity</hi>; you are reſponſible to him and may render ſuch accounts as you think proper; mine with you, I ſend with this letter. In your ſame letter of the twenty-third of January, you dwell on the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044903_0012_101F4F0C73240698"/>
and ſay:
<q>I am convinced you do not think me quite ſo great a fool, as to have eſtabliſhed you Agent General over myſelf.</q>
To <hi>all</hi> this my anſwer is very ſimple: you are, I ſuppoſe, anſwerable to the King; but whether you are or not, is none of my affair. As to the buſineſs I performed for you, I muſt anſwer it to you, and I do this by ſhewing a compliance to your orders. Robert Morris accounts to the Agent of the Royal Marine; John Holker, Daniel Bell, John Rowe and others, tranſact buſineſs on account of the Royal Marine in Boſton; the Agent General makes thoſe Gentlemen accountable to Robert Morris, by placing the accounts of thoſe tranſactions in his hands, for the expreſs purpoſe of introducing their accounts into his, ſo that the Agent General may have the whole in one view in the accounts of Robert Morris, and for the purpoſe of juſtifying the charge of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereon, one half of which is to be drawn by the Agent General, by agreement, and the other half by Robert Morris. If the accounts of thoſe Gentlemen do not pleaſe you, I care not; for I did not employ them, and inſerted their accounts in mine by your order. In my letter of the twenty-fourth of January I aſked this queſtion: "Whether you did not deſire me to comprehend all the accounts of the Royal Marine in my accounts?" It would have ſaved time at leaſt if you had anſwered plainly in the affirmative. The fact was, that the account of your Boſton tranſactions, as well as all other of theſe accounts, was inſerted in mine by your order, <hi>that the whole might appear in one point of view, and a commiſſion be charged on the whole.</hi> You have ſtated this matter ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, in your letter of the ſixteenth of January, ſpeaking of the vouchers to that Boſton account, you ſay,
<q>which you were ſo obliging as to take charge of, in order that they might be recorded for my ſafety, in the firſt draught of my public accounts.</q>
In your letter of the twenty-third of January, you ſay,
<q>My Boſton tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions ſhall never be blended with yours; I affirm, that I <hi>never</hi> intended, <hi>much leſs agreed or conſented,</hi> that they ſhould be <hi>rendered</hi> by you.</q>
And in your letter of the twenty-fourth of January, you ſay,
<q>When I carried you the papers and notes I had made and drawn up in Boſton, I prayed you to <hi>draw up</hi> an account of my tranſactions there, ſeparate and diſtinct from all others, to ſtate them in a ſeparate book or paper, and <hi>to keep the vouchers till I ſhould want or call for them</hi>; telling you, I ſhould think them ſafer in your hands than in mine.</q>
In that ſame letter you mention other things, relative to a commiſſion on thoſe tranſactions, in which your memory ſerved you ſo badly, that your letter of the nineteenth inſtant has been written to correct one error. Your relation of this matter would ſeem to turn on this point: <hi>That you conceived your papers to be ſafer in my cuſtody than in your own.</hi> But how is this poſſible? You admit, that it was agreed, a commiſſion ſhould be charged by me on this tranſaction. How could that be, without bringing the whole into my accounts? You ſay that theſe tranſactions were to be recorded in your firſt public accounts. In the firſt accounts <hi>ſettled</hi> you admit the amount of them was carried out in one line, agreeably to the original intention. Now, Sir, I have in my poſſeſſion a ſtate of thoſe tranſactions, as rendered by me for ſettlement, and joined thereto, is written, not only Mr. Gerard's certificate that he had compared it, &amp;c. &amp;c. but the following words ſigned by you, "<hi>vu, verifié &amp; approuvé par nous à Philadelphie,</hi> 9 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1779." After doing this how can you at this hour pretend, that <hi>you never intended much leſs agreed to or conſented</hi> that theſe accounts ſhould be rendered by me? But this is not all: ſeveral of your tranſactions in Boſton were included in and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in ſupport of an account entitled
<q>John Holker, Eſqr; Agent of the Royal Marine of France in account cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with Robert Morris of Philadelphia on account of ſaid Marine</q>
To make out this account you yourſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with your own minutes with John Rowe's accounts, Daniel Bell's, the Continental Navy Board's, Miller and Tracey's, Nathaniel Rugles's, Jon. Williams's, Thomas Ruſſell's and the Board of War's at Boſton: And you yourſelf was preſent, not only at the adjuſtment of this account before Monſr. Gerard, but alſo when the entries were made by me in my books, <hi>and you have ſigned the account.</hi> I do acknowledge that <hi>you propoſed my opening a ſet
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044903_0013_101F4F0F20DB9348"/>
of books</hi> for the buſineſs of the Royal Marine, but upon my objecting that a multiplicity of books were apt to create confuſion and ſubjected accountants to a greater chance of error, you acquieſced in the introduction of thoſe as well as the private affairs entruſted to your management, into my books, and after that acquieſcence, objections made now to anſwer your own purpoſes, can have no weight, <hi>eſpecially</hi> as the accounts, I render, are juſt, fair and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. To theſe convincing evidences of <hi>your agreement and conſent,</hi> I can add alſo <hi>your directions.</hi> I have in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion a liſt of bills drawn by you at Boſton for the uſe of the Royal marine, to which is added <hi>by you</hi> the following note, "<hi>Mr. Holker begs the proper entries may be made</hi>". In a letter from you of the 7th of January 1779, you aſk,
<q>When will Mr. Robert Morris be at liberty to work with Mr. Holker on account of the expenditures of the fleet, <hi>his negociations,</hi> and at Boſton.</q>
You wrote to me on the firſt of Auguſt 1779, as follows,
<q>Mr. Holker pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents his compliments to Mr. Morris, reflecting on Mr. Chaumont's proteſting the bills, he makes the following requeſts: That his account may be finally drawn out and ſent to him, that a proper liſt of loan-office certificates, proceeding from the bills drawn on Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, payable at the houſe of Mr. Peltier, may be finally drawn up and tranſmitted, after having been certified by me par quadruplicates, ſo as he may diſpoſe of part or the whole thereof. That an account of the money paid into Mr. Bell's hands, by Mr. Jonathan Williams, for the account of Mr. Chaumont, may be made out, and the price of exchange, then current, mentioned; ſo as to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe me to ſend notes of the payment to the Miniſter, to pay the value thereof to Mr. Chaumont on account of the affairs of the Royal Marine, to determine the Miniſter to honor my bills, to facilitate Chaumont's affairs, to give ſome ſatisfaction, to enſure my own credit and conſequence, &amp;c. &amp;c. I ſhould want ſeven half joes, which I ſhall reimplace here on the firſt opportunity. I am yours for life and death, HOLKER,</q>
In your letter of the ſixteenth of Auguſt, 1779, you ſay,
<q>I beg you'll write in a preſſing manner to Mr. Smith for his accounts, ſo as I may have, as ſoon as poſſible, an eſtimate of <hi>our</hi> ſituation with reſpect to the King.</q>
On the twenty-fifth of the ſame month you ſay,
<q>Mr. Holker hopes Mr. Smith has ſent his accounts, they are very neceſſary, as Mr. Holker can only ground his remittance to Mr. Chaumont on the general account.</q>
On the third of September you ſay,
<q>The above note is a general account of what was furniſhed by the Continental commiſſaries in Boſton, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the article mentioned in Miller and Tracey's account. Remainder, is that part, which, being ſent from hence, arrived in Boſton, and muſt be eſtimated at the price then current in Boſton, according to Meſſrs. Miller and Tracey's account, ſo as to avoid all difficulties.</q>
And on the eighth of September, 1779, you ſay,
<q>As ſoon as you can ſend me a copy of the general account, I ſhall be glad to receive it, ſo as to ground my letter to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, by Mr. Gerard, and my correſpondence with Mr. de Chaumont.</q>
All this was previous to the <hi>ſettlement</hi> of thoſe accounts on the 9th of September, 1779.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, it will not be difficult to ſhew, not only what you ordered and agreed to, but even what you <hi>intended</hi> at that time; altho' your intentions may now have changed. Be pleaſed to recollect, that your operations at Boſton were twofold, part for the King, and part for private account; that the buſineſs of both kinds paſſed in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thro' the ſame hands, and that the money was applied partly by funds, which you received there, and partly by bills drawn on me. John Rowe's accounts amount, in the whole, to the ſum (in Pennſylvania currency)

               <p>Theſe were part of the funds applied to the King's ſervice, alſo about £.2000, of what you received for goods of Mr. Chaumont, and a very conſiderable ſum belonging to the ſame gentleman, which was received by Jonathan Williams in Boſton. This laſt, paid to the uſe of the Royal marine £.187,525 - 5 - 10, and he received the money from ſales of bills on Mr. Chaumont, Mr. Grand, Meſſrs. Lecouteulx &amp; Co. and from ſales of goods, the property of Mr. Chaumont, Chaumont Cavillon freres &amp; Co. Sabatier fils &amp; Deſpres, and Marquis de St. Aignan. <hi>The accounts of all theſe things are, at your deſire, in my books and in my name.</hi> How are they to be ſeparated? Where are your inſtructions for the purpoſe at the time? Could you have had any ſuch thing then in idea? But you have endeavoured to obviate theſe clear concluſions, by holding up the idea, that the ſettlement before Mr. Gerard was a very incomplete ſtatement, which it was neceſſary for <hi>him</hi> to have before his departure for France. Is there any thing in your notes or letters, written at the time, which will countenance ſuch conſtruction? You know that there is not; you know that they prove the direct contrary. And, I'll go one ſtep farther, which is to ſhow, that very long after Mr. Gerard's departure you viewed that ſettlement in a very different point of light. For, I have a note, in which you ſay,
<q>Mr. Holker wants a copy of Mr. Robert Morris's <hi>old account current of the Royal Marine ſigned by Mr. Gerard,</hi> which he will return immediately, and then will demand a meeting with Mr. Morris, for his kind advice, how to proceed in a ſettlement with Roger Sherman.</q>

The effort now made to ſeparate them is with a view to eſtabliſh your demand of depreciation. But, altho' it is in that reſpect immaterial to me, I will not conſent to it.</p>
               <p>I have already mentioned that I deſired you to write on this ſubject, that I might have an opportunity, once for all, to conteſt it. I will add, that I did not imagine you would ſeriouſly advance ſuch a claim. Remember, Sir,

that my tranſactious with you, were merely of the nature of a truſt; you put monies into my hands <hi>for your own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi>; I held them <hi>at your diſpoſition</hi>; if I performed that truſt, and the monies periſhed in my hands, how am I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable? Did I ever aſk you to place monies in my hands (except when you indicated purchaſes to be made or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to be performed that required it? You know that I did not. Did I ever refuſe to honor your drafts, or obey your orders on me for money? You know that I did not. To what purpoſe, then, is it, that you ſpeak to me of the depreciation of monies which I did you the favor to keep for you? I ſay favor, becauſe the loſs in receiving and paying ſuch large nominal ſums in paper money, by errors in counting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. amount to more than you can have any idea of, and the trouble and time conſumed therein, none can know, but thoſe who went through the painful experience. Suppoſe you had entruſted to me any other periſhable article, ſhould I, or could I be made anſwerable for the waſte and loſs while it lay in my ſtore, eſpecially if I received no conſideration for the care and cuſtody? Altho', to oblige you, theſe accounts were rendered in a variegated form, they might all be comprized under one general account, between you and me, of monies received and paid by me. Whether, during the whole of this time, there was, or was not, a balance in my hands, is totally immaterial to me; it was always ready at your order to draw it out when you pleaſed. I repeatedly, at your deſire, made eſtimates for your government in this reſpect, and my books and papers were always open to you. Thus much, Sir, I have thought it might be proper to ſay on the general principle.</p>
               <p>For what you ſay, in your letter of the 23d of January, on the ſubject of dates to the articles of my accounts, I can only refer you to the ſubordinate accounts, which contain dates as preciſely as I can render them (except that the articles of my caſh account being only entered from the caſh-book into the waſte-book weekly, probably the dates may ſometimes bear the date of the day of entry, inſtead of the preciſe day on which the money was paid or received; but this, I conceive, is not of any importance.) But, in your ſame letter, you ſay further,
<q>In the private accounts your tranſactions being blended with mine, the accounts of various other individuals being alſo blended with mine and yours, it is impoſſible to know, from the dates that appear on them, what is the right of each individual.</q>
Believe me, Sir, I have no deſire to preclude you from any calculations you may think proper, on this occaſion; but, I will neither aſk of others, nor allow myſelf any depreciation in the monies which were held for your uſe and at your diſpoſition. For inſtance, when, by your deſire, I remitted upwards of thirty thouſand pounds to Mr. Slough, to purchaſe flour for the Royal Marine and money of the recalled emiſſions for your private friends, can you believe I would expoſe my reputation, by aſking him for the depreciation of that money, or waſte my fortune, by allowing it to you? But, you aſk me, in your letter of the twenty-third of January, Why offer a certificate that you would not allow depreciation? Recollect, I pray you, that this was in anſwer to your queſtion, what you ſhould ſay to the King's Miniſter for not allowing it to him. You ſay further,
<q>Let the advantages gained by your operations, be placed againſt the loſſes ſuffered by depreciation; this is fair and juſt; <hi>this is all you certainly can mean or pretend to.</hi>
                  </q>
But, I neither mean nor pretend to any ſuch a thing, I have already ſaid, and again repeat, I aſk no credit of the King for any ſavings, I am not accountable to him for any looſings, nor will I compenſate to him or to you for any depreciation during my agency in your affairs. At the ſame time it is not clear to me that you would not have to pay, rather than receive on the King's account; for, at the time when the ſettlement was made before Mr. Gerard I was actually in advance, altho', from the face of the account, the balance is conſiderably againſt me. The notes made on that very account ſhew this, and, altho' thoſe notes were then made upon eſtimates only, yet the facts ſupport them; except, that the ſum in the hands of Mr. Smith was not quite ſo large as we expected, a conſiderable part thereof being applied to purchaſe and fitting a ſhip for your and my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:044903_0016_101F4F1B34ADCB48"/>
came from our own funds, and of courſe leſſened the ſum Mr. Smith had for the ſervice of the Royal Marine. In like manner, the remittance of £.10,000 had not been effectually made to Mr. Langdon, but he had, by your deſire, received my orders long before to purchaſe the maſts which were eſtimated at that ſum, and I was liable to pay his drafts whenever they ſhould appear. But, in your letter of the twenty-third of January, you aſk me,
<q>Why argue, that becauſe the King had made great ſavings by the operations of the Royal Marine <hi>under my direction,</hi> you are not to account <hi>to me</hi> on his behalf and make good depreciation if any loſs enſued.</q>
Indeed, Sir, I made uſe of no ſuch argument, but told you the King had not ſuffered by depreciation, and therefore had no right to aſk it. You certainly can not have forgotten the arguments which you have uſed for paying the United States for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions furniſhed at the nominal value, viz. that the King's money lay in the hands of your agents, at your order, ready to pay into the treaſury, and as you could not aſk them to make good depreciation, ſo it ought not to be aſked of you. I have ſaid that I did not aſk you to place money in my hands; I now go further, if I had been in your place, <hi>I would not have drawn for the King's money until it was wanted for the King's ſervice.</hi> Doubtleſs you had good reaſons for writing to me on the twenty-ſixth of February 1779,
<q>Mr. Holker preſents his compliments to Mr. Robert Morris, and begs he will do his utmoſt to puſh on his accounts as faſt as poſſible, as alſo the negociation of bills, ſo as to make money.</q>
And ſhall Mr. Holker now aſk this ſame Mr. Morris for depreciation, for money thus brought into his hands? Nay, money that lay ready for his diſpoſal, and which Mr. Morris could not have parted with without immiment hazard? On the twenty-eighth day of April, 1779, you ſay,
<q>I ſhall want, for the uſe of the Royal Navy of France, from <hi>fourteen to fifteen thouſand barrels of flour.</hi> I beg, alſo, that you'll lay in here, <hi>five hundred barrels of the beſt beef, and as much pork.</hi>
                  </q>
On the twentieth of Auguſt, 1779, you ſay,
<q>What money can you command in Boſton, ſhall I offer it to the treaſury, or ſhall I have it employed in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of beef, pork, codfiſh, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
On the third of September, 1779,
<q>Mr. Gerard wants 10,000 dollars for a few days. Mr. Holker has taken the liberty of drawing this day on Mr. Morris for that ſum.</q>
On the eighteenth of the ſame month,
<q>I requeſt you'll be ſo kind as to write to Mr. Mumford in Connecticut, to ſecure the ſalt proviſions, flour, bread, &amp;c. but eſpecially the oil, and butter, and ſalt-fiſh, that might come in any prize veſſels, to be ſold at Providence or New-London.</q>
Can you ſeriouſly imagine, that the depoſitary of monies, held liable to ſudden calls, of any and every kind, and who was always ready to anſwer thoſe calls, would be ſo weak as to allow for the periſhing of it in his hands? Can you ſuppoſe any tribunal, or any impartial perſon, would hold him bound to make it good? But let us return for a moment to your Boſton tranſactions, on which ſo great a ſtreſs is laid. Your moſt favorable ſtatement of them can only be, <hi>a profit made by the King on the depreciation of money belonging to individuals, applied to his uſe.</hi> But this is not all: you, as I have already obſerved, derived the means of making thoſe expenditures, principally from funds credited to individuals in accounts kept by you, in my name, at your requeſt; compriſe the whole together, and you muſt ſee, that it forms neither addition to, nor deduction from, what I poſſeſſed. But, according to the mode in which you ſeem to deſire a ſtatement, I ſhould firſt account to thoſe individuals for depreciation on monies you received and applied to the King's uſe; ſecondly, to the King, for monies which you put into my hands; and, thirdly, you would aſk the United States to accept of the money at the original value, becauſe it had been in my hands; this attempt requires no comment. Such, then, is your claim for depreciation on general principles, and on the particular nature of our accounts. Before I quit the ſubject I will ſelect two or three inſtances from thoſe accounts, which will bring the reaſoning more home to your perceptions. The King paid 400,000 <hi>Livres</hi> for two prizes, taken by the privateers Hancock and Boſton, you agreed with the owners for £.70,000 lawful money; you paid in part your bills for 45,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> (£.7875) and drew on me for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:044903_0017_101F4F1CCEA0A100"/>
the remainder £.62,125, which ſums together, make £.70,000 lawful. Theſe drafts on me, equal to £.77,656 - 5 Pennſylvania currency, were paid by me, when your public bills were ſelling at 900 per cent. on ſterling, reckoning livres 10½ d. ſterling. Conſequently, thoſe bills were paid with ſomewhat leſs than 200,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> the difference on the whole tranſaction was a gain of 155,000 <hi>Livres Tournois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The account ſales of bills of exchange, dated the eleventh of March, 1779, contains a ſale to Peter Whiteſide of 91,428 <hi>Livres</hi> 5 <hi>ſols,</hi> of which one bill for 4571 <hi>Livres</hi> 7 <hi>ſols,</hi> was on his account. The remainder (equal to £.3800 ſterling) was, on your and my joint account, taken at the current rate, towards reducing the advances which had been made for the Royal Marine, and afterwards I agreed to give you the ſum of £.5700 advance on your half, for which you are credited the 12th of May in your account current, being a profit you gained thereon. The fifteenth of February, 1780, I received by your orders, bills to the amount of 54,722 <hi>Livres</hi> 18 <hi>ſols,</hi> which were, according to that order, received of Meſſrs. Wm. Turnbull and Co. whom I have credited for the ſame, at the then current price of ſix dollars per <hi>livre</hi>; afterwards 36752 <hi>Livres</hi> 6 <hi>ſols</hi> of theſe bills were paid for a brigantine, in which you and I were concerned, and 5500 <hi>Livres</hi> were ſold at one dollar advance, is Dollrs. 5500 and 12651 <hi>Livres</hi> at three dollars advance, is 37953 Dollrs. 43453</p>
               <p>For one half of this gain you are credited by me in account current on the ſeventh of April, 1780, and yet you can aſk me for depreciation on theſe accounts. You have aſked me for <hi>Livres</hi>—which you ſuppoſe to be due, and by examining the laſt of theſe tranſactions, being one of thoſe on which this demand is made, you will find I ſhould in that caſe pay £. 4104 - 3 - 7 for what ſold at the time for £. 2600—and in a tranſaction where you had already derived the benefit of the actual depreciation.</p>
               <p>You wiſh to know what meaſures I allude to which may prove diſadvantageous or even ruinous to you, and what are the falſe concluſions drawn by you. I believe, Sir, you will be convinced that the concluſions you had formed of me and my conduct are not juſt; if you ſtill think otherwiſe, go on in the meaſures neceſſary to compel me to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch accounts as you like. Whether ſome of the facts contained in this letter would be to your advantage or diſadvantage and whether they would promote your grandeur or effect your ruin, you beſt can determine. Having thus diſcuſſed the points ſo much laboured and inſiſted upon in your late letters, I come now to ſpeak of the accounts ſent you herewith.</p>
               <p>In your letter of the 24th January you ſay "I told you that Mr. Swanwick had delivered to Mr. Turnbull the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Royal Marine after my peruſal <hi>and examination of ſaid accounts</hi>: in this you are miſtaken; I might have looked at them curſorily, but as to examining them I never did until ſince the twenty third day of January, the day on which you and I had our laſt interview. I am ſorry to ſay that, upon my examination of thoſe accounts, I find Mr. Swanwick had made conſiderable errors and omiſſions, all which I have now corrected: and as you did forbid Mr. Turnbull to admit the balances of my accounts to be introduced into his, (although I could prove your contrary orders at the time if I thought it neceſſary) I have continued the account of the Royal Marine in your name as agent until the end thereof. By this account you will find there was a balance of upwards of £. 340,000 continental cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in my favor when I ceaſed to be your agent: this conſiſts with eſtimates which you and I made at that time and with the letters you told me you then wrote, excepting as to £. 100,000 which I ſhall preſently mention. This balance was nearly diſcharged by bills of exchange which by your order I received of Mſſrs. William Turnbull &amp; Co. in March, April and June 1780, and which I ſold or paid at the ſame price I was charged for them, to John Donald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:044903_0018_101F4F2259600860"/>
Iſaac Moſes and others, to all which you was privy at the time. It is true that I had charged Wm. Turnbull and Co. with the effects from which their capital was to be drawn, and that I had omitted in due time to give them credit for the ſum of £.200,000 continental currency, being the amount of that capital, which you and I agreed to advance to Mr. Turnbull, when we took him into partnerſhip, in order to transfer your agency into his hands, neither had I charged your account for £.100,000 continental, being the half of that capital, ſo that theſe omiſſions not being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in our eſtimates, generally occaſioned an error in them of £. 100,000 continental currency, as is above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Notwithſtanding this I find, that on ſtating properly the accounts between Mſſrs. Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. and me, they were paid for all the bills of exchange which I purchaſed of them, ſo that you will find your claim of 169,000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois falls to the ground. From the time I ceaſed to be your agent our accounts are no longer to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as of the nature of a truſt, neither are the accounts between Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. and me of that nature. I am willing therefore to ſettle my accounts with them and thoſe with you for ſubſequent tranſactions upon principles of depreciation. I find, that at the time when the Royal Marine owed me upwards of three hundred and forty thouſand pounds continental currency, I had in my hands, of your private funds, and thoſe of your friends, nearly to the amount of three hundred thouſand pounds continental, and as I continued to receive more after that period, I readily agree to ſet aſide Mr. Swanwick's propoſition, of valuing the balance of continental money on your private account current at one hundred for one; he meant to do juſtice between us, but it did not occur to him that I received on account of the balance in my favor, on your account, as agent of the Royal Marine, the ſum of £. 342,775 - 2 - 6 conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental money, when it was worth ſixty-one and a half for one; and, that having at the ſame time near £. 300,000 of yours and your friends in my hands, you ought to have the like value for at leaſt the latter amount. And therefore to ſave all trouble of inveſtigation, as to the exact ſum which was in my hands, I agree to compute the ſame ſum which I received £. 342,775 - 2 - 6 continental, at ſixty-one and a half, and bring the amount thereof to your credit in the hard money account; this I think is juſt, and therefore, Sir, I offer it. There will then remain a balance of £. 114,561 - 18 - 0 ½ continental money ariſing from receipts of later date, the value of which muſt be ſettled by you and me. You will obſerve, I ſuppoſe, ſeveral articles in the accounts now rendered, which Mr. Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick had omitted ſome for, and ſome againſt you. In the courſe of examining my books and papers I have diſcovered alſo, that I lent you a cargo of tobacco, which was ſhipped for your account in May, 1780, per the brig Hawke, Captain Taylor, from Baltimore, conſiſting of 79 hogſheads. This tobacco I borrowed and paid in November laſt, without recollecting its being lent to you; therefore, you muſt either return me ſeventy-nine hogſheads of tobacco, or pay me as much money as will purchaſe it. I am ready to meet you at any time and place, in order to fix the value of the continental balance above mentioned, as alſo the price of the tobacco; unleſs you chuſe to ſave that trouble, by delivering the like quantity of tobacco equally good in quality, which will be moſt agreeable to me; when theſe two points are adjuſted, there can be no difficulty in completing the ſettlement of our accounts. I will then render you an account of thoſe articles depending between us, which conſiſts of hard money debits and credits. I have formerly rendered you a number of thoſe ſubordinate accounts, whoſe amount or balance form articles in the accounts currt. now ſent, I did intend to have had the whole copied again and ſent with theſe, but as this would detain you much longer from the inveſtigation of your real ſituation with me, I have omitted it for the preſent; but I will cheerfully have copied and ſent to you any of them that you may deſire. I am alſo not only ready but deſirous to explain any thing in theſe accounts that you do not comprehend; for, altho' I will not comply with unjuſt and unreaſonable demands, yet I am, and ever ſhall be, ready to ſhew all thoſe with whom I have any dealings, that the accounts, which I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are juſt, fair and honorable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:044903_0019_101F4F258E4050C0"/>You will probably think it neceſſary that I ſhould have ſent my vouchers in ſupport of theſe accounts; but, ſince you have detained from me ſome of thoſe which were confidentially entruſted to you, I will not part with thoſe which now remain, until we ſhall have made a ſettlement. It is poſſible, ſituated as I am, ſubject to perpetual interruptions, that there may ſtill be errors or omiſſions in theſe accounts, altho' I have examined them with all the care and attention that I could; if any ſuch, they cannot be important nor long undiſcovered, as I ſhall ſtill beſtow time on the ſubordinate accounts more than I have yet done. If either errors or omiſſions are diſcovered, whether they make for or againſt me, I ſhall announce them to you, in order that right may be done.</p>

            <head>Obſervations on ROBERT MORRIS's letter of the 26th of February, 1784, to JOHN HOLKER, and extracts from the ſame.</head>
            <p>ROBERT MORRIS, being accuſed with delaying the ſettlement of his accounts with JOHN HOLKER, appears determined to acquit himſelf of that charge. With this view, he ſends, with the letter above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (of February 26, 1784,) his accounts, for a final ſettlement, which, according to his ſtatement, nearly balance by credit and debit. He then, in his turn, accuſes the agent general, J. H. of having unjuſtly charged him with ſuch delays, and of attributing them to a wiſh of withholding a balance due to J. H. This point is to be cleared up by the accounts of the auditors, which, however, cannot materially differ, at leaſt in <hi>nominal</hi> ſums of continental money, from thoſe eſtabliſhed by J. H. againſt R. M. upon the vouchers produced by the latter.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the nature of the truſt repoſed in him, during his agency, R. M. ſays,
<q>You may remember alſo, that you urged it as a kind of obligation, to take care of the intereſts of a King, who was in the act of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſuch generous aſſiſtance to my country, and called on me, if I would not act myſelf, to point out ſome other perſon.</q>
And <note n="*" place="bottom">In this ſaid letter R. M. firſt ſays,
<q>You will remember, Sir, that <hi>you introduced yourſelf to my acquaintance</hi> in the beginning of July, 1778, and <hi>preſſed me</hi> to undertake the tranſaction of your affairs. The <hi>conſideration,</hi> held out to me, was, that very <hi>great</hi> ſums of money would naturally come to my hands, and might be occaſionally employed in uſeful ſpeculations on our joint account.</q>
J. H. ſays he never preſſed R. M. to undertake his affairs; he offered to R. M. the preference of his affairs; he ſtipulated a fixed commiſſion; but denies that ever he held out as a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they were jointly to ſpeculate with the funds of any one; much leſs to ſpeculate and attempt the ruin of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and of his abſent friends, by working depreciation againſt them. No one at leaſt will believe that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held out to R. M. was, that R. M. ſhould ſpeculate with J. H's money for his own account, and afterwards that J. H. ſhould gladly put up with a nominal account, when it pleaſed R. M. to render any, or to offer a ſettlement of them. But every one will ſee why and wherefore he accepted of the preference given him to manage J. H's affairs; and others will beſt judge, whether it is true that R. M's conſent was <hi>reluctantly drawn from him,</hi> on this occaſion, by a man who had <hi>introduced himſelf</hi> to his acquaintance.</note> further ſays,
<q>At length you drew from me my reluctant conſent. And whatever elſe may happen, I have, at leaſt, the pleaſure to reflect, that the truſt repoſed in me was faithfully executed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:044903_0020_101F4F284AB13E60"/>By this paragraph, he ſays, he reflects with pleaſure, that he has faithfully executed the truſt repoſed in him, tho' he did undertake the King's buſineſs with reluctance; he was ſolicited thereto by the King's agent, who urged him to act for the intereſt of a good and generous King, and ſtipulated with him, as a previous obligation, that he ſhould take care of his intereſt; becauſe he was in the act of giving and affording aſſiſtance to his country in the hour of it's diſtreſs; he engaged in the King's concerns, and to act in thoſe of Holker's friends on this footing. But, RES MIRABILIS? he afterwards maintains he was not <hi>agent,</hi> not bailiff in law,—but merely a <hi>banker,</hi> all the time of his agency.</p>
            <p>And further,
<q>As you was not only agent for your ſovereign, but alſo for many individuals trading to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or ſpeculating in our public funds, the concerns, <hi>which I engaged in for you,</hi> were both numerous and important.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In another part of this letter he ſays, page 9,
<q>Remember, Sir, that my tranſactions with you were merely of the nature of a truſt, you put <note n="*" place="bottom">R. M. is pleaſed to call <hi>bills of exchange</hi> by the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>monies,</hi> in order thereby to draw a conſequence, favorable to his purpoſes.</note> monies into my hands for your own purpoſes, <hi>I held them at your diſpoſition</hi>; if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that truſt, and the monies periſhed in my hands, how am I anſwerable. Did I ever aſk you to place monies into my hands, except when you indicated purchaſes, or ſervices to be performed? Did I ever refuſe to honor your drafts, or obey your orders on me for money? To what purpoſe then is it that you ſpeak to me of depreciation of monies which I did you the favor to keep for you? I ſay favor, becauſe the loſs in receiving and paying ſuch large nominal ſums of paper money, by errors <note n="†" place="bottom">Is the miſtake in counting money always on one ſide?</note> in counting, amount to more than you have an idea of, and the trouble and time conſumed therein, none can know, but thoſe who went through the painful experience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>John Holker entruſted to Robert Morris almoſt the whole of the buſineſs of the Royal Marine, deeming him alone competent thereto; J. H. being a foreigner, unacquainted with accounts and with the characters to be choſen and employed—with the prices of articles,—with the countries where theſe articles or proviſions were to be procured,—with the nature of the money then current,—and the valuations of ſpecie through the continent: he had no clerk, no accountant with him, no credit eſtabliſhed to tranſact or give ſatisfaction in tranſacting buſineſs, to ſecure engagements, &amp;c. &amp;c. For all theſe purpoſes R. M. was choſen and employed, and at the time J. H. had not another choice to make.</p>
            <p>For theſe purpoſes, he gave bills of exchange, he put bills on France into the hands of R. M. and alſo ſome monies ariſing from the ſales of prize goods and others, ſalt, &amp;c. &amp;c. However, all this, R. M. ſays, was reduced to a mere truſt of monies depoſited with him, which he did J. H. the favor to keep; this favor, however, was to coſt an immenſe ſum to the King; for, laying aſide all conſiderations reſpecting the heavy loſs ſuſtained on ſuch of the bills, as it was neceſſary to ſell for the real purpoſe of ſervices actually performed for the Royal Marine, it appears by the account, that a ſum exceeding £.39,000 of real ſpecie value, of which £.30,000 at leaſt were paid in bills on France, are ſaid to have been employed by R. M. in order to make purchaſes of articles or payments, which together amount to no more than £.11,950 - 8 - 11½ ſpecie value, thus ſinking £.39,000 real, in order to pay about £.12,000. A pretty favor indeed!</p>

            </p>
            <p>This paſſage of the letter admits of the depreciation of the paper, it being alſo a periſhable article; moreover it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that if this periſhable article did not remain in his ſtore, or in his cheſt, he is anſwerable for the waſte and loſs; and the more ſo, becauſe he was actually not only a depoſitary, but a true agent, a bailiff in law, receiving the full conſideration he had previouſly ſtipulated for (which is alſo expreſſed in this ſame letter) three times the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or commiſſions uſually allowed for recovering <note n="*" place="bottom">A mere banker charges no commiſſion whatever.</note> and paying money: if anſwerable for the waſte and loſs of the money when not in cheſt, he is alſo anſwerable for the total loſs of the bills, either by the untimely ſale thereof, or of their proceeds by depreciation, becauſe if he did not keep thoſe public monies in cheſt, till wanted for the public ſervice, he muſt have employed them in the interim for his own purpoſes, to his own emolument, to throw the waſte in his hands; and if anſwerable for the waſte, by his own avowal when the money was out of his cheſt, ſhall he not produce his books, the only certain evidence in his favor, to prove, that he did keep them in his cheſt, that he did not employ the proceeds of the bills for his own purpoſes, that he did not ſell the bills in order to get at the proceeds, that he did not take the bills to himſelf, under the idea of fictitious ſales; eſpecially when fictitious ſales can be proved againſt him by this ſame letter? Is he not alſo bound; by this avowal, to give full, undoubted and lawful reaſons for his conduct, in order to convince us that he had ſufficient cauſe for the ſale of all the bills given to Him?</p>
            <p>Further ſays R. M. (page 4)
<q>As to myſelf I claim from the King neither thanks, nor honors, nor rewards.<note n="†" place="bottom">But he claimed from the King's agent five per cent. for his commiſſions on all purchaſes on the King's account, two and a half per cent. on the ſales of all bills, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is true, he was, per agreement, to allow one half of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to the King's agent, and this half has been prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved for the King; therefore, the auditors can only credit R. M. in account, for two and a half per cent. on all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, and one and a quarter on the ſales of bills, ſince R. M. on account of the extenſive buſineſs he had to manage, agreed originally, to be ſatisfied with one half of the commiſſions uſually charged in America, which are more than double of what is uſually charged by European merchants on commiſſion buſineſs.</note> I ſhall never give myſelf a <hi>moment's concern,</hi> whether he <hi>gained</hi> or <hi>loſt,</hi> on thoſe tranſactions which <hi>I</hi> performed by your order: I owed him <hi>no duty,</hi> he had confided to me <hi>no truſt,</hi> nor conferred on me any authority, <hi>if</hi> he had, I ſhould have executed his <hi>truſt with fidelity:</hi> you are reſponſible to him, and may render ſuch accounts as you think proper, mine with you, I ſend with this letter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the King had conferred on R. M. authority, he then would have acted with fidelity; but when the King's agent confers on him all his authority, then he is not bound to any duty; he may act without integrity in this caſe, and even charge therewith his employer, and traduce the agent general, becauſe he repoſed confidence in his good faith, honeſty, reputation and fidelity; he was not then reſponſible for the truſt repoſed in him, becauſe no commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his name had iſſued under the King's authority, except merely for the accounts of the nominal value of theſe periſhable articles, which he had purchaſed with <hi>unperiſhable</hi> bills; and theſe he had procured from the King's agent, under the pretence of fallacious accounts, of real expenditures, actual advances of money, and further wants for further expenditures. Suppoſe he had received from the agent general 100 hogſheads full of molaſſes, that he was to keep them in his ſtore, and attend carefully to the waſte; he accounts for the hogſheads but not for the contents; and when called upon to open the ſtore, and to prove by his cooper, and ſervants, and books, that the hogſheads were attended to, that they have been conſtantly in ſtore, and that he has neither ſold nor bartered the contents; he then maintains, that the King had conferred on him no authority; therefore that he would neither open his ſtore, thereby
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:044903_0022_101F4F2B94B2F728"/>
to prove the natural leakage and waſte of the hogſheads; nor would produce his books, not being bound to act with fidelity or integrity, becauſe he was only employed by the King's agent, and not by the King—becauſe he was not agent for the latter, but only a ſtore keeper, a banker for J. H.</p>
            <p>R. M. however adds—
<q>As to the <hi>buſineſs</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Was he a depoſitary of buſineſs? Does a mere banker incur the obligation of anſwering for buſineſs? Does a mere banker perform any buſineſs for others?</note> I performed for you, I muſt anſwer it to you, and I do this by ſhewing a compliance with your orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The following paſſage will ſhew that he received more, or pretended to receive more, than the full conſideration for his ſervices as bailiff and agent; and therefore much more than he could have claimed, had he been, as he ſays, a mere depoſitary, a mere banker.</p>
            <p>Page 11,—
<q>The fact <note n="†" place="bottom">This is in reply to J. H's letters of the 23d and 24th of January, 1784 who ſaid, that the <hi>accounts</hi> relative to Boſton tranſactions, reſpecting the <hi>fleet of</hi> Count D'Eſtaing, ought not and ſhould not be blended with R M's accounts of his agency; becauſe improper conſequences would and did appear from their introduction into R. M's accounts. For J. H. had then diſcovered, that it was by their means that R. M. contrived to conceal the real ſituation of his accounts and operations from him, and to make a claim of bills on France to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe amount, on account of balances erroncouſly brought by R. M. to his own credit, and which he ſays,
<q>were due to me</q>
ſay, to R. M.</note> was that the account of your Boſton tranſactions, as well as all others of theſe accounts, was inſerted in mine by your order, that the whole might appear in one point of view, and a commiſſion be charged on the whole.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this buſineſs, J. H. did not even benefit of the advice of R. M. during all the time of his reſidence in Boſton: in October, November and December 1778. But as he pray'd R. M. to redact thoſe accounts on his return to Philadelphia, he at the time conſented to allow a commiſſion of 2½ per cent. on the whole, on a ſum of more than £.305,000, when it ought only to have extended to the ſum of £.51,503, paid by him for J. Rowe's drafts from Boſton, and J. H's bills on him for £.54,981 - 11- 3, continental currency: one half of this commiſſion was, however, to have been credited to the Royal Marine, and this reduces the claim of R. M. on the whole to one and one quarter per cent. or one half of the above commiſſion, if the claim is admiſſible on the improper conſent of the agent general given at the time, to the propoſal of R. M. for his trouble in redacting the accounts.</p>
            <p>R. M. has ſaid above, (page 10)
<q>that if the King had conferred on him any authority, he would have executed his truſt with fidelity:</q>
afterwards, he adds, (page 15) to his immortal honor
<q>I did not aſk <note n="‡" place="bottom">His words are (page 14)
<q>Did I ever aſk you to place monies in my hands, except when you indicated purchaſes or ſervices to be performed?</q>
This is very different,— and he muſt reconcile the interrogation and the aſſertion to each other.</note> you to put monies into my hands; now go further; if I had been in your place, I would not have <hi>drawn</hi> for the King's money, until it was wanted for the King's ſervice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Does not this accuſation made againſt J. H.—does not this charge preferred by R. M. againſt his employer—indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and amount to an acknowledgement, that R. M. knew at the time, that the bills were improperly ſold?— This ſale he well knew, the accounts when properly ſtated would diſcloſe: therefore to prevent the charge againſt himſelf, and to avoid the conſequences, he becomes accuſer of the agent general, and lays the blame at his door, though no ſuch charge had yet been made againſt R. M.—J. H. could not have even ſuſpected that R. M. had ever concealed from his knowledge the management and appropriation of ſuch a large ſum as appears by the accounts, nor would he ever have believed it, but from the conviction, that the accounts carry with them, to all who can read and underſtand them.</p>
            <p>However, the following queſtions ariſe on this aſtoniſhing paſſage of his letter: If it was, in his eyes, a want of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:044903_0023_101F4F2D8F3376D8"/>
fidelity; if it was not honeſt in the King's agent general, to have (as he here aſſerts) <hi>prematurely drawn the bills</hi>; why does his confidential ſubordinate agent <hi>prematurely</hi> ſell theſe bills? Was it, becauſe J. H. had entruſted to him the management of the whole of his buſineſs, the tranſaction of all his affairs, the negociation of thoſe bills, the choice of agents and correſpondents for all purchaſes on account of the royal ſervice, the ſettlement of the accounts? Was it neceſſary for R. M. to ſell thoſe ſame bills, before the expenditures in many caſes could have been foreſeen, much leſs have taken place? Were the periſhable proceeds of the bills, ſo <hi>prematurely ſold,</hi> to be conſidered as veſted in J. H. or in R. M. to whom the management of this buſineſs was wholly confided?—Why were thoſe <hi>unperiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bills,</hi> ſold for a periſhable article: or rather why pretend a ſale to P. Whiteſide, of £.3,800 ſterling of bills, as he acknowledges to have done, by this very letter, and then keep the whole bills for his own purpoſes, in order to account for the periſhable value of their proceeds?—Was this the execution of that truſt repoſed in him, which he ſays "It gives me ſo much pleaſure, to have faithfully<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide the ſecond page of the letter.</note> executed!" And is it thus he was to act for the intereſt of a King, whoſe ſervice he had been <hi>urged</hi> by his agent to undertake, becauſe he was in the act of affording ſuch generous aſſiſtance to his country, and of aiding to ſave him from the wrath of an incenſed nation, and a relentleſs enemy?</p>
            <p>In another part of this letter, R. M. deſcribes the nature of the truſt repoſed in him in conciſe terms.—Page 15.
<q>Can you ſeriouſly imagine, (ſays he) that the depoſitary <note n="*" place="bottom">In the beginning of this letter he ſays,
<q>The concerns I engaged in for you, were both numerous and important.</q>
He engaged for J. H. in the concerns of the King, and of J. H's friends—Was he depoſitary of their concerns as well as of their monies, or agent for their concerns and depoſitary for their monies, ariſing from, or neceſſary for their concerns?</note> of monies, held liable to ſudden calls of any and every kind, and who was always ready to anſwer thoſe calls, would be ſo weak, as to allow for the periſhing <note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 14. R. M. ſays,
<q>But I will neither aſk of others, nor allow myſelf any depreciation on the monies which were held for your uſe, and at your diſpoſition.</q>
If held for J. H's uſe in his hands he will not allow depreciation; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if he did not hold it for his uſe, he muſt pay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation, according to his own principle.</note> of it in his hands?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is replied, that among thoſe articles beſt calculated to raiſe money on ſudden emergencies, and for ſudden calls of the ſervice, bills held the firſt rank among merchants, for the purpoſe of an unfailing remittance to Europe: theſe would have anſwered the purpoſe completely at all times, and were not a periſhable article.—But it is alſo to be added, that there never was one ſudden call made on him for a large ſum of money during his agency: that all the calls made upon him were the conſequence of his own meaſures in almoſt every inſtance, of the purchaſes <hi>he</hi> had directed to be made, of the expenditures <hi>he</hi> had authoriſed, as <hi>ſubordinate agent,</hi> and not as depoſitary or banker.</p>
            <p>Indeed it would be rather hard if the monies had come into the hands of R. M. and were to lay with him, till employed, if he ſold the bills for real purchaſes ordered, then actually making, or really practicable, it would be rather hard I ſay, to make him account for the untimely ſale of bills, and the conſequent loſs by depreciation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he always had, as he aſſerts, the money ready in his cheſt, to anſwer ſudden calls; and that ſuch money was actually and bona fide periſhing in his hands;—in ſuch a caſe, it might be dealing too hard with a banker, or even an agent, to throw on him the whole burthen of the loſs. But if the loſs ſhould have proved unreaſonably great in proportion to the ſervice he had rendered, if there ſhould be reaſons to doubt of the purchaſes having been ordered by the agent general to him, when he took the bills, or when he ſold them to his correſpondents or brokers; then and in this caſe, will it not be incumbent on him to clear up the matter, to ſhew his books, in order to prove, that, as he ſays, the money was actually periſhing in his hands? Shall we take his word, or the declaration of his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:044903_0024_101F4F30D4BCCAC8"/>
friends or partners, or clerks, in his juſtification, when a poſitive written evidence, kept on purpoſe to eſtabliſh it, and to ground the opinion of the world on or reſpecting his conduct, can be produced by him in his defence?— Shall not this evidence be produced, ſince he acknowledges by this paragraph, "That it would be weak in him to allow for the periſhing of the money in his hands." Which implies a very different conſequence, if he employed the money to his own purpoſes on the above ſuppoſition, and reaped not only the waſte of the money, but alſo the profits of the ſpeculations he made with the proceeds of the public bills; eſpecially when it is evident that he took ſome to himſelf, under the appearance of fictitious ſales; nay, are we not to ſuppoſe that he probably ſold others ſo as to employ the proceeds thereof when in his cheſt, with and without any diſtinction from his own monies, as faſt as opportunities offered? This he confeſſed in as many words (on the arbitration) to have done, as conſtantly as J. H's monies came to his hands, and as any calls whatever were made on him for his own concerns.</p>
            <p>Can ſuch conduct and ſuch arguments be applauded? Was it thus that R. M. intended to act for the intereſt of a generous King in his concerns? Had he forgot that the paper of Congreſs was but a nominal <hi>periſhable thing</hi> (to make uſe of his own words)? Had he forgot that he alone kept the books; that he had refuſed to open a ſeparate ſet of books; that he had inſiſted upon blending the accounts of the concerns of J. H. as agent and as a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual in his own books, with thoſe of his own affairs and concerns? He alone was able to know whether the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus monies were employed for the ſervice, or periſhing in his cheſt; it was, therefore, incumbent on him, either to veſt the money, or to have propoſed to his employer to veſt it in ſome thing not periſhable, not ſubject to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, rather than to let it periſh, as he ſays, in his hands, if really it was in his hands. Can any one believe, that ſuch immenſe ſums, 2, 3, or £.400,000, ſhould have lain for long periods of time, for 6, 8, or 10 months, periſhing in his hands? Was he not to have apprized the King's agent of ſo very unfortunate a circumſtance, ſo as to have provided againſt future waſte or depreciation, if theſe had been the unavoidable conſequences of the times and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances? Had he (R. M.) not foreſeen, and previouſly intended to apply thoſe monies to his own purpoſes, and was not this the conſideration he had in view when he reluctantly conſented to tranſact J. H's affairs?</p>
            <p>R. M. being challenged by the letter of the 23d of January, 1784, of the agent general, with having refuſed to keep ſeparate books for the public concerns, he anſwers:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I do acknowledge that you propoſed my opening a ſet of books for the buſineſs of the Royal Marine; but, upon my objecting that a multiplicity of books <note n="*" place="bottom">According to this writer, to open a ſet of books for all public concerns, ſeparate from all others, would have created confuſion, and given riſe to errors; to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> according to him, is to confound matters, to ſubject an accountant to a greater chance of error; and this was his motive for refuſing to open one more ſeparate ſet of books diſtinct from his own.</note> were apt to create confuſion and ſubjected accountants to a greater chance of error, you acquieſced to the introduction of thoſe, as well as the private affairs entruſted to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, <note n="§" place="bottom">The management of his friends affairs and concerns was entruſted by J. H. to R. M. and by this means R. M. became their agent, and has accounted for his agency to them.</note> into my books, and after that acquieſcence, objections made now, to anſwer your own purpoſes, can have no weight, eſpecially as the accounts I render are juſt, fair, and honorable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By refuſing to enter the accounts of the public tranſactions in ſeparate books, in oppoſition to J. H's repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, R. M. thus put it out of the power of the King's agent to look into, or to know the ſituation of the public affairs, as to the matter of monies on hand: he could not have made out on the books of R. M. the caſh account of the Royal Marine, his own, and that of his friends, without knowing alſo the ſituation of R. M. as to money in cheſt; and without being more or leſs acquainted with his ſpeculations and affairs, and thoſe of his agents and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. But this could not have been permitted, and thus the agent general was to be kept in the dark. By theſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:044903_0025_101F4F36EFED0EE8"/>
means did R. M. alone become reſponſible for the conſequences of his refuſal to accede, at the time, to J. H's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal; which was a proper and neceſſary one, and ſuch as being afterwards made to Meſſrs. Turnbull <note n="‡" place="bottom">Their evidence on the trial is to be taken, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with the conduct of R. M. and a pretty contraſt it will be indeed; for every eulogium, as to truth and candor, is deſerved by them, and their accounts give ſomething of a profit to the King, inſtead of the enormous loſs we have to complain of; they were employed for the ſame buſineſs, public and private, of J. H. they were requeſted to keep ſeparate books and a ſeparate cheſt, and it was done; they never ſold a bill but for an expenditure actually made or making; they were confidentially employed, and every truſt was repoſed in them, and they know that they were reſponſible for that truſt, though the King had conferred on them no authority.</note> and Co. was moſt cheerfully complied with. R. M. would not grant this requeſt; yet, as J. H. placed the utmoſt confidence in his <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> as he conceived that his ſervices would be highly uſeful to the King, and as the choice of him, for rendering ſuch ſervices, had been made by his Excellency Mr. Gerard, as well as by J. H. he (J. H.) would not <hi>change</hi> his agent for this ſole reaſon; eſpecially as he knew, that this <hi>agent's refuſal</hi> of opening ſeparate books, would render him ſtill more and more reſponſible for all the conſequences thereof—a <hi>refuſal</hi> grounded on ſo weak and frivolous a pretence, ſo void of truth and reaſon. In fact, J. H. objected at the time to the entering of the public accounts on R. M's private books; he objects now to the impropriety of the meaſure, and always thought the refuſal, to keep them ſeparate and diſtinct, very improper. J. H. never did freely acquieſce in, but ſubmitted to the refuſal, becauſe R. M. would not do otherwiſe; and therefore R. M. is now charged with the conſequences thereof, by his employer.</p>
            <p>Shall not R. M. be reſponſible, when he alone did know, or could know the amount of the expenditures making, or to be made, and the amount of the bills on France neceſſary for defraying thoſe expenditures? He alone did and could know the amount of the public monies, or private monies on hand; the management whereof, to ſave them from periſhing, to ſave the King from loſs, himſelf and his friends from ruin, J. H. had entruſted to R. M. to his good faith and attention, to his agency, upon the moſt confidential reliance on his fidelity and abilities, on the ſame footing and principles, as the public buſineſs.</p>
            <p>How much more ſtrong will this reaſoning appear; how weak and flimſy the excuſe offered by R. M. and how glaring his criminal intentions, at the time to keep J. H. his employer, and all others in the dark; when it ſhall be rendered evident that the eſtimates made, the accounts given to J. H. as ſettled accounts, (though only ſettled by R. M. <hi>in his own behalf</hi>) are not exact; that the balances are untrue and fallacious, and all in his favor, all contrived to eſtabliſh the grounds of obtaining further ſums of money, and bills on France, in order to ſecure the whole to himſelf, to work the plan of depreciation in his defence, and to maintain at a future day, that an immenſe property was waſted thereby in his hands, and had vaniſhed like ſnow before the ſun: all this will appear by the accounts to which we refer the reader, and to the obſervations thereon. Nay, when large nominal ſums of the public paper, then ſaid to be periſhing in his hands, were ſtill to be accounted for, when heavy ſums of the ſame money, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to J. H. or his friends, were ſuppoſed to be in his cheſt, and were alſo to be accounted for; if it ſhould appear that he was ſtill claiming <note n="*" place="bottom">A ſum of 169,000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois, was claimed by R.

Turnbull &amp; Co.</note> balances in his favor, claiming bills for <hi>advances,</hi> which he ſaid, <hi>he had made</hi> on the public account; will it not be as clear as day light, that even as banker, or depoſitary, R. M. was untrue, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate and unjuſt? Will it not therefore be believed, that when he refuſed to keep ſeparate books, he meant to keep the agent general in the dark, to abuſe his truſt, and to profit by the confidence repoſed in him? Was not this refuſal neceſſary, to conceal the conſequences of the premature and untimely ſale of the bills, and of depreciation of money, which, he ſays, did periſh in his hands; leſt a redreſs of grievances might have been ſued for at a more early
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:044903_0026_101F4F391CB56938"/>
period, or rather, that he might have time to accompliſh a ſettlement, and obtain a full <note n="†" place="bottom">We muſt here refer the reader to ſome obſervations made on R.

            <p>Was it not on account of theſe terrible conſequences, that R. M. would not ſend on the 26th of February, 1784, (vide page 18) the vouchers in ſupport of thoſe accounts, he then forwarded to J. H. with his famous letter of that date? Was it not for fear of theſe conſequences, that he writes on the 2d and 3d of March, that he will not even give communication of theſe vouchers, without all claim of depreciation is formally and for ever given up, previous to all communication thereof? Was it not through the fear of theſe conſequences, that he intimates (page 14) that he conceived it was of <hi>no importance</hi> to aſcertain the preciſe dates of receipt and payment of paper money. Was it not through fear of theſe conſequences that he writes a letter in 16 long and full pages, to prove that J. H. had no claim whatever for depreciation on him, during the whole of his agency; forgetting that he himſelf urged and got paſſed a law, declaring that every one ſhall receive and allow depreciation on all unſettled accounts.</p>
            <p>Beſides the accounts and the balances of the eſtimates, which R. M. ſays he made at the time, we ſhall find other proofs of the claims he made for his advances on behalf of the Royal Marine, as early as the 11th of March, 1779. Vide his letter, page 16.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The account ſales of bills of exchange, dated the 11th of March, 1779, contains a ſale to Peter Whiteſide of 91,428 <hi>Livres</hi> 5 <hi>ſols,</hi> of which one bill for 4571 <hi>Livres</hi> 7 <hi>ſols</hi> was on his account; the remainder (equal to £.3800 ſterling) was on your and my joint account taken at the current rate, towards reducing the advances which had been made for the Royal Marine: and afterwards I agreed to give you the ſum of £.5700 (continental Money) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance on your half, for which you are credited the 12th of May, in your account current, being a profit you gained thereon.</q>
—A little further he ſays, "And yet you aſk me for depreciation on thoſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Referring to another ſum of 54,722 <hi>Livres,</hi> 18 <hi>ſols,</hi> paid to him by J.

            <p>The firſt object that ſtrikes, in this paſſage of the letter, is the ſale made to Peter Whiteſide (Peter Whiteſide and Co. was the houſe of R. M. in which he held 3 ſhares in 4) of bills which belonged to him, as he ſays, on account of his actual advances for the Royal Marine, and were taken afterwards for his and J. H's joint account. It will be neceſſary that the books of P. Whiteſide be examined, to ſee whether any mention is made of this ſale, and whether he did not gratuitouſly endorſe theſe bills to the order of R. M. which muſt have been done to cover the ſale, and give room for a charge of a commiſſion, &amp;c. This is the more neceſſary, in order to ground further minute inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of R. M's books, in this and other reſpects; and to eſtabliſh, whethe he was or was not, under the date of the 11th of March, 1779, in advance for the public account, as he now ſays, and as he told J. H. at the time. If he was not in advance for the Royal Marine at that period,—if, on the contrary, he then owed the Royal Marine, or had on hand, more than £.100,000 continental, belonging to the King, did he not deceive J. H. then, and in his letter of the 26th of February, 1784? What ſhall we believe from him? Does he not owe theſe bills, which he confeſſes having taken, under the cover of a fictitious ſale? Has he not taken any more, and how could he ſay, that J. H. was in advance for half the ſum? Was not this alſo impoſing on his underſtanding? Was it not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the purpoſe of loading J. H. with depreciation afterwards, on that part of the bills (ſays R. M.) taken on his account, that R. M. preſſed J. H. to let him have thoſe bills in order to offer the £.5700 continental of <hi>advance,</hi> as expreſſed in the accounts under the date of the 12th of May, 1770; and afterwards offered them to J. H. by

Swanwick, at the exchange of 100 for 1, at a later period—ſay in 1781—that <hi>advance</hi> being worth, and to be valued in May, 1779, at 24 for 1? This is what R. M. calls a clear profit, gained by J. H. on the ſum of £.1900 ſterl. in bills of exchange, the whole of which he took to himſelf; and afterwards adds—
<q>How can you aſk for me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Page 13, his words run thus
<q>I have already mentioned, that I deſired you to write me on this ſubject of deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I might have <hi>an opportunity,</hi> once for all, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> it; I will add, that I did not imagine, you would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly advance ſuch a claim.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He certainly has wonderfully availed himſelf of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; but it will not be, I ſuppoſe, once for all, as he ſays. He adds in the very ſame page,
<q>Remember, Sir, that my tranſactions with you were merely of the nature of a truſt.</q>
                     </p>
                  </note> on this buſineſs, on a tranſaction wherein you have actually received the benefit of the actual depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation?</q>
Is not this an aſtoniſhing queſtion, made in a letter wrote to that very man to whom R. M. refuſes all depreciation during his agency, and wherein, alſo, he reprobates J. H's claiming depreciation on a tranſaction where it has been granted by himſelf as early as the month of May, 1779? When ſitting as his own judge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt J. H. and himſelf, R. M. grants the principle of depreciation in May, 1779, by an impulſe of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, of his own knowledge of right and wrong,—depreciation for two months, from the 11th of March, 1779, to the 12th of May following,—and refuſes it in 1784 on this very ſum, and others received by him during the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing months and years! He reproaches the agent general for claiming it in his own affairs, but much more in the public account; forgetting, we ſuppoſe, that he had got unjuſtly and without any cauſe, the whole ſum of £.3800 ſterling, as now appears evident from the vouchers. A great part of theſe vouchers were obtained from R. M. when ſitting on an arbitration, in the month of June, 1784, and not before.</p>
            <p>Can we not here ſay, and with ſome ground, <hi>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat?</hi> If it is proved, as it will be, that, he was not in advance on the 11th of March, 1779, is it not clear that R. M. miſapplied thoſe bills (for £.3800 ſterling) induced thereto by the agent general's confidence in him?—If at other various periods, under the pretences of his advances, <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>By the eſtimate of R. M. ſaid by him, to have been ſettled by J. H. in preſence of his Excellency Mr. Gerard, under the date of Auguſt, 1779, he brings the Royal Marine in debt for £.192,692-11-6 continental, by his mode of ſtating the account, and therein ſays, as well as in his letter of February, 1784, "That he was then actually in advance for the Royal Marine, although by the face thereof, a balance of £.163,355-8-6, appear againſt him. In December, 1779, he gives an account to J. H. of his ſituation in money, with R. M. and brings J. H. in debt to him £.91,073-18-8, at the very time that he owed J. H. near £.500,000. Theſe are the nominal accounts, furniſhed by him as banker and depoſitor.</p>
                  <p>In 1781, he furniſhes the account of the Royal Marine, and brings the King in debt for £.450,000,—when he actually did owe a very heavy ſum of more than £.100,000, nominal, beſides 169,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> taken in bills on France, on account of the above balance, in the year, 1780.</p>
               </note> of balances in his favor, &amp;c. R. M. did claim more bills at the very time he owed nominal ſums to the Royal Marine, and immenſe ſums, nominal and real, to J. H. and his friends, on their private account (—which ſums he was alſo in duty bound to appropriate for the public ſervice, before he could, without injuſtice to them and J. H. have ſold any one bill—) and if, under thoſe circumſtances, he did actually take up more bills from the Royal Marine—does he not owe them to the King, being taken without cauſe, or to Holker's abſent friends? Eſpecially if he had then in hand their money to purchaſe the bills therewith; and this muſt have been the caſe, ſince he exclaims—Can I be ſo weak as to make good depreciation, ſince J. H's money <hi>was periſhing in my hands, was waſting in cheſt?</hi>—Perhaps, however, it was employed for his own purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the reſult of the reflections and opinions of the readers hereof on the foregoing obſervations, it is now proper to tranſcribe another paſſage of R. M's letter, which fixes the time during which his firſt principles of accounting are to take effect; for we muſt obſerve, that theſe are only of ſhort duration, not general, not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.—
<q>From the time I ceaſed (ſays R. M. page 17) to be your agent, our accounts are no longer to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:044903_0028_101F4F4033AFBC38"/>
as of the nature of a truſt, neither are the accounts between Wm. Turnbull and Co. and me of that nature; I am, therefore, willing to ſettle my accounts with them, and thoſe with you for <hi>ſubſequent tranſactions upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of depreciation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From this we are to conclude, that while any confidence, dependence, or truſt is repoſed in him, for ſo long all monies entruſted to him are to be permitted to periſh in his hands; all concerns confided to his integrity, judgment, and knowledge, are to be forgot or unnoticed as unworthy of attention; <hi>no depreciation</hi> whatever is to be allowed: but when no dependence, as he ſays, is placed on his talents and fidelity, he will, of his own motion and accord, allow that the principle of depreciation ſhall take place between him and J. H. in all caſes, where he was no longer to act as agent for the King's intereſt, the intereſt of J. H. and that of his friends! Is it R. M. who reaſons thus? What are then his ideas of fidelity, truſt, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let it however be admitted, for a while, that theſe principles are grounded on the ſolid baſis of honeſty, and that they will lead to ſubſtantial juſtice, from the accountant R. M. to his employer J. H.—Then put the queſtion— Do the accounts of his agency, thoſe ſent with his letter of the 26th of February, 1784, agree with theſe principles? The anſwer may be collected from what follows:</p>
            <p>William Turnbull and Co. his ſucceſſors in the agency, began their operations in the firſt days of January, 1780; they credit in <note n="§" place="bottom">The deed of copartnerſhip between R. M. and Wm. Turnbull under the ratio of Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. is dated and was ſigned by them, on the 27th day of December, 1779.</note> account R. M. under the date of the 1ſt of January of that year, for 120,000 dollars, paid by him to Blair M'Clenachan, for the leaſe of the houſe they have occupied ſince that date; and, R. M. ſays, he credited them in account for <note n="‖" place="bottom">Theſe form a part of the 169,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> given to R. M. on account of the advances he pretended to have made on the public account.</note> 54,722 <hi>Livres</hi> 18 <hi>ſols</hi> Tournois, in bills he received from them, order of J. H. as their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployer; they delivered theſe bills as agents for J. H. therefore he acknowledges, by his ſaid letter, that they were actually his agents under the date of the 15th of February, 1780.<note n="*" place="bottom">A circumſtance which happened to Mr. Wm. Turnbull, about that period, deſerves to be noticed here: He waited upon the widow lady, owner of the houſe which he afterwards occupied, to inform her in his own name and that of R. M. that he had purchaſed the remaining leaſe thereof, from the gentleman who had lately occupied it, and for which R. M. had paid by agreement, a ſum of £.45,000, which were therefore a clear profit to that gentleman: he was deſired to relate this circumſtance to the lady, and to inform her in the name of the company, that the annual rent would be regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid her in ſpecie, let the currency be what it would: and that they not only looked upon it, as their duty, <hi>but abhorred the idea of availing themſelves of depreciation.</hi> This was ſaid to make the lady eaſy in her mind, and alſo for giving her a plea, for claiming the actual full value of the ſum of £.300, ſpecie, due for the rent 1779, by the late occupier who, it was ſaid, offered her only the £.300, in paper money, or a ſum inadequate to the real value of the rent: did R. M. here act upon truſt, or upon honour? If ſuch were his <hi>principles,</hi> in December, 1779, why ſhould <hi>they</hi> vary ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely in 1784, why ſhould he now ſay, that he never thought he was to account for the bills, but merely for their nominal proceeds?—Wm. Turnbull's teſtimony to be taken on this fact.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us weigh the words that follow the above tranſcribed paragraph—
<q>I find that at the time (No. 1.) when the Royal Marine <hi>owed me</hi> upwards of three hundred and forty thouſand pounds continental currency, I had in my (No. 3.) hands of your private funds, and thoſe of your friends, nearly to the amount of three hundred thouſand pounds continental; and, as I continued <hi>to receive more after that period,</hi> I readily agree (No. 6.) to ſet aſide Mr. Swanwick's propoſition of valuing the balance in continental money, on your private account, at one hundred for one; he meant to do juſtice between us; but it did not occur to him (No. 2.) that <hi>I had</hi> received on account of the balance in <hi>my favor,</hi> on <hi>your account,</hi> as agent of the Royal Marine, the ſum of £.342,775 - 2 - 6 continental money, when it was worth ſixty-one and a half for one, and that having at the ſame time near
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:044903_0029_101F4F4539BBC900"/>
£.300,000 of yours and your friends in my hands, you ought to have the like value for at leaſt the latter amount; and, therefore, to ſave all <hi>trouble of inveſtigation</hi> (No. 5.) as to the exact ſum, I agree (No. 4.) to compute the ſame ſum which I received £.342,775 - 2 - 6—at ſixty-one and a half, and bring the amount thereof to your credit in the hard money account,—this (No. 7.) I think <hi>is juſt,</hi> and therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> I offer it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No. 1. Here he ſays, that the Royal Marine <hi>owed him</hi> more than £.340,000—</p>
            <p>No. 2. He ſays,
<q>it did not occur to Swanwick that I had received on account of the balance in <hi>my favor,</hi> on <hi>your account,</hi> as agent of the Royal Marine, the ſum of £.342,775 - 2 - 6.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How are we to reconcile theſe two ſentences? Did the Royal Marine owe this ſum to R. M. or to J. H.? What does the writer mean? Could ſuch ideas occur to Swanwick or any other? However, it had occurred to R. M. to receive £.342,775 - 2 - 6, inſtead of £.340,000, which he ſays were due to him at the very time that not <hi>one farthing</hi> was due to him! On the contrary, he then owed more than £.30,000 ſpecie to the Royal Marine alone, if juſtice is done to him and the King.</p>
            <p>No. 3. Here R. M. acknowledges, that three hundred thouſand pounds, of Holker's friends money, were then in his hands, at the very time that he took £.342,775 - 2 - 6 from the Royal Marine, which he ſays were due to him! If he took this ſum at the time, why did he not pay J. H's friends? If he took the amount of £.342,775 - 2 - 6 in bills from Holker's agents, why did he not give thoſe bills to J. H's friends? If he kept the bills for his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is he not to pay them to his friends, with intereſt from their date? If he took them on account of a ſuppoſed balance, ſaid to be due to him by the Royal Marine, is he not to return them with intereſt, to the Royal Marine? It is his buſineſs to extricate himſelf from this embarraſsment; it is his part to get out of the dilemma, into which his own avowal has plunged him, if he can; for, really, we cannot, on this occaſion, come to his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>No. 4. Here he offers the balance, which he ſays he had received, namely £.342,775 - 2 - 6, (and which he ſuppoſes to be due, when he ceaſed to be agent for J. H.) at the exchange of ſixty-one and a half for one,—the rate of depreciation in April 1780—But why does he not offer it at the exchange of December, 1779, when the balance was due, and he had ceaſed to act as public agent—or of January, 1780, when Wm. Turnbull and Co. had commenced agents; was it becauſe the exchange <hi>then</hi> being at ſixty-one and a half, inſtead of forty in January, he thereby would only pay two thirds of the ſum he owed in January? The auditors will eſtabliſh this point, nor ſhall we hereafter forget the propoſal.</p>
            <p>No. 5. R. M. ſeems very deſirous of avoiding all inveſtigation, as to the exact ſum due to J. H. or to his friends, at this as well as any other period, and therefore No. 6, he readily agrees to lay aſide Swanwick's propoſal of one hundred for one; he adds No. 7, this I think is juſt, and therefore I offer it.</p>
            <p>But to return to the object of depreciation, let us take up the accounts, which were tranſmitted by R. M. with his letter of the 26th of February, 1784. There we ſhall find a ſum of £.150,000 continental, and 2½ per cent. commiſſion <note n="*" place="bottom">This is a ſingular commiſſion, claimed only in 1784, on a ſum never before charged in the public account, and on a ſum paid in the firſt days of June, 1780, by a credit to be given by Wm. Smith, (R. M's. correſpondent) to Meſſrs. Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. agents for J. H.</note> thereon, charged to the debit of the Royal Marine,—for ſo much he paid to J. H. with his conſent, by his order dated the 30th of May, 1780, to William Smith Eſq. of Baltimore, when he directed him to credit in account, Meſſrs. Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. as agents for J. H. for the above ſum of £.150,000, and for which he ſays, he was to underſtand with J. H. How, therefore, could R. M. preſume to bring this charge againſt the Royal Marine, for a payment made on the thirtieth of May, 1780, and to the credit of J. H's. agents, when his public
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:044903_0030_101F4F4715495740"/>
agency had ceaſed in December, 1779?—He acknowledges that he is willing to allow the principle of depreciation, at the cloſe of his agency, and to extend it to all ſums he received at a later period:—and yet he does not think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to avail himſelf of the advantage of his own propoſal, when he pays money on account: certainly, this man muſt be moved by ſome extraordinary principle of action, on this occaſion: and this may be readily conceived of one ſo ſtrenuous in exertions in his own favour. Here he refuſes the exchange of ſixty for one on the foregoing £. 150,000, <note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>However, upon a cloſer examination, the true motive will be diſcovered, and the original leading principles of this man be eſtabliſhed:—Without this charge of £. 150,000, nominal, R. M. would have fallen conſiderably in debt to the Royal Marine, at that very period, at which he declares, that £. 342,000 and more were due to him, and this would not look well. Upon further inveſtigation, it will be alſo acknowledged, that this charge and commiſſion are to act nominally, though not virtually and in fact, againſt a ſum of 450,000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois given him in bills in March, 1779, <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide J. H's obverſations on the public account, and his ſtatement thereof.</note> and which he then claimed on account of his <hi>actual</hi> advances, the whole of which large ſum, equal to more than £. 20,000 ſterling, has <hi>melted waſted away,</hi> and <hi>periſhed totally</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> through a <hi>premature unneceſſary</hi> ſale which occaſioned conſequent depreciation, as he ſays, in his hands: therefore we muſt own that, though R. M's mode of reaſoning is not always clear, juſt and conſiſtent, ſtill his actions, his principles and manner of preſenting and redacting eſtimates and accounts to his advantage, are perfectly conſiſtent; all calculated to acquire an overgrown fortune, at the expence of <hi>truth,</hi> of <hi>juſtice,</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>employer,</hi> of <hi>him</hi> whom he termed his <hi>boſom friend,</hi> of <hi>him</hi> who wiſhing to throw equitable advantages in the hands of R. M. had confidentially entruſted him with the means, and generouſly ſeconded his oftenſible views. But, can this be allowed? Shall R. M. involve this ſum in his accounts, in order to make theſe nominal £. 150,000, <note n="§" place="bottom">Let the reader here remark, that in January, 1779, R. M. had forgot to charge a ſum of £.99,080-10-0 againſt the Royal Marine, for which J. H. was to account to the King in his own ſtatement of his Boſton operations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is probable that theſe £. 150,000 are introduced in the year 1784, into the accounts of R. M's agency for the year 1779, in order to counterbalance this heavy omiſſion of a charge of ſuch conſequence, in January, 1779. But thereby he makes another nominal miſtake of more than £.50,000 in his own favor. Such is the extreme regularity of R. M's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal mode of accounting, under his favorite ſuppoſition of his being a banker—a mere depoſitary of continental cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</note> paid in Baltimore, (when he knew not probably what to do with the money) be brought in the public account of <hi>his</hi> agency, at the very time that he actually owed J. H. in his private account, near three times this ſum, and probably twenty times the ſum in real ſpecie, if the law, equity, uſage and a ſcale of depreciation are to govern and take place throughout his tranſactions? This ſcale it would be neceſſary to eſtabliſh, in order to explain his operations and mode of action, even if juſtice did not require it.</p>
            <p>I will here remind the reader of theſe obſervations, that the principles he lays down in his letter, he does not even follow in thoſe very accounts, which he ſends to his employer on the very ſame day; or rather he chooſes in his letter to expreſs one idea, and as an accountant to follow another, much better calculated to cover his mode of operation: nor is he more conſiſtent in his <hi>argument</hi> on this occaſion than in his propoſals or principles of account render.</p>
            <p>On the argument, we have ſeen that he maintains, he was only a banker and depoſitary for J. H. during the whole of his agency. The tranſactions between J. H. and R. M. were merely of the nature of a truſt, ſays the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:044903_0031_101F4F496359CE00"/>
latter: and therefore he will not allow any depreciation, nor account on the principles of depreciation for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, during the whole period of his agency. His agency on the public buſineſs ceaſed in die firſt days of January, 1780, and becauſe he allows the principle of depreciation to take place on all <hi>occaſions ſubſequent thereto,</hi> either between Wm. Turnbull and Co. or him, or J. H. and R. M.—therefore, ſays our logician, I will fix the rate of value of the monies <hi>due to J. H. in December,</hi> by the <hi>ſcale in April</hi>; but I will fix no value on the monies I paid to Wm. Turnbull and Co. on the 30th of May, 1780, in Baltimore. Let us now aſk him, why he allows any depreciation whatever, to J. H. without working the good deed throughout? Is he aware of the conſequences of this his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion? Does he know, that by the ſame principle on which this conceſſion is grounded, he grants all that is claimed from him? For he muſt either be abſurd in the extreme, and erroneous in every one of his arguments, or he is guilty of injuſtice;—he muſt either be deprived of the uſe of reaſon, and be deſtitute of common ſenſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty, or he muſt give up the bills, unleſs he can procure a better title to them than appears in his letter.— And now for the proof of what is here advanced.</p>
            <p>R. M. maintains, that during his agency he was not anſwerable for depreciation of monies, put (he ſays) into his hands. Why? Becauſe he was only banker; he was not agent-reſponſible, not a bailiff in law; but only an <hi>agent-depoſitary,</hi> accountable only for nominal ſums of a periſhable currency:—in other words, he was accountable for the number of hogſheads of molaſſes put into his ſtore—for the mere hogſheads, and not for the contents.</p>
            <p>He afterwards argues, that when he was no longer agent, he can no longer be conſidered to have acted <hi>on truſt;</hi> and, therefore, he will grant the principle of depreciation.</p>
            <p>Now let it be obſerved, that according to theſe ideas, if he ceaſed to be agent he ceaſed alſo to be a banker or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitary. The queſtion, therefore, in this view, is—what became of R. M? Quis invenit? I know not of a deſcription by which we can afterwards legally define his ſubſequent character or functions. He denied in his firſt poſition, that he was reſponſible for J. H's concerns; he was not bailiff, becauſe he was only agent upon truſt, id eſt, ſays he, banker and depoſitary. Afterwards, when come to nothing, when he has no known legal or avowed mercantile character and denomination, then he ſays—after I ceaſed to be your agent, then I will allow the principle of depreciation; but as it is difficult for him to change his character, we muſt reaſon thus: he allows of depreciation when he ceaſed to be agent, becauſe he was no longer employed <hi>upon truſt</hi>; and, therefore, we ſay, becauſe he was banker and depoſitary only. It is unlucky for him in this caſe, that he muſt alſo allow depreciation on the preceding accounts; becauſe he maintains that he was then alſo banker and depoſitary.—For one and the ſame principle muſt be followed throughout; unleſs principles reſpecting his accounts are to change with the new year, and that the principle of depreciation is not to be attended to in 1779, but only in 1780. If he denies this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning to be fair and juſt, then he muſt fall into the following abſurdity and argue thus: While I was agent (id eſt banker) I will not allow the principle when I ceaſed to be agent then I will allow the principle, becauſe I received the ſubſequent monies not as agent, but only as banker.</p>
            <p>However, to put an end to all ſuch puerile jargon, it is neceſſary to remind him, that he never ceaſed to be agent of J. H. in thoſe concerns entruſted to his management, from the moment they came under his notice and care to this hour: he <hi>only</hi> ceaſed in December, 1779, to act as agent in <hi>new concerns</hi> on the <hi>public account</hi>: he is yet accountable for the previous tranſactions; though he diſcontinued and cloſed his operations early in 1780, and might then have rendered his accounts thereof, if he had thought proper not to delay the ſettlement, having been conſtantly preſſed on this ſcore. In 1780, he engaged for and with J. H. on his private account, in ſome new concerns, after that ſame period, at which, he ſays, we are to conſider his agency as terminated.—Of the whole
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:044903_0032_101F4F4B1F7A2E88"/>
concerns and balances, in his hands, he owes accounts; and we are obliged to bring ſuits at law, to obtain ſuch as juſtice and equity preſcribe.</p>
            <p>If R. M. never ceaſed to be J. H's agent and bailiff and banker, as he contends in ſome inſtances, why ſhould he allow the principle of depreciation in 1780 and 1781? Was it becauſe in theſe laſt years he only received pence, and becauſe he received pounds, in 1777, 1778 and 1779? The reaſon is then moſt admirable, though it would aggravate the injuſtice. Whether banker, or broker, or agent and bailiff, he owes depreciation, according to his own conviction and principle, from the time, when he <hi>firſt commenced to act</hi> on the concerns of J. H. in his private and public capacity: eſpecially, as he previouſly engaged to act for his intereſt and that of the King, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to ſave them and guard them and J. H's friends, from damage, loſs and ruin: —he was agent or banker reſponſible on a ſcale of depreciation in the end of the buſineſs and, of courſe, in the beginning and progreſs thereof: nor can any diſtinction be made between thoſe intereſts and concerns, which relate to the public ſervice from thoſe of a private nature; nor can any difference of principle or of value be made, between the King's bills and dollars of Congreſs's money, or J. H's dollars and his friends' dollars and bills.</p>
            <p>Thus far, we believe the argument againſt R. M. to be juſt, candid and true; and if granted, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if R. M. owes depreciation on the proceeds of thoſe bills he ſold, becauſe the ſales were unneceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no employment for their proceeds, or becauſe he had other public or private monies, given to him for the ſervice, periſhing in his hands—he alſo muſt make good the loſs on the ſale of thoſe bills; for he ſold them without cauſe. Having proved that he took the very bills in kind, under the cover of falſe and fictitious ſales, made to his partner Whiteſide, we have a right to preſume he ſold the other bills, which he afterwards claimed in that ſame month at leaſt, ſay March 1779, in order to apply the proceeds to his private ſpeculations and purpoſes, when money would command any thing on the moſt advantageous terms; or to preſume that he alſo got other perſons to endorſe other bills for him; and this is but juſt to ſuppoſe and believe, unleſs he will produce freely and fully his books, caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, &amp;c. in order to convince us that he was only guilty of taking improperly one ſum of £.3,800 ſterling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying one farthing at the time on account thereof. This argument and the conſequences are fair; for the money could not have periſhed in his hands, if he had not <note n="*" place="bottom">In his letter of February, 1784, he makes it, or inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it as, a charge againſt J. H. that he drew the bills on France, before the expenditures took place.</note> 
               <hi>ſold</hi> the bills <hi>before the expenditures took place</hi>; nor would the bills have been ſold at all, for much the greater part were never neceſſary for the ſupplies or expenditures of the navy and its ſervice; therefore the unjuſtifiable <hi>ſale</hi> of theſe bills did occaſion the loſs on the ſale, with the loſs by depreciation on the proceeds thereof, if any did happen. Thus R. M. is in duty and in conſcience bound to make good theſe bills and their intereſt <note n="†" place="bottom">At leaſt the public ſervice is not to ſuffer, either thro' the miſconduct of R. M. or J. H. and to its intereſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the court, auditors and jury are particularly to attend.</note> in the Royal Treaſury in France, through the King's agent; becauſe this loſs has occaſioned additional loans to the King's miniſter, which loans have incurred the burthen of heavy intereſt in the time of war: and this conſideration is the more to be <note n="§" place="bottom">Becauſe this intereſt may be claimed from J. H. merely becauſe he relled and depended upon the good faith and honor of R. M. though he ſhould not have received any from him.</note> attended to, eſpecially as this war was waged to ſave R. M. from ruin, and his country from the ravages of an implacable herd of foes.—Nor can any of his fellow citizens ſcruple to admit theſe principles, when they will conſider the nature of the truſt repoſed in R. M. and of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet up by him in his defence, and when they will recollect that he knew all theſe conſequences, ſince he ſays, (page 15) in order to criminate the agent, or to terrify him from his duty—that had he been in the place of J. H. he would not have drawn for the King's money until it was wanted for the King's ſervice—they will readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:044903_0033_101F4F52A7B24EC8"/>
that tho' R. M. reaſons like a child in this letter, he knew enough of depreciation, at leaſt in 1779, to have kept the bills on hand, rather than to have ſold them without cauſe or neceſſity, if he had not had ſome excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtment to make of the proceeds, ſome great ſpeculation to enter upon, ſufficient to make good all poſſible claims againſt him; otherwiſe he would not have ſold them to poſſeſs himſelf of a periſhable article, in order to let it waſte in cheſt, much leſs have reproached his employer J. H. with the folly and injuſtice of his conduct in drawing the bills on France, in order to ſcreen himſelf from the conſequences of ſelling them. No one can ſuppoſe R. M. igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his duty, nor of the nature of paper money. Why, therefore, did he thus ſacrifice the King's <note n="*" place="bottom">This muſt appear horrid indeed, and it is but too true; unleſs R. M. can explain all his conduct, and juſtify it on better ground by his books, &amp;c.</note> intereſt in the firſt inſtance, and afterwards attempt to ſacrifice the King's agent, as an atonement for his own want of fidelity to both King and agent?</p>
            <p>After what has been ſaid, we may now tranſcribe ſome further paſſages of this letter, in order to throw ſome additional light on the ſubject. When called upon to ſeparate from his accounts thoſe relative to the tranſactions perſonal only to J. H. in order to ſhew the advantages gained by R. M's operations, ſo as to oppoſe them to the loſſes ſuſtained by depreciation—our ingenious writer anſwers, (page 14)
<q>But I neither mean nor pretend to any ſuch thing; I have already ſaid, and again repeat, I aſk no credit for any ſavings; I am not accountable<note n="†" place="bottom">This he has ſome right to maintain, becauſe he never made one ſaving, either for the King or his employer; but he ſacrificed by depreciation more than £.39,000 ſpecie, to pay twelve; or, rather, he ſacrificed £.20,000 ſterling in bills, and loſt the whole ſum (as he ſays) while he was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing £.12,000 Pennſylvania currency, with other bills and monies given him alſo, and ſufficient for the whole ſervice. Well may he wiſh to pay no looſings!</note> for any looſings; nor will I compenſate to the King or to you for any depreciation during my agency in your affairs. At the ſame time it is not clear to me, that you would not have to pay rather than receive on the King's account; for at the time <note n="§" place="bottom">With what grace will not this ſuppoſition appear, when it is known, that by the inveſtigation of the accounts it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that more than £.100,000 continental currency was due by him at that very time, and that at that period the above total loſs of the bills had taken place. Well may he inſiſt that this account was ſettled in Auguſt, 1779.</note> when the ſettlement was made before Mr. Gerard, <hi>I was actually in advance,</hi> though from the accounts <hi>the balance is conſiderably againſt me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo ſays, (page 14)
<q>Whether during the whole time there was or <hi>was not a balance</hi> in my hands, is <hi>totally immaterial</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">But not quite ſo <hi>immaterial</hi> to him in the time of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, practicable on many of thoſe faithful whigs, who were willing to devote their fortunes to the ſafety and independence of their country.</note> 
                  <hi>to me:</hi> it was always ready at your order to draw it out when you pleaſed: I repeatedly, at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, made eſtimates for your government in this reſpect, and my books and papers were always open to you: thus much Sir, I have thought proper to ſay on the general principle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He, however, in the remaining part of his letter, ſays much more on the ſame ſubject. But to the point—Who can believe that his books and papers were always open to J. H. when he had ſuch ſtrong reaſons to conceal the true ſituation of the affairs of the Navy from his employer: when he pretends that an eſtimate <note n="**" place="bottom">Alias the public account, ſigned by his Excellency Mr. Gerard and J. H. in September, 1779.</note> was an account ſettled; when he refuſes <hi>all</hi> communication of all vouchers, <note n="§§" place="bottom">Vide the letters of R. M. to J. H. dated the 2d and 3d of March, 1784.</note> relative to his agency, during the year 1779,—in ſupport of accounts ſent only in 1784, unleſs <hi>all claim of depreciation,</hi> whatever, is previouſly and fully renounced againſt him: when be accuſes the agent general for having drawn thoſe bills, which he ſold afterwards to receive the proceeds: when he refuſes the uſe of his caſh-book<note n="††" place="bottom">Vide the queſtions and anſwers on the arbitration.</note> which would prove what he did with the proceeds of the bills, or with ſuch of the bills which he took in kind, under the pretence of his advances: when he refuſed to open
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:044903_0034_101F4F5496DFCDF0"/>
one ſeparate ſet of books for the agent's buſineſs, becauſe it would create confuſion, and give riſe to a greater chance of error: when he refuſed to give all and every information in his power, on the arbitration, though he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to lay the truth and the whole truth before his judges, and every document neceſſary to eſtabliſh the facts, which promiſe he previouſly made to his Excellency Mr. Van Berkel, before the bonds were agreed to be ſigned by J. H. &amp;c.—After ſuch conduct, who will believe that R. M's books and papers were always open to J. H? What are theſe abovementioned eſtimates? Are they conformable to the books? Are they conformable to the accounts rendered, and to thoſe to be ſettled by the auditors? Are they accurate, correct, full and true? Does not R. M. claim balances, by the eſtimates and accounts? Did he ever produce one account before April, 1780, by which a balance appeared to be due to J. H? How, therefore, can he ſay or pretend, that it was not his fault, if the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances due were not drawn out of his hands, or that theſe ſums of money, due by balance, were ready in his cheſt to J. H's order? Is not this aſſertion of R. M. untrue and erroneous, if it is proved by all the accounts, and by this ſame letter of the 26th of February, that he was always craving for more bills, becauſe, as he ſaid, <hi>he was in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>? How could he poſſibly be in advance for J. H. and at the ſame time maintain, that the balances due to J. H. (balances utterly unknown to J. H. on the public account, until the year 1784) were conſtantly kept on hand, to the order of the agent general, to draw them out when he pleaſed? And if this aſſertion is untrue, (and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as rendered originally and now profered, prove it to be untrue, and demonſtrate that he always concealed the balances due by him) will not this ſort of argument operate againſt himſelf, and prove that he owes depreciation, and the loſs of ſale upon the bills? His aſſertions, excuſes, and apologies, are not grounded on fact, on the ſolid baſis of truth. By attempting to prove his innocence, by defending with vehemence, and with unjuſt inſinuations againſt his employer, thoſe principles by which he inſiſts, that he is not to be made accountable for his tranſactions, is it not apparent that he knows, there are great looſings on his mode of eſtabliſhing the accounts, and that he fears the conſequences of his conduct will affect himſelf, and not the King, his employer, or his employers friends? It would have been much more to his honor and reputation, if he had ſaid leſs on the general principle.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould he be ſo much afraid of the conſequences? He is poſſeſſed of an immenſe fortune, acquired by the means above deſcribed, and by others, more or leſs laudable; but principally during 1778 and 1779,<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1778 and 1779 R. M. accounts to J. H. for 614,000 <hi>Livres</hi> given him in J. H's bills on France, all of which were duly honored; theſe were for the purchaſe of loan-office cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, bearing intereſt, payable in bills of Congreſs upon France. R. M. maintained on the arbitration that the whole money was neceſſary for the King's ſervice: however that may be, there is not a value of 500 dollars of certificates, bearing intereſt upon France, purchaſed by R. M.—Whether he did purchaſe any, could purchaſe any, or took any to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will hereafter explain. Poſſibly he may now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on the public trial, that the public monies were neceſſary for the purchaſe of certificates bearing intereſt upon France.</note> through the very heavy ſums entruſted to him by J. H. independent of the public account, and this will be proved by his books, if neceſſary. He has put the waſte and depreciation in his own ſcale, or pocket: beſides the uſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of J. H. he has moreover enjoyed the advantage of obtaining the moſt uſeful and early intelligence, from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral confidence repoſed in him by his employer, and other ſuperior characters; advantages, with which alone any reaſonable ſpeculator, ſituated as he was, might have been ſatisfied. Is he not, under theſe circumſtances, not only liable, according to all principles of equity and juſtice, but alſo able to make good all loſſes ariſing from the miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the public bills to his own purpoſes? And becauſe theſe bills, on the public and private account, amount to a large ſum, is he therefore not to pay the ſame? Is he to be excuſed from paying intereſt, when on the one hand it can be proved, that it was a breach of truſt in him to have ſold the bills, if there was no occaſion for making ſale thereof; and when on the other hand, he has brought ruin all around him, through ſuch a breach of truſt, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:044903_0035_101F4F57383B66A8"/>
dishonor <note n="†" place="bottom">If intereſt was not due to the King for the uſe, for the improper uſe of the public monies, or others, it would be due for damages done to J. H. by way of indemnity for delaying him in America, and withholding accounts ſo neceſſary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving him in every poſſible diſtreſs and difficulty.</note> on the head of his employer, both by his delays and the errors that his fallacious eſtimates and accounts have made him innocently commit, and unregardedly plunge into? Shall he not ſhew his books in ſuch buſineſs, to obviate all the ſuſpicions he has ſo juſtly given riſe to, on his account, and that of J. H?</p>
            <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that theſe and other arguments will be neglected on ſuch an important occaſion, where every thing dear, and precious, and valuable, is at ſtake between R. M. and J. H. the latter of whom will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be charged with infidelity to his truſt, unleſs juſtice be obtained from the former.</p>
            <p>J. H. certainly wiſhes he could terminate the preſent inveſtigation of R. M's letter and conduct; but his duty to his King and country, whom R. M. neither fears, nor values, urges him to every exertion on this important occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well as that which he owes to himſelf and family.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to proceed—page 13. we read, <q>The 15th of February, 1780, I received by your order bills to the amount of 54,722 <hi>Livres</hi> 18 <hi>ſols,</hi> which were, according to that order, received of Meſſrs. Turnbull and Co. whom I have credited for the ſame, at the then current price of 6 dollars per livre; afterwards 36,752 <hi>Livres</hi> 6 <hi>ſols</hi> Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois of theſe bills were paid for a brigantine, in which you and I were concerned, and 5500 <hi>Livres</hi> were ſold at one dollar advance, is Dollrs. 5500 and 12651 <hi>Livres</hi> at three dollars advance, is 37953
Dollars. 43453 for one half of this gain you are credited by me in account current on the 7th April, 1780; and on this ſum <note n="§" place="bottom">Here he paid depreciation till April, 1780; by his letter of the 26th of February, 1784, he offers to value the monies due then, by the ſcale of that month; but, forgetting this propoſal, by which he allows depreciation whatever, he here reproaches J. H. with improperly claiming depreciation. Is it R. M. who reaſons thus, or the then ſuperintendent of finance?</note> alſo you claim depreciation, when you have actually received it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to what has been ſaid on a ſimilar ſubject, reſpecting a ſum of £. 3800 ſterling, in bills ſold to Whiteſide, in May, 1779, (vide page 22.25) we muſt expreſs our ſurprize that he ſhould mention this ſum of 54,722 <hi>Livres</hi> 18 <hi>ſols,</hi> when ſpeaking of depreciation, ſince the remaining bills, not employed on joint account, in the purchaſe of a veſſel, being ſold in April, J. H. needs claim no depreciation on the 43,453 dollars (which he ſays, were a gain,) for this good reaſon, becauſe he actually offers it at the exchange or rate of ſcale in that month, but in 1781, R. M. (through Swanwick) had offered the advance dollars at the rate of 100 for one, and therefore J. H. had then at leaſt a right to claim another valuation from the principal R. M. and this is hereby confeſſed.</p>
            <p>Let us now aſk, For what reaſon does R. M. intereſt J. H. in theſe bills? Did he take them from William Turnbull &amp; Co. on their joint account, or on his account <hi>ſolely</hi>? What do Mr. Turnbull's books ſay on this occaſion, and thoſe of R. M? That Houſe debits him for theſe bills to the credit of the Royal Marine, on account of the balance claimed by him as due to him from the Royal Marine, becauſe he paid nothing on account thereof. In his accounts R. M. credits them for theſe bills, as bought from them, though by the foregoing entries, it would ſeem he did not buy them, but aſſumed them on account of the balance he then claimed, and on account whereof, he afterwards took many more, to the amount of 169,000 <hi>Livres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, he may pretend to have a right to charge J. H with the value of one half the bills paid for the brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Hawke, at the time, <note n="‡" place="bottom">N. B. This concern was entered into the accounts in the run of February, 1780—when R. M. was no longer J. H's public agent.</note> but then he ought to have paid the value to the agents of J. H. Meſſrs. Turnbull &amp; Co.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:044903_0036_101F4F5AC0AB6AD0"/>
becauſe no balance was due to him from the navy; but, on the contrary, he actually owed a balance at this very period, and he ought eſpecially to have paid for J. Holker's ſhare thereof, becauſe he owed a great deal more than his ſhare to him on his private account, or to that of his friends; but R. M. choſe here to aſſume the public bills on credit, and keep J. H's private monies employed otherwiſe for his own advantage. Shall he not pay intereſt on monies and bills thus obtained and thus detained?—</p>
            <p>The queſtions, therefore, on this ſubject are—Was a balance due to him or not? And how much, if any? Did he owe monies at the time to J. H? When 36,000 <hi>Livres</hi> were only neceſſary for this tranſaction, or rather, when he had only 18,000 <hi>Livres</hi> to claim from J. H. on account of his half of the brigantine, why then take 54,000 <hi>Livres</hi> from the ſubordinate agents of the Royal Marine, leaving J. H. to account to the King as he can, for the whole ſum, and which will not be very eaſy, ſince the ſale thereof was not neceſſary for the ſervice? Why take bills from J. H's agents without paying for them, when he had monies enough of his on hand to purchaſe J. H's ſhare of the bills? Would J. H. have conſented to this arrangement at all, if R. M. had not led him to believe in December, 1779, that he was in his debt by the accounts he produced and gave to J. H. for his government? Would he not have inſiſted that if R. M. wanted the bills he ſhould have paid for them, ſince thereby it would have prevented a ſale of a ſimilar ſum, on account of, and for the ſubſequent expenditures of the Royal Marine by the agents at the time? And is not R. M. anſwerable for theſe bills to the Royal Marine, ſince he did not pay for them, though, he ſays, he bought them; he charging J. H. for the value of 18,000 <hi>Livres</hi> paid on his account, taking to himſelf the gain on the remaining bills? This would be fair and juſt. Otherwiſe, would not J. H. be the dupe of the ſnares into which R. Morris's accounts and miſrepreſentations at the time led him unawares? We ſay ſnares, for R. M. could not be ignorant of their reciprocal ſituation, but this was not the caſe with J. H.</p>
            <p>If, notwithſtanding the foregoing reaſons, he ſhould perſiſt in refuſing to refund theſe bills thus unjuſtly taken, as we have proved, how can he inſiſt upon a quantity of tobacco (about 79 <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide the letter page 17—In this letter he refuſes to pay the bills he owes, but offers their nominal value in continental money. At the ſame time 79 hogſheads of tobacco were lent, he ſays, to J. H.—theſe 79 hogſheads he claims, but will not permit that J. H. ſhould claim his bills!</note> hogſheads, for the cargo of this brigantine Hawke) furniſhed in May, 1780, being replaced in kind by J. H. or accounted for at the preſent value? Why ſhould not J. H. be permitted to account for this tobacco at the value thereof in May, 1780, <note n="§" place="bottom">In May, 1780, R. M. had in hand of J. H's money, more than £.500,000 continental, repreſenting £.64,000 ſpecie.</note> ſince R. M. owed him ten times more money at that time, when the tobacco was agreed to be taken as a payment on account? If R. M. ſays that he <hi>borrowed</hi> the tobacco and paid it only at a later period—whoſe fault is that? Had he not the uſe of the value of the tobacco during the whole interval? And could he not therewith have purchaſed 79 other hogſheads, to replace the tobacco at the time if it had been convenient? Had he not employed all J. H's money in ſpeculations as well as his own, leſt both might have periſhed in his hands? Or ſhall it be juſt, that R. M. ſhould not refund bills when he had no right to them, from the Royal Marine, without paying for them, and at the ſame time be permitted to claim tobacco, ſaid to be lent to J. Holker, when he had his money to purchaſe an equal quantity, or that ſame tobacco? Shall R. M's mode of ſtatement <note n="†" place="bottom">Among the ſix actions brought by J. H. againſt him, I muſt here beg leave to mention one worthy of notice—In an account between Mr. Le Ray De Chaumont and R. M. the latter is yet to ſettle for near 200 hogſheads of tobacco, remaining due to the former, on account of ſome powder which his houſe received in July, 1777, the proceeds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Meſſrs. Willing, Morris and Co. were to veſt in tobacco; for theſe 200 hogſheads R. M. offered £.31 - 14 - 0, thro' his clerk Swanwick, and ſomething more than £.50 by his letter of February, 1784, and on the arbitration. On this occaſion he wiſhes to pay a balance due in tobacco to Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, at the exchange of 100 for one, or 61 and a half for 1: but as he had lent 79 hogſheads of tobacco in 1780 to J. H. he claims the tobacco in kind. Is this <hi>fair</hi> and honorable? Or, rather, the tobacco lent to J. H. was it not the tobacco borrowed by R. M. from Chaumont? Would not this be a good ſpeculation of R. M. upon two friends, for whom he acted upon truſt?</note> be admitted, becauſe the bills to be repaid by him, and the tobacco he
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:044903_0037_101F4F6153CDE688"/>
claims from J. H. are both of a higher value, than when it was his duty to have paid for both, to have purchaſed both, with J. H's monies? In other words, ſhall R. M. becauſe he has to account for his tranſactions, dictate in 1784, the form and principles of accounts at his own will and pleaſure, to vary them in every operation according to his intereſt, and explain away the fortune of all his employers, or ſhall juſtice, law and equity take place in this caſe? We claim nothing more.</p>
            <p>When ſpeaking of the improper claim of R. M. for bills on France, as early as the 11th of March, 1779, for his pretended advances on account of the Royal Marine, we delayed mentioning a tranſaction which took place about the 7th of that ſame month, and under which date R. M. credits the Royal Marine for £.24,666 continental, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of £.2740 - 13 - 4 ſterling, by him received in bills on France.</p>
            <p>When in Boſton, J. H. drew on R. M. at ten days ſight, various bills to the amount of near £77,656 - 5 - 0, which were afterwards reduced by J. H. while in Boſton, to £.54,981 - 11 - 3—they bore date of the 16th of October, 1778.</p>
            <p>On account thereof, J. H. remitted a bill of £.61,196 - 1 - 3, drawn by a continental agent on the commiſſary general of Congreſs, and paſſed by J. H. to the order of R. M. adviſing him at the ſame time—not to receive this money, but in caſe of need for the King's ſervice; as he wiſhed it to remain with Congreſs, on account of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſupplied by their agent in Boſton. R. M. however got this bill paid in Philadelphia, at the treaſury, on the 10th of November following, through the hands of Benjamin Hogeland his clerk; but whether with or without any neceſſity for the King's ſervice, the accounts of the auditors will more preciſely aſcertain. A few of theſe bills drawn in Boſton by J. H. on R. M. were paid in December, 1778, the reſt in January, February and March, 1779. However, on the 7th of March of that year, of theſe Boſton bills a ſum of 63,338 dollars 4<hi>ſ</hi>6, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, was profered to R. M. for payment, being part of thoſe drawn by J. H. to the order of Adam Babcock of Boſton, and was given by Adam Babcock's correſpondent as part payment of the £24,666 continental, neceſſary for the purchaſe of the abovementioned bills on France for £.2740 - 13 - 4 ſterling, which were alſo drawn at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of R. M. to the order of ſaid Adam Babcock.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt firſt obſerve, that in order, we ſuppoſe, to conceal this tranſaction and the dates of acceptances or payment, no bills drawn on R. M. have been produced as vouchers in ſupport of his accounts, though all vouchers were claimed from him and ordered to be given up by the arbitrators.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> All the bills of J. H. on R. M. from Boſton, not charged as paid in 1778, are charged in his monthly account, redacted for the arbitrators, as paid in January, 1779, though few were even accepted for payment in the run of that month.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> This money proceeding from the bill drawn on the commiſſary general of Congreſs, was not neceſſary in 1778 to R. M. Nota bene. <note n="*" place="bottom">N. B. He then had a conſiderable balance of Holker's private monies, or thoſe belonging to his friends, to account for; beſides all the proceeds of 350,000 <hi>Livres</hi> of bills on France, ſold by him for the purpoſe of purchaſing certificates bearing intereſt payable in France, which he at firſt ſaid were neceſſary for the King's ſervice, and which he afterwards was obliged to ſay, he had kept on hand alſo periſhing, but ſubject to Holker's orders, till his return from Boſton; or, rather, he had employed every farthing of the money in lands, or ſhips, or, ſtill better ſpeculations.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> The bills on account thereof, unpaid in 1778, were taken up by J. H's public bills ſelling in January,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:044903_0038_101F4F634355CE38"/>
February and March, 1778, as appears by R. M's confeſſion in his letter, which, circumſtance he mentions in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to criminate bis employer, though he knew that the ſuſpicions he throws out were unjuſt.—Of this we ſhall ſpeak more at large hereafter.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> This confeſſion proves, that the money from Congreſs not being wanted for the King's ſervice, the whole or greateſt part thereof might have been better employed for the uſe of the continent, than in the hands of R. M.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> If the bills upon France were employed for the purpoſe of taking up in 1779, the bills drawn upon R. M. on the 16 of October 1778, is it not a ſtrong preſumptive proof, that in November, 1779, R. M. had employed for his own purpoſes the whole £.61,196 - 1 - 3, which he carefully had got paid, without neceſſity, from the public treaſury? Is it not apparent, that when he paid thoſe drafts in 1779, he had no money on hand but what aroſe from the daily ſale of the bills on France, ſupplied him by J. H. for his pretended wants?</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> On the 7th of March he had not any money in cheſt, or a ſmall ſum, for he took and claimed from J. H. £2740 ſterling in bills, to diſcharge Holker's drafts on him from Boſton; theſe drafts and J. H's bills on France being in both caſes drawn to the order of Adam Babcock of Boſton, the bills being negociated and the drafts taken up at one and the ſame inſtant.</p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> This poverty of R. M's cheſt, in March 1779, will appear eſtabliſhed to perfect conviction, ſince he acknowledges on the 11th day following, to have ſold to Whiteſide &amp; Co. and afterwards taken £.3800 ſterling to himſelf, on account of his advances for the Royal Marine, and for which advances he claimed the bills from the King's agent.—The pretended advances he would not not have felt or dreamt of if he had been rich in cheſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude, that when he agreed upon the arbitration, that he employed all Holker's money in his hands, without diſtinction whatever, as opportunities offered, he did not ſay too much; ſince his claim of bills on the 11th of March, on account of his advances, is ſupported by his claim of bills on the 7th; becauſe he could not take up the Boſton drafts ſo conveniently, without either diverting the funds on hand from ſome lucrative employment or veſtment in view, or without ſelling ſome object or inveſtment, or merchandize on hand or in ſtore, at a leſſer profit than it would have commanded at a later period.</p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>thly.</hi> We muſt further remark, that on the payment of theſe drafts from Boſton, and on the negociation of the bills, R. M. claims and is entitled to the commiſſion of an agent by previous ſtipulation, tho' he ſcarcely received a dollar of continental money in either caſe, nor did he even indorſe Holker's bills, ſince he got them drawn to the order of Adam Babcock. Yet he maintains,—he was not agent reſponſible, or bailiff, but agent upon truſt, <hi>a banker</hi>; eſpecially ſince he received no conſideration for the care and cuſtody of the goods in ſtore, for attending to the King's money in his cheſt, which, elſewhere he ſays, was periſhing in his hands—Did the money of Congreſs in this caſe, or the money ariſing from the bills on France of the King's agent, periſh in his hands, in his cheſt, in his ſtore?</p>
            <p n="10">10<hi>thly.</hi> From the above we may form an idea of the manner in which he carried on his operations, when under cover of the confidence repoſed in him by J. H. with what zeal he held forth his aid and aſſiſtance to his country, then ſtruggling for independence, and working againſt the tide of depreciation of their currency. Thus he attended to the intereſt of a generous King and nation every where fighting for his ſafety, and the future happineſs of himſelf and his poſterity! Whatever may be the caſe in this reſpect, every one will be convinced, that depreciation at leaſt never reached R. M. in this inſtance; that no money in this inſtance periſhed in his hands; that the public bills were not employed for public purpoſes, but to take up his own engagements (having himſelf employed thoſe monies tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, to anſwer all demands made upon him). Then, ſhall he not return the bills with intereſt, ſince the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:044903_0039_101F4F6588CCAF80"/>
bills employed on this occaſion turned out a moſt advantageous ſpeculation in themſelves? This advantageous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment we ſhall, for the ſake of inveſtigation, alſo here explain.</p>
            <p>
               <list>

               </list>
in favor of R. M.—Thus ſuppoſing the veſtment of the continental money in ſpecie in November, and the ſale thereof in March following, R. M. would have cleared £.1428 - 18 - 1, by depreciation alone, on the money of Congreſs, on one ſum of £.20,000<note n="*" place="bottom">He received £.61,196 - 1 - 3 public money.</note> only; and this may explain why he took up the money from the treaſury on the 10th of November, without any other poſſible reaſon. But in bills the profit is much greater—he was only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count nominally for the proceeds of the bills drawn at his requeſt to the order of Adam Babcock, in March, 1780, at a later period; and this cannot have taken place by his accounts, but in the fall of that ſame year, when money was at 30 or 40 for one, and then the profit is in proportion greater. Suppoſe the nominal employment on the King's account was made when money was at forty, then the profit is £.2,833 - 13 - 4, on a ſum of £.3,333 - 13 - 4. Can ſuch profits be allowed in equity? Can the loſs on the ſale of bills be allowed in order to give R. M. ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortionate advantages? And ſhall the King's agent be condemned to make good theſe bills in the King's treaſury in France, for the ſake of ſuch a ſubordinate agent, in whoſe honor he had confided, becauſe he was alſo confided in by his countrymen, fellow-citizens and Congreſs?—For a ſubordinate agent, who declared on the arbitration, that he knew nothing of depreciation in all 1778 and 1779, and who accuſes his employer of want of fidelity to his ſovereign, becauſe he drew the bills which he (R. M.) employed, to fulfil his own engagements? By way of apology to him, for this ſevere ſcrutiny and inveſtigation, we muſt here tranſcribe what he ſays on the ſubject of thoſe bills drawn on R. M. from Boſton, and which ſubject we have entered upon more fully in our firſt letter of ſelf-juſtification, wrote in reply to R. M's wicked inſinuations in his favorite letter of the 26th of February, 1784. (Vide page 15.)</p>
            <p>Speaking of the claim of depreciation on general principles, and on the nature of the accounts betwixt him and J. H. he writes:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Before I quit the ſubject I will ſelect two or three inſtances from thoſe accounts, which will bring the reaſoning <hi>more home to your perceptions.</hi> The King paid 400,000 <hi>Livres</hi> for two prizes, taken by the privateers Hancock and Boſton; you agreed with the owners for £.70,000 lawful money; you paid in part your bills for 45,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> (£.7875.) and drew on me for the remainder £62,125—which ſums together make £.70,000 lawful. Theſe drafts on me, equal to £.77,656 - 5 - 0, Pennſylvania currency, <hi>were paid by me when your public bills were ſelling at</hi> 900 <hi>per cent.</hi> on ſterling, reckoning Livres at 10½ ſterling: conſequently theſe bills were paid with ſomewhat leſs than 200,000 <hi>Livers</hi>; the remainder on the whole tranſaction was <hi>a gain to you</hi> of 155,000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This paragraph and buſineſs we have elſewhere explained, but we did not then chooſe to obſerve to R. M. the conſequences of the confeſſion he ſo liberally makes, that J. H's drafts on him drawn in October, were paid by R. M. from the proceeds of the public bills ſold in March, 1779, or with thoſe very bills in kind: a confeſſion which R. M. made for the purpoſe only of drawing from thence the inference, that the agent general was pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:044903_0040_101F4165D9761100"/>
155,000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois their repreſentative value; when in fact and reality R. M. was himſelf contriving to pocket the greater part of this ſame difference, and 500,000 <hi>Livres</hi> more, under his ingenious mode of redacting and preſenting accounts, and by refuſing all depreciation thereon. But how could J. H. pocket any ſuch difference? For when R. M. ſays, under the date of February, 1784, that he paid £.77,656 - 5 - 0, Pennſylvania currency, of Holker's drafts on him, he aſſerts that as a fact which he knows to be untrue; becauſe he credits J. H. in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Holker's Boſton tranſactions, under the date of January the 14th, 1779, <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note> for £.24,962 - 2 - 6—for as much of thoſe ſame drafts which J. H. himſelf took up while in Boſton, at the requeſt of the parties concerned; and be would have done the ſame for all, if they had applied to him there.—Therefore R. M's calculation is falſe, his relation of the fact, wrote when the accounts were under his eyes, is untrue.—What ſhall we believe from ſuch a man?</p>
            <p>But to ſhew that malice, and the fear of accounting on honeſt and juſt principles, poſſeſſed his ſoul, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all reaſon, when he wrote this infidious letter, it is ſufficient to remind the reader of his ſaying that J. H. when he paid his own drafts on R. M. did it with the proceeds of his public bills on France. He forgot that J. H's money and that of his friends paid in July and Auguſt, 1778, to R. M. and his remittance on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary general, are credited in account to J. H. and were to be employed by R. M. to take up thoſe ſame drafts on Philadelphia in 1778, for which (he ſays) the <hi>proceeds of the public bills</hi> were employed <hi>by J. H.</hi> in March 1779.— tho' theſe proceeds were received by R. M. by him employed in his own ſpeculations or to take up his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and have entirely diſappeared through depreciation, if his ſtatement of accounts is allowed, and have occaſioned the total loſs of the bills drawn, as he ſays, to take up Holker's drafts from Boſton. Let us now grant to R. M. for a moment the full force of his allegation againſt his employer, and with him pretend to believe—that the difference on this whole tranſaction, on theſe 400,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> was a gain to him (J. H.) of 155,000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois—(Vide page 16.) What can we conclude from thence? Let it be ſuppoſed, that J. H. did attempt to gain 300,000 <hi>Livres</hi> on 400,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> ſtill he would not have attempted to gain as much as R. M.—£.2800 out of £.3300—and ſacrifice one third of the original value of the bills on the ſale thereof, in order to raiſe the £.500 neceſſary to make up the difference of payment. And if J. H. is ſuppoſed to have actually made the gain, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to R. M's words, then we ſhall fall into an abſurdity; for all Holker's accounts are grounded on thoſe of R. M. which form near one third of the value to be accounted for, and are the firſt to be accounted for; therefore he has not made the gain of 155,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> ſince he has not ever yet been able to redact, much leſs propoſe his accounts, in order to make any gain whatever.</p>
            <p>From hence it is alſo to be concluded that J. H. has not <hi>even attempted</hi> to make this gain; but it may ſtill be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he had that intention, and that R. M. knew his intention: this being granted, his argument will run as follows:</p>
            <p>J. H. working the nefarious plan of depreciation againſt the King, or in other words, making great gain himſelf through a nominal ſet of accounts, inſiſts with R. M. that he ſhall account to J. H. on a ſcale <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> depreciation, for his tranſactions on behalf of the Royal Marine, at the very time that R. M. can prove, that he (J. H.) had intended at leaſt to gain 155,000 <hi>Livres</hi> by depreciation, from one ſingle payment of 400,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> made on behalf of the King:
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:044903_0041_101F4F70B8D7F8B0"/>
and as ſo groſs an injury to the King's intereſt muſt not take place in favor of J. H. therefore he inſerts in his letter of February, 1784, that J. H. has actually made the gain of ſo large a ſum. Unluckily R. M. forgot that the aſſertion deſerved a reply.</p>
            <p>Is it becauſe J. H. (to ſpeak plain) has cheated the King, that R. M. is to cheat J. H? Is it becauſe J. H. had intended and attempted to cheat his King, that R. M. is to cheat actually and effectually J. H. and alſo the King and J. H's friends, through the fallacious medium of depreciation? But if J. H has gained 155,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> and R. M. gains them upon J. H. where is the profit to J. H? Can he in this ſituation be termed a cheat, with any truth? Without having derived any advantage from his fraud, eſpecially by R. M? At moſt it can only be ſaid that he did attempt it, but was weak enough to be outwitted in the attempt by that confidential agent, whom he employed and paid to redact the accounts of his own tranſactions—his Boſton tranſactions. But if this gain is gone from J. H. how will he be able to refund the King, ſhould his miniſters one day or other diſcover the attempt, and the knavery of the agent general? How will he be able to account to the officers and crews of Count D'Eſtaing's Fleet for the real value of the monies which the commander thereof entruſted to his good faith? And if this game is to be played upon J. H. throughout, by R. M. how then will J. Holker's friends be redeemed from ruin, when their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes will have been diſſipated under the cloak of depreciation, and the loſs be explained away by R. M. in a ſet of accounts?</p>
            <p>Is R. M. to attempt thus to cheat J. H. and then call out cheat firſt, turn informer, and threaten J. H.<note n="†" place="bottom">Will it not ſurpriſe all impartial men, that though J. H. may be ſuppoſed to have intended to ſecure to himſelf the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of depreciation, R. M. ſhould have imagined that he could terrify J. H. from his claims on him, by inſinuating the attempt, and reproaching him with having ſelfiſh views to anſwer, when in fact there is but one principle, one ſingle equitable mode of ſettling accounts between J. H. and R. M. between J. H. and the King, between J. H. and his friends? And has not R. M. ſeen J. H. ſettle with Congreſs on theſe ſame principles, while he ſuperintended their finances, during the run of the year 1783? And ſhall R. M. make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the general rule, becauſe he acted upon truſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was entruſted with the redaction of J. H's accounts for his perſonal tranſactions in Boſton?</note> that if he ſhould ſqueak, or ſhake even through fear, he will go and tell the King his maſter? This is too much. And is this language to be held by R. M. when he knew that as early as January, February and March, 1779, in all Holker's letters to the King's ſecretaries of ſtate, he informs them of the ſavings he has made on the Boſton trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, of the advantageous rate of exchange of bills, then ſelling in Philadelphia for the payment of the debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in Boſton by the King's fleet, and due to individuals, to himſelf, and to Congreſs? This R. M. knew at the time, he knew that J. H. made his pride thereof, and that he vaunted and gloried in his ſucceſsful endeavours for the King's intereſt, to R. M. himſelf, to Mr. Gerard, and all others to whom he could confidentially ſpeak on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This R. M. has heard J. H. ſpeak of repeatedly: but, res miranda! at that very time, R. M was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the plan of accuſing him, ſome day or other, of theſe very exertions on the King's behalf; and to maintain at a later period, that the whole was a cheat, becauſe there was a gain of 150,000 <hi>Livres</hi> to J. H. on 400,000 <hi>Livres,</hi> in order to cover his own plan of working depreciation againſt J. H.</p>
            <p>It may be ſuppoſed by ſome, that this was not really intended by R. M. that it was only a hint, by way of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, made from R. M. in a letter to J. H. ſo artfully written, that tho' it conveyed the idea of a gain that could be made by J. H. if his accounts were properly ſtated, ſtill J. H. could never be imprudent enough to ſhew the letter, or make any uſe of it againſt R. M. becauſe the inſinuation would be againſt J. H. and the ſecret of his gain of 155,000 <hi>Livres</hi> ſuffered to tranſpire. But here again R. M. is foiled in his object; for the King's miniſters were fully informed of this whole buſineſs, in a ſeries of letters, which explain the whole; therefore, if they are one
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:044903_0042_101F4F726337F208"/>
day impoſed upon by J. H. it will be with their eyes open and in noonday; and if, as R. M. pretends, there is any gain whatever to J. H. it will be the free gift, the free conceſſion of the King through his miniſters: if ſuch a profit could exiſt, even then it would be but a juſt reward of his fidelity to the King's ſervice and intereſt: but this cannot be, ſince it would only enable him to do juſtice to the King, to the officers and ſeamen of the King's navy, and to J. H's friends in Europe, whoſe money was to be employed for the King's ſervice by J. H. and of which the greater part was afterwards put into the hands of R. M. for this very purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the extreme length of this memorial, we muſt now further remark, that R. M. ſeems to lay great ſtreſs on the circumſtance of the accounts, reſpecting J. H's tranſactions in Boſton in 1778, being entered in R. M's books in 1779, at J. H's requeſt: He aſks, (Page 13) "<hi>How are they to be ſeparated? (i. e. from his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.) Where are your inſtructions for the purpoſe at the time?</hi> He adds, in the ſame Page,
<q>The effort now made to ſeparate them, is with a view to <hi>eſtabliſh your demand of depreciation</hi>: but, although it is in that reſpect immaterial to me, I will not conſent to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This refuſal of R. M. is extraordinary. J. H's tranſactions in Boſton are perfectly diſtinct from thoſe of R. M. in Philadelphia: he never would have conſented to, or could be obliged to make good any loſſes to the King or to J. H. on J. H's operations and tranſactions in Boſton, in which he had no concern; which he neither adviſed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or concerted. On this occaſion R. M. was really a mere <hi>book-keeper</hi> to J. H. recording in the run of 1779, one part of J. H's tranſactions in Boſton, which took place in October and November, 1778, and which only came to R. M's knowledge in the year following, thro' the confidential communication of J. H. He was neither a banker or agent in this buſineſs: he was not to looſe by being merely a recorder of accounts; he could not reaſonably have any profit in view; he could not claim or diſclaim any depreciation thereon. Nay, page 11, he reaſons on this ſubject in the following words:
<q>Robert Morris, (ſub-agent to J. H.) accounts to the agent general of the Royal Marine. (i. e. to J. H.) John Holker, Daniel Bell, John Rowe and others, tranſact buſineſs on account of the Royal Marine in Boſton; the agent general makes thoſe gentlemen accountable to Robert Morris, (J. H. makes J. H. accountable to R. M.) by <hi>placing</hi> the accounts of thoſe tranſactions in his hands, for the expreſs purpoſe of introducing their accounts into his.</q>
And further, in the ſame page:
<q>If the accounts of thoſe gentlemen do not pleaſe you, I care not; for I did not employ them, and inſerted their accounts into mine by your order.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here R. M. acknowledges that he did not tranſact the buſineſs; he is not reſponſible for the ſame, for he did not employ John Holker, the agent general, nor any other of the Gentlemen; and becauſe he recorded their tranſactions in his Books, he therefore introduces their operations into the ſtatement of his own operations, into the accounts of his own tranſactions: he is deſired to ſtate his own accounts ſeparately and diſtinctly, to ſpecify merely what he did actually receive and pay on the public account. And tho' he ſays, that with reſpect to depreciation, it is immaterial to him, he will not conſent to do it, becauſe
<q>
                  <hi>the effort now made to ſeparate them, is with a view to eſtabliſh your demand of depreciation.</hi>
               </q>
As if the mere ſeparation of ſuch accounts, the ſubſtraction of accounts where he neither received or paid one penny, could eſtabliſh or annul any claim of depreciation againſt him or for him.</p>
            <p>Page 15, R. M. ſays,
<q>But let us return for <hi>a moment</hi> to your Boſton tranſactions, on which ſo great a ſtreſs is laid; <hi>your</hi> moſt favorable ſtatement of them can only be, <hi>a profit made by the King on the depreciation of money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to individuals,</hi> applied to his uſe; but this is not all; you, as I have already obſerved, derived the means of making thoſe expenditures, principally from funds credited to individuals <hi>in accounts kept by you, in my name,</hi> at
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:044903_0043_101F4F755AF01E40"/>
your requeſt; (i. e. in R. M's books) compriſe the whole together and you muſt ſee, that it forms neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to, nor deduction from what I poſſeſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Without obſerving on the obſcurity of the firſt part of this paragraph, or on the ſuppoſed injuſtice of an attempt made by the agent general to make a profit for the King, or on the propriety of doing <hi>now</hi> ultimate juſtice to the King or J. H's friends, let us only attend to the latter part: —compriſe together the whole of J. H's Boſton tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, they neither make addition to, nor deduction from what R. M. poſſeſſed.— Why therefore not ſeparate ſuch unneceſſary accounts, which can only create confuſion and error, eſpecially in dealings with continental money; and which, when entered into R. M's accounts under different dates of receipt and payment, give riſe to the moſt erroneous inductions.</p>
            <p>Why, therefore, is the ſeparation of theſe Boſton accounts ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by R. M? The truth in this reſpect we muſt ſuppoſe to be, that there is exiſting a very heavy loſs to the King on R. M's operations in 1779; in the beginning of that year he actually received more than £.20,000 ſterling, in bills payable at the Royal treaſury of France, and more than £7000 ſterling in ſimilar bills from Meſſrs. Turnbull and Co. in the year 1780, beſides very large ſums in continental currency, the whole for the King's account, for his ſervice alone; ſtill it appears from R. M's own accounts, from his own ſtatement, made out by himſelf, from his books and from the vouchers he produced in ſupport of his accounts, that he never did pay for the King's account, £.12,000 Pennſylvania cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, of real ſpecie value, according to the ſcale of depreciation fixed by law; from whence there reſults a loſs of near £.40,000 to the King, tho' he ſold almoſt all the public bills himſelf,—made his own engagements through agents of his own choice,—made his own contracts and purchaſes, &amp;c. Does not ſuch an extraordinary loſs and deficiency need an inveſtigation? Does it not afford a ſufficient reaſon why auditors ſhould ſtate R. M's tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions ſeparately and diſtinctly from thoſe perſonal to J. H. where J. H. alone received and paid the monies, ſo as to examine and report on this myſterious buſineſs; eſpecially as R. M. did receive monies applicable only to ſpecial particular purpoſes, ſuch as, for the public ſervice, for the purchaſe of loan office certificates, for ſpeculations in South-Carolina, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It muſt be with a view of avoiding the conſequences of this great deficiency, that R. M. ſays, page 11 and 13, that the part of the ſtatement of the public tranſactions, ſigned by his Excellency Monſieur Gerard, in Sept. 1779, <hi>was an account ſettled.</hi> This is a circumſtance ſo remarkable, and ſo much ſtreſs is alſo laid thereon, that it is proper to relate what appears on record upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>The ſtatement referred to is entitled:
<q>
                  <hi>Debtor,</hi> The Hon. John Holker, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> agent to the Royal Marine of France, in account current with Robert Morris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Philadelphia,— on account of ſaid Royal Marine, <hi>Creditor</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt charge in this ſtatement, that appears under the date of the 19th of Sept. 1778, is a ſum of £.2520, for £.2400, paid by R. M. to Edward Evans, on behalf of the owners and Captain of the ſloop Supply, for ſervices performed to his Excellency Connt D'Eſtaing's fleet, which, with a commiſſion of 5 per ct. for paying this money, make £.2520 - 0 - 0</p>
            <p>It balances by a ſum of 1000 <hi>Livres</hi> Tournois £.163,355 - 8 - 6 continental currency, in theſe words, <q>To balance carried to the credit of John Holker Eſq, agent of the Royal Marine of France, in a new account current.</q>—ſay £.163,355 - 8 - 6</p>
            <p>The groſs ammount is for a ſum of £.584,158 - 13 - 5 ½</p>

At the foot thereof is wrote the following note:</p>
            <q>That more money than the above balance is actually paid by me for the ſervice of the Royal Marine for ſundry articles and ſervices that cannot yet be brought into the account, as the perſons who received the monies have not yet rendered their accounts, altho' frequently requeſted; theſe articles will therefore appear in the next account, viz.</q>

            <p>ROBERT MORRIS."</p>
            <p>The groſs amount of this ſecond ſtatement is £.1,528,119 - 14 - 2—Pennſylvania currency—of continental paper: It was ſent to J. H. on the 26th or 27 of February, 1784, with R. M's letter of the 26th day of that month. But previous thereto, another ſecond ſtatement of accounts for the Royal Marine, had been handed to J. H. by which a balance in favor of R. M. of £.450,000 was claimed from the Royal Marine: this laſt was made out in 1781, and R. M. ſays, page 8—<hi>the accounts of the continental commiſſaries</hi> (from whence it was ſtated) <hi>were only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to me about the middle of</hi> May, 1781.</p>
            <p>From what has now been related, will it not be eaſy for any one to anſwer, whether R. M's firſt ſtatement of the public matters is <hi>an account ſettled</hi> between the parties? Other documents will prove, that it never could be, nor ever was intended by the parties as a ſettlement. What then does R. M. mean by maintaining that it was an account ſettled? Surely he cannot intend thereby to prove that his accounts cannot be ſeparated from thoſe of J. H. for he, of his own accord, ſeparates the public from the private concerns.</p>
            <p>This riddle will be beſt explained thus: He wiſhes to make J. H. believe that the principles of the account may be deemed ſettled, though not one word is ſaid thereon; he wiſhes this firſt ſtatement had been really ſettled as to all claim of depreciation; and as this may be maintained before auditors, it would appear to be incumbent on them to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:044903_0046_101F4F7E280479F0"/>
ſtate all R. M's accounts diſtinctly and ſeparately, under their real dates in the firſt inſtance, before they condeſcend to hear the parties on their diſputes, differences, or contentions, in order thereby to underſtand well what may be ſaid, and to aſcertain clearly the truth and the whole truth of this unfortunate buſineſs.</p>
            <p>In order to prove the neceſſity of admitting the principles of depreciation on his accounts, we muſt here relate ſome further facts.</p>
            <p>A gentleman of high truſt, and of honorable memory, employed R. M. as his confidential agent in various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, during the years 1779 and 1780—to him he accounted for the outfits of veſſels, and the proceeds of return cargoes on a footing of depreciation.</p>
            <p>Swanwick, the clerk, attorney, agent and at preſent the partner of R. M. was employed during two ſucceſſive years with full powers of attorney from R. M. in ſettling, claiming ſettlements, and offering them to all concerned, on a valuation, or ſcale of depreciation, on behalf of his employer. R. M. when employed as a banker, as a depoſitary of money merely, when he has paid continental money on account of depoſits made with him in hard money, he has valued theſe payments according to the ſcale at the time of payment. When employed as banker he admits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation to every one but to J. H.—when employed by J. H. as <hi>agent,</hi> to tranſact upon truſt immenſe purchaſes of proviſions and ſtores, to ſell prizes, &amp;c. &amp;c. he admits no principle of depreciation, becauſe, he ſays, he was only banker and depoſitary. When J. H. is intereſted in ſome unfortunate expedition to ſea by his agent, and the ſhip and cargo fall into the poſſeſſion of the enemy, then the expenditures and outfits are all reduced, by ſome ſcale or other to a ſpecie value, and the amount in ſpecie is charged againſt J. H. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide the accounts of the ſhip Defence, fitted out by Wm. Smith, of Baltimore, Maryland—in the run of 1779, and for which a balance of £.2400 ſpecie, is charged againſt J. H.</note> in a ſpecial particular ſpecie account. But when adventures are ſomewhat more proſperous, then the proceeds of the return cargoes, ſold by R. M. or his correſpondents, are only to be accounted for nominally in a large, grand, nominal account, where ſums appear mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in number or in found, but whence the reality is to be ſubſtracted for the benefit of the accomptant;—for the proceeds of theſe cargoes are, collectively with the monies of Holker's friends, to form one general balance, which alone is to be accounted for on that rate of depreciation which it pleaſes R. M. to fix upon, according to his ideas of what is juſt, right and honorable. And therefore he offers the balance due in April, 1780, at the exchange of that month; though it reſults from a long courſe of tranſactions, from July 1777, to April 1780, during the courſe of his agency for J. H. and J. H's abſent friends.</p>
            <p>We will now put a period to theſe obſervations, and leave the reſt to the deciſion of law and equity—Relying on our own integrity, the fairneſs and importance of our claims, and the efficacy and uprightneſs of the laws, we can entertain no doubt of obtaining ample and ſubſtantial juſtice.</p>
