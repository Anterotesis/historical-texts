            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHARACTER OF THIS WORK. From the CRITICAL REVIEW, Vol. XVI. page <hi>221.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>"Among the many novels with which the preſs is every day ſwarming, we are happy, when able, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a few, which afford amuſement without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the morals, and inſtruction without the dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſtant moraliſing. Of this number is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette.</p>
            <p>"The title, however, ſhould not lead our readers to ſuppoſe that this publication is of a political character. It has not the leaſt reference to the affairs of France; and for this reaſon we could have wiſhed it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under another name: the preſent is apt to miſlead readers.</p>
            <p>"The heroine is the daughter of a nobleman of the ancient family of the Percivals, barons of Arlington, that occupied Arlington caſtle, on the weſtern ſide of the lake of Killarney, in Ireland. The principal incidents of the hiſtory paſs in that pictureſque and beautiful ſpot.</p>
            <p>"Antoinette is the daughter of lord Arlington, by his firſt wife; ſeveral circumſtances, for a long time myſterious and inexplicable, relating to the parents of the young lady, form a principal part of the plot, in the unravelling of which, conſiderable ingenuity is diſcovered. In the character of lord Arlington we contemplate thoſe generous virtues that throw a luſtre on exalted ſtations; and in lady Arlington we view a ſenſible female, who thinks the principal excellence of her ſex conſiſts in the cultivation of her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and in an attention to her children. Both theſe characters, and indeed moſt of the others, are well drawn; though we think lady Arlington bears the
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:038283_0002_101188F0A9FC98A0"/>
abſence of her huſband rather too ſtoically, and ſeveral incidents are too haſtily run over, particularly ſuch as muſt have occurred during the lady's reſidence in London, a deſcription of which would have afforded a degree of variety in the work.</p>
            <p>"The morality is unexceptionably pure; the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are liberal; the reader is led on gradually to events intereſting and ſtriking; the language is in the main neat and correct, and the iſſue of the hiſtory fortunate and agreeable. On the whole, this novel has conſiderable merit; and we think the writer might diſplay her powers of deſcription a little more freely.</p>
            <p>"The latter hint we drop, becauſe we underſtand this is the production of a lady, who is likely to favour the world with another novel ſhortly, and becauſe we think the public will receive Antoinette as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſpecimen of her abilities."</p>

               <p>ON the weſtern ſide of the lake of Killarney, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that noble expanſe of waters and the Atlantic ocean, ſtood Arlington caſtle, the ſeat of the ancient family of the Percivals, barons of Arlington. The houſe was ſituated on the declivity of a hill, and the front being to the ſouth weſt, commanded a view of the ocean, with the Skelig Iſles in the horizon. The ſpace between the houſe and the ſea was a continued landſcape of lawns and woods, or rather ſhrubberies, for they were only of a ſtature to diverſify and adorn the proſpect, not to interrupt it. From another part of the houſe were ſeen the beautiful lakes of Killarney, with the mountain of Mange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on on the other ſide of them, forming a ſcene not leſs grand than pictureſque. On the whole, perhaps, a more romantic or beautiful ſpot could not be formed by the moſt luxuriant ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038283_0005_101188F777C40810"/>The houſe was ſpacious, and had formerly been the abode of cheerfulneſs and hoſpitality; but alas! the halls now no more rang with the mirth of the feſtive board; the gueſts no more aſſembled round the blazing hearth; nor did a ſmiling peaſantry repeat with tranſports the name of their hoſpitable landlord. All was ſilent in the manſion—its owners had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken it—they were allured away by the luxuries of the Engliſh metropolis, and by the imaginary fame to be acquired by gaining a ſeat in the Engliſh houſe of commons; forgetting that it was not the mere act of ſitting there, which could caſt a luſtre around their heads; and that, this was only to be obtained by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſeat worthily; by labouring inceſſantly to promote the welfare and happineſs of thoſe, who had deputed them to that ſtation; and not by ſitting on the benches as idle ſpectators and auditors.</p>
               <p>Two very expenſive conteſted elections, for the populous town of —, had made dreadful depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on the fortune of one of the proprietors of Arlington caſtle; ſo that when it deſcended to his ſon Edward, he found himſelf encumbered with an immenſe debt, thus fooliſhly incurred.</p>
               <p>Edward, born and educated in the metropolis of Great Britain, could ill digeſt the thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to live amongſt the WILD Iriſh, as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heard them emphatically ſtiled; and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to try, firſt, whether by prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement in England, he might not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve his affairs, without baniſhing himſelf from all civilized ſociety, which he conceived it would be, to return to his patrimonial inheritance.</p>
               <p>Prudence in the choice of a wife, he conceived, would be of the utmoſt importance to him, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his economical plans into execution. For this purpoſe, he reſolved not to take one from amongſt the daughters of affluence, who would probably ſpend three times as much money as ſhe brought him; but to ſeek out for ſome female, who, having been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038283_0006_101188F90D6B39F8"/>
in habits of economy and retirement, would have no wiſh to enter into the expenſive courſe of life, which one born in a more elevated ſituation, would naturally be led to expect.</p>
               <p>It was not long before he met with a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, agreeable in her perſon, whom he thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſuited to the plan of life which he had laid down for himſelf, to whom therefore, he immediately made his propoſals, and was, ſoon after, married. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken man! he ſoon learnt the ſevere leſſon, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of an irrational courſe of life in her early years is no ſecurity for a woman's leading a rational one, when more knowledge of what is called the world, has filled her head with new ideas of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be derived from following the giddy rounds of folly and diſſipation, in which ſhe ſees thouſands engaged. No; a woman is then moſt likely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her duty properly, when initiated into the follies of the gay world, with a mind accuſtomed to reaſon on all things; and who, viewing thoſe follies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with a philoſophic eye, would not prize them too highly, or ſeek after them too eagerly.</p>
               <p>Start not, readers, at the ideas here ſuggeſted, of a female philoſopher. I know it is a character, which the world has been hitherto in the habit of conſidering as a ſort of eccentricity of nature, very fit to be ſhown about as a ſight, but not to be imitated. But, thanks to the improved ſtate of knowledge in theſe times, we may hope that in a ſhort time the character will become ſo common, that it will no longer be looked on as a prodigy, or ſhunned as a bane, but nouriſhed as a plant of the moſt balſamic influence. For let me aſk, whether it can ſeriouſly be ſuppoſed by any reflecting perſon, that a woman will be the leſs likely to perform the domeſtic duties well, when her mind has been cultivated, and ſhe has been taught to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them on principle, and to uſe her reaſon in the management of her family, than when her whole ſyſtem of action is the reſult of habit only; ſo that like
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038283_0007_101188FB51F40DD8"/>
a piece of mere mechaniſm, ſhould one wheel be in the leaſt deranged, ſhe is utterly at a loſs, and the whole machine immediately becomes confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington, at leaſt, had ſoon reaſon to repent of the choice he had made; for no ſooner did his bride find herſelf elvated to a ſtation, to which, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to her acquaintance with him, ſhe had never even dared to raiſe her thoughts, than ſhe launched out into every extravagance, which the intoxication of newly-acquired rank could ſuggeſt to her, without ever pauſing a moment, to conſider whether ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes were proper or improper.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington endeavoured, from the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this propenſity to extravagance in his wife, to check its progreſs; but alas! in vain; ſhe went on from year to year, growing more profuſe, as expenſe grew leſs proper; 'till, at laſt, hurt in his fortune, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beyond a poſſibility of retrieving—and wounded deeply in his mind with the thoughts of the needy ſituation, and conſequent obſcurity, into which he and his family, muſt be thrown, by the freſh incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances which the prodigality of his wife had brought on his before over-burdened eſtate, he reſolved to make one effort more, before all was loſt; and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his wife from the ſcenes with which, and the companions by whom, her attention had, for ſo long a time, been entirely occupied, to pluck up the evil by the roots, and endeavour to ſave a part of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune from the general wreck.</p>
               <p>However contrary therefore, to his own inclinations it might be, he determined to retire with his wife and his ſon Theodore, then about ſix years of age, and the only fruit of his ill-ſtarred union, to Arlington caſtle, there to live in retirement and economy.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner was this plan ſuggeſted to lady Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, than ſhe, who had drunk too deeply of the Circean cup of Britiſh diſſipation, to be able quietly to relinquiſh the intoxicating draught, began to play
<pb facs="unknown:038283_0008_101188FCDDFC6058"/>
off the uſual round of arts, ſo often ſucceſsfully prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by females, when they wiſh to turn a huſband aſide from any purpoſe, which may not be pleaſing to them.</p>
               <p>But it was all in vain. Lord Arlington was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: and he was not of ſuch a wavering diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when once reſolved on any thing, as to be eaſily ſhaken in his purpoſe; he had, therefore, made a conſiderable progreſs in ſettling his affairs, previouſly to his departure, when his wife, finding all her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to move him ineffectual, determined to purſue a plan of her own forming, and eloped with one of thoſe kind hearted knights errant, who are always ready to fly to the aſſiſtance of females, in lady Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington's diſtreſſed ſituation.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington immediately ſued for, and obtained, without difficulty, a ſeparation from her in Doctor's Commons; and thus being relieved, though in a painful manner, from this great obſtacle to his eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical plans, and, indeed, as it ultimately turned out, relieved from all expence on his wife's account —for though a proper maintenance was ſettled for her, yet, as ſhe went abroad, and lord Arlington never heard of her more, that allowance was never paid,—he purſued with alacrity, the ſchemes he had formed, and very ſoon after arrived with his ſon at Arlington caſtle.</p>
               <p>This firſt ſtep taken, the next was to inſtitute a ſtrict inquiry into the real ſtate of his affairs. But in this inveſtigation, lord Arlington only found mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification riſe on mortification. The more he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into his affairs, the more embarraſſed they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Every day produced ſome freſh mortgage or claim upon him; 'till wearied with chagrin, he had ſeveral times nearly given up the enquiry, and determined to go abroad, as concluding all loſt. At laſt, however, by the moſt unwearied perſeverance, he ſo far arranged his affairs, and put them into ſuch a train, as to give reaſonable hopes, that if his plans
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038283_0009_101188FED0E7F8F0"/>
were ſtrictly adhered to, his eſtate might, in a courſe of years, be quite freed from all embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe cares, together with the education of his ſon, upon which he ſpared no proper expence,— wiſely judging, that this was the only branch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, wherein a very rigid economy would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,—occupied the greateſt part of his time during the firſt years of his reſidence at Arlington caſtle. He ſaw little company, only viſiting thoſe of his neighbours, who had ſenſe enough to reſpect him, for the prudent manner in which he lived. Theſe, indeed, were few; it being the opinion of much the larger part of the country, that it was degrading to a peer, to live in ſo economical a manner.</p>
               <p>Among theſe with whom he principally aſſociated, was colonel Conolly, who had a ſmall eſtate, with a pretty houſe on it, at Airville, about four miles from Arlington caſtle. The colonel had acquired a very large fortune in the Eaſt-Indies, where he had ſerved as an officer in the company's army, and was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his eſtate, to enjoy in peace his large poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: for, unlike many of thoſe who acquire their fortunes in the Eaſt-Indies, he could enjoy his in peace, having no qualms of conſcience to torment him with the idea of any thing am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All was fairly gotten, that is, as far as any thing can be ſaid to be fairly gotten, which is acquired by the murder of our fellow creatures: for, though murder was his profeſſion, yet he had not extented an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to the injury of any one, but in the fair way of that profeſſion.</p>
               <p>He had married an Engliſh woman while he was in India, by whom he had only one child, a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and his wife dying on her paſſage to England, he immediately, on his arrival in England, placed his daughter under the care of a relation in London, from whence, at a proper age, ſhe was to be removed to a boarding ſchool, with a charge that ſhe ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038283_0010_101189006822C3D8"/>
in every thing proper to be taught to the heireſs of ſo large a fortune.</p>
               <p>Colonel Conolly was juſt arrived at Airville, when lord Arlington returned to his family ſeat. An inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ſoon commenced between them; which the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was particularly aſſiduous to cultivate, indulging a ſecret hope, that when their reſpective children came to be much together, they might entertain a partiality for each other: and that miſs Conolly's fortune might help to diſencumber the Arlington eſtate.</p>
               <p>At ſixteen years of age Theodore Percival was ſent abroad, under the care of a mr. Lewſon, a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and reſpectable gentleman, with whom he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through the greateſt part of Europe; and was returning by way of France, having ſo ſettled his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that in conformity with his father's wiſhes, often expreſſed in his letters, he ſhould return to Ireland by the time he was of age; lord Arlington having intented that day to be ſpent as a day of great feſtivity at the caſtle. His return was, however, ſomewhat retarded by the death of mr. Lewſon, who had been, for ſome time, in a very indifferent ſtate of health, and who, when he arrived at Vienne in Dauphiné, was taken too ill to be able to proceed on his journey, and, after languiſhing ſome weeks, died there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival deeply regretted the loſs of him, as he had in every reſpect fulfilled, with the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect propriety, the important truſt committed to him. Well aſſured, that the moſt effectual method to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his precepts a favourable reception from his young pupil, was, to watch the proper opportunities of inſtruction, and to mingle, with the utmoſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and art, amuſement and inſtruction together; he never threw in an obſervation mal-a-propos, nor ever attempted to thwart his charge in any innocent plan he had formed for recreation or entertainment; neither did he ever refuſe to accompany him on ſuch occaſions, how much ſoever he might be diſinclined to them himſelf. He was, in ſhort, not only the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038283_0011_10118902D1AE3308"/>
tutor, but the friend and companion of Theodore, who in all his letters to his father, bore an ample teſtimony to his virtues and talents, and at his death lamented, in the moſt pathetic terms, the loſs he had ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>The death of mr. Lewſon, however, made lord Arlington more anxious than ever for the return of his ſon. He wrote him many very preſſing letters on the ſubject, in conſequence of which, though only two days before he completed his twenty-firſt year, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore arrived at Arlington caſtle, to the no ſmall joy of his father, who beheld in him all the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which his moſt ſanguine hopes could expect.</p>
               <p>In his outward appearance, he was tall, and well made, with a countenance at once handſome, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and expreſſive of a mind liberal and well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and of the utmoſt ſweetneſs of temper; his manners alſo were thoſe of a perfect gentleman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt tincture of the coxcomb or pedant.</p>
               <p>About two years before his return, miſs Conolly had been taken from ſchool, and placed at the head of her father's houſe. She was miſtreſs of all thoſe accompliſhments, which are denominated genteel; ſhe could dance, ſing, play on the piano-forte, talk French and Italian to perfection; ſhe underſtood all kinds of work, proper for her ſtation, and dreſſed with taſte and elegance; yet, with all theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and with a face and perſon, which were both much admired, ſhe was quite free from affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and coquetry. One thing only was wanting to make her completely amiable; but, perhaps, one worth all the acquirements ſhe had attained, and that was, a taſte for reading and intellectual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but to have acquired that taſte in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which ſhe had been educated, was not to be expected, and ſtill leſs could it be expected, that ſhe would acquire it at her father's houſe, who himſelf conſidered reading as not at all a feminine employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:038283_0012_10118905DC67F900"/>Such were Theodore Percival and Horatia Conolly, at the time of the former's return from his travels, previouſly to which event, lord Arlington had, at a diſtance, founded the ſentiments of mr. Conolly, on the ſubject of the union, which he ſo much wiſhed for; and having reaſon to think, that he would not be averſe to it, he came at once to the point, and propoſed to him, that they ſhould endeavour to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the plan with all the intereſt they poſſeſſed, in their reſpective children. Mr. Conolly, whoſe only object in the diſpoſal of his daughter, was rank, as her fortune would be ſufficient to ſupport any rank, readily aſſented to lord Arlington's ſcheme: and it was agreed between theſe two fathers, that at mr. Percival's return, the young people ſhould be thrown as much as poſſible in each other's way, and every fair means taken, to create in them an attachment to each other.</p>

               <p>FROM the moment when this agreement was made between the fathers, which was ſome months before Theodore's return, lord Arlington almoſt lived at colonel Conolly's, in order that the views of the parents might be the better veiled from the young
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038283_0013_1011890824FC4EB8"/>
people, who if a ſudden increaſe of intimacy had taken place immediately after Theodore's return, might have been led to ſuſpect that it was not without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for colonel Conolly and lord Arlington both agreed, that if it ſhould come to be ſuſpected by their children, that they had formed the ſcheme we have related, it might at once put an end to all hopes of its ſucceeding: for young people ſeldom revolt at any thing ſo much as the idea that they are deſignedly thrown in each other's way, in order to accompliſh the ſchemes of their parents. But as ſcarcely a day paſſed without ſome intercourſe between the families of lord Arlington and colonel Conolly, for weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mr. Percival's return, the frequent viſits which they intended ſhould take place afterwards, would not appear to have any particular deſign in them.</p>
               <p>At length the day ſo much wiſhed for by lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arrived, and after an abſence of five years, he again claſped in his arms a ſon, for whom he had ſuffered ſo much anxiety, and to whom he looked up, as the future ornament of his ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The very ſame day this dear ſon was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his father, with eyes ſparkling with joy and hope, to colonel and miſs Conolly, who ſeemed ſcarcely leſs charmed with him, than the enraptured lord Arlington himſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet amidſt all the delight which his preſence ſeemed to diffuſe around him, and the real pleaſure which he himſelf felt, at again ſeeing a parent, to whom he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo many obligations, Theodore was at times thoughtful and reſerved; it is true, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to wear a maſk of gaiety, and returned, with an irreſiſtible grace and elegance, the compliments paid him on his return; but it was apparent, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that his gaiety was but a maſk, and that thoughtfulneſs and reſerve were the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of his breaſt.</p>
               <p>Miſs Conolly was as much pleaſed with mr. Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, as the moſt ſanguine wiſhes of her father could
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038283_0014_10118909CEA0A8D0"/>
aſpire to; but as to mr. Percival, it was, alas, but too evident, that miſs Conolly's charms made no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his (as his father at once determined it to be) inſenſible heart.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington, on leaving the colonel's was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by him to dine at Airville the next day, an invitation which he moſt joyfully accepted, but which his ſon, though he replied to it with perfect polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, too plainly wiſhed he could have declined. In their way home, lord Arlington addreſſed his ſon,</p>
               <p>'Well, my Theodore, and what do you think of miſs Conolly?'</p>
               <p>'She is a fine woman?'</p>
               <p>'Aye, a charming woman, is ſhe not?'</p>
               <p>'I don't doubt but ſhe is; but one cannot form any opinion of a woman at firſt ſight.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, you cannot fail to be charmed with her, when you are more acquainted with her.'</p>
               <p>'Perhaps, then, 'twere beſt to ſhun her, if ſhe is ſo very dangerous.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, by no means, cowards only fly from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the brave are ever moſt forward to face it.'</p>
               <p>'It is true, that the brave will face it with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when it muſt be met; but it is raſhneſs alone that will ſeek it unneceſſarily. However, to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, my dear ſir, I do not think that there is any thing ſo very dangerous in miſs Conolly's eyes, but that one may encounter their glances, without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the imputation of raſhneſs.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington felt a little chagrined at this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but made no reply. However, he conſoled himſelf with the reflection, that impreſſions made at firſt ſight, are not always the moſt laſting, and reſted on the hope that miſs Conolly's accompliſhments, when they came to be known to his ſon, might work the effect, which her eyes had failed of.</p>
               <p>After ſupper, lord Arlington could not help obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſon's gravity, ſaying, half in jeſt and half ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:038283_0015_1011890CC4611030"/>'Indeed, my Theodore, you are ſo ſerious that one would think you had left your heart behind you: you uſed to be all life and ſpirits before you went away: I ſhall begin to hate foreign countries, if they have deprived me of the chearful companion I was ſo long accuſtomed to.'</p>
               <p>'Indeed, I beg your pardon, ſir, a thouſand times,' anſwered Theodore, 'I own it is very wrong, after ſo long an abſence from ſuch a kind and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate parent, to meet him at my return, with a clouded brow: but though bleſt in the living, a pang will ſometimes ariſe for the dead; and recollect, ſir, what a friend I have lately loſt, and how much every object here reminds me of him; nor blame me if a cloud now and then appears, to break the ſunſhine which ought to beam on my countenance.'</p>
               <p>''Tis true, indeed, my ſon,' anſwered lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, and I no longer wonder at, or blame the ſorrow you appear to feel. Mr. Lewſon was worthy of every reſpect you can ſhew him; and not deeply to feel his loſs, would be brutal indeed in you, who owe him ſo much.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington, indeed, ſecretly rejoiced to hear his ſon's appearance of gravity and thoughtfulneſs ſo well accounted for. He had himſelf, though fully ſenſible of Mr. Lewſon's merit, and the obligations which he owed him, ſo loſt in the firſt joy of ſeeing his ſon, all recollection of the loſs of that valuable friend, that it never once occurred to him, that his ſon had that cauſe of ſorrow. But he no ſooner heard it mentioned, than he immediately felt the full force of his remarks, and wondered not that Theodore, who had for ſo long a time been his conſtant compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and had gone through the painful ſcene of attending him in a long illneſs, which he ſaw him at laſt finally ſink u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of circumſtances, make the like impreſſion on his own mind.</p>
               <p>Theodore, however, felt this reproof of his father's
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038283_0016_1011890E5007CE38"/>
deeply, and reſolved, that nothing more of this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſhould, if poſſible, appear. The next day, therefore, at colonel Conolly's, he was much leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, than on the former occaſion; he was perfectly eaſy and polite—talked much of foreign countries, their manners and cuſtoms—entertained the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with many anecdotes of hie travels, and, in ſhort, was quite the hero of the circle.</p>
               <p>Horatia was charmed with him; ſhe ſung and played; ſhe exhibited ſpecimens of her talents in drawing and painting; ſhe talked of London, and the beau monde; but Theodore was inſenſible to all her attractions, though perfectly polite to her. On the whole the day paſſed off pleaſantly; and at parting in the evening, lord Arlington reminded the colonel and his daughter of the feſtival which was to take place at Arlington the next day, when his ſon would be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one years of age, and which mr. and miſs Conolly both ſaid they enjoyed too much in idea, to have wanted to be reminded of.</p>
               <p>Great preparations had been making for ſome time, for the celebration of this day; the rooms, which from the deſertion of the houſe by his anceſtors, and from the retired plan of life which lord Arlington himſelf had adopted, had been ſhut up for many years, were now opened, having been repaired and decorated for the occaſion; not that by a fooliſh and wanton extravagance, lord Arlington, meant now to undo all that years of prudence had been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing. The feſtivity was conducted at the ſame time with economy and hoſpitality. Nothing gaudy or frivolous was mixed with it; but every thing was good of its kind, and ſerved in plenty, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>A moſt elegant dinner, a concert, with a ball and ſupper, were ſerved within the houſe, attended by the nobility and gentry for many miles round. Without the houſe, an ox was roaſted whole, with plenty of other beef, pies, plumb puddings, ale and punch, for
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038283_0017_10118910DA74FEB8"/>
the tenants, both farmers and peaſantry, men, women, and children; and in the evening there was a diſplay of very fine fire-works, with rural muſic, and a dance upon the green.</p>
               <p>The whole was a ſcene of elegance and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of jollity and hoſpitality; and was conducted with the utmoſt regularity and order: nor did one untoward circumſtance intervene during the whole of the entertainment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival, on whoſe account it was given, was preſent in every place by turns, and was alike admired wherever he went; he was no leſs eaſy among the company without doors, than amongſt thoſe within; he ate ſome of the ox with them; drank health and happineſs to them all; joined with them in their dance, and while he continued with them was as one of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Nor was his elegance of manners a leſs ſource of admiration to the company within doors; he charmed them all, and it was with peculiar pleaſure that lord Arlington and colonel Conolly both obſerved, that Horatia was not amongſt the number of thoſe who were the leaſt ſenſible to his attractions. In fact, ſhe that day completely loſt her heart; it became wholly and ſolely mr. Percival's. But the love ſtill remained entirely on her ſide: though ſhe was dreſſed to the beſt advantage, though ſhe danced to perfection, and was allowed by all preſent, to be the fineſt woman in the room, ſhe was not at all the particular object of Theodore's attentions, ſhe came in for no more of them than her ſhare in common with the reſt of the company.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington obſerved this indifference of his ſon's with the deepeſt regret: a regret, which time only increaſed, inſtead of diminiſhing; for time only ſhewed more and more plainly, how little proſpect there was of Theodore ever voluntarily fixing on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia in his choice of a wife. And this regret, which was felt ſo deeply by lord Arlington, was doubled in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038283_0018_10118912976931D0"/>
the heart of colonel Conolly; as it became every day more apparent, how much his daughter's affections were engaged to a man, who repaid them with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indifference; and appeared, indeed, as much as poſſible to ſhun her. This, indeed, was but too true. Theodore ſoon perceived what the aim of both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was; and as he had no inclination to comply with their wiſhes, he thought it the moſt honourable mode of proceeding, to avoid the lady whenever he could do ſo, without being guilty of incivility.</p>
               <p>Eight months had elapſed thus, mr. Percival at ſome times appearing quite thoughtful and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, at others eaſy and chearful; when lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington growing impatient of delay, determined to lay open his mind to his ſon. He called him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, one day into his ſtudy, and thus addreſſed him:</p>
               <p>'My deareſt ſon, it is my moſt earneſt wiſh to ſee you well ſettled in life; nor could any thing, I think, be more deſirable for you, than an union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your family, and that of colonel Conolly, by a marriage with his daughter. She is a very amiable and accompliſhed woman, to whom you cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly make any objection, and her fortune is beyond what your moſt ſanguine wiſhes could have dared to think of. I have ſounded the colonel's ſentiments on the ſubject, and though he might have formed much higher views for his daughter, yet he is content, he kindly ſays, to wave all other conſiderations, in the happineſs he ſhould feel at beſtowing his daughter on a man of your worth and accompliſhments. I hope therefore you will raiſe no obſtacle to an union, which would give ſo much ſatisfaction to all parties.'</p>
               <p>Theodore heard his father out, without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to interrupt him; but being well aware, that ſuch a propoſal was likely to be made to him, he was prepared with his anſwer, and replied with a calm but firm tone, as follows:</p>
               <p>'I am perfectly ſenſible, my deareſt father, of your kind intentions towards me, in the alliance you
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038283_0019_10118914E07733F8"/>
propoſe. I am perfectly ſenſible too, of the merits of miſs Conolly, and of the honour done me by her father; but indeed, dear ſir, I muſt entreat of you not to think of preſſing this match any farther. I am ſure miſs Conolly is not a woman with whom I could ever be perfectly happy. She is, though amiable in her diſpoſition, uncultivated, except in thoſe ſhowy accompliſhments, which may, indeed, attract the ſenſes, but never can find their way to the heart; and though ſhe may paſs off very well as an aſſociate for an afternoon, ſhe muſt be an inſipid and unintereſting companion for life; nor can I ever conſent to an union, which I am ſure would make me miſerable.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington was ſufficiently chagrined at the firm and decided manner in which his ſon declared his diſapprobation of a meaſure, which he had ſo much at heart to accompliſh; unwilling, however, totally to give up this darling project, he often urged it on his ſon, alleging to him not only the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the lady herſelf, which he thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfy any man; but that, added to theſe, ſhe would bring him a fortune which would entirely clear his ſtill encumbered eſtate; and was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in that light alſo, a moſt deſirable match for him.</p>
               <p>Theodore, however, continued firm, often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his father, that he could eſteem miſs Conolly, but never could love her; and that no happineſs could be experienced in the marriage ſtate without an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington could not deny the force of this objection; but ſtrove to parry it, by urging that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem was the beſt poſſible foundation for love, and that if he ſhould marry miſs Conolly, he did not doubt but love would ſoon be added to eſteem. But all was in vain. Theodore ſeemed reſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to conſent to the match. He grew, too, almoſt daily, more thoughtful and melancholy, 'till at laſt his father, who, as we have already ſaid, was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038283_0020_10118917E4C6D738"/>
not eaſily to be turned aſide from any thing he had once reſolved on, grew quite incenſed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Colonel Conolly, too, had, for ſome time paſt, grown very impatient at the delay of an union, on which his mind was ſet as much as lord Arlington's, and often urged the latter to uſe authority with his ſon, as entreaties were of no avail; till at laſt his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments working on lord Arlington's own feelings, wrought him up to the very point which Theodore had long foreſeen and dreaded. Accordingly, lord Arlington, one day, on his return from a morning's ride to Airville, called his ſon into his ſtudy, and with a harſhneſs of tone and manner, which he had never before uſed towards him, ſpake thus to him:</p>
               <p>'Theodore, deareſt ſon of my affection, for whoſe ſake I have conſented, for ſo many years, to baniſh myſelf from a world, which had ſo many charms for me; how is it, that I am to endure the mortification of ſeeing you perfectly inſenſible to all that I have done for you, while you make not the ſmalleſt return to me for ſuch obligations? One only thing have I ever aſked of you, in return for all I have done, all I have given up for your ſake, yet that you deny me, with an obſtinacy that wounds me to the ſoul. How is this, how can you be thus ungrateful?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! ſpare me, ſpare me, my deareſt father, wound me not thus,' cried the agitated Theodore 'Heaven is my witneſs, with what reluctance I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear thus ungrateful to you; but the ſacrifice you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand—'</p>
               <p>'The ſacrifice!' exclaimed lord Arlington, with a countenance pale with anger. 'What is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice I aſk you to make?—This mighty ſacrifice is to marry an amiable and beautiful woman, whom thouſands would rejoice to have in their power, with a fortune beyond what your moſt ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could hope for, and thus to render happy the declining years of an affectionate parent, who has thought no ſacrifice too great to make for you; to ſee

your paternal inheritances freed from their preſent embarraſſments, and in a ſituation to be tranſmitted, unincumbered, to the remoteſt poſterity;—this, this is the mighty ſacrifice I aſk.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, 'tis too much, 'tis too much!' exclaimed Theodore, convulſed with agitation: 'I wanted not this to rend my ſoul in pieces; no, no, my father, it muſt not, cannot be.'</p>
               <p>'Grant me patience, heaven,' exclaimed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant lord Arlington, 'what inſufferable obſtinacy! but hear me, ſir, my paſſions once rouſed, are not eaſy to be calmed; comply with my wiſhes, or I ſwear—'</p>
               <p>'Oh! hold, hold,' cried Theodore, 'hear me, deareſt father, hear me—'</p>
               <p>'By heaven,' ſaid lord Arlington, 'I will hear no more!—either conſent before three days are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, to what I deſire, or never come into my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence any more.'</p>
               <p>So ſaying, he burſt haſtily out of the room, and flew to colonel Conolly, to relate what had paſſed, leaving Theodore in a ſituation more eaſily to be imagined than deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Colonel Conolly applauded the reſolution which lord Arlington had at laſt ſhewn; and ſaid, he did not doubt but it would have the deſired effect. He added, that his fortune ſhould be diſpoſed of in any way that lord Arlington and his ſon wiſhed; for he had no other object but to ſee his daughter the wife of mr. Percival.</p>
               <p>The three days which lord Arlington had allowed to his ſon for making his determination, paſſed over without his ever ſeeing him, or even enquiring for him. Indeed, had be enquired for him, it would have been to no purpoſe, for Theodore had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the caſtle the whole time; nor did any one belonging to the houſe know what was become of him. On the evening of the third day, however, he arrived at the caſtle, juſt in time to attend his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038283_0022_1013BFD62A6DF810"/>
ſummons, when he appeared before him, pale, dejected, tottering in his ſteps, apparently plunged in the deepeſt affliction, and moſt truly an object of compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Such a ſpectacle in a moment diſarmed lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington's anger, and turned it immediately into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, as he conſidered himſelf the author of his ſon's miſery. He took him by the hand, led him to a ſeat, and began to ſay the moſt ſoothing things to him. Theodore could not ſpeak for ſome minutes: but when the power of utterance returned, 'No more of this, I beg, my father,' he ſaid, 'your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now wounds me as deeply as your anger did, when laſt we met—I am now wholly your's— do with me as you pleaſe—make me—make me—the huſband —of miſs Co—nolly—I have no more—to ſay— againſt it.'</p>
               <p>Theſe words were uttered with ſuch a faltering accent, that they were ſcarcely articulate; but lord Arlington underſtanding by them an aſſent to his wiſhes, broke forth into warm expreſſions of joy at that event, mingling them with the deepeſt concern for the ſtate in which he ſaw his ſon.</p>
               <p>'Pray, pray, ſay no more,' ſaid Theodore, 'I have conſented to this marriage. Talk not either of joy, ſorrow, or gratitude. I muſt have time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover myſelf. I will propoſe it in form in a few days: but in the mean time let me be left to myſelf —I ſhall ſoon be calm —I ſhall indeed—but reaſon will beſt gain ſtrength in privacy—excuſe me, my father—forgive me—I cannot ſtay with you now.'</p>
               <p>He roſe up, and was going out of the room, but was hardly able to ſupport himſelf. The aſtoniſhed lord Arlington offered to aſſiſt him, with looks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the deepeſt terror. He feared to loſe ſight of his ſon, in the ſtate in which he ſaw him, yet wiſhed not to diſtreſs him farther, by combating his wiſh to be alone. Theodore read in his father's eyes what was paſſing in his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:038283_0023_1011891B505CFED0"/>'Do you then fear me, my father?' he ſaid, 'but you need not—indeed you need not—I am agitated —I am not well—but my ſenſes are perfect. I am not diſtracted—indeed I am not—let me go then. I will ſee you again to-morrow, if I can—but truſt me to myſelf—you may ſafely do it.'</p>
               <p>'But let me then aſſiſt you, my Theodore, to get to your chamber. Support yourſelf on my arm; you are weak; you muſt be very ill.'</p>
               <p>'No, not very ill—a night's reſt will do much for me—pray don't be alarmed—there is no cauſe for alarm.'</p>
               <p>At theſe words he quitted the room, leaving lord Arlington to a train of very unpleaſant reflections. He plainly ſaw that ſomething ſat very heavy on the mind of his ſon, and thought that he had puſhed the affair of the match too far. He even reſolved to offer to releaſe his ſon from the conſent he had given to it; and had almoſt determined to go immediately to colonel Conolly, to inform him of the ſtate of affairs, and rather to hazard an abſolute breach with him, than to permit the match to proceed any farther. But it grew late in the evening, and he determined to defer the matter till the next morning.</p>
               <p>When the morning arrived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, his ſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo much amended in the ſtate both of his body and mind, that he thought matters were not quite ſo bad as they had ſeemed to be on the preceding night: and he determined to wait for a day or two, to ſee how he went on, and not to act with too great precipitation. In ſhort, by the time that a few days had elapſed, Theodore had acquired ſuch an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy over himſelf, that he could conceal, from all but himſelf, the anguiſh that inwardly preyed upon him.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington obſerved the daily amendment in his appearance, with the higheſt ſatisfaction; and ſoon loſt, with his alarms for his ſon, the idea of putting off the match. In a ſhort time, therefore,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038283_0024_1011891D48413C48"/>
purſuant to the promiſe he had given his father, he made his offer in form to miſs Conolly, which was accepted with tranſport by her, and her father; and when all things were duly prepared, Horatio Conolly became the wife of Theodore Percival.</p>

               <p>COLONEL CONOLLY's joy at this event, was as unbounded as his perſeverance in accompliſhing it had been; but he did not long ſurvive it. About ſix weeks after the marriage took place, he was ſuddenly taken off by an apoplectic fit, and put mr. Percival into complete poſſeſſion of his large fortune. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining debts upon the Arlington eſtates were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately paid off: and lord Arlington would have been the happieſt of men, if he could have been aſſured that his ſon was ſo. But of that he ſometimes had his doubts, though he never ſuffered thoſe doubts to eſcape his lips; and Theodore was in general ſo good a counterfeit, that it was not often he gave cauſe for ſuſpicion. However, that lord Arlington's doubts were not unfounded, the ſequel will ſufficiently ſhew.</p>
               <p>About a year after their marriage, mrs. Percival preſented her huſband with a ſon, to the unſpeakable
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038283_0025_1011891F109CA3C8"/>
joy of his grandfather. Mr. Percival too, ſeemed pleaſed with this addition to his family; but his joys were always clouded over by at leaſt an equal portion of chagrin; a chagrin too, which was increaſed by the reflection that he was poſſeſſed of every thing, which, according to the opinion of the world, could conduce to the happineſs of man. But perhaps we can in no way paint to the reader ſo forcibly the then ſtate of his mind, as by preſenting him with a letter, written by mr. Percival himſelf, at the time we are ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>A friend of his youth, with whom he had kept up a conſtant correſpondence during his travels, had frequently written to him ſince his return to Ireland, and ſince his marriage, but had never received any anſwer from him, except to his congratulations on his nuptials. He again wrote to him on the birth of his ſon, and with congratulations on that event, mingled reproaches for his ſilence, adding, that he ſcarcely knew whether he ought to write to him again. To this letter Theodore wrote the following anſwer: <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>'I acknowledge, my dear friend, the juſtice of your reproaches: I have been negligent of you: I am negligent of all the world, for there is ſcarcely a worldly object which can intereſt me.—Yes, my friend, that wife whom half the world envies me, whoſe worth, accompliſhments, and ardent affection for me, I feel and admire—I am negligent even of her. I feel that I wrong her, and deteſt myſelf for it. But I have this to urge in my defence, that ſhe never was the object of my choice, and my indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for her I cannot conquer; yet her whole ſtudy is to pleaſe and recommend herſelf to me. Oh! why did I ever conſent to this ill-fated union? why did I not reſtrict, that it was not myſelf alone that I was ſacrificing to my father's wiſhes, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia too? I am convinced that I was wrong, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038283_0026_101189220E78A2B8"/>
and that I ought to have reſiſted my father to the end. Horatia, though ſhe had given up her heart wholly to me, might, in time, have conquered her paſſion, and been happy; but with a huſband who is indifferent to her, ſhe never can be ſo I thought every thing would be ſmoothed to me, when I ſaw my father happy—vain thought!—how often am I forced to break away from the joy that beams in his countenance, and ſeems to reign in his ſoul, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the anguiſh that preys on mine? In the deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the ſurrounding rocks and woods, I lie down to give vent to my ſorrows, that I may return to my family with a compoſed countenance; but though, by theſe means, I deceive my father tolerably well, I cannot deceive my wife! ſhe feels, I know— I ſee that ſhe does that my attentions to her are forced, the effect of duty, not of affection. She ſees me kiſs my little ſon, and preſs him fondly to my boſom, but ſees anguiſh mingled with my fondneſs. Such is the ſituation of one who has now been, in the eſtimation of the world, for above a year a happy huſband. Wonder not then, my friend, if, in ſuch a ſituation, you do not hear often from your faithful, but wretched</p>

               <p>Hitherto, however, ſelf reproaches were the only cenſures mr. Percival had incurred; for the world ſaw no reaſon to cenſure him, ſince, to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance his conduct was exemplary. The time, however, was arrived, when a different ſcene was to be laid open Mrs. Percival was recovered from her lying-in; and as no reaſon remained for the family living any longer in retirement, it was determined that they ſhould paſs the enſuing winter in London. Every thing was accordingly prepared for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and the day fixed for them to ſet off for Dublin, from which place they were to embark for England. On the evening before that day, lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, his ſon, and daughter, were looking over ſome
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038283_0027_10118924544F2478"/>
papers together, in order to the ſettling of ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily concerns, before they left the place, when a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was brought to Theodore, which having read, he changed colour, ſeemed violently agitated, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying a word, went haſtily out of the room.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington and mrs. Percival both obſerved his agitation, but for ſome time took no notice of it; but an hour having elapſed, without Theodore's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, lord Arlington began to expreſs anxiety about him; for, ſaid he to his daughter, 'you muſt have obſerved how much he ſeemed agitated when he read that letter.'</p>
               <p>'I did indeed,' anſwered mrs. Percival, 'but hardly dared to obſerve it—I have ſeen ſuch emotions ſo frequently, that I dare not obſerve upon them.'</p>
               <p>'Ha? it is even ſo then?' ſaid lord Arlington, 'you think my ſon unhappy.'</p>
               <p>'Alas! it is moſt certain,' ſhe replied: 'he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to conceal it; but it will ſometimes break out. Suppoſe we enquire if he is ſtill at home.'</p>
               <p>'No,' ſaid lord Arlington, 'I will go myſelf and ſeek for him.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington went out of the room—he ſearched all over the houſe, but could not find his ſon. He then enquired of his ſervants, if they knew any thing of him; they could only anſwer, that he left the houſe on receiving the letter, and had not returned ſince; but they could not tell which way he went. They were then queſtioned, who brought the letter? To which they anſwered, that it was brought by a woman, with her face muffled up in a large cap and bonnet, who ſeemed unwilling to be ſeen; ſhe only gave in the letter, deſired it might be carried to mr. Percival, and then walked away as faſt as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Here was ground for alarming ſuſpicions; yet lord Arlington reſolved not to proceed too haſtily. Two hours more paſſed, and no Theodore appeared. Lord Arlington then ſent round the grounds, particularly to a wood, which he knew his ſon uſed to frequent
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038283_0028_101189264A158B00"/>
very much; but no ſon was to be found. He ſent about the pariſh, but could learn nothing of him; he had not been ſeen by any body: night came on, but they could not go to bed, and reſolved to renew the ſearch as ſoon as day-light appeared—they did ſo, but with no better ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>At laſt, as lord Arlington and mrs. Percival were ſitting down to breakfaſt, the former was called out of the room to a woman, who deſired to ſpeak with him alone, and whom he, therefore, ordered to be ſhewn into his ſtudy: ſhe appeared carrying in her arms a beautiful female child, very neatly dreſſed, and who ſeemed to be about a year and a half old. She drew a letter from her pocket, and gave it to him, ſaying, 'that ſhe was ordered to deliver it into no hands but his own, and to wait while he read it.' Lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington ſaw it was his ſon's writing—he eagerly opened it, and read as follows: <floatingText type="letter">

I never can return to you, 'till I know whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that letter are true or falſe—to obtain that knowledge, is the cauſe of my preſent abſence; my future conduct muſt be regulated by events. Seas muſt at preſent divide us; in the mean time, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, condemn not, too haſtily, the conduct of a ſon who may have been faulty, but who has ſuffered, and does ſuffer, ſeverely for it—and if ever that ſon was dear to you, attend to the requeſt he now makes you; perhaps it is the laſt he may ever make. Look, dear, dear ſir, look on the infant who accompanies this letter!—heaven ſure never formed a more lovely creature!—pity her innocence! — pity the dangers to which an unprotected infant is expoſed; then take

She is not the offspring of illicit love; her birth is lawful, her parents illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; yet, ah hard fate! from them ſhe muſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at leaſt, be ſeparated; be a hapleſs outcaſt! will you then? will my Horatia ſupply their place to her? —yes, ſurely you will—it will be enough for you to know, that your Theodore is intereſted in her fate. Let her be ſo educated, my father, that ſhe may be qualified to adorn the higheſt ſtation in life, or to make her way in the loweſt: teach her to be able to get her own bread, if it be neceſſary, and inſtil into her principles of charity and benevolence, which ſhall impel her to impart bread to thouſands, ſhould the means to do ſo fall to her lot. Will you too, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, become the protector of colonel Conolly's injured daughter? I would have ſaid, of my wife, but ſcarcely dare call her by that name—and of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſon? Let the child I ſend you, be educated as his ſiſter: let them be taught to live in the ſtricteſt friendſhip with each other; but guard them againſt other thoughts than thoſe of friendſhip. Let both their minds be early ſtored with knowledge and virtue —knowledge, the moſt valuable treaſure they can poſſeſs—virtue, their only true ornament.</p>
                        <p>'I would ſay much more, but my ſenſes are ſo diſordered, that I hardly know what I write. Tell the amiable Horatia—what—ah, ſhe knows it well— that I revere her worth—that my heart is grateful for all the affection which ſhe has laviſhed on me—oh! that my affections could have been equally devoted to her—but I know ſhe will be ready to caſt a veil over my errors— then, why ſay more?—yet I muſt add another exhortation, my father, that you will love the poor little friendleſs Antoinette, and let her add to that name, the name of Percival. Remember, dear ſir, that if it can be a fault to have given birth to ſo ſweet an infant, the fault is not the child's, but her parents'; ſhe, dear ſoul, is innocent—then take her to

               <p>Whether aſtoniſhment, horror, or tenderneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed moſt in the breaſt of lord Arlington, on read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this letter, it is difficult to determine; they all contended for empire. He looked firſt at the letter, then at the child, which the nurſe had ſet down, and which inſtantly ran up to him, and was looking in his face with all the eloquence of ſpeechleſs innocence. He could not reſiſt it—he caught her in his arms— kiſſed her ardently—'yes, lovely Antoinette,' ſaid he, 'he muſt be more than a monſter, who could withſtand ſuch ſweetneſs, ſuch innocence! you ſhall be my child — my ſon is intereſted in your fate—you are unprotected—what motives can plead ſtronger?' He kiſſed her again —ſhe ſmiled—a tear ſtole down his cheek—he remained for ſome minutes quite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in contemplating her—he read the letter again —he was more and more bewildered—ſhe was born of illuſtrious parents, and in lawful wedlock, yet thrown on his compaſſion—it was affecting to think of. He inquired of the nurſe, if ſhe knew any thing of the child's hiſtory; all ſhe could tell him, was that about fifteen months before, mr. Percival came one day to her houſe at Killarney, with this child in his arms, and followed by a woman, who appeared to be not more than twenty years of age. He aſked, if ſhe would be willing to take in the woman and child as lodgers, and ſaid that he would pay her whatever ſhe required for it; that it was of importance to him, his

placing them there ſhould be kept a ſecret; and that ſhe ſhould be well rewarded for not betraying him. The woman ſaid, ſhe at firſt heſitated, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> with her to conſent to it, ſhe at laſt did yield to him; and that they had continued at her houſe ever ſince. She ſaid, that mr. Percival often came to ſee the child, but that it was generally, either late in the evening, or early in the morning; and that he ſeemed exceſſively fond of it. That the evening before, he came to her houſe in a violent agitation, and took the child's nurſe into another room, where they ſat for ſome time, in earneſt converſation; and then deſiring a pen and ink, he wrote the letter which ſhe had brought, and giving it into her hands, he deſired her to carry that, with the child, by breakfaſt time the next morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Arlington caſtle; to give the letter into no hands but lord Arlington's, and to wait with him while he read it. Then he and the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, after both of them had affectionately kiſſed the child, went out of the houſe; but ſhe did not know what became of them.</p>
               <p>This relation was no leſs aſtoniſhing to lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, than all that had before paſſed. He then enquired by what names the child and its nurſe had been called? And was anſwered, that the former was called Antoinette, the latter Joanna; but no ſurnames had ever apppeared for either. His next enquiry was, what ſort of a woman Joanna appeared to be? To which mrs. Roberts (for that was the name of the woman) replied, that ſhe was a genteel appearing woman ſhe ſhould gueſs her to be rather of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling rank of life, but ſhe could not tell exactly; that ſhe was a French woman, and underſtood very little Engliſh when firſt ſhe came over, but could now ſpeak it very well, ſo as to be perfectly underſtood. She ſaid, that often, while ſhe was kiſſing and careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the child, ſhe would ſhed tears, and lament that it was to live in ſuch obſcurity; but, that ſhe had
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038283_0032_1011892FDAE6DF10"/>
never ſuffered a word to eſcape her lips, relative to the parents of the child; but (mrs. Roberts ſaid) her own idea was, that Antoinette was the child of Joanna, by mr. Percival; and that mr. Percival would have married her, only that he found his father was deſirous of his marrying miſs Conolly. All this ſhe ſaid, with an apology to lord Arlington; but as he ſeemed to wiſh to hear all ſhe could tell him, ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to mention her conjectures.</p>
               <p>Theſe conjectures were ingenious on the part of mrs. Roberts, but did not at all ſatisfy lord Arlington. His ſon declared the child to be born in lawful wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock; and ſhe could not, therefore, be his child by Joanna, unleſs he was married to her; and, ſurely, he could not have been ſo baſe as to marry miſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolly, while he had another wife living—it was all myſtery. He aſked mrs. Roberts if ſhe had been paid up to the preſent time? To which ſhe replied, ſhe had been always regularly, and liberally, paid; and that mr. Percival had ſettled every thing of that kind the evening before. Lord Arlington then gave her a guinea, and diſmiſſed her.</p>
               <p>What now was to be done with regard to mrs. Percival? This queſtion agitated lord Arlington very much: he had left her in ſuch a ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, that ſhe muſt be anxious to ſee him again. He was reſolved, himſelf, to take the child into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: but, what would mrs. Percival ſay to her huſband's requeſt? He determined, at laſt, that it was better to break the ice at once; he, therefore, with the child in his arms, returned to the breakfaſt room, where mrs. Percival had ſpent many an anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moment, in expectation of him. Judge of her ſurpriſe, at ſeeing him enter; not alone, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but bringing an infant with him. He went to his ſeat—he ſat down—he looked earneſtly at mrs. Percival, whoſe eyes ſpoke the utmoſt aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>'Look on this child, my love; is it not a little angel?'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:038283_0033_101189322C921478"/>'Heavens! What do you mean my lord?'</p>
               <p>'Can you be a mother to this child?'</p>
               <p>'Oh God! oh God! Is it then ſo?—ſome other woman.'—She could ſay no more—ſhe fell back in her chair.</p>
               <p>'Be calm, my deareſt daughter,' ſaid lord Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. 'I know not whoſe child this is—I do not know that ſhe is my ſon's—compoſe yourſelf—call up all your reſolution to your aid, and read this letter.'</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival rouſed herſelf; 'Oh! if I am thus inſulted,' ſhe exclaimed;—'but let me be calm!' She then took the letter, and read it. Love, horror, reſentment, and mortification, alternately ſeized her breaſt, and ſparkled in her eye: but they paſſed off in rapid ſucceſſion. She looked at the child—ſhe had only one ſenſation left, which was, ſelf-condemnation at the manner in which ſhe had deſcended from the true dignity of her ſex, in giving her hand to a man, to whom ſhe well knew at the time, ſhe was an object of indifference, if not alſo of averſion. 'Yes!' ſhe exclaimed, 'I am rightly ſerved; but I will make all the atonement in my power—ſhe ſhall be my child— 'tis enough that my Theodore deſires it—come, then, poor orphan, come to my arms.' So ſaying, ſhe took the child from lord Arlington, kiſſed it, and burſt into an agony of tears. Theſe, at length, ſomewhat ſubſiding, ſhe again kiſſed the child—'hapleſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette,' ſaid ſhe, 'you ſhall indeed be my child; I will endeavour, aſſiſted by my father, to form your infant mind to virtue, that, if ever that unhappy wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, who is ſo anxious for thy welfare, ſhall hereafter ſee thee, he may know that he has not erred, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing me capable of exerting my benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unprotected innocence.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington warmly applauded her ſentiments and from that hour the friendleſs Antoinette was conſidered as the child of adoption by them both, and provided for accordingly.</p>
               <p>But not to the child alone was their anxiety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:038283_0034_10118933C04D7BF0"/>
No pains nor expenſe was ſpared to find out, if poſſible, what was become of the diſtracted Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore. But all was of no avail: no traces of the courſe he had taken, could be diſcovered: and after many weeks of fruitleſs enquiry after him, the purſuit was given up; and they reſted in the hope, that time might throw more light on this myſterious affair, and diſcover what diligence had ſought for in vain.</p>
               <p>They then applied themſelves to arranging, and putting in order his apartment, which was left in the utmoſt confuſion; determining carefully to lock up every thing which he had left, conſidering his papers, and all things belonging to him, as a moſt ſacred depoſit.</p>

               <p>THIS unhappy affair had put a total ſtop to their intended journey to Great Britain. After ſome time, lord Arlington mentioned it again to his daughter-in-law, and propoſed to travel about ſome parts of the country during the ſummer, and go to London in the winter. Mrs. Percival replied to this propoſal, that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:038283_0035_101189358BE43468"/>
ſhe by no means wiſhed him, at preſent, to think of leaving Ireland, alleging, with good reaſon, that if any hopes could be entertained, of hearing again of their loſt friend, it muſt be by remaining on the ſpot. 'And what pleaſure, my lord,' added ſhe, 'can I hope to find from the gaieties of London, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſituation in which I am now placed?—no, my lord, the time was, when indeed I ſhould have ſought, in diſſipation, to chaſe away ſorrow; but after living more than a year with my Theodore, I have learnt, that reading and reflection are the moſt powerful cordials to heal a wounded mind. And though, alas! they could not work a complete cure in his, yet I am well convinced, that it was from thoſe ſources he derived all the little intervals of tranquility that he ever did attain; and we know not to what a depth his ſoul was wounded; perhaps, even beyond the power of the ſtrongeſt medicines to heal.</p>
               <p>'In a word, my lord, ſince my connexion with that beloved Theodore, I have found that my father (who I am well aſſured meant to do every thing that was kind to me) miſtook the path of prudence in my education, and in giving me every ſhewy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, which it was poſſible to acquire, neglected to give me one, which, though of a leſs ſplendid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is worth all others put together—a taſte for reading and intellectual improvement. How often have I felt—with the deepeſt mortification felt—my total inſufficiency to be the companion of a mind ſo highly cultivated, as that of my Theodore; and ſighed in ſecret, to render myſelf more worthy of him!</p>
               <p>'Let me then, my lord, live ſtill in retirement, and ſo enrich my mind with knowledge, that ſhould heaven ever give back to my arms a huſband, whom I almoſt adore, I may ſhew him, that I have a ſoul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of emulating even the perfections of his.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington heard her with equal aſtoniſhment and delight. He very much feared himſelf, that her deficiency as a domeſtic companion, had been one
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038283_0036_101189374167CD60"/>
very principal cauſe of his ſon's indifference to her; and hoped, when that obſtacle was removed, if he ever did return, he would find ſuch an alteration, as would entirely reconcile him to his ſituation.</p>
               <p>He therefore highly applauded the reſolution ſhe had taken, and claſping her in his arms, 'Ah, my daughter,' ſaid he, 'how much do you deſerve a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier fate!—would to heaven that my ſon could have ſeen with my eyes—how different, then, would your ſituation be!'</p>
               <p>'Oh! blame not your ſon,' ſhe anſwered, 'blame me only,—it was in my power to have prevented an union, which, had not paſſion and vanity blinded me I might have foreſeen could never have been a happy one. But let us drop ſo painful a ſubject: repining is of no avail, and the uneaſineſs which I have thus brought on myſelf, I am determined to ſupport with fortitude—my own ſenſations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I am reſolved that ſuch a ſource of mortification ſhall not exiſt to that dear charge he has left me, if it be in my power to prevent it. He bids me ſtore her mind with knowledge—his requeſt ſhall be ſacred to me. But how am I to ſtore it? with what I do not myſelf poſſeſs? Ah! then, what an additional motive is thus held out to me, to ſpur on my induſtry! Yes, dear Antoinette, child of my Theodore's love, I will inform myſelf that I may impart knowledge to you: ſuch knowledge as ſhall teach you to ſhun the rock on which my peace of mind has been wrecked.'</p>
               <p>The idea of rendering herſelf a fit companion for her huſband, and inſtructreſs for her children, having thus ſtrongly taken poſſeſſion of the mind of Horatia, ſhe loſt no time in applying herſelf to ſuch ſtudies as would contribute to the furtherance of her views; and when, to a good capacity, an ardent deſire of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an eager thirſt for knowledge, are united, the knowledge ſo deſired is not difficult to be attained.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038283_0037_1011893B25C68C28"/>
The truth of this poſition mrs. Percival ſtrongly exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified. She made a rapid progreſs in her purſuits, with the aſſiſtance of lord Arlington, and another gentleman, a friend of the family: this was a doctor Schomberg, a clergyman, who was a widower, with one ſon and one daughter, both married and ſettled; and who, being an excellent ſcholar, and a perfect gentleman, and having a great deal of leiſure time, was ſolicited to undertake the office of mrs. Percival's inſtructor.</p>
               <p>With ſuch aſſiſtance, and her own indefatigable induſtry, mrs. Percival made a very rapid progreſs in various branches of knowledge, ſo that by the time the children were of an age to want her inſtruction, no one was more capable of inſtructing them; nor did ſhe ever depute that taſk to another, giving an excellent example to the daughters of affluence, who are too apt to imagine, that wealth excuſes them from maternal duties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd who think they have done ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their children, by placing them at a boarding ſchool, or putting a tyrannical governeſs over their heads, who teaches them nothing effectually but to be conceited and to make courtſies.</p>
               <p>Four years had now elapſed, ſince the ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Theodore; in all which time, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the utmoſt diligence had been employed, not a trace of him could be diſcovered; he had never written to his family, and the whole buſineſs remained as myſterious as ever. Mrs. Percival was ſettled into a calm reſignation; her whole thoughts were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in improving herſelf and her children, and in attending to ſuch amuſements as a retired country life affords, and ſhe felt no wiſh for other amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Hope was not totally baniſhed from her breaſt, though its rays glimmered there but faintly; and lord Arlington's affectionate kindneſs to her lightened all her cares. But that ſource of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhe was now to loſe; his health had been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declining for ſome time: the conſciouſneſs of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:038283_0038_1011893CB210B238"/>
which made him more anxious than ever to hear of his ſon; and that anxiety again preying on a debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated conſtitution brought on his diſſolution, though at no very advanced age.</p>
               <p>This ſtroke called forth all mrs. Percival's philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy to ſupport with fortitude. Though almoſt adoring her huſband, and half diſtracted at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of her, yet while ſhe ſtill had lord Arlington to look up to as a friend, counſellor, and aſſiſtant in the education of her children, ſhe felt not quite ſo deſolate, as her ſituation now appeared to be. She had, however, one friend yet left, doctor Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, who had for more than two years been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant inmate in the houſe, and whom ſhe deſired to continue as ſuch; wiſely ſetting at defiance any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which a babbling, ill-natured world might paſs on her, for acting thus contrary to its arbitrary laws, which ſhe conſidered as trifles, when put in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the ſolid advantages, which ſhe hoped would reſult to herſelf and the children, from having ſuch a man conſtantly with them.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington left his whole fortune in mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival's power, while his ſon continued to abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his family, but made many proviſions in caſe of his return; none of which, however, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial for the reader to be made acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Thus was mrs. Percival left for the preſent, ſole arbitreſs of a large fortune, with the charge of educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two children, and providing by her example, and inſtruction, for their future reſpectable appearance in life. There ſcarcely could, perhaps, be a more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous ſituation for a woman to fill with propriety. Young and handſome, an object of admiration, round whom, had ſhe choſen to ſhew herſelf in public, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of flatterers would have flocked; yet deſerted by her huſband, whom ſtill ſhe could not ceaſe moſt ardently to love—even uncertain, whether that huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were yet alive—with two children to educate, one of whom was not her own, and to whom, from
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:038283_0039_1011893EB4045C48"/>
the circumſtances in which ſhe was thrown into her care, many women would have conceived an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable diſlike—with a large fortune ſolely under her management—ſhe was in a ſituation truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing. Yet all theſe concurrent ſources of embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, which would have weighed down ſome minds, and rendered them almoſt incapable of action at all, only ſerved to tender her's more vigorous, and to make her double her exertions to go through her taſk with prudence and propriety.</p>
               <p>She determined to inform her children preciſely of the true ſituation of the family, when ſhe thought them of an age to be capable of receiving the ſtory as ſhe wiſhed, and reaſoning properly upon it: but 'till then ſhe thought it better to conceal from them how they were circumſtanced, nor to let them have any other idea than that they were really brother and ſiſter. And ſhe truſted that when they had been educated in ſuch habits of friendſhip, as ſhould ſubſiſt between brother and ſiſter, that thoſe habits would continue, even when their true ſituations were known to them; for ſhe equally dreaded that a change of the ideas they had been accuſtomed to entertain of each other, ſhould operate either to an alienation of their mutual regard, or to carrying that regard beyond the limits of fraternal affection, againſt which Theodore had, in his letter, given the ſtricteſt caution.</p>
               <p>When, ſometimes, in the innocence and ſimplicity of childhood, they would enquire whether they had no papa, ſhe always told them that their papa was gone abroad into foreign countries; and ſhe was afraid that he was dead, as ſhe had not heard of him for a long time. Nor was ſhe at all apprehenſive, that Antoinette might learn by accident, any hints of her own ſtory; for before ſhe was of an age to have attended to them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat ſtory was almoſt forgotten in the neighbourhood. She was called miſs Percival, as Theodore had requeſted; and, as ſhe was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed to be a natural child of his, and it was
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:038283_0040_10118942EEF10F30"/>
ſuppoſed that he was gone off with her mother, after the neighbourhood had amuſed themſelves with the affair, as long as they found amuſement in it, which was no longer than 'till a more novel circumſtance ſuperceded it, it was thought of no more.</p>
               <p>They continued at the caſtle, 'till Henry had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted his ſeventh year; when Antoinette was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be approaching to the end of her ninth. Mrs. Percival now began to think that it was time for them in ſome ſort to emerge from the cloſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in which they lived; and ſhe determined, therefore, to go over to England, for the purpoſe of completing their education, and introducing them to more knowledge of the world, a knowledge which ſhe conſidered as an eſſential part of their education.</p>
               <p>Her great difficulty was in what way beſt to diſpoſe of Henry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>till ſhe thought him old enough to travel with advantage and improvement, which could not be 'till he was ſixteen or ſeventeen years of age. As to Antoinette, ſhe had not a doubt, that it was beſt to keep her entirely under her own care, procuring only proper maſters to inſtruct her in ſuch things, as none but profeſſed maſters could properly inſtruct her in; ſuch as muſic, drawing, and all that are generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated genteel accompliſhments; and as theſe were to be beſt procured in London, ſhe determined to reſide there during the winter, and ſeek out ſome pleaſant retreat in the country for the ſummer.</p>
               <p>After much conſultation with doctor Schomberg, it was determined to find out, if poſſible, ſome eligible ſituation for Henry, among that deſcription of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who undertake the education of ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of boys only, as they can educate themſelves; which is, perhaps, the beſt ſituation a boy can be placed in, to obviate the objections which he againſt an entirely private education, and the ſtill ſtronger objections which ſubſiſt againſt a public ſchool. When this was determined on, doctor Schomberg wrote to a friend in England, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſuch a ſituation; and was by him recommended to a gentleman in Hampſhire, who took only eight boys at a time, and who had juſt then a vacancy. The account given of this gentleman's character, learning, plan of education, and general manners, being ſuch as exactly correſponded with the ideas of mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival, ſhe immediately agreed on terms with him, and determined to carry her ſon thither the enſuing ſpring.</p>
               <p>She, accordingly, arranged all her affairs in Ireland, and having conſigned the management of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the ſteward, mr. Mac-Allen, whoſe fidelity had been long tried and approved in the family, ſhe left Arlington caſtle about the end of the month of April, attended by doctor Schomberg, Henry, and Antoinette, and arrived at the houſe of her ſon's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tutor, mr. Sidney, in about three weeks after, ſhe having made many little ſtops by the way, to ſhew her children ſuch things as ſhe thought worthy of their obſervation.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned to mr. Sidney her intention of ſeeking out ſome country reſidence for the ſummer months during the time that ſhe ſhould think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to continue in England, he told her of a pretty retired place about ten miles from his houſe, which was then to be let, and which he thought would ſuit her exactly. She, accordingly, went to ſee it, and finding it quite the kind of place ſhe wiſhed to have, ſhe hired it, and immediately ſettled herſelf in it, with her good friend doctor Schomberg, and the amiable little Antoinette, leaving Henry under the care of mr. Sidney, with whoſe appearance ſhe had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pleaſed.</p>
               <p>After ſpending a very pleaſant ſummer in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, mrs. Percival went to London for the winter, where Antoinette was put under the tuition of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per maſters, and made a rapid progreſs in her various attainments. Mrs. Percival entered, in a very ſmall degree, into what are called the gaieties of London;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038283_0042_1011894658733378"/>
but her houſe ſoon became the great reſort of men of genius and talents, whoſe ſociety ſhe was eager to cultivate, and who always met with a welcome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from her.</p>
               <p>After a winter ſpent thus pleaſantly and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in the very ſpot where the generality of women waſte all their time in folly and diſſipation, ſhe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the ſummer again to her cottage in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, accompanied only by Antoinette, doctor Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg being gone to Ireland, on private buſineſs of his own.</p>

               <p>IN a few days after mrs. Percival's return, her ſon came over to ſpend the day with her.

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038283_0043_10118947ED5A4E48"/>
unwilling that the children ſhould perceive her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe immediately recovered herſelf, and ſaid, 'I am ſorry, my love, that you have accepted ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Who was it gave it to you?'</p>

               <p>'Why, mamma, he was a man, that came twice into our field, while we were all at play; and he looked for all the world like a beggar: but, however, he never begged, and he would make me take this watch.'</p>
               <p>'I am ſorry you did take it, my dear; you know I ordered you never to accept preſents, without mr. Sidney's leave; and I dare ſay, he did not give you leave to accept this?'</p>
               <p>'No, mamma; for I had not an opportunity of aſking his leave; but he knows I have it; and he bid me ſhew it to you. I'll tell you all about it. The firſt time he came, we were all at play at cricket; and he came up and ſaid, ſo, my lads, you ſeem all very merry; but you have gotten a very bad ball; I have a much better here in my pocket; try it; and then he pulled out a ball, and gave it to one of the boys; and then he began aſking all our names; and when I told him my name was Henry Percival, he aſked me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had a papa and mamma alive; and whether I had any brothers and ſiſters? And I told him that I did not know, whether I had a papa or not, but that I had a mamma and a ſiſter: and then he aſked me, how it came about, that I did not know whether I had a papa? and I told him, that he had been gone away a long time, and my mamma was afraid that he was dead, becauſe ſhe did not hear from him. Then he aſked me, my ſiſter's name; and I told him it was Antoinette—and a great many more queſtions he aſked me; and he deſired I would read to him, if I had a book in my pocket; and ſo I took out Gay's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ables, and read him one or two; and then he aſked
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038283_0044_10118250B1833778"/>
if I could read Latin; and ſo I read him ſome of Ovid; and then he patted me on the head, and ſaid I was a good boy, and bid me behave well to my mamma and ſiſter: and he enquired where you lived: and I told him at London in the winter, but you would come down again into Hampſhire in the ſummer, to a place about ten miles off. And he aſked, if you had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lived in London; I told him no; we lived at Arlington caſtle in Ireland 'till laſt year, and then I came to mr. Sidney's, and you did not mean to go back to Ireland, 'till I was to leave mr. Sidney again.'</p>
               <p>'And what ſort of a looking man was he?' ſaid mrs. Percival.</p>
               <p>'Why, he was but a queer looking man, he had ſuch a great beard, mamma, as long as Iſaac the Jew's, at Killarney. Oh, and I forgot to tell you, mamma, that he aſked me to let him cut off a lock of my hair, which I did, and he put it up in his pocket-book.'</p>
               <p>'Well, my love,—but the watch?'</p>
               <p>'Oh, mamma, I ſhall come to that preſently; that was not 'till the ſecond time that he came. I don't remember any thing more to tell you about the firſt time he came. But we were talking about him at dinner; and mr. Sidney ſaid it was very odd, and he told us if ever the man came again, to let him know, and he would come and ſpeak to him. Well, the next morning, he came, and he pulled out this watch; and aſked me, if I liked it. And I ſaid, yes; I thought it a very nice one; and then he ſaid, he would give it to me; but I told him, that I was ſure my mamma would not like I ſhould take it, then he ſaid, he was ſure my mamma could not be angry with me for ſuch a thing as that; and then I ſaid, that ſhe ordered me never to take any preſent without mr. Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's leave; but that I would go and aſk him what I ſhould do, for he ſeemed ſo earneſt that I ſhould take it, mamma, that I did not know how to refuſe; and, juſt as I was going to ſee for mr. Sidney, I ſaw him come to the gate of the field, and then the man laid
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038283_0045_1011894BDA7FB4E8"/>
the watch down on the ground, and ran away into the wood, and we ſoon loſt ſight of him, and he never came any more.'</p>
               <p>'And how long ago was this, my love?'</p>
               <p>'Why, mamma, it was only laſt week; I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to write to you, and tell you all about it; but mr. Sidney ſaid, that I had better wait, and tell you all about it when I ſaw you, as you was coming down ſo ſoon.'</p>
               <p>What a field of ſpeculation was here opened to mrs. Percival: that this man was her huſband, ſhe could not doubt for a moment; but how ſtrange was his behaviour, and how reſolute he ſtill ſeemed to keep himſelf concealed from her! Alas! that woman that went off with him!—ſhe knew not what to think—but mr. Sidney was to come over in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon to fetch Henry back, and then ſhe might, perhaps, hear more. When he arrived ſhe took him aſide, and mentioned what her ſon had told her, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring at the ſame time if he knew any thing farther about this extraordinary man.</p>
               <p>'He is an extraordinary man indeed, madam!' ſaid mr. Sidney: 'Yes, madam, I can give you ſome farther particulars of him. When firſt I heard the young gentlemen's account of him, the ſame idea ſtruck me, which, pardon me, madam, you no doubt entertain, that this was indeed mr. Percival (for mr. Sidney knew his ſtory) and for that reaſon I deſired to be immediately ſummoned, if he ſhould appear again. I was ſummoned accordingly; but as you already know, madam, he ran away on ſeeing me approach; I followed him into the wood, but could not ſee any thing of him. I immediately made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries about the village, if ſuch a man had been ſeen; and found that he had been about for two days: but no one ſeemed to have concerned themſelves about him. He never ſpoke to any one, except at the public houſe, when he aſked for what he wanted, and they could not tell where he lodged. I, with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038283_0046_1011894E342FDD00"/>
madam, traced him to your pariſh, and from thence to Southampton, but there I quite loſt him. I have however deputed a man whom I can truſt, to make farther enquiries there; and pray heaven they may prove ſucceſsful!'</p>
               <p>'But, you did not ſee him, ſir, when he was in your fields?'</p>
               <p>'My view of him was indeed very imperfect, madam. I could ſee that he was tall, and that his clothes were very much tattered: but I enquired of one of the boys, a youth of ſixteen, what kind of a man he was; and he told me that he had a very dark ſwarthy complexion, remarkably fine eyes, a large black beard, and a great deal of long black hair, which hung very much about his face and ſhoulders, as if ſtudiouſly to aſſiſt in diſguiſing him.'</p>
               <p>'Ah! too ſurely it was my huſband!' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'but—ſtill cruel, ſtill dark and myſterious in his conduct. Oh! ſir, you have been kind and friendly indeed, in the ſearch you have made for him. What more can be done to diſcover him?'</p>
               <p>'I know not of any thing farther to do,' returned mr. Sidney. 'You may depend on me, madam, that every exertion poſſible ſhall be made to gain you far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information; but allow me, madam, to ſuggeſt, whether it will not be better, that you ſhould remain quiet in this affair, and leave all enquiries to me; you may depend on my activity in your ſervice; and my exertions will not occaſion the ſpeculations, that any made on your part might do.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! how juſt is your reaſoning, and how more than commonly friendly is your conduct!' ſaid mrs. Percival. 'Yes! dear ſir, I agree with your opinion, and will myſelf make no ſtir about the matter: but oh! my huſband, how unkind is your conduct!—How have I deſerved!—But no—I have deſerved it all!— I will not dare to murmur.' She could not refrain from burſting into tears; but her fortitude ſoon roſe ſuperior to all weakneſs, and reſtraining her emotions,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038283_0047_1011894FC9360840"/>
'No,' ſhe ſaid, 'this weakneſs muſt not be allowed!' and after a few minutes, ſhe returned with mr. Sidney to the children.</p>
               <p>Day after day, however, paſſed over, nor was mr. Sidney able to give mrs. Percival any ſatisfaction on the object of her preſent anxiety. He could learn no tidings of him, and, at laſt ſhe ſunk again into a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of his ever returning to her. She had juſt abandoned hope, when doctor Schomberg returned from his journey to Ireland; and ſhe imparted to him what had paſſed during his abſence. As ſhe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her relation, he exclaimed, 'Poor unhappy man, and ſo he has been in England alſo!'</p>
               <p>'How!' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'Do you then know any thing of him?'</p>
               <p>'Indeed, I have now no doubt, that I do,' returned doctor Schomberg. I had, before I heard your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the ſtrongeſt reaſon to ſuſpect that he had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Arlington caſtle, juſt before I went there, and you, madam, have confirmed me in the truth of my conjectures.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! quickly tell me all you know,' ſaid mrs. Percival, eagerly.</p>
               <p>'I will, madam,' replied the doctor; 'I had, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, heſitated within myſelf, whether I ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the ſtory to you or not, leſt it might only be a renewal of your troubles, but as you know ſo much already, I will conceal nothing from you.</p>
               <p>'When I arrived at Arlington caſtle,' he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, 'I found mr. Mac-Allen buſied in making en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after a perſon, who had been there the week before, of whom he gave me the following account:'</p>
               <p>'I ſpent laſt week, ſir,' ſaid he, 'at Limerick upon ſome buſineſs of my own; and at my return, mrs. Simmons, the woman who takes care of the houſe, told me, that ſhe had been ſadly plagued for three days, by a madman ſhe believed, at leaſt, ſhe hoped he was mad; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>othing elſe could excuſe his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The firſt time he came,' ſaid ſhe, 'which was
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:038283_0048_10118951AFFC0AD8"/>
the day you went away, he ſpoke very civilly, and deſired to be permitted to look over the houſe, which, as he looked like a gentleman, I immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with. He was very quiet, till he got into the library, when all on a ſudden he took a knife out of his pocket, and run it through mr. Percival's picture, ſaying, that he looked ſo diſagreeable, he could not bear to ſee him. I did not know what to do for my part,' ſaid the houſe-keeper; 'for he began to look ſo wild, that I thought, to be ſure, he was quite crazy. But I thought it better not to let him go any farther; for there was no knowing what other freaks he might take into his head; ſo I told him, that as he did not know how to behave, I could not ſhow him any more of the houſe: and then he began to be very angry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and ſaid, he would ſee it; and that neither I nor any body elſe ſhould hinder him; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would not do any more miſchief, but as for that man he could not bear to ſee him, and he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my miſtreſs would let the picture hang there; ſo as I found that nothing elſe would pacify him, I went on, and he was very quiet 'till we came to my miſtreſs's dreſſing-room, and then when he looked at miſs Percival's picture, ſtood ſtock ſtill, juſt as if he was a ſtatue.</p>
               <p>'After he had looked at it for about five minutes, he aſked me, whoſe picture it was?—And I told him it was miſs Percival; and then he aſked, 'Is ſhe as beautiful as that picture?' 'Oh, yes,' ſays I, 'and a great deal handſomer too.'—'And ſhe is as ſweet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered as ſhe is beautiful: I dare ſay,' ſays he—'That ſhe is, to be ſure,' ſays I. 'Then he ſtared again at it for ſome time, and away he walked, without aſking to ſee the reſt of the houſe. Well, the next day he came again, and begged I would let him go up ſtairs to have another look at miſs Percival's picture; but I poſitively told him he ſhould not ſee it; and if he did not go away, I'd call the men, and have him turned away: and then he threw himſelf on the ground, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038283_0049_101189540167E8B8"/>
ſaid, there h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mped up, and ran away. But the third day he came again, and told me that it was in my power to make him the happieſt of men, by letting him take a copy of the picture; and if I would do that; he would promiſe not to trouble me again. So, at laſt, I thought it was the beſt way to let him have his wiſh, and get rid of him, and I ſhewed him up ſtairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he took out a pencil, and a bit of paper, and ſoon copied the picture: then kiſſing it eagerly, he put it into his pocket-book, and as he was putting it in, a paper dropped; but I took no notice of it, and when he had ſhut up the book he ran down ſtairs, and he was out of the houſe, and out of ſight in a moment; then I went up into the dreſſing-room again, for the paper I ſaw him drop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Such,' ſaid Mac-Allen, 'was the houſe-keeper's account to me, which ſurpriſed me very much. I opened the paper, which I found to contain ſome verſes, which I was very ſure were mr. Percival's hand writing. Do not you think they are, ſir?' added he, giving them to me. 'I looked at them, and perfectly coincided with his opinion.' 'Well, ſir,' ſaid he, 'I hardly knew what was beſt to be done in ſuch an odd affair, for I thought it ſeemed certain that he was a little crazy: however, I determined to make what enquiries I could after him, but all I could learn about the country was, that ſuch a man as the houſe-keeper deſcribed, had been for a week at the public-houſe at Airville, and the people there all thought him crazy. But there was a young man,' added Mac-Allen, 'who was in the houſe at the ſame time, ſtaying there for ſome days in order to ſee the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038283_0050_1011895703AB4520"/>
country, and he told me that he had been exceedingly intereſted by this ſtranger, and thought there muſt be ſomething particular in his ſtory. His figure, he ſaid, was ſtrikingly fine; his eyes beautiful, though carrying in them an expreſſion of the deepeſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. He had a large black patch on one cheek, which appeared, as if put on for a diſguiſe; and then he wore his hair very much about his face, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to conceal it. The young man ſaid, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watched him very much, he twice found him ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a piece of rock by the ſide of the lake, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intent in gazing on a picture which he always wore faſtened round his neck with a riband; and every now and then he eagerly kiſſed it, but as ſoon as he found he was obſerved, he haſtily returned it into his boſom. He had attempted to enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him two or three times, from mere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſympathy, but the ſtranger always ſhunned all communication with him, and he had not now ſeen any thing of him for three days. This was all the intelligence,' continued Mac-Allen, 'that I could gain, for as to the route which he took on leaving Airville, I could get nothing but the moſt vague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures; ſome thought he went to Kinſale; ſome to Cork; ſome to Waterford; ſome to Dublin; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of certainty could be acquired.'</p>
               <p>Such was the relation which doctor Schomberg made to mrs. Percival, and producing the verſes to her ſhe read as follows: <q>

               <p>'Yes, moſt ſurely it is my Theodore's writing,' ſaid mrs. Percival, when ſhe had finiſhed them, 'and his whole conduct ſhews too plainly that he is diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his mind; I fear too his derangement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the oppreſſion of concealed anguiſh. Oh! that any charm could allure him back to my arms! With what affection would I ſoothe his ſorrows, and endeavour to reſtore to its right tone, a mind formed by nature for every thing great and noble, but which circumſtances have thus disfigured!—And how long do you ſay it is, ſir, ſince he was at Arlington caſtle?'</p>
               <p>'It is now about ſix weeks, madam; for it was juſt before I arrived there.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, the time too correſponds with his viſit to mr. Sidney's; they muſt have been made by the ſame perſon. But, alas! his heart ſeems ſtill alienated from me!

But let me preſerve both unſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied; ſhe is not to blame, that ſhe engroſſes all the attention which I would wiſh to ſhare, nor ſhall ſhe ſuffer for it. But, ſir, was the ſearch continued after you got to the caſtle?'</p>
               <p>'It was, madam, but to no purpoſe; but, indeed, we know now what route he then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The event, indeed, proved, that mrs. Percival promiſed no more than ſhe had reſolved to perform. She ſoon returned to her

               <p>MRS. Percival continued to viſit Hampſhire in the ſummer, aad to live in London in the winter, 'till her ſon was arrived at the age of fifteen, when ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Antoniette to be approaching to ſeventeen, a time of life when it was proper ſhe ſhould be brought out into the world, if that was ever to be done. But difficulties aroſe in mrs. Percival's mind with regard to the line of conduct, which it might be proper for her in this caſe to purſue. Her Theodore had deſired that ſhe might be ſo educated, as to be fitted to adorn the higheſt ſtation in life, or to be able to get her bread in the loweſt; and ſhe had, therefore, inſtructed her in every thing, which ſhe thought was intended to be included in thoſe directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:038283_0053_1011895CB6F70798"/>But, could he mean, that with the accompliſhments thus beſtowed on her, ſhe ſhould be ſhut up from the world?—No, ſurely—that could not be his object.— Mrs. Percival wiſhed ſhe had been more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as to his intentions: but he, probably, at the time he wrote, hardly knew himſelf what his views were—perhaps, indeed, had no views at all. Her counſellor, doctor Schomberg, could not adviſe her in this affair; it was a nice point to decide, and ſhe muſt decide it entirely for herſelf. After well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, ſhe determined, at laſt, that in the enſuing winter, ſhe would introduce her into a world, which ſhe was ſo formed to adorn; well aſſured, that her mind was too well guarded againſt the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that world, to be intoxicated with its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or to be unwilling to relinquiſh them, ſhould that hereafter become neceſſary.</p>
               <p>But, before ſhe was thus to be brought forth into public notice, mrs. Percival thought it would be right, for many reaſons, to make her acquainted with her own hiſtory. It might, among other reaſons, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to put her properly on her guard againſt forming any attachment, which might, from her peculiar ſituation, be liable to draw her into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. This diſcovery therefore, ſhe determined to make, the firſt favourable opportunity that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf: and ſhe did not doubt, but many ſuch would occur in the courſe of the enſuing ſummer, which it was her intention to ſpend in Ireland. She had been ſo long abſent from that country, that ſhe wiſhed much to viſit it again, and, indeed her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was for many reaſons much wanted there. She left London, therefore, rather earlier in the ſpring, than uſual, and after a ſhort ſtay in Hampſhire, where ſhe was joined by her ſon, who, ſhe intended, ſhould accompany her, ſhe ſet off for Ireland, and arrived at Arlington caſtle the middle of May, juſt ſeven years ſince ſhe quitted it.</p>

                  </gap>ntoinette had not loſt the impreſſion which the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:038283_0054_1011895FEE895098"/>
romantic ſcenes of Arlington, and, indeed, of the whole environs of the lake of Killarney, had formerly made upon her young mind; and now perfect miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, as ſhe was, of the art of drawing, they appeared to her, beholding them with a ſcientific eye, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more beautiful and ſublime than when ſhe left them. She had been always taught by mrs. Percival, to be above the idle fears of her ſex; and not to think it neceſſary that ſhe ſhould have an attendant with her whenever ſhe ſtirred out. She, therefore, often rambled about by herſelf, and took ſketches of ſuch ſcenes as moſt ſtruck her active fancy.</p>
               <p>One day, not very long after their arrival at the caſtle, mrs. Percival being gone out for the day on buſineſs, and Henry and doctor Schomberg for a viſit ſome miles off, Antoinette, left alone, amuſed herſelf with one of theſe rambles, taking a different route from any, which ſhe had gone before. She had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, at laſt, into a delightful little valley, through which ran a ſmall rivulet, which meandered beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through a ſort of meadow, ſurrounded with woods, except at one ſmall interval, which opened on the lake, and where the rivulet emptied itſelf down a gentle ſlope into the lake itſelf.—It was a ſpot, which ſeemed formed on purpoſe for the pencil; Antoinette was ſorry ſhe had not provided herſelf with her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements for drawing; ſhe determined, however, to bring them the next day, and, in the mean time, to ſurvey the valley round, in order to fix on the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque ſpot. Having, at laſt, determined on one, ſhe was turning about to go home, when her attention was ſuddenly arreſted by the appearance of a man, who came out of the wood juſt by the ſpot where ſhe ſtood. He was clad in a long, tattered, thread-bare cloak, tied round him with a cord, at the end of which hung a crucifix; on his head he had a coarſe woollen cap, from under which appeared a few locks of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſilver-hair; and he had a long beard, which with with his eye-brows were alſo perfect ſilver. He
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038283_0055_10118961D9AD2690"/>
leaned on a ſtaff, which ſeemed hardly able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his tottering limbs; and his whole appearance was that of extreme want and wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>When he perceived Antoinette, he ſuddenly ſtarted, by which means his ſtaff ſlipping he fell down;—ſhe immediately haſtened to his aſſiſtance, and having ſet him again on his feet, he looked ſtedfaſtly up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'Great God! I thank thee,' ſaid he, 'for this mercy. I am unworthy to meet with ſuch compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but of thy goodneſs there is no end. Thou haſt ſpared my life to enjoy this bleſſed moment, and I ſhall now die content.—Bleſſed be thy name, Oh God, throughout all nations and generations!'—When he had finiſhed this ejaculation, he turned again, and looking ſtedfaſtly at her, he was ſeized with a fit of trembling, and fell again to the ground;—ſhe again held out her hand to aſſiſt him, but in a moment raiſing himſelf on his knees, and lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven in the utmoſt ecſtacy, he exclaimed, 'And is this the angel form, which my ſoul has ſo long panted to behold?—Heaven and earth!—Can it be?—Let me look at her again: Yes, yes! 'Tis ſhe herſelf!—Thoſe eyes, that lovely bloom.'—He was overcome with agitation, and ſunk down again on the ground.</p>
               <p>Antoinette was motionleſs with aſtoniſhment, at all ſhe heard and ſaw; nor could tell, what ſhe ought to think of it.—She had heard of ſtrange effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by religious enthuſiaſm; but could this moſt unaccountable ſally proceed from that cauſe only? She, however, held out her hands again to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>'My good friend,' ſaid ſhe. 'What is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?—Are you ill?—Accept of my aſſiſtance.'</p>
               <p>'Ah!' ſaid he, 'from ſuch hands, who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it? Yet, oh! will it not contaminate thy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to touch a wretch like me?' Then making a great effort he raiſed himſelf up, and leaning upon his ſtaff—'Reſolve me, ſweet angel,' ſaid he, 'from whence do you come?—Where do you live?'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:038283_0056_101189644D2E0600"/>'Juſt by,' ſhe replied, 'at Arlington caſtle.'</p>
               <p>'And are you the daughter of lord Arlington?'</p>
               <p>'I am.'</p>
               <p>'No more, no more!' he cried, ''tis too much, too much! This tide of joy, I cannot bear!—Leave me, leave me, at preſent, but'—and here he gave a look of the moſt anxious ſolicitude—'May I aſk it? —Will you keep this adventure ſecret, and meet me here this time to-morrow?—You need not fear me—there was a time when, indeed, you would not have been ſafe in my hands—but now for worlds I would not harm you—to-morrow I ſhall be more compoſed; this interview has quite overcome me.'— He pauſed, as expecting her anſwer.</p>
               <p>'I ſhall come to this ſpot again to-morrow.' Then he added, 'and may I hope? Yes, heaven will ſurely inſpire you with confidence to meet me—Your heart is, as I have witneſſed, the throne of benevolence; three times to-day have you ſtretched out the arm of charity to raiſe a fallen wretch; heaven bleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee!' So ſaying, he returned into the wood, from whence he had come, and Antoinette ſoon loſt ſight of him.</p>
               <p>She remained for ſome minutes fixed to the ſpot where he had left her, loſt in aſtoniſhment, at what had paſſed; at laſt ſhe turned homewards, pondering in her mind whether ſhe ſhould comply with the old man's requeſt or not. At length ſhe determined ſo far to ſwerve from it, as not to keep the matter ſecret, but to impart it to mrs. Percival, when ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, and be determined by her opinion whether to meet the old man or not. But before that opinion could be obtained, Antoinette was called on to act from her feelings, rather than from deliberation.</p>
               <p>About a mile from the caſtle lived a catholic prieſt, a man of the utmoſt worth and benevolence, whoſe time was wholly employed in working all the good in his power in the neighbourhood. As he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the ſame ſpot for ſome time before mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:038283_0057_101189678BE3BF38"/>
had left the country, he was well known to her, and had occaſionally been at the houſe; he was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no ſtranger to Antoinette, and had, indeed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken particular notice of that amiable girl, who on her part, was always pleaſed with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, his attentions.</p>
               <p>She had not been returned home above two hours, before this benevolent man came to the houſe, and deſiring to ſpeak with her, was immediately ſhewn into the room where ſhe was ſitting. As ſhe had not ſeen him before ſince her return, ſhe ſprang forward with great eagerneſs at hearing his name announced, and taking him by the hand, expreſſed the greateſt pleaſure at ſeeing him again; and he, on his part, expreſſed equal delight at her return into thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>'But, my dear miſs Percival,' ſaid he, 'we muſt not waſte time in compliments, I have buſineſs of importance to impart to you.—Have you not this morning ſeen, and converſed with an old hermit?'</p>
               <p>Antoinete anſwered, that ſhe had, and that he had requeſted her to meet him on the ſame ſpot again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, which ſhe intended to do, if her mother ſhould approve of it.</p>
               <p>'I have juſt now left that old man,' ſaid the prieſt, 'who ſeemed very near approaching to his laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and who expreſſed the moſt anxious deſire to ſee you again before he expires. Will you grant his requeſt, madam? I am ſure it will calm his laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—You may truſt yourſelf to me, my character is well known to you— I will conduct you to his cell —it is little more than a mile from hence, and I will be reſponſible for your ſafety.'</p>
               <p>Antoinette was more and more aſtoniſhed—'Me!' ſhe cried, 'What can he poſſibly want with me?'— But he ſhall be gratified; you would not aſk me, I know, to do what is improper—I will then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you.' She immediately put on her hat and cloak, and ſet out with the prieſt. As they walked together, ſhe enquired of him, who this man was,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:038283_0058_1011896917AFB498"/>
and how long he had been in the country?' When he gave her the following relation.</p>
               <p>'It is now near ſeven years, madam, ſince he firſt appeared here, in all which time no one has been able to learn any thing of his ſtory. When he at firſt came he took up his abode entirely in the open air, lying down at night on the ground amongſt the woods, not even taking ſhelter in the cavity of a rock, and living in every reſpect a moſt auſtere life. I had often met him by chance, before I ventured to ſpeak to him; but, at laſt, I broke ſilence, by obſerving, that he ſeemed to have no habitation, and, as winter was coming on, he was in danger of periſhing, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued thus expoſed to the inclemencies of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.'</p>
               <p>'He replied, that a wretch like him, could not be too much expoſed to hardſhips—Penances and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications were the only road by which he could hope to reconcile himſelf to an offended deity,' adding, 'the world hardly contains ſuch another wretch, ſuch a monſter as I am!'—He then fell on his face to the earth, but ſtarted up again, 'No,' ſaid he, 'I dare not pray!—prayer from me would be downright blaſphemy!—Pray for me, father, your oriſons may be accepted; mine never can be.' After ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther converſation with him, finding that ſome actions of his life filled his ſoul with anguiſh and remorſe, I preſſed him to unboſom himſelf to me, and make me his confeſſor, and in time he might obtain abſolution.'</p>
               <p>'No,' ſaid he, 'I have an oath regiſtered above, a ſolemn oath—I have ſworn by the moſt high God, the ruler of heaven and earth, never to reveal my ſecret, unleſs—" Here he pauſed—he remained motionleſs for ſome minutes, with his eyes fixed upwards—'No,' ſaid he, 'abſolution I cannot have—Even the mercy of the Almighty can never pardon a wretch like me; and ſhall man then dare to pretend to it?'</p>
               <p>'I liſtened to him with aſtoniſhment, horror, and pity, but preſſed him then no farther—but I have
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:038283_0059_1011896AE06486B8"/>
ſince that time had much intercourſe with him, and with ſome difficulty prevailed on him at laſt to fit himſelf up in a cell in one of the rocks which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the lake, where at firſt he would only have a little ſtraw to lie on, and one chair, but by degrees I have perſuaded him to get a bed and ſome other conveniencies. Frequent converſations have paſſed between us, in all of which I have found him a man of poliſhed manners, with a great knowledge of the world, and no inconſiderable ſhare of learning. His favourite topic of converſation is, the dreadful effects of giving way to one's paſſions and appetites, even in the ſmalleſt degree, and I am convinced he has been guilty of ſome dreadful crime, in conſequence of not having controlled his paſſions; but what that crime may be, or whether, indeed, it is one crime in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or that in general he has ſeen horrible effects ariſe in various ways, from his ſuffering thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to rule him at all times, I cannot with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion determine: but I rather think that there is ſome one particular offence, which thus weighs him down.</p>
               <p>'He is a wonderful adopt in languages, and ſpeaks both French and Engliſh ſo equally well, that I do not know of which country to gueſs him to be, though I rather ſuppoſe him to be of England, or Ireland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a companion as you have been, to ſoothe my latter days. I am deeply indebted to you already for a thouſand little offices of friendſhip. May I yet aſk that friendſhip farther?—I feel my end approaching:' Then taking a caſket from under his pillow—'My ſtory will not die with me,' ſaid he: 'this caſket—take it when I am gone—the paper which is tied on it will give you all directions concerning it.' He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it to his pillow; but recovering from his illneſs, he has never ſince ſpoken to me on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>'He had often enquired, madam, with great anxiety, whether lord Arlington had a daughter, and expreſſed his wonder that the family never came to the caſtle. When the firſt intelligence arrived here of mrs. Percival's intention to ſpend the ſummer amongſt us, I informed him of it; he ſeemed rather agitated. I alſo told him of the family's arrival, as ſoon as I knew of that event; but he ſeemed to take little notice of it at the time, though I have obſerved that ever ſince that time, he has appeared reſtleſs and uneaſy more than uſual, and has almoſt always been rambling about, which is contrary to his uſual practice.</p>
               <p>'This morning I met him at the entrance of his cell, pale, agitated, tottering, and with every ſymptom of approaching death; I ſupported him into the cell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he ſunk down on his bed, and graſping my hand, ſaid,'</p>
               <p>'My deareſt friend, my ſpirit is departing, but I die in peace—I have ſeen—I have ſeen—ſweet angel, yes, I have ſeen her.'</p>
               <p>'I was aſtoniſhed at his words, and could not, at firſt, comprehend their meaning—he lay ſtill and ſilent a few minutes, then ſtarting up, he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>'In peace!—No. I cannot die in peace, unleſs I ſee her again—Will ſhe come to me?'</p>
               <p>'I begged of him to explain his words—he was ſilent for a little while, and then calmly ſaid.'</p>
               <p>'It is paſt; I am myſelf again; but the ſhock has been too much for me.'—He then related to me the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038283_0061_1011896FC6B73148"/>
particulars of his interview with you, madam, this morning, and concluded with ſaying—'My friend, the hand of death is now upon me—go to her—beg her to let me ſee her again before I die—'tis of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance both to myſelf and her—no time is to be loſt —I do not know even now whether I can live 'till ſhe ſhall arrive.'</p>
               <p>Antoinette liſtened to the prieſt's relation with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, nor could form in her mind any idea, which could give her the leaſt clue to ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary an affair. Perhaps, had ſhe been acquainted with her own ſtory, ſuſpicions might have ariſen in her mind, that ſhe was about to hear great diſcoveries; but ignorant as ſhe was of that, the matter ſeemed totally inexplicable. At length ſhe arrived with her conductor at the cell; on entering which, they found the hermit ſtretched on his bed in the agonies of death, yet ſtill with ſo much ſenſe, as to give a look of ſatisfaction at ſeeing them. Antoinette ſat down by him, and involuntarily took hold of his hand; it was cold as the rocky floor of his habitation. He fixed his dying eyes upon her. Twice he eſſayed to ſpeak: but the overflowings of his ſoul were too mighty for utterance. He made a ſign to the prieſt to take the caſket from under his pillow, which having done, he again made a ſign that it ſhould be put into the hands of Antoinette, and making a great effort he juſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, in a voice ſcarcely audible, ''Tis of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to you.' He then raiſed his hands and eyes to heaven—'Heaven bl—;' a bleſſing hung on his lips —he was unable to utter it—his hands fell—his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids cloſed—his boſom heaved— he expired.</p>
               <p>Antoinette, by an involuntary impulſe, again took hold of his hand, and preſſed it to her boſom. What a ſcene was here formed for a painter's eye!—the hermit ſtretched on his miſerable bed, a breathleſs corpſe; his aged and ſorrow-worn features yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the mingled emotions which agitated his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul; one hand faſt locked in that of the lovely

Antoinette, whoſe fine eye ſpoke all the feelings of pity, aſtoniſhment, and benevolence which then filled her boſom; while at the feet of the bed ſtood the philanthropic prieſt, endeavouring to ſuppreſs tears which nature would have called forth, but which phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and religion forbade him to ſhed.</p>
               <p>It was ſome time before this intereſting and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene received any interruption; but the prieſt at laſt taking Antoinette by the hand, propoſed her returning to the caſtle; to which ſhe aſſented, and taking the caſket with her, they proceeded thither together in perfect ſilence,</p>

               <p>'You ſurpriſe me much,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'Has Antoinette then been attending the death-bed of any one?—Tell me how it has happened?—Your looks, your words, ſeem to indicate that it is ſomething par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which led her to this ſcene.'</p>
               <p>'Indeed, madam, you are right,' returned the prieſt. 'The ſtory is an extraordinary one.— Come, madam,' then he continued, addreſſing himſelf to Antoinette, 'Shall I leave mrs. Percival and you to talk it over at your leiſure?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! no,' anſwered Antoinette, 'Pray do not leave us:—I ſhall want you to aſſiſt my recollection with regard to the poor hermit—I will tell my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all that I know; but you, perhaps, will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſome further circumſtances with regard to his abode in theſe parts.'</p>

               <p>Mrs. Percival heard the relation with no leſs aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than the whole tranſaction had excited in Antoinette. The firſt thing that ſuggeſted itſelf to her mind was, that this extraordinary perſonage was her long loſt huſband—But if he was ſo, how morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying was the reflection, that his only anxiety was to ſee Antoinette; he had not even mentioned the names of herſelf or her ſon!—Could he be her Theodore then?—yet circumſtances ſtrongly confirmed her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that it was ſo.—It was near ſeven years that he had lived in that ſpot;—he muſt therefore have arrived there ſoon after the time when ſhe was well aſſured that her huſband had been both in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and England—his conduct too was then ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſeemed ſurpriſing—beſides, it was evident too at that time, that he wiſhed to remain in concealment. Yes, ſhe was convinced it muſt be her Theodore.</p>
               <p>But, why not ſatisfy herſelf at once by viſiting the corpſe?—ſhe ſhould then no longer remain in doubt: The prieſt ſaid too that ſorrow, rather than age; ſeemed to have brought him to the grave. Alas! how much had her Theodore been a prey to ſorrow, even before he left her? And what havoc might not fifteen ſubſequent years of ſorrow have made in his frame? All theſe reflections paſſed rapidly in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: for to Antoinette, who was yet unacquainted with the true ſtate of the family, ſhe could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly impart theſe ſuſpicions: ſhe ſat therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving them in her mind, without uttering a word; but at times clapping her hand on her forehead, as if abſorbed in meditation.—At length ſhe begged of the prieſt to accompany her into another room.</p>
               <p>When they were arrived there ſhe aſked him 'Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had never any reaſon to ſuſpect that this man was her huſband? Yet why do I aſk that queſtion? ſhe added. 'Had you ever entertained ſuch ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, you would ſurely have communicated them to me.—Nay, indeed, you muſt at once have known my Theodore.'</p>
               <p>'Pardon me, madam,' he anſwered, 'You will recollect that I did not ſettle in theſe parts 'till very ſoon after mr. Percival's abrupt departure; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at my firſt coming here, heard much of that tragical affair, as it was then the principal topic of converſation in the neighbourhood, and conſequently being no ſtranger to the ſtory, I own I have been ſometimes led to ſuſpect that this might be the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who has coſt you ſo many hours of ſorrow. And I have therefore been always particularly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to catch at any thing which might remove or confirm my ſuſpicions. But he has been ſo uniformly wary in all the converſations I have had with him, that I have never had, in my opinion, ſufficient grounds

               <p>'I did indeed long ago impart the ſtory, by letter, to doctor Schomberg; at the ſame time conſulting him whether it ſhould be imparted to you or not, and deſiring him to act in the affair according to his own diſcretion. But he agreed with me in opinion, that without more grounds to go upon, it was better not to haraſs your mind at all on the matter. Doctor Schomberg, ſince his arrival here, has ſeveral times attempted to ſee the old man; though, as he ſaid, mr. Percival was ſo little known to him, that he ſhould have had difficulty in recollecting his features, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially under ſo different an appearance; but, madam, as the hermit, contrary to his uſual cuſtom, has ſcarcely ever been in his cell ſince your arrival at the caſtle, doctor Schomberg has never been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſight of him.'</p>
               <p>'But,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'has Mac-Allen never ſeen him?'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied the prieſt, 'he has ſeen him very frequently; but he has always ſaid he did not think he could poſſibly be his maſter; for though, to be ſure, he was about his ſtature, and very much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him in perſon, excepting that he was bent, with weakneſs, he does not think that eight years of ſorrow and fatigue could have given a man of mr. Percival's years, ſuch an appearance of age, as this hermit had, even at his firſt arrival.—Of this, however,' continued the prieſt, 'I am well aſſured, from many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that the hermit knew a great deal of mr. Percival, if he was not mr. Percival himſelf; and I have alſo good reaſon to ſuppoſe, that he was not ſo old as his firſt appearance led one to imagine him.'</p>
               <p>'Well,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'I am determined to be ſatisfied; I will go and viſit the corpſe. You will perhaps be ſo kind as to accompany me thither.'</p>
               <p>'I think you are perfectly right, madam,' anſwered

the prieſt; but as it now grows late, and would be quite duſk before we could reach the cell, will it not be as well to defer your viſit till the morning? You will then find me at the cell.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then, it ſhall be ſo,' anſwered mrs. Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, 'to-morrow morning we will meet there; in the mean time, I muſt go through the painful taſk of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my dear charge her true ſtory. It muſt no longer be kept a ſecret from her. Perhaps I have been wrong in not imparting it to her before; but I have always dreaded, leſt the knowledge of it might be a means of abating the friendſhip in which we have hitherto lived.'</p>
               <p>The prieſt now took his leave; and mrs. Percival returned to Antoinette, who, filled with aſtoniſhment at what had paſſed, ſat impatiently waiting for her; ſhe could not conceive the reaſon why her mother had not made any remark on the ſtory of the hermit; or why ſhe ſhould ſo immediately deſire a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the prieſt; yet as ſhe knew, that there was ſomething rather myſterious relative to mr. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival's conduct, ſhe began to have confuſed ſuſpicions wandering in her mind, yet of ſhe ſcarcely knew what.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival, on entering the room, ſaw plainly what was paſſing in the mind of Antoinette, and that ſhe wiſhed to know much more than perhaps ſhe thought it was proper for her to enquire. She, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after a pauſe of a few minutes, in which ſhe was ſummoning all her reſolution to her aid, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate what ſhe dreaded to impart, but what ſhe thought it would be criminal any longer to conceal, began the converſation by ſaying,</p>
               <p>'You are, perhaps, ſurpriſed, my love, that I have not yet made any remarks to you on the extraordinary ſtory you related to me—Alas! my child, you know not with what ſenſations it has inſpired me.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! my deareſt mother,' ſaid Antoinette,—'I fear—I know my father.' She could not arrange her ideas ſufficiently; tears burſt from her involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038283_0067_1011897D67FD55D0"/>
though ſhe ſcarcely knew what produced them. —She looked earneſtly and anxiouſly at mrs. Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but her eyes only, not her tongue, could ſpeak; ſhe ſeemed at once to wiſh and dread to hear more.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival took her hand; 'Antoinette, my love, my child,' ſhe ſaid, 'it has been my earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtore your mind with virtue and fortitude. —The latter muſt now be put to a ſevere teſt.— Tell me, my love, can you attend with unſhaken nerves to a ſtory, which, would to heaven I could for ever bury in oblivion, but which muſt one day be revealed to you,—which, perhaps, can never be better revealed to you than at this moment, when your mind, called into a ſtate of exertion, is fortified to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo great a ſhock.—What do I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—never better revealed than at this moment! Ah! If I were to let this moment ſlip, when would my courage be again equal to the arduous taſk—to the dreadful taſk of wounding, as I ſhall do, my Antoinette, the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a ſoul like your's?—Tell me, is your mind, my love, armed to hear it?'</p>
               <p>'Ah me!' ſaid Antoinette, 'What is it that I am to hear!—But tell it me at once, my deareſt mother, be it what it may.—I am armed to hear it; and truſt, that I ſhall never in any action of my life diſgrace the excellence, which has trained me up, and taught me by example, as well as by precept, to bear with like equanimity of temper, the bewitching ſmiles of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, or the ſharp frowns of adverſe fortune.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'liſten, my child. —You have been told, even from the firſt moment, when reaſon dawning in your tender mind, led you to enquire with infant curioſity, if you had no papa, that the fate of that father, of whom you thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was unknown.—But in telling you that, how little, alas, did I diſcloſe to you!—My huſband's, my Theodore's fate, is indeed unknown; but heaven only knows, my love, whether that Theodore be really your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:038283_0068_10118980324BB3B0"/>Antoinette turned as pale as death—her head ſwam round—ſhe reſted it on the ſhoulder of mrs. Percival—a pauſe of ſome minutes enſued—all was ſilence—Antoinette, at laſt, raiſed her head again —''Tis paſt,' ſhe cried. I am recovered. My ſenſes had almoſt forſaken me—but go on, my deareſt—what ſhall I ſay?—Mother!—my tongue would fain utter that dear ſound—but—'</p>
               <p>'Alas! you are right, my love.—I am not your mother. But never, never, can I ceaſe to love you as a child. So ſaying, ſhe eagerly kiſſed her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand, and preſſed it to her boſom; then added, 'Shall I go on, my love? Shall I not quit the ſubject for the preſent; perhaps, 'twill be too much to tell you all at once?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! no,' ſaid Antoinette, 'let me hear all:—I have recovered the firſt moment of agony and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and have no fear of a relapſe; but oh! my —' ſhe pauſed, ſhe heſitated. 'Mother,' ſaid mrs. Percival. 'Let me not loſe that tender appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and even ſhe who has a claim to it from you, can never love you with more partial fondneſs than I do—But I will purſue my ſtory.'</p>
               <p>She then related all the particulars of her marriage with mr. Percival;—of his ſtrange departure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of her (the infant Antoinette) to the protection of herſelf, and lord Arlington; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the relation, with giving Antoinette the letter, which Theodore ſent with her, and which would vouch for the truth of the ſtory ſhe had been telling.</p>
               <p>If Antoinette had been ſurpriſed with what had paſſed relative to the old hermit, how much more was ſhe aſtoniſhed, and how much was ſhe ſhocked at what mrs. Percival had now imparted to her! ſhe fetched a deep ſigh as mrs. Percival concluded, and, 'Alas!' ſhe exclaimed, 'What a change has a few minutes made in my ſituation! But now and I was—'</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival interrupted her. 'Do not talk of a

'Believe me, your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no ways ahead; I cannot ceaſe to love you, and cannot bear the idea, that you ſhould feel a degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in your own eyes.

Be comforted, my child, be aſſured. —Here they were interrupted by the arrival of Henry, and doctor Schomberg, who returned from their day's excurſion.</p>
               <p>Henry was entering, with all the ardour of a youthful mind, delighted with his day's entertainment, and eager to relate the particulars of it;—but his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was damped in a moment, when he beheld Antoinette in tears, and with all the ſymptoms, in her countenance, of the deepeſt affliction, and mrs. Percival, with the tendereſt affection, endeavouring to conſole her. His eyes, which had ſparkled with pleaſure, were in a moment expreſſive of nothing but anxiety.</p>
               <p>'What is the matter with my dear ſiſter?' ſaid he, eagerly.</p>
               <p>'My love,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'You ſhall know preſently.'</p>
               <p>'I hope ſo,' ſaid he. 'I hope my ſiſter will never know a ſorrow, in which her brother will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to participate.'</p>
               <p>Antoinette gave him a look full of gratitude and affection, but could not make him any other reply.</p>
               <p>'Come, my Antoinette,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'You and doctor Schomberg will, perhaps, take a walk in the garden; you may talk freely with him, and the air will be of ſervice to you—I would have half an hour's converſation with Henry alone.'</p>
               <p>Doctor Schomberg went out with Antoinette, when mrs. Percival related to Henry all that ſhe had before imparted to his ſuppoſed ſiſter. He heard the ſtory
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:038283_0070_1011898414110DF0"/>
with no leſs aſtoniſhment, than ſhe had, done: and when his mother had finiſhed, he looked at her with the moſt earneſt mixture of anxiety and apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>'But I hope we are not to loſe Antoinette?' he ſaid.</p>
               <p>'Heaven forbid, that we ſhould!' returned mrs. Percival.—'No, ſhe will ſtill be my daughter.'</p>
               <p>'And my ſiſter too?' ſaid he, anxiouſly.</p>
               <p>'I hope ſo,' ſhe anſwered. 'I hope, my love, you will not ceaſe to regard her as ſuch.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, no,' he replied, 'I ſhould dread nothing ſo much (next to loſing you, deareſt madam, as a mother) as loſing Antoinette for a ſiſter. We have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated under the ſame roof, as brother and ſiſter, and have lived in the pureſt friendſhip as ſuch; and life would be but a blank to me,' ſaid he, putting his handkerchief up to his eyes, 'if that friendſhip was to be deſtroyed.'—Here he could contain himſelf no longer, but fairly ſobbed out, and let his tears have their free courſe.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival ſaw them with delight, nor could ſhe forbear to mingle hers with them: and taking her ſon's hand, 'Ah! my Henry,' ſhe ſaid, 'dear as you have always been to my ſoul, I never loved you to the exceſs I do at this moment.—This affection for your ſiſter—'tis charming—'tis enchanting!' She eagerly kiſſed him. 'How have I dreaded this moment!' ſhe ſaid. 'It was one of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of my life to ſee your affection for each other. I dreaded leſt this diſcovery ſhould interrupt it.—Go then, my ſon, haſten to Antoinette. She will anxiouſly expect the event of this interview; and your renewed aſſurances of fraternal affection, will be one of the beſt of cordials to her wounded heart.'</p>
               <p>Henry went out immediately to ſeek for Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette: and mrs. Percival retired to her room, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to compoſe her ſpirits, after the affecting ſcenes ſhe had gone through. She had not been arrived there many minutes before ſhe ſaw—the fading light of evening juſt ſerving to diſplay the intereſting ſcene—
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:038283_0071_10118986A17D97D8"/>
Henry run up to Antoinette, who, whih doctor Schombergh, was ſeated on a bench in the garden, and claſping her in his arms, kiſs her with the utmoſt warmth of fraternal affection. Mrs. Percival, quite overcome, burſt into a torrent of tears, which ſhe did not for a while endeavour to repreſs. Her feelings had been wrought up to a pitch which required, that they ſhould have ſuch a vent: and ſhe found her mind grow more compoſed by giving way to them for a while.</p>
               <p>Henry, in the mean time, gave Antoinette the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of his unalterable affection for her; aſſured her that he could never ceaſe to conſider her as his ſiſter, and to love her as ſuch; and conjured her ſtill to love him as a brother. She returned this burſt of affection with reciprocal aſſurances on her part, that nothing could wound her boſom more deeply, than the thoughts of loſing his friendſhip; and ſoon after this family of harmony aſſembled round the ſupper table with, if poſſible, even increaſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to each other.</p>
               <p>After ſupper, Antoinette proceeded to examine the caſket, which ſhe had received from the hermit. She, therefore, unbound the paper, which was tied upon it, which only contained a requeſt to the prieſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the caſket into no other hands, than thoſe of Antoinette, daughter to Theodore, lord Arlington, and which ſeemed only meant as a proviſion, in caſe he had not the opportunity of placing it in her hands himſelf. On opening the caſket, Antoinette found a letter directed to herſelf; a ſealed packet of papers, a croſs of very ſplendid diamonds; and a very ſmall miniature picture of a lady; the extreme likeneſs of which to Antoinette ſtruck every one preſent. The letter contained as follows:</p>
               <p>'In your hands, unfortunate maiden, I place a ſacred depoſit, theſe papers, this croſs, and this pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: let not the former be opened, 'till you have found a long loſt father, whom I have made wretched;
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038283_0072_10118988F1338138"/>
in placing theſe in your hands, however, I endeavour, as far as lies in my power, to atone for the injuries I have done him—for the miſery which he as endured in conſequence of my giving way to uncontrolled paſſion. Oh! would to God, that the paſt could be recalled! But if fifteen years of miſery and remorſe can atone for my offences, I may hope hereafter to find that peace, which I have never known on earth. Wear the croſs, and picture, conſtantly about you! —They are precious relics; had their former own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers been alive, how dear would you have been to them! May the God of Heaven ever bleſs you, ſweet maid, and may he have mercy on my ſoul!'</p>
               <p>New wonders were now opened to them; and mrs. Percival felt more and more convinced, that this man was her Theodore; he talked of fifteen years of miſery and remorſe, and it was juſt fifteen years ſince he left her.—But what could he mean by having made the father of Antoinette wretched?—Could Joanna have been ſeduced by him from her huſband? And could Antoinette be the child of Joanna by her huſband? Yet, ſurely, Theodore had a ſoul incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſo great villany; he had always appeared to have a high ſenſe of moral rectitude!—She was perplexed beyond meaſure, as ſhe revolved theſe things in her mind, and was impatient for the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſhe ſhould ſee the corpſe.</p>
               <p>The morning, at length arrived, when mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival, accompanied by Henry, Antoinette, and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Schomberg repaired to the hermit's cell, where they found the benevolent prieſt ſinging a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>quiem for his departed ſoul. Mrs. Percival earneſtly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the features of the corpſe. She thought ſhe diſcovered ſome faint traces of thoſe of her huſband. But age was imprinted on the countenance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, beyond what ſhe could poſſibly expect to have
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:038283_0073_1011898AC168FA28"/>
found in him. Yet why? ſorrow and fatigue will produce the effects of age on the form and features, and fifteen years were a long time for thoſe cauſes to have operated.—She looked again. She aſked doctor Schomberg's opinion.—He had not much knowledge of mr. Percival, and was, therefore, but an indifferent judge; but he owned, he thought there was a conſiderable reſemblance; that is, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the hermit was ſuch as mr. Percival's might be ſuppoſed to have become from age and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival looked again and again at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. —She grew more and more convinced that this object of miſery was the once charming Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Percival; and in this conviction, almoſt invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, took his clay-cold hand, preſſed it to her lips, and bathed it with her tears; and with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction ſhe returned home, ordering that the corpſe ſhould be depoſited in a private manner, in a vault belonging to the family of Arlington.</p>
               <p>Yet amidſt all this conviction, one doubt ſtill aroſe in her mind.—She could by no means, if this was her huſband, account for his thus leaving her in doubt, as to his fate; but, again, ſhe recollected that he had told the prieſt that his ſtory would not die with him; and there might be reaſons, why he would not yet have it developed. The prieſt called again;—he had been ſearching the cell, but could find nothing in it, except the little furniture he had, a Latin Bible and Teſtament, and the Roman Miſſal; which three books he had brought to Antoinette, as the hermit ſeemed to have ſelected her for the depôt of his few effects.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival took this opportunity of putting ſome farther queſtions to him concerning the object of her curioſity, but could gain little more information. The hermit was active and diligent to exceſs (the prieſt ſaid) in adminiſtering to the wants of the neighbouring poor, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but his means ſeemed ſlender, and I could never make out, madam, continued the prieſt, from what ſource even the little he had, was derived. He uſed to teach the poor children to read, purchaſing for them ſuch little books as he could procure at Killarney; and the children were always fond of him, and uſed to gather round him whenever they ſaw him: but, except for purpoſes of benevolence, he ſeldom left his cell. I have often gone there, and converſed with him; and at firſt, in thoſe converſations, I endeavoured to give them ſuch a turn, as might draw him inſenſibly into revealing his ſtory; but he was aware of my deſigns, and always eluded me, and, at length, one day ſaid, 'I ſee your drift plainly, my good friend; but you will not ſucceed. I have told you that I have an oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered above, never to diſcloſe my ſtory during my life, unleſs I am ſo fortunate as to ſee—.' There he pauſed—looked earneſtly at me, but without any appearance of anger; then continued, 'Do not then entertain ſo ill an opinion of me, as to ſuppoſe that I ſhall not be watchful ſtrictly ſo obſerve that oath. I have been wicked—very wicked. Few people in the world, perhaps, have greater enormities to account for than I have—yet I know how to revere an oath— I might be raſh in making it. On that matter I will not pretend to determine; but as I have made it, the world united, ſhould not force me to violate it.'</p>

               <p>FOR ſome time this affair entirely engroſſed the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mrs. Percival and her family. But no freſh incidents concerning it occurring, it, at length, ſunk gradually, though not into oblivion, yet into that kind of ſtate, that it was no longer talked of, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their attention to other concerns, and they reſted in ſilent hope, that time would make farther diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>They now began to be viſited by the neighbours,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038283_0076_1011899289D00A08"/>
amongſt whom were many people, whoſe ſociety they found very pleaſant. But the family, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was moſt agreeable to them, was that of a mr. Delaval, who had hired mrs. Percival's houſe at Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, where, it will be remembered, ſhe had lived with her father before her marriage. Mr. Delaval was a widower, with one ſon and one daughter, the latter about the age of Antoinette, the former four years older than his ſiſter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Delaval had ſome years back been reſident in Italy for a conſiderable time, on account of the ill ſtate of his wife's health, who died at Florence ſoon after the birth of Caroline Delaval, but he remained at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for ſome time after that event. At his return from Italy, he ſettled near Dublin for ſome years, and had taken Airville houſe only about four years before the time we are now ſpeaking of. His being tenant to mrs. Percival, of courſe brought the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies together, when they became near neighbours, and congeniality of diſpoſition ſoon improved their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance into the cloſeſt intimacy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Delaval and his family were all of a very mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical turn; he himſelf was a very fine performer both on the violin and violoncello. Francis, his ſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled on the flute, and could alſo play a good ſecond to his father on the violin, and Caroline ſung charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. When this family and mrs. Percival's were together, therefore, they made very pleaſant little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs. Henry Percival, whoſe taſte for muſic was not inferior to that of his mother's and Antoinette's, had for ſome time practiſed on the hautboy, on which he had attained a conſiderable degree of excellence, and could join with his voice in a glee: and mrs. Percival and Antoinette, as has been ſaid already, both played on the piano-forte, and ſung in a very ſuperior ſtile.</p>
               <p>They were particularly fond of exerciſing their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical talents in little parties on the ſide of the lake, or upon it, where the echoes reverberating from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding mountains, added a fine effect to the muſic,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038283_0077_101189945E40EB38"/>
which effect was much heightened by two excellent French-horn players, who lived at Killarney, and whom they uſually hired to be of their parties on ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>One afternoon they had been on one of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the lake, and the weather being remarkably fine, they were induced by it to lengthen out their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion 'till moon-light, when perhaps a more ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and captivating ſeene could hardly be witneſſed. The air was perfectly ſtill, no breeze ruſtled amongſt the ſurrounding trees, or ruffled the ſerenity of the waters, on which the moon bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> played with the moſt beautiful luſtre, except where the lengthened ſhadows of the over-arching rocks caſt a deep gloom on them, which only ſerved, by contraſt, to heighten the beauty of the ſcene; at intervals they ſang and played pieces and ſongs adapted to the ſcene; at others, no ſound intervened but the daſhing of the oars in the water.</p>
               <p>As they advanced towards the ſhore, Antoinette began to ſing the ſong of 'Sweet Echo,' from Milton's beautiful poem of Comus, when a hautboy from the ſhore anſwered her with ſounds that ſeemed to come from one of more than human mould; it conveyed an idea of the muſic of the ſpheres. The company were aſtoniſhed, were enchanted;—again, as ſhe proceeded, ſhe was anſwered by the ſame ſounds, or even ſweeter than before. Mrs. Percival trembled and turned pale—ſhe knew that her huſband had been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former on that inſtrument, when firſt he returned from his travels, and though he had never purſued it, from want of ſpirits to go through any ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſhe did not know what might have happened during his abſence, to draw him on ſuch a purſuit; and being always eager to catch at any thing like a ſhadow of hope on the grand ſubject that occupied her mind, without, at the firſt impulſe, abſolutely knowing a good reaſon for the idea ſhe harboured, ſhe exclaimed, 'Good heavens! who can this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038283_0078_10118996DDACA248"/>
muſician be?'—but ſhe recollected, and checked herſelf—when mr. Delaval ſaid, 'Oh! What melody! ſure never was any thing ſo fine;' —again he liſtened—again exclaimed—'What a ſtrain was that,—Oh! if I were on the ſilver Arno, inſtead of the lake of Killarney, I ſhould ſay that it muſt be count Marſini himſelf; for never did I hear ſuch ſtrains but from him.'</p>
               <p>Antoinette finiſhed her ſong, and in a minute or two the hautboy began playing again, an Italian air, in ſtrains ſtill more and more melodious—'Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!' ſaid mr. Delaval, ſtarting up in the boat, 'it muſt be Marſini, and he has at laſt remembered his promiſe, made ſo many years ago. Haſten, rowers, to the ſhore. The ſound ſeems to come from near yon creek.'</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival fetched a deep ſigh. The ſounds were accounted for: and her hopes, if ſuch a chaos of ideas as filled her boſom might be called hopes, were cruſhed again. As they drew near the ſhore, the muſic ceaſing, mr. Delaval called 'Marſini! count Marſini!' No anſwer was made, but the hautboy began again, and they ſoon diſcovered the muſician, ſeated on a rock, juſt above the creek, to which they were rowing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Delaval again called 'Marſini!'—ſtill no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made but by the muſic.</p>
               <p>'Heavens!' cried mrs. Percival, 'He anſwers not to you!—It is—it muſt be!—' ſhe ſtopped. She thought ſhe had been indiſcreet; but fortunately the attention of the company was too much engaged with the muſic, to attend to what ſhe ſaid; and it was unnoticed, except by her own family. The boat, at length, reached the ſhore, and mr. Delaval was haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to the muſician, who ſliding down the rock, met him half way, and in a moment the names of 'count Marſini,' and 'ſignior Delaval,' were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed; for he was indeed the count Marſini, whom mr. Delaval conjectured him to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:038283_0079_10118999F71BC5D8"/>This count Marſini was an Italian nobleman, with whom mr. Delaval had been very much acquainted during his reſidence at Florence, and from whom he had received very great attention and kindneſs in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways. He did not, however, continue at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence all the time mr. Delaval was there, which was near three years, for he had been unfortunate in loſing a very amiable wife, after he had been married to her leſs than a year, which circumſtance had affected him ſo much, that it had a viſible effect on his health; in conſequence of which, his friends perſuaded him to travel about, in order to turn his thoughts, if poſſible, into a different channel. It was on this ſcheme, that he quitted Florence before mr. Delaval had left it, promiſing, however, at his departure, that when mr. Delaval was returned to Ireland, he would viſit him there. But ſo many years had elapſed, ſince the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made, without its being fulfilled, that mr. Delaval began to be in deſpair of ever ſeeing him.</p>
               <p>He had, however, arrived at Airville houſe while mr. Delaval, with his ſon and daughter, were abſent on the above-mentioned party, and being informed by the ſervants where their maſter was, and conducted by them to the ſpot where it was probable the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany would land, he ſat himſelf down to ſurvey the beauty of the ſcenery, when his attention was taken off from that ſubject, by the fine voice of Antoinette, and a thought inſtantly occured to him to announce his arrival by the reſponſive ſtrains of his hautboy, which he did not doubt mr. Delaval would ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being explained, mr. Delaval intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to the company and he was, by mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival, invited to ſup with the reſt of the party at Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington caſtle; to which place they all immediately proceeded.</p>
               <p>It was on their arrival there, that Marſini firſt had a full view of the countenance of Antoinette, on which he no ſooner caſt his eyes, than he ſtarted, and was
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038283_0080_1011899B8CF283A0"/>
ſcarcely able to take them from her again. Then, as if aware of his rudeneſs, he turned them away; but during the whole evening, they were perpetually wandering towards her, and it ſeemed to require the exertion of all his ſelf-command, to keep them one moment from her.</p>
               <p>Nor did this admiration ceaſe with the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view: but it ſeemed to increaſe every time he ſaw her, which, on account of the intimacy ſubſiſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two families, he did very often.</p>
               <p>Marſini was now in the fortieth year of his age, nineteen of which he had been a widower, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, no man ever poſſeſſed greater attractions. His countenance, and perſon, were ſuch as to prejudice every one ſtrongly in his favour; for the former had in it an irreſiſtible benevolence, and animation, and the latter was genteel and well formed. He had been, as we have already hinted, a great traveller: and from the knowledge he had thus acquired of men and manners, was a moſt entertaining and inſtructive companion, and had the true Italian taſte for muſic and painting, in both which arts he was a great adept.</p>
               <p>Theſe talents recommended him extremely to mrs. Percival and Antoinette, who were both paſſionate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of excellence in any way, and both great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the arts, in which Marſini particularly excelled. But Antoinette was always the chief object of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor did he ever appear ſo happy as when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing her. Was muſic her employment? Marſini was ſtill by her ſide at the piano-forte, improving her ſtile and execution, both in ſinging and playing. Did nature's charms woo her all-excelling pencil? Marſini was always at hand to point out the moſt beautiful ſpot amongſt the romantic ſcenery around them, as an object for its exerciſe. Was her attention engaged by the ſublimity of Taſſo? by the ſweetly melting lays of love-lorn Petrarch? or by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching harmony of the elegant Metaſtaſio? Marſini inſtructed her in cadence and articulation. Marſini
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038283_0081_1011899D597B3180"/>
gave grace, feeling, and expreſſion to all. Still it was ſilent admiration only which he beſtowed on her. She never was the topic of his converſation, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as the family at Arlington were often made the ſubject of diſcourſe amongſt mr. Delaval's family, when Marſini would, in general terms, ſpeak in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of them: and though every one ſaw that he was deeply ſtruck with the lovely Antoinette, they ſaw it only; they never heard it.</p>
               <p>Francis Delaval ſaw, and not without regret, how deep an impreſſion ſhe had made on the count; not, that he ſeemed to have made the like impreſſion on her; but Francis, who had himſelf too ſuſceptible a heart to have ſeen Antoinette with indifference, dreaded leſt the perfections of the count ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance with his miſtreſs the diſproportion of their years, and at laſt make a conqueſt of that heart, which he wiſhed to retain for himſelf. He felt, at the ſame time, ſo ſtrongly, that the count was ſo every way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of her, that he could hardly regret it, ſhould ſhe beſtow herſelf on him.</p>
               <p>However, he was determined not to yield up this prize to a rival without any reſiſtance; and he was, therefore, not at all behind hand with the count in his aſſiduities. As he was well acquainted with the country, which he had explored very much ſince his reſidence in it, he contrived parties for a day's excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to any ſpot which he thought worth viewing; and in theſe he had ſometimes the inexpreſſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of having Antoinette's company with him in his chaiſe. At other times, he made parties to dance on the lawn, either at Airville or Arlington, when he ſhared, at leaſt, with Marſini, the hand of Antoinette. Various other amuſements, too, he contrived, in hopes of recommending himſelf to the object of his affections; who, on her part, received his attentions, as well as thoſe of Marſini, with an eaſy politeneſs, but without the leaſt appearance of preference, or partiality to either.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:038283_0082_101189A0C6610A98"/>Francis, one day, in one of the excurſions we have mentioned, conducted the company to a very curious cell, in a rock, which hung over the ſea, and which was called Alfred's cave, and to which, he ſaid, a very affecting ſtory was attached, as he had lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in looking over a volume of poems, called the Muſe of Killarney; which ſtory he would, if agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, read to them, when they were all ſeated in the cell. Accordingly, they all ſat down on ſeats inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly hewn out of the ſolid rock, when Francis read as follows:

               <p>FRANCIS received the thanks of the company for the entertainment he had given them; they paid 'the mournful tribute of a tear' to the misfortunes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred and Helen, and then proceeded to examine the cave. It was very curiouſly cut out of the ſolid rock into various conveniencies. In the interior was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which ſeemed deſigned as a chapel, where an urn was erected, on the pedeſtal of which was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, the characters of which were ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced by time, that it was perfectly illegible: but it was ſuppoſed to be a tribute to the memory of poor Helen.</p>
               <p>After they had ſufficiently examined the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of induſtry and ſorrow, which this cave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, the company returned to Airville, where they were to paſs the evening. There Marſini found a letter from Italy, which having read, he ſaid, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mr. Delaval,</p>
               <p>'What think you, ſignor, of our friend the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Vellorno being married to a young woman only ſixteen years of age?'</p>
               <p>'Is it poſſible?' anſwered mr. Delaval,</p>
               <p>'Why, Vellorno himſelf cannot ſurely be leſs than fifty?'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:038283_0092_101195EC6C3830C0"/>'You are quite right,' ſaid Marſini, 'Vellorno is now in his fifty-firſt year.'</p>
               <p>'Beſides,' ſaid mr. Delaval, 'it was always ſuppoſed that he was waiting for the death of count Durazzo, to marry his widow.'</p>
               <p>'Tis true,' ſaid Marſini, 'that ſuch was the general idea, but it now appears that it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded one.—But you ſhall hear what his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, count Carletti, writes to me.' Marſini then read as follows:</p>
               <p>'How much will you be ſurpriſed, my dear Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>como, to hear that our friend, and my couſin, the marquis Vellorno, has given his hand in marriage, not to the handſome widow of Durazzo, whom, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her huſband's life, he had ſo long ſerved in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ciceſbeo, and whom every one ſuppoſed, at the death of her huſband, he would have advanced to the rank of marchioneſs Vellorno; but to count de Portici's daughter, who is only thirty-four years younger than himſelf! This match is now the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal topic of converſation and ſpeculation, and it is ſuppoſed by ſome people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there are private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, of a political nature, and that the poor bride's inclinations have been little conſulted on this occaſion. Others, however, are of opinion, that the young marchioneſs has, at leaſt her ſhare in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the houſe of Portici, and that ſhe would have married a man, even twenty years older than Vellorno, for the ſake of the rank, to which ſhe is raiſed; while another deſcription of people ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſert, that it is entirely a match of affection on both ſides.'</p>
               <p>'Affection?' exclaimed Francis Delaval, 'Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible! How can the bloom of ſixteen be united, through affection, to the frozen boſom of fifty?— No, no: attachment cannot ſubſiſt between people of ſuch diſproportionate years. Oh! how I pity the lady, if ſhe has been made a ſacrifice to political <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iews! but I could almoſt find in my heart to curſe
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038283_0093_101195EF4DF9BE58"/>
her, if through ambition ſhe could form ſo unnatural an union.'</p>
               <p>'Why, I own, indeed,' ſaid Marſini, 'that there does ſeem rather too great a diſproportion of years in this inſtance, eſpecially conſidering the extreme youth of the marchioneſs. But I have heard many ladies of twenty, or even under twenty, declare, that they thought the manners of a man of forty, or near it, commonly much more intereſting and attractive, than thoſe of men nearer to their own age. I muſt beg pardon for having juſt fixed on my own age as the moſt pleaſing; but you will allow, that one cannot help feeling a little vanity in the hopes of catching the attention of the young and beautiful amongſt the other ſex.'</p>
               <p>'Francis during this ſpeech, had particularly watched Marſini's eyes, but did not find them ſtray once towards Antoinette. He anſwered; 'No apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is neceſſary on this occaſion, my dear count, and I will freely own, that if all men of forty were like you, I ſhould not at all wonder at the preference you ſeem to think the ladies in general give to men of that age.'</p>
               <p>Marſini interrupted him: 'I meant not, my dear ſir, to aſk for ſuch a compliment, of which I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undeſerving. I only meant to obſerve, that, in general, I think the ſuperior knowledge of the world, which accompanies ſuperior years, is more pleaſing to the female mind than the mere gaieties of youth, however enchanting they may be at times.'</p>
               <p>'Neither did I mean to pay a compliment,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Francis. 'I ſpoke what I really thought: and I perfectly agree in the opinion, that where a man of ſorty has made a proper uſe of his advance in years, he muſt be far more captivating than a very young man. But it muſt altogether depend on the uſe that he has made of his ſuperiority of years, whether or not he ſhall be this formidable rival of youth: for if he has not uſed it in the acquiſition of knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:038283_0094_101195F35A4985D0"/>
and improvement of his mind, the empty rattle which is ſcarcely to be endured, even in youth, is abſolutely inſupportable in more advanced years.'</p>
               <p>'Moſt certainly,' anſwered Marſini, 'no general rule can, in this inſtance, be laid down. The only thing that can be ſaid, is, that, where the diſpoſition for improvement is the ſame, the man of forty muſt have this advantage over the man of twenty; that his years have given him greater opportunity of acquiring thoſe ſources of entertainment, which muſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him very much to every ſenſible woman.'</p>
               <p>''Tis true,' ſaid Francis; 'and here we meet pretty much on the ſame point, that, where the ſpirit of improvement is wanting, the man of forty has no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over his juniors, but a manifeſt diſadvantage, in that he has loſt the agreeableneſs of youth, to which, after all, a certain charm is attached, without having attained any of the advantages of years. But, I beg your pardon, ſir, I fear I have engaged rather arrogantly in this argument.</p>
               <p>'Oh! by no means.' returned Marſini. 'I rejoice to hear you inclined to enter into ſuch kind of diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which few young men ever will engage in; and I am perſuaded they are a great ſource of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as of entertainment to both parties.'</p>
               <p>'I rejoice to hear you ſay ſo, ſignor,' replied Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis; 'for I think one great cauſe of the general ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of all parties, is, that people baniſh from them all topics of ſpeculative diſcuſſion, and confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to talking over paſſing occurrences, which I think the moſt tireſome of all converſation.'</p>
               <p>'Ah!' ſaid Marſini, 'How much do your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments recal to my recollection a young man, whom,' ſaid he, addreſſing mr. Delaval, 'you remember, ſir, no doubt, as he was with me, I think, for ſome time after you came to Florence, the chevalier de St. Foix —he was paſſionately fond of an argument of this kind, and a moſt extraordinary talent he had for it. I have known that young man, at the age of only
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038283_0095_1011824CE57F51C8"/>
twenty, completely baffle many of our ſages, both in churcn and ſtate, by the ſoundneſs of his reaſonings, and the depth of his obſervations. But perhaps, you will think, that leſs ſplendid talents than his, might have ſufficed to beat them off from ground ſo untenable, as the doctrines of our church, and the principles of our government. However, he was a rare gem.'</p>
               <p>'So he truly was,' ſaid mr. Delaval 'I ſcarce ever ſaw ſuch brilliant talents; but he came, I think, to an untimely end.'</p>
               <p>'Alas! he did indeed,' anſwered Marſini 'he quitted me to go to his ſiſter, who was, at that time, ſuffering a cruel perſecution from her father, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a marriage he had agreed on for her, to which ſhe would not conſent; and the poor chevalier was killed in a duel with this lover, after which, I was told the ſiſter was ſhut up in a convent by her father, whoſe paſſions, as I well know, were of a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable kind.'</p>
               <p>Marſini ſeemed much agitated; he fixed his eyes for a few moments upon Antoinette, who ſat directly oppoſite to him, but withdrew them rather in a hurried manner, and reſuming the diſcourſe, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'But we are wandering wide of our original queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was, Whether it could be ſuppoſed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a young woman of ſixteen, to marry a man of fifty, from attachment only. What is your opinion, mrs. Percival?'</p>
               <p>'I think it not only poſſible,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'but even very probable, that ſhe may do ſo; and I am inclined to be of opinion, that a woman has a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proſpect of happineſs with a man ſome years older than herſelf, than with a very young man, who though he may be very much attached to her at the time ſhe marries him, yet from a ſickleneſs of temper, often attendant on youth, may poſſibly abate in that attachment in a few years, and his heart may wander
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038283_0096_101195FA902F1CB8"/>
after other objects.—But, why do I ſay this? For at this moment I could cite many inſtances of happy, and many of unhappy, matches, both where there was a great diſproportion of years, and where there was nearly an equality in that reſpect. Indeed, with one of the happieſt couples I know, the diſproportion of years is on the other ſide from what we have hitherto been diſcuſſing: for the lady was thirty-two years old when ſhe married, and the gentleman only twenty-four. Yet their regard for each other has appeared continually increaſing during twenty years, which they have now lived together.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' ſaid Marſini, 'on the whole we may conclude, that it muſt depend on other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, rather than on the relative ages of the parties concerned, whether a marriage ſhall turn out an happy one or not.'</p>
               <p>'Moſt certainly,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'if they are but ſtrongly attached to each other, the ages are of ſmall importance: but no happineſs can be expected on any other foundation than that of mutual attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for this reaſon I am inclined to think, that thoſe mariages are moſt likely to be happy, which are the reſult of long habits of intimacy with each other, and where the foundation for love is laid in friendſhip; for in fact, conjugal attachment is the moſt refined ſpecies of friendſhip.'</p>
               <p>'You now ſurpriſe me much,' ſaid mr. Delaval; 'for I have always inclined to the opinion, that a very long previous engagement was rather inimical to matrimonial happineſs.'</p>
               <p>'Miſtake me not, ſir,' anſwered mrs. Percival. 'I do not mean by long habits of intimacy, a long engagement. I perfectly agree with you in opinion, that a long engagement has often proved a gulph, which has ſwallowed up all conjugal happineſs. I only mean to ſay, that I think thoſe have the beſt proſpect of happineſs in marriage, who have been long acquainted with each other before any engagement takes place.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038283_0097_101195FE81DA1348"/>
But when an abſolute engagement is entered into, it cannot be too ſoon fulfilled.'</p>
               <p>'But I am afraid,' ſaid mr Delaval, 'that it is not often, that people can come together on thoſe terms.'</p>
               <p>'Perhaps ſo,' replied mrs. Percival. 'But happy are thoſe to whoſe lot ſuch a connexion falls. Long accuſtomed to place their happineſs in each other's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—to ſhare the ſame amuſements, and the ſame occupations—to ſee, and make allowances for each other's failings; and to know how to prize each other's good qualities: I can conceive no happineſs equal to marrying under ſuch circumſtances. But where one ſide is indifferent to the other, 'tis madneſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any happineſs can ever exiſt; and 'tis the moſt dangerous of all ſelf-deceptions, to expect it.'</p>
               <p>She had gone too far in this laſt ſpeech. It brought home to her mind, rather too forcibly, her own ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. She began to heſitate, and to falter in her voice.</p>
               <p>Marſini ſaw ſhe was agitated. He knew enough of her ſtory from the Delaval family, to gueſs the cauſe of it; and willing to divert the ſubject from the courſe which it had taken, addreſſed himſelf thus to Caroline and Antoinette:</p>
               <p>'And, what do you think, ſignore?' he ſaid, 'You have not yet given your opinion on this ſubject, and perhaps you are the beſt judges in this caſe, as you are about the very age we are ſpeaking of. Do you really think you could marry a man of fifty years old, from motives of attachment only?—though perhaps, it is hardly a fair queſtion.'</p>
               <p>Caroline replied without heſitation, that he had, perhaps, gone too far in mentioning fifty; but ſhe thought it very poſſible for a young woman to marry a man of twenty years older than herſelf, from no other motive but that of ſtrong affection.'</p>
               <p>'So far,' ſaid Marſini, 'the anſwer is favourable for my ſide of the queſtion. But now, miſs Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:038283_0098_101196000DC690C8"/>
what do you ſay? May we not hope to have your ſentiments?'</p>
               <p>'Indeed,' ſaid Antoinette, 'You put a queſtion to me, ſignor, to which I hardly know how to give an anſwer.—A ſenſible man of forty or fifty may be, nay, certainly is, a moſt deſirable companion and friend for a young woman; perhaps, there hardly can be a more advantageous circumſtance to her, than to have ſuch a friend. Yet I own, for a huſband, it ſeems to me a great diſproportion of years; and I ſhould think it more deſirable for a man and woman to be united in that happieſt of all ſtates, with a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of neither of them much out-living the other. For my own part, nothing could weigh in my mind againſt the dreadful idea, that my huſband might die twenty years before me.'</p>
               <p>During this ſpeech, her eyes had wandered invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily towards Francis Delaval; but ſhe ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected herſelf, and turned them again to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe was addreſſing. Francis's eyes ſparkled with delight, whilſt Marſini appeared ſomewhat chagrined, but Henry Percival ſoon drew the whole attention of the company, by exclaiming,</p>
               <p>'Well, I am glad to hear that my ſiſter is of that opinion, for I began to be quite alarmed, leſt if the young women were all for taking the old men, we young men ſhould be reduced to take the old women; and I honeſtly confeſs, that I ſhould not wiſh for a wife thirty years older than myſelf.'</p>
               <p>This honeſt declaration of Henry's raiſed a general laugh, and ſo put an end to the converſation.</p>

               <p>BUT, though Marſini had heard this declaration of the ſentiments of Antoinette, which certainly was no encouragement to him to continue his purſuit of her; he did not in the leaſt remit his aſſiduities: but, as ſhe began to perceive their tendency, although at firſt ſhe had received, and encouraged them only as thoſe of a friend, ſhe found it neceſſary to alter her conduct, and ſhe began, therefore, rather to ſhun him. When he invited her to the piano-forte, ſhe was not inclined to play, but had ſomething to write, or made ſome other excuſe. Did he aſk her to accompany him to take ſome view?—She had already ſo many unfiniſhed ſketches, that ſhe did not chooſe to begin any more 'till ſome of them were compleated. Did he invite her to read Italian with him?— She had read ſo much lately, that ſhe wiſhed for a reſpite; and by theſe means ſhe eluded being alone with him; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, ſhe had never ſcrupled to be.</p>
               <p>Marſini ſaw and felt mortified at her coolneſs. He wiſhed for an opportunity of ſpeaking with her in private; but it was plain, that ſhe cautiouſly avoided affording him the opportunity he wiſhed. She ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom walked out by herſelf—employed herſelf in her own apartment, that ſhe might avoid ſeeing the count, who ſcarcely ever paſſed a day, without calling at the houſe; and ſhe even made excuſes to ſtay at home when the reſt of the family went to Airville. But, though this behaviour on her part, was ſufficiently
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038283_0100_101196A43393BC40"/>
diſcouraging to his hopes, Marſini was drawn to her by ſuch an irreſiſtible attraction, that he determined, at all hazards, to have ſome private converſation with her.</p>
               <p>One day, therefore, when mrs. Percival and her family were to attend a concert at Airville, the count watched, in his apartment, for their arrival; and, ſeeing that Antoinette was not with them, he immediately took his horſe, and rode to Arlington. Antoinette, unſuſpicious that he would take this method of ſeeing her, had taken no precautions to prevent his gaining acceſs to her; and he was, therefore, without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhewn into the parlour where ſhe was ſitting, practiſing a new ſong, which had been juſt ſent her from London.</p>
               <p>She was ſo intent upon her employment, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpicious of interruption, that ſhe did not perceive Marſini's entrance, 'till he came cloſe to her, and ſaid,</p>
               <p>'I hope my Antoinette has not now a letter to write, but will ſtay and hear what I have ſo long wiſhed to ſay to her.'</p>
               <p>'I am aſtoniſhed, count Marſini,' ſhe ſaid, 'at this intruſion. It is what I could not expect from you, whom I have always conſidered as a true gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.'</p>
               <p>'I own, madam,' ſaid Marſini, 'that my conduct is hardly to be juſtified; but believe me, I have not thruſt myſelf thus into your preſence, with any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perſecute or diſtreſs you, but merely with a wiſh that we may come to a right underſtanding of each other. And I faithfully promiſe, that if you will for this time give me a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Antoinette heſitated.</p>
               <p>

               <p>'No, no,' ſhe replied; 'You muſt, I think, be a man of honour, nor will ſay any thing, which I ought not to hear. Therefore, ſpeak on.'</p>
               <p>'Well then,' he ſaid, 'dear Antoinette, I think you cannot but have perceived, how deep an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you made on me, even the firſt moment that I ſaw you.' Tears almoſt ſtarted into his eyes. 'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, I was married at only twenty years of age, to a woman whom I loved to a degree beyond the power of words to expreſs, and which none but thoſe, who have loved to an equal degree, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Antoinette, when I firſt ſaw you, I thought I beheld my poor Gabrielle returned from the tomb, and could ſcarcely refrain from claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to my boſom, and welcoming a dear and long loſt friend. My ſenſations at that moment were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribable. I had, ſince the death of my Gabrielle, been quite inſenſible to female charms. I now, again, powerfully felt their influence, and had ſoon no pleaſure, when abſent from your ſociety. I wiſhed you had been my daughter—with what double tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port then, ſhould I have been your inſtructor!—have cheriſhed your virtues, and corrected your failings, though for that you would ſcarcely allow me any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity! With what tranſport ſhould I have beheld your cultivated and enlightened underſtanding, daily advancing nearer and nearer to perfection!—you would have been the ſolace of my life, which has been a burden to me ſince my Gabrielle was taken from me. But my daughter you could not be: yet I knew not how to live without you, and, pardon my preſumption, I therefore wiſhed to make you my wife.</p>
               <p>'Here, then, deareſt Antoinette, I offer you my hand and heart. The latter is entirely devoted to you; and I make this offer, for the firſt and the laſt time. I believe you far above the common female

I know you have ſeen my love for you, for I could not conceal it. This offer can ſcarcely, therefore, be unexpected; and you muſt, already, have well weighed in your mind, what anſwer you ſhould give to it.

               <p>He pauſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taking her hand, ſeemed to expect her reply. But the pathetic tone and manner in which his laſt words were delivered, had diſſolved the heart of Antoinette ſo much, that ſhe had burſt into tears, and at firſt could not ſpeak; but when reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, ſhe ſaid,</p>
               <p>'Count Marſini, you have pleaded your cauſe in the moſt eloquent manner that words could have pleaded it; and your open and undiſguiſed explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſentiments has made a much deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my ſoul, than all the artificial harangues commonly uſed on ſuch occaſions could poſſibly have done. Let me be as ingenious as yourſelf. Believe me, I moſt ſincerely revere your virtues, and eſteem your character. I feel the moſt lively gratitude for the preference with which you have honoured me; and nothing can be more grateful to my boſom, than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to cheriſh you there as a friend; but think not of any thing farther. I can love you as a friend: but were I diſpoſed to enter the marriage ſtate, I muſt candidly own, that with all my eſteem of, and regard for, you, I could not think of you as a huſband. But even ſuppoſing my heart would lead me to accept the hand you offer, I have powerful reaſons which would ſtill make me decline it.—It is impoſſible, believe me,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:038283_0103_101196AA29546220"/>
count Marſini, it is impoſſible, that at preſent I ſhould marry at all.—Heaven only knows to what ſcenes of ſorrow a haſty union on my part might lead. I am obliged, therefore, to guard my heart with an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine ſhield, and to teach it leſſons of ſtoiciſm, that ſhall enable it to reſiſt every impulſe of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which might be inclined to ariſe there.'</p>
               <p>She burſt again into tears; for ſorrowful reflections were called up in her ſoul.</p>
               <p>Marſini liſtened with aſtoniſhment. 'Dear An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette,' he ſaid, 'how myſterious are your words?— Not marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at all!—Heavens! What ſhould prevent the daughter of lord Arlington from beſtowing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in marriage on a man whom her heart might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove?—Did he then, at parting, leave any cruel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! no,' ſhe ſaid, interrupting him, 'it is not an injunction from him that prevents me; but aſk no more. It is enough, dear ſir, for you to know, that I not only cannot be your wife, but that at preſent, I cannot be the wife of any one.</p>
               <p>'Well then,' he ſaid, 'I am ſatisfied; but dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Antoinette, let me be your friend, your father! Do not, oh! do not ſhun me: it kills me to ſee your cold and averted looks. Let me ſtill inſtruct you— ſtill enjoy your ſweet ſociety; believe me, it will not be dangerous, either to you or to myſelf.

               <p>'Indeed, ſir,' anſwered Antoinette, 'I do not wiſh your abſence; and after the aſſurances you have made me, I have no fear of giving up my ſoul to you in the moſt unreſerved friendſhip.—Yes, I will again be your pupil, your elêve; I owe much to you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, nor ſhall you ever find me ungrateful, either for your paſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Antoinette looked earneſtly at him. She knew not what to make of his words. Her parents were unknown to her. How was it that ſhe bore ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to Marſini's deceaſed wife?—Her thoughts were confuſed—ſhe wiſhed to aſk a thouſand queſtions, but prudence forbade her to ſpeak—time might unfold more: but, in the mean time, ſhe ſtored up carefully in her boſom the things ſhe had heard.</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' he ſaid, 'on theſe terms we now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate. As a friend I ſtill may love and regard you, but never ſhall a more aſpiring thought find a place in my heart. Adieu, therefore, for the preſent, deareſt young lady; and though this interview, which I have ſo long anxiouſly ſought for, has not ended preciſely as I could have wiſhed, yet I go away more and more convinced of the excellence of your heart and underſtanding, and eaſier in my own mind, for being releaſed from a painful ſuſpenſe, and knowing exactly the extent of my proſpects with regard to you.'</p>
               <p>So ſaying, he took her hand gently, which he preſſed to his lips, and with a look full of anxious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, withdrew, pondering all the way home, on what ſhe had ſaid, earneſtly wiſhing to unravel the myſterious meaning of her words; yet unable to form any conjecture which might lead to a probable ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
               <p>When mrs. Percival returned home, Antoinette re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to her all that had paſſed, and received from her the warmeſt approbation of her conduct, and thus matters reſted for a ſhort time. Marſini reſumed his
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038283_0105_101196B0DF039728"/>
character of inſtructor to Antoinette, and ſhe no longer ſhunned his attentions; all which Francis Delaval, who did not know what had paſſed, regarded with a jealous and envious eye.</p>
               <p>Francis, however, was ſoon in ſome ſort relieved from his anxiety, by finding, that though he had no proſpect himſelf of ſucceeding in his wiſhes, yet that the count's proſpect was no better; and ſome conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is always to be derived from the knowledge, that a rival has no chance of poſſeſſing the treaſure which we ourſelves have in vain endeavoured to obtain.</p>
               <p>Francis had long cultivated an intimacy with Henry Percival, perhaps, at firſt, in the hope, that an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with the brother might aſſiſt his views with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſiſter; but it was afterwards continued out of regard to the youth himſelf, who certainly was highly deſerving his friendſhip. Francis, therefore, reſolved to ſound Henry on the ſubject of his ſiſter's inclinations, and try if he could learn, by that means, whether he might entertain a reaſonable hope of her lending a favourable ear to his addreſſes.</p>
               <p>One day, therefore, when they were walking out together, Francis, as if quite undeſignedly, drew the converſation round to Antoinette, and after it had been carried to ſome length, at laſt aſked Henry, 'if his ſiſter was not going to be married to count Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini, for he ſaid it was generally ſuppoſed that the match was agreed on: and,' ſaid he, 'although ſtrange to ſay, Marſini, though our gueſt, has never hinted a word to us on the ſubject; yet I can nevertheleſs ſcarcely doubt of the truth of the report, as he and miſs Percival ſo much are together.'</p>
               <p>Henry replied, 'That he believed the count would be very glad to marry his ſiſter: but, indeed,' ſaid he, 'I think he is too old for her, and I know very well that my ſiſter is determined not to marry at preſent, whoever might offer to her; ſhe ſays ſhe is too young yet to undertake the care of a family; beſides—'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:038283_0106_101196B2777CE138"/>He ſtopped: he thought he had ſaid a word too much.</p>
               <p>'Beſides what?' aſked Francis eagerly.</p>
               <p>'O nothing,' ſaid Henry. 'But I am ſure my ſiſter would not marry now; and perhaps ſhe may never marry at all.'</p>
               <p>'You aſtoniſh me,' ſaid Francis. 'How can ſuch a charming young woman have made ſo ſtrange, ſo cruel a reſolution?'</p>
               <p>'Why, ſhe has not made it without good reaſons,' anſwered Henry. 'But come, Frank, don't be ſo over curious. You have, ſome how or other, made me ſay too much already.'</p>
               <p>Francis ſaid no more: but Henry's words ſunk deeply into his mind. There was an air of myſtery in them, which aſtoniſhed him exceedingly; but as he found that Henry did not like to be queſtioned, he was too much of a gentleman to importune him on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Soon after, in the courſe of their walk, paſſing by the cell which the hermit had inhabited, Francis ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly exclaimed,</p>
               <p>'Ha! I wonder whether the hermit be ſtill alive? —I have not ſeen, or heard of him, for a long time, and had almoſt forgotten him.' Then, addreſſing Henry, 'Did you ever hear of him?' ſaid he.</p>
               <p>'Oh! yes,' anſwered Henry, 'and I can tell you that he died very ſoon after we came to the caſtle: —What an extraordinary old man he was!'</p>
               <p>'Extraordinary indeed,' ſaid Francis. 'I often tried to get into converſation with him; but I never could get him to ſay much: ſometimes I could hardly even obtain an anſwer to any queſtion I aſked. But once he aſked me, with great anxiety, if I was related to lord Arlington? and on my anſwering in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, he ſhook his head, and did not ſay any thing more.—Could you ever get him to talk?'</p>
               <p>'I never had an opportunity of trying,' anſwered Henry. 'I never ſaw him 'till after he was dead.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:038283_0107_101196B6595A47B8"/>'Ha!' ſaid Francis, 'What, did he drop down as he was walking about?—And did you find him?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! no,' ſaid Henry, 'He died in his cell: and I went there on purpoſe to ſee him.'</p>
               <p>'And how happened that?'</p>
               <p>'Why I went becauſe I had heard ſuch a ſtrange account of him from my ſiſter, and becauſe ſhe had ſome converſation with him, that excited our curioſity about him very much.'</p>
               <p>'What then, he would talk to your ſiſter?—Old as he was, he could not reſiſt her attractions?'</p>
               <p>'Pho,' anſwered Henry, 'No, no,—attractions— pho—no—but my ſiſter had ſeen him fall, and helped him up, and ſo he began talking to her. But come, Frank, let us find ſome other ſubject of converſation; for though I love my ſiſter—dearly love her, yet I don't like to be always talking of her.'</p>
               <p>Francis ſaw more and more plainly, that there was a ſomething relative to Antoinette, which Henry did not like ſhould be too cloſely inveſtigated. He was diſtreſſed about it; but at the ſame time, felt a ſecret pleaſure, in finding that he ſhould not have the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſeeing her in the arms of a rival.</p>
               <p>They ſoon after arrived in the grounds belonging to the caſtle, where meeting with mrs. Percival and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, the converſation ſoon became general.</p>

               <p>IT was not many days after the two converſations had paſſed, which are related in the preceding chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that an event occurred, which, while it confirmed Francis in the belief, that ſome myſtery hung over the fate of Antoinette, at the ſame time ſeemed, in ſort, to unravel it: I ſay ſeemed, for though there was a ſpecious appearance of developement as to her birth, enough of cloud ſtill remained, to leave her mind far from ſatisfied of the truth of what was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be diſcovered, and far from thinking it right to crown, at that time, the wiſhes of her lover, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ever her inclinations might have prompted her to it.</p>
               <p>One day when the two families were met together at Arlington caſtle, a converſation aroſe which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the company to wiſh to refer to the Romiſh Miſſal in order to aſcertain a point on which they were doubtful, and which, Marſini ſaid, could immediately be decided by a reference to that book, if one could be produced. Antoinette recollecting that which had belonged to the hermit, and which had been in her poſſeſſion ever ſince his death, immediately brought it, and gave it into the hands of Marſini.</p>
               <p>He no ſooner caſt his eyes on it, than he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>'Good God! ſignora! How came this book into your poſſeſſion?—Theſe are the arms of St. Foix!' pointing to the arms in gilding, on the outſide of the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:038283_0109_101196BBAA7AA240"/>Antoinette replied, 'That he muſt excuſe her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that queſtion; that a hiſtory belonged to that book, which ſhe did not care to relate; and perhaps,' ſhe added, 'I have done wrong in producing it, and expoſing myſelf to any queſtions that might be aſked concerning it.'</p>
               <p>'Nay; but for heaven's ſake, dear Antoinette, tell me all you know about this book;' ſaid Marſini, 'Theſe are indeed, the arms of St. Foix!—too, too well do I know them; I cannot be miſtaken.—Look at them mr. Delaval<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you know the chevalier:—You muſt have ſeen the arms frequently.'</p>
               <p>Mr. Delaval looked at the book; 'Moſt aſſuredly theſe are the arms of St. Foix,' he ſaid, 'They are too remarkable to be miſtaken; and, pardon me, miſs Percival, but I have always thought, that there was a great reſemblance between you and our truly amiable friend, the chevalier de St. Foix.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! and has the likeneſs ſtruck you, then?' ſaid Marſini, 'Oh! ſhe is the perfect reſemblance of my wife, my Gabrielle de St. Foix, and ſhe was the exact counterpart of her brother.'</p>
               <p>He got up from his ſeat; he walked about the room for ſome minutes in a violent agitation; then ſat down by Antoinette, and eagerly graſping her hand, 'Pardon me, pardon me, deareſt creature,' he ſaid, 'I am on the rack! Oh! releaſe me, and ſay how that book came into your hands!'</p>
               <p>Antoinette looked anxiouſly at mrs. Percival, as if to aſk her advice what ſhe ſhould do, which mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival obſerving, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'You ſeem to wiſh for my opinion, my love, and I will freely give it. We are ſurely amongſt people who will not betray what paſſes here, and, perhaps, the imparting to the count what you know concerning this book, may lead to important diſcoveries. But, my Antoinette—the picture and the croſs: You have them about you, no doubt—Might you not ſhew them alſo to the count?'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:038283_0110_101196C28B1BF6B0"/>Antoinette immediately drew from her pocket a little caſe, in which ſhe always kept them, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, preſented the picture to the count, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,</p>
               <p>'My wife!—my wife!' and fell ſenſeleſs on the floor.</p>
               <p>The company looked all aſtoniſhment; they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately applied themſelves to aſſiſt the count, but it was ſome time before his ſenſes returned; when they did, he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>'Merciful God!—And could then, what I have hitherto conſidered as a vile calumny, be really true! —Yes,' ſaid he, looking firſt at the picture, and then at Antoinette,—'It muſt be ſo—I cannot doubt any longer;—But Antoinette, deareſt Antoinette, tell me, whence had you theſe things?</p>
               <p>It was impoſſible to reſiſt the agitation of the count any longer: and Antoinette begged of mrs. Percival to relate her ſtory, which ſhe immediately did; and, at the concluſion of it, ſhe deſired Antoinette to ſhew the croſs to Marſini, which he had not yet ſeen.</p>
               <p>Aſtoniſhment at the ſtory he had heard held the count for ſome time in perfect ſilence. He looked earneſtly at Antoinette for ſeveral minutes, and at length, caſting his eyes on the croſs, which ſhe held in her hand, he cried out,</p>
               <p>'It is St. Foix's! by heaven it is St. Foix's!"</p>
               <p>He was again ſilent a few minutes; and then ſaid, 'Come, I will endeavour to compoſe myſelf, that I may tell my ſtory; and I think, deareſt maid,' addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antoinette, 'that I can point out to you one of your parents at leaſt.'</p>
               <p>He went out of the room. He walked a little while about the garden; then returning, and ſeating himſelf by Antoinette, he began thus:</p>
               <p>'I have already told you, my deareſt creature, that I was married when only twenty years of age. My wife was the eldeſt daughter of the baron de St. Foix, a French nobleman, who have taken an unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038283_0111_101196C419879178"/>
and unreaſonable diſlike to her, ſent her to live with a relation of his at Milan, where I become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, and was irreſiſtibly charmed with her. Good God! that a father could find any thing to diſſike in ſo amiable a creature;—ſhe was faultleſs! (I, at leaſt, thought ſo) I ſoon ſolicited her hand in marriage; and the baron being indifferent as to her fate, ſaid, in a cavalier kind of way, 'That I was welcome to take her if I wiſhed it; but he ſhould not give her any fortune.' Fortune, however, was not my aim. I wiſhed only for Gabrielle, and was ſoon after married to her. The baron continued to treat both me and my wife with the utmoſt contempt, nor would he ſuffer his youngeſt daughter to come near us; but the chevalier de St. Foix's ſon, who was in every reſpect a perfect contraſt to the baron, came to Milan, to be preſent at our marriage, and always treated us with the greateſt reſpect and attention. Indeed, from our firſt meeting, the ſtricteſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip commenced between us, which ended only with the untimely death of the chevalier,</p>
               <p>'We had only been married a fortnight, when I was obliged to leave this dear wife, (whom I loved beyond expreſſion) to attend ſome buſineſs at the court of Naples. I wiſhed to have taken my wife with me, and ſhould certainly have done ſo, but as it was quite uncertain how long I might be detained, and whether I might not be obliged to take frequent journeys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Naples and Florence, it was judged beſt for me, to leave my wife, whoſe health was rather deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, with my father, at Florence, and go to Naples, accompanied only by the chevalier de St. Foix.</p>
               <p>'Ah! How little did I think, when I parted from my beloved Gabrielle, to take this journey, that I was never to ſee her more! but ſo, alas! it happened. I was detained at Naples for more than five months, and judge, if you can, of my ſufferings, when the night before I was to ſet out on my return to Florence, an expreſs arrived from my father, informing me of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038283_0112_101196C701297088"/>
the ſudden death of her, in whom my whole happineſs was centred. I returned, however, to Florence; but heaven only knows the torments I endured on my arrival there.</p>
               <p>'I found my poor father almoſt as much affected with the loſs of my Gabrielle, as I was myſelf. He ſpoke of her in terms of the higheſt eſteem and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but I always found him unwilling to enter on the ſubject of her death, which I then thought was owing to his finding it too affecting a ſubject; alas! I fear there was another cauſe for his thus ſhunning the converſation. He did not, indeed, long ſurvive a ſcene, which ſeemed to have occaſioned him ſuch bitter affliction, for he died in about half a year after.</p>
               <p>'St. Foix continued with me for about a year after the death of my wife, when he was called away in the manner I have mentioned ſome time ago; ſoon after which, to my no ſmall additional regret, he met with his untimely fate.</p>
               <p>'But now, my dear Antoinette, to come to that part of my ſtory, which I ſuppoſe to relate to you.</p>
               <p>'Some time after the departure and death of the chevalier, and while you, mr. Delaval, was reſident in Florence, a ſtrange rumour reached my ears, that my Gabrielle died in child-birth, and that the child was conveyed away, in order that the affair might be kept ſecret from me; and was then alive; that this circumſtance was known to my father, who thought it better that it ſhould be concealed from me; for as my poor wife had atoned for her fault with her life, it was unneceſſary that her memory ſhould be black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</p>
               <p>'This ſtrange report, I at firſt totally diſbelieved, and even diſdained to make enquiries into it; but ſtrong circumſtances afterwards appearing to lead me to ſuſpect, that it was not abſolutely without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I endeavoured, privately, to inveſtigate the truth of it, with intention, if I could find out the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038283_0113_101196CA41126DE8"/>
the child, with ſufficient proof, that it was really my Gabrielle's to adopt it as my own, and educate it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>'Perhaps, this may appear to many people an odd reſolution; but doating on her as I did, while ſhe was alive, and having ſo long cheriſhed her memory in my boſom, as a model of perfection, I could not feel the indignation which it may be thought I ought to have felt at the deception ſhe had practiſed on me. In ſhort, I had ſo long been accuſtomed to live upon the idea of my Gabrielle, that I ſhould have been more rejoiced at having a repreſentative of her, to love, cheriſh, and protect, than chagrined at finding that another had ſhared thoſe beauties with me, which I had been accuſtomed to conſider as exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively mine.</p>
               <p>'But after the moſt diligent ſearch, I could not find out the child I fought for, nor could I find either a complete confirmation, or contradiction of the ſtory I had heard. The circumſtance which ſeemed moſt of all to confirm the truth of the ſtory, was, that a woman who had attended on Gabrielle, diſappeared immediately on her death, taking with her, as was ſuppoſed, a number of jewels, which were miſſed at the ſame time. This, at the time, I attributed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the diſhoneſty of the woman; but I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it might be with a view of providing for the child. After all, the affair was ſo dark and myſterious, that I hardly knew what to think of it, but have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been inclined to believe, that the character of my deareſt Gabrielle was falſely aſperſed.</p>
               <p>'But now, my Antoinette, I ſee in you her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect likeneſs;—I ſee you in poſſeſſion of articles, which I know muſt have belonged to the houſe of St. Foix, from which ſhe was deſcended; and cannot, therefore, but ſuppoſe, that there are people who know you to belong to that houſe. Your ſtory is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in a cloud of myſtery; and all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances convince me, that I now behold the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:038283_0114_101196CD1B7F0448"/>
child, whom years ago I ſought for in vain, but whom chance has, at laſt, thrown in my way; and that you are indeed the daughter of my Gabrielle,—ſhall I, without offending, hazard the conjecture?—by lord Arlington himſelf; nor can I any longer be ſurpriſed at the ſtrong affection I have felt for you ever ſince I firſt ſaw you; for the child of that dear creature could not fail to be dear to me.'</p>
               <p>He accompanied theſe laſt words with ardently preſſing the hand of the trembling Antoinette to his boſom.</p>
               <p>She had liſtened to the ſtory with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed emotions of grief and aſtoniſhment; and the whole company, indeed, were deeply affected with his intereſting nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and, particularly, with the extraordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence he had ſhewn with regard to his Gabrielle and her chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival was the firſt to remark on the ſtory, by queſtioning Marſini, with ſome emotion, 'What had occaſioned his conjecture relative to lord Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton?—and if he knew of any intercourſe having ever ſubſiſted between him and the houſe of St. Foix?'</p>
               <p>Marſini replied, 'Indeed, madam, I do not know that lord Arlington ever had any acquaintance with my dear wife's family. That idea was ſuggeſted to me by the anxiety which he ſeemed to have for the fate of Antoinette, and his thorough knowledge of her ſtory; beſides that, his lordſhip, according to what I underſtand, from the relation you gave me, muſt have been abroad at the time I ſpeak of.'</p>
               <p>'Still,' ſaid mrs. Percival, 'I am far from being ſatisfied as to this affair. My Theodore, in the letter he ſent with Antoinette, ſays, that, She is not the offspring of illicit love.'—This is irreconcileable with what you ſuppoſe; and, I think, he would not have impoſed on me in ſuch a manner. My affection to the child, and my attention to the requeſt of a huſband I ſo much loved, would not have been leſs, had he waved the ſubject of her birth entirely, and that, I
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038283_0115_101196D10455B9D8"/>
think he muſt have known me well enough to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of it.'</p>
               <p>'Yet,' ſaid Marſini, 'I cannot give up my belief, that I have diſcovered the mother of Antoinette.— That picture,—Oh! 'tis my Gabrielle herſelf!—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did painting bear a ſtronger reſemblance to the original;—nor ever did child bear ſo ſtrong a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to a parent, as Antoinette does to my dear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted wife. Oh! then, let me conſider her as my child; and, how happy ſhall I be in ſuch a child, to be my comfort and ſupport in my declining years! Say, Antoinette, can you from henceforward conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Oh! moderate your tranſports, my worthy friend,' ſaid Antoinette. 'You have, indeed, ſhort as our acquaintance has been, ſhewn to me the kindneſs, the affection of a father;—but, What do you now mean? I will love you ſtill as a friend: but, How ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'True, oh! true,' ſaid Marſini, interrupting her. 'I ſee what you would ſay;—forgive me, I was tranſported beyond all bounds—my ſenſes were well nigh gone;—but I am cool again. I believe ſtill, that I have a dearer intereſt in you, than I was at firſt aware of. But time will, no doubt, develope all; and to time we muſt conſign it, and patiently wait the event.'</p>
               <p>The converſation continued ſome time longer; but the more the matter was talked over, the leſs reaſon did there ſeem to be for Marſini's belief, that he had diſcovered the mother of Antoinette. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, Marſini continued in that belief, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he ſhould always conſider her as his daughter; and thus the company broke up for that evening; Antoinette, greatly affected with all that had paſſed, and more ſtrongly than ever confirmed in her reſolution, not to marry while the ſtory of her

Percival turn her thoughts towards returning to England, where it was her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſpend the next year and half, when ſhe meant Henry ſhould go abroad. When ſhe firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to Antoinette her idea of leaving Arlington, ſhe deſired her, at the ſame time, to ſay whether ſhe would like to paſs the winter in London, or whether ſhe would prefer remaining in Ireland; ſtrongly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, that the latter would be her choice: and as her principal object in returning to England, was to introduce Antoinette into the world (for Henry, ſhe thought, in very good hands, under doctor Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg), if her wiſh was rather for retirement, ſhe would certainly not think of taking her out of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her inclination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:038283_0117_101196D49A609BF8"/>Antoinette ſaid, 'Since you, my deareſt madam, are ſo kind as to leave this matter entirely to my choice, I will freely own, that my wiſh is, at preſent, to remain where I am. I think, while I am here, I have more chance of making diſcoveries relative to my own ſtory, than if I were to be at ſuch a diſtance as London, where I ſhould conſtantly be haunted with the idea, that ſomething was paſſing here of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to me.'</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons were quite ſufficient for mrs. Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, as, indeed, would the bare expreſſion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette's wiſh have been, without her aſſigning any reaſon at all for it; and ſhe reſolved to give up all thoughts of England.</p>
               <p>Marſini, whoſe whole ſoul was wrapt up in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, when he found ſhe was likely to remain at Arlington, took a ſmall houſe, which was then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in the neighbourhood, at which, however, he ſpent but little of his time; as he was every day, and almoſt all day long, at the caſtle; but his behaviour to her was changed entirely from that of the lover, to the father. This attachment furniſhed an ample topic of converſation to all the neighbourhood, and occaſioned the long forgotten ſtory of Theodore's abrupt departure to be revived, as an appendage to that of Marſini and Antoinette; and many were the expreſſions of aſtoniſhment uſed, whenever the affair was canvaſſed, that Marſini, circumſtanced as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he was with regard to her, ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a partiality for her;—an aſtoniſhment which, I doubt not, has been anticipated by many of my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for, according to all eſtabliſhed forms in the world, the deception, which he was well convinced, had been practiſed on him by his wife, ought to have rendered Antoinette the object of his hatred, however ſtrongly her youth, beauty, and, above all, her bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and amiable diſpoſition, might plead in her behalf. I will not pretend to apologize for his thus tranſgreſſing the rules of cuſtom. I only give the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038283_0118_101196D67A103E18"/>

A ray of hope did, ſometimes, break in upon him, that he was not abſolutely indifferent to her; but deſpondency was generally the prevailing feature in his mind.

               <p>Mr. Delaval ſaw his ſon's ſituation with the deepeſt concern. It was plain that his happineſs depended wholly on the poſſeſſion of Antoinette: and he would
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038283_0119_101196DA2334EC98"/>
have done any thing in his power to forward an union between them: but he ſaw plainly the ſtrong reaſons ſhe had to guard her heart againſt any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of a paſſion, which might, if indulged, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately involve her in ruin and wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>Things were in this ſituation, when an event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which threatened to hurl mrs. Percival and her family from the height of wealth and affluence, to a comparative ſtate of poverty, by depriving them of the eſtates annexed to the barony of Arlington, which, as the greateſt part of mrs. Percival's fortune had been ſunk in freeling them from incumbrances, were now almoſt their only poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>The next heir to the eſtates and title of Arlington, ſuppoſing Theodore to have died childleſs, was a diſtant relation of the family, who had lived for ſome years at Marſeilles: as the cheap living in that ſouthern part of France, enabled him to ſupport a better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, with a very ſmall fortune, than he could have done in England or Ireland. This man hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his youth, quarreled with the father of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, no intercourſe had ſubſiſted between the two branches of the family from that time, and mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival, though ſhe had heard of ſuch a perſon, did not know whether he was alive or not.</p>
               <p>This man now ſuddenly appeared at Dublin, to lay claim to the eſtates and title of Arlington, under the plea that he had ſufficient evidence to bring forward, that Theodore was married, during his reſidence abroad to a French lady, who was alive at the time that he married miſs Conolly, conſequently, that the marriage with her was illegal, and the ſon he had by that marriage, could not inherit; and that Theodore having died ſome months before in the Weſt-Indies, the title and eſtates of courſe devolved upon him.</p>
               <p>This was a ſtroke ſo ſudden, ſo unexpected, and carrying ſuch dreadful conſequences in its train, that it would have broken down the minds of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of females; but that of mrs. Percival was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:038283_0120_101196DC256F0DB8"/>
to moſt of her ſex. She ſaw plainly, that if mr. Thomas Percival could ſubſtantiate the facts which he had alleged, the caſe was clear, and ſhe muſt ſubmit to her fate; to the hardſhips of which ſhe could not be inſenſible, but which ſhe was reſolved to meet with fortitude. She was inured to troubles, and had learnt by them, leſſons of philoſophy, which would enable her to adapt her ideas to any ſituation in life, convinced that there is none ſo elevated, as to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from troubles; nor any ſo low as to be devoid of comforts. She could not charge herſelf with any thing culpable in her conduct, unleſs it were the marrying Theodore, when ſhe was ſenſible that ſhe was not the object of his choice. But with regard to her ſon, though his birth might not be legal, ſhe was guiltleſs in that reſpect; for her mind had no ſhare in the tranſgreſſion, which, therefore, in the eye both of God and man, could not be conſidered as one.</p>
               <p>With theſe, and various other reflections of the like kind, ſhe fortified her mind againſt the ſtorms which ſhe had now to encounter; and with the moſt unſhaken firmneſs and compoſure, ordered every thing to be prepared for her immediate departure with her family to Dublin.</p>
               <p>When Francis Delaval heard of the ſituation into which the family that contained his adored Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, was likely to be thrown, he immediately applied to his father for his conſent, that he might throw himſelf at her feet, and offer her a heart and hand devoted to her, and by accepting which, ſhe would be placed out of the reach of thoſe ſhafts, which the malice of fortune was aiming at the unfortunate mrs. Percival and her ſon. And this conſideration, added to the ſtill more powerful one, that ſhe might then be enabled to make ſome acknowledgment, more ſolid than in words only, for the immenſe weight of favours, which ſhe had received from the hands of mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival, Francis hoped would operate on her mind, as an inducement to her to lay aſide her ſcruples, and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038283_0121_101196E175A47BA0"/>
accept an offer, which, under other circumſtances, ſhe might have refuſed. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s not, too, quite without hopes, that the generoſity of temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, which this offer would carry on the face of it, might ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his favour, on a mind ſo open as that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, to every virtuous impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Delaval, whoſe diſpoſition was not behind hand in generoſity with his ſon, entered with ardour into all his feelings and views, and ordered him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to proceed in the affair, as his own wiſhes ſhould dictate to him; though he obſerved, at the ſame time, that Antoinette had a friend in Marſini, who would prevent her being involved in the fate of mrs. Percival and her ſon.</p>
               <p>Francis loſt no time, but immediately repaired to Arlington caſtle, where, enquiring for miſs Percival he was told, that ſhe was in the garden, where he would find her. To the garden, therefore, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, where ſhe was taking a ſolitary walk, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging in the melancholy reflection, that it was, perhaps, the laſt ſhe might ever take there. He opened his errand by ſaying, 'I come not now, deareſt madam, to intrude unſeaſonably on your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; but I could not ſupport the thought of your leaving this place, to which, alas! you may perhaps never return, without laying open my mind to you.'</p>
               <p>'Surely, fair Antoinette,' ſaid he, taking her hand gently, which ſhe had not power to withhold from him, 'my outward actions cannot have been ſuch unfaithful interpreters of my internal feelings, as to leave you any doubt of the ardour of my affection for you. I know very well,' he continued, 'the reaſons you have for wiſhing to keep yourſelf free from any engagement of the kind, which my heart pants to propoſe to you; but, deareſt Antoinette, conſider, that your ſcruples in this inſtance are quite done away. Though you are unfortunately a ſtranger to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, mine are well known; nor can you, in uniting yourſelf to me, run any riſk of forming a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038283_0122_101196E440D8A108"/>
which the ties of blood would prohibit. No ſecret connections on the part of my father or mother, have rendered my birth doubtful; it can therefore no ways interfere with your's. Surely, then, my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, I have removed all obſtacles to our union on that account; and, will you not, therefore, per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me to hope, that the offer I here make you, of a heart and hand devoted to you, may not be unfavourably received? Believe me, and I ſpeak no common cant, but what I ſay comes from the bottom of my heart, that my future happineſs or miſery depends on your acceptance or rejection of my propoſals. I wait your anſwer,' ſaid he, preſſing her hand to his boſom, 'Oh!' let it be favourable.—I have ſometimes dared to hope, that I was not abſolutely indifferent to you.'</p>
               <p>Tears flowed faſt down the cheeks of his fair au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, while Francis made this harangue, to which ſhe replied,</p>
               <p>'Had any doubts exiſted in my heart, mr. Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, of the true generoſity and ſweetneſs of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and of the ſincerity of your affection for me, the preſent moment muſt at once have diſpelled them; but I wanted not this inſtance to convince me, that your ſoul is the ſeat of benevolence and philanthropy.—Oh! that you had not taken me at a moment, when ſorrow had looſened the chains with which I have endeavoured to guard every avenue of my heart!—But I cannot now diſſemble.—Yes, mr. Delaval, I will own it, my affections are ſolely, wholly, your's. I wiſh I felt leſs forcibly the truth of this confeſſion; but let me intreat you to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, at preſent, with the knowledge of my regard for you, nor preſs me farther to enter into engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I muſt abſolutely refuſe.</p>
               <p>'I grant the juſtice of the obſervations you have made, with regard to my principal objection to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and that objection, I own, is entirely done away in my mind, with regard to giving my hand to you;—but ſtill I muſt at preſent refuſe, abſolutely

               <p>'Oh no,' exclaimed Francis, interrupting her. 'Tis impoſſible. I never did, and I hope never ſhall, repent of following the dictates of an open, undiſguiſed heart, which has not a thought that it wiſhes to conceal from the world.'</p>
               <p>'Yet conſider,' returned Antoinette, 'if not for your own ſake, for mine at leaſt, conſider, my preſent ſituation. My benefactreſs, my more than mother, is likely to be reduced from affluence to poverty; and though, from the kindneſs and affection of count Marſini, I have a proſpect of not being involved in her ruin, yet conſider whether you can, yourſelf, think it a proper time for me to accept your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.—Oh! no: aſſure yourſelf of my ardent affection for you, but forbear to urge me to an engagement, which my judgment tells me I ought not to enter into. Should the generous ſentiments which you now profeſs for me, continue ſome time hence. I may then, with more propriety, accept your propoſals, if you ſhould think proper to renew them:—but at preſent, I entreat you, as you value my peace, to urge me no farther.'</p>
               <p>Francis ſilently acquieſced in the ſentence, which Antoinette had thus paſſed on him. He entered into all her feelings on the ſubject, which he could not entirely diſapprove; and as he had gained an aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from her own lips, of her affection for him, his heart was much more at eaſe.

               <p>Francis was, however, comforted for the loſs of his miſtreſs, by hearing his father declare his intention of going to Dublin very ſoon to ſpend the winter there.</p>
               <p>When mrs. Percival arrived in that city, her firſt care was to engage, on her ſide, ſome of the moſt able men in the law department, by whoſe advice ſhe ſolicited an interview with her antagoniſt, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he poſitively refuſed to grant, ſaying, 'That the only intercourſe which could poſſibly paſs between them, muſt be by means of their reſpective agents.' Several meetings accordingly paſſed between them, by which mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick, mrs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival's
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:038283_0126_101196EF608AB810"/>
two principal council, got an inſight into the evidence which the claimant had to bring forward.</p>
               <p>The witneſſes to be produced to the marriage, were Pierre Dupont, and Jeanne Berger, a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been ſervants at the Celeſtine convent of Sainte Marguerite, on the banks of the Rhone, about fourteen miles from the city of Vienne, in the Province of Dauphiné. The account they gave of the affair, and which they ſaid they were ready to depoſe on oath, was 'That a rumour ariſing in the convent, at a time which they mentioned, (and which was about eighteen years before that, at which they were giving in their relation) that ſome days before one of the nuns had been married to a gentleman at the cell of the confeſſor of the convent, which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ſecretly introduced at night, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance of one of the ſuperiors of the convent, to the chamber of his wife; they determined, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inveſtigate the matter, in hopes, as they ſaid, of bringing wretches, who could be guilty of ſuch profanation, to condign puniſhment. The confeſſor died ſuddenly very ſoon after. They went, therefore, immediately to his cell, in hopes of finding ſomething there, which might lead them to diſcover the truth of this dark affair.</p>
               <p>In the cell they found a paper, containing the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing memorandum, which they brought away with them, and which was to be produced in evidence on the trial: <floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>'I Anſelm de la Bruyere, confeſſor of the Celeſtine convent of Sainte Marguerite, in the province of Dauphiné, think it proper by the following paper to teſtify, leſt any doubt of the validity of the marriage ſhould hereafter ariſe; and I do hereby teſtify, that I did, on this day, unite in holy wedlock, with all due forms and ceremonies, Theodore Percival, of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Ireland, and Antoinette de St. Foix.

                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:038283_0127_101196F0EFA2ABF0"/>This paper was alſo ſigned by two witneſſes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at the marriage, under the names of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Sequin, and Marianne de Mercier; the former of whom, as the ſervants ſaid, was a friar of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring monaſtery, who was often with Anſelm, and the latter the ſuperior, who was reported to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the gentleman into the men's chamber. This paper, they ſaid, they intended to have given to the lady abbeſs, and at the ſame time to have related to her the report they had heard; but having had a quarrel with her very ſoon after, for which they were diſmiſſed the convent in haſte, they, in revenge, kept the ſtory ſecret. But, ſome years after, Pierre Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont coming to viſit ſome friends in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the convent, heard that the nun and Marianne had juſt made their eſcape from it together.</p>
               <p>The fact of Theodore's death was to be atteſted by two French ſailors, who could depoſe, that about a year or a little more back, a perſon, who was called Theodore Percival, was brought ſtrongly guarded to Rochelle, and put on board the ſhip to which they belonged, which was one of a fleet of merchant ſhips bound to St. Domingo; that he remained on board all the time of their paſſage to St. Domingo; and after he was landed at that iſland came frequently down to viſit the ſhip; but after ſome time he caught a fever, and died there. The deſcription they gave of the perſon of this man, exactly correſponded to that of lord Arlington; and his own extraordinary conduct, threw a ſhade of probability over the whole narrative, which left no room to doubt of its truth.</p>
               <p>'And what evidence had the defendants to bring on the other ſide?—None—the caſe ſeemed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a loſt one. But, notwithſtanding, mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick adviſed mrs. Percival to ſtand the trial, as it was poſſible that contradictions might ariſe in the depoſitions of theſe witneſſes, which might tend to invalidate their evidence.</p>
               <p>On the whole, however, it appeared to mrs. Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:038283_0128_101196F2AAB1FA38"/>
that ſhe had nothing now to expect but the loſs of her fortune, and that, in conſequence, her ſon and herſelf would be reduced to very ſtrait circumſtances. She experienced, however, a great conſolation in the friendſhip of Marſini, and of the Delavals, who were come to Dublin. The former made the moſt kind and liberal offers of an aſylum to the whole family, in his country, if affairs ſhould take the ill turn that was to be expected; and both he and Francis Delaval offered to take a journey, to the convent of Sainte Marguerite, to gain, if poſſible, ſome farther inſight into the extraordinary tranſaction, which was reported to have happened there.</p>
               <p>This was mentioned to mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick; but their opinion was, that it was beſt, at leaſt, to delay the journey, 'till they ſaw more pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y what turn the buſineſs was likely to take; and if a verdict was given againſt them; it was then poſſible that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be collected there, on which to ground a motion for a new trial. But if they were to go at that time, it was ſcarcely poſſible they could return before the day fixed for the trial; and on the whole, it was better to let the cauſe have a hearing, before they proceeded to any farther ſteps, and to reſt on the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the evidence produced by the claimant not being deemed ſufficient by the judge and jury, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a verdict in his favour.</p>
               <p>At length the day of the trial arrived. The depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the two ſervants of the convent were to the effect above-mentioned. When they were croſs-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the defendant's council, it appeared that they had quitted the country immediately after they were diſcharged from the convent, and that the only reaſon Pierre Dupont had for ſaying that Antoinette de St. Foix had eloped from the convent ſome years after was, his hearing there that one of the nuns had eſcaped with Marianne; and as ſhe was a witneſs to Antoinette's marriage, he concluded the nun to be no other than that lady herſelf. A bold concluſion,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038283_0129_101196F66F04E168"/>
which could by no means ſtand as evidence in a court of law however ſtrong the preſumption might be, that he was in the right.</p>
               <p>There was no evidence, therefore, to prove that Antoinette was alive at the time that Theodore was married to miſs Conolly; but neither, on the other hand, was there any evidence to prove her death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time; and as the fact of the firſt marriage was eſtabliſhed, it became the part of the defendant to prove, that the ſecond marriage had not taken place 'till after the firſt was diſſolved by the death of one of the parties.</p>
               <p>Pierre and Jeanne were next examined, as to the manner of their becoming acquainted with mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Percival at Marſeilles, and for what reaſon they had put the paper in queſtion into his hands. They anſwered to theſe queſtions, that they went to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles about two years after they had left the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, having lived, during that two years, at Lyons; and as their view in going to Marſeilles, was to get into ſervice there, Pierre, at the recommendation of a friend, was ſoon hired as footman into mr. Percival's family. As the name of his maſter was the ſame as that of the gentleman, the certificate of whoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage they had found in Anſelm's cell, he conſulted with Jeanne, whether they ſhould not offer him the paper, (which might, perhaps, be of value to him) if he would give them a good ſum of money for it.</p>
               <p>This being ſettled between them, the offer was made, and mr. Percival readily conſented to purchaſe the paper, at the price they demanded; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it had never been out of his poſſeſſion ſince. They had, however, thought no more about it, 'till not long ſince, when mr. Percival had aſked them to accompany him to Ireland, for the purpoſe of atteſting all they knew, relative to the marriage, of which, that paper was the certificate; and told them, they ſhould be well paid for it; upon which they readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his requeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:038283_0130_101196FA391DFE78"/>Theſe people alſo poſitively ſwore to Anſelm's hand-writing in the certificate, having often ſeen him write during three years, that one had lived in the convent, and two years, that the other had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in its ſervice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival himſelf was then examined, as to the reaſon of his having kept the certificate of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore's marriage ſo long concealed, and at laſt produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, 'That he thought his reaſons for doing ſo, muſt be obvious to every one, nor ſhould he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſguiſe them. He had firſt purchaſed the paper, and afterwards kept it for the very purpoſe for which it was now produced. He knew himſelf to be the next heir to the Arlington eſtates, if Theodore died without lawful heirs; and he therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it very poſſible, that it might be of great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to himſelf, to be poſſeſſed of a paper, containing a certificate of a marriage of that ſame Theodore's, in ſuch a ſecret way; and that when once poſſeſſed of it, he had kept it with care, 'till the moment ſhould arrive when he could turn it to his own advantage, which moment he conceived to be at length arrived.</p>
               <p>The two French ſailors were next called, who were to prove the death of Theodore, the heads of whoſe depoſition have been already given. In their croſs-examination, they too were queſtioned as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they became known to the claimant, of which they gave the following account:</p>
               <p>That at their return from St. Domingo, after the voyage, when they had carried over Theodore Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cival, they quitted the merchant of Rochelle, in whoſe ſervice they had been, on account of a quarrel which they had, in their return home, with the captain of the ſhip; and one of them having relations at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, they went thither, in hopes of getting employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>They had not been many days at Marſeilles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they became acquainted with Pierre Dupont,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038283_0131_101196FBEC4DB878"/>
who had not long been known to their relations; and hearing him often mention his maſter, by the name of Percival, it brought to their mind the unfortunate man of that name, who had been paſſenger in their ſhip, and who died at St. Domingo; and in the courſe of converſation one day with Pierre, they mentioned that circumſtance, but with no other view, than as relating a ſtory, which a ſimilarity of names had brought to their minds.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, Pierre told them, that his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wiſhed to ſpeak with them; and when they went to him, he queſtioned them cloſely reſpecting the ſtory which they had told to his ſervant; in conſequence of which, they gave him a full detail of all that they knew reſpecting Theodore Percival; but at that firſt interview, nothing more paſſed. They afterwards frequently ſaw mr. Thomas Percival, and he always examined them about the ſtory, and at laſt he aſked them, 'If they would be willing to go with him to Ireland, in order to make oath, before a court of law, of the ſeveral circumſtances, which, at different times, they had related to him; to which they readily conſented.'</p>
               <p>They were then aſked by mrs. Percival's council, what reward had been promiſed them for the trouble they were to take. They heſitated at firſt; but then affirmed, that they were to have no recompenſe, only to have their expenſes paid, and a remuneration for their loſs of time, and were to be furniſhed with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, if they ſhould chooſe to ſtay in Ireland ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than return to France. On being hard preſſed, however, it appeared, that the remuneration for their loſs of time, was to be at a moſt extravagant rate, for they were to be paid about ten times the ſum per day, that they could have earned in their uſual occupation; and at laſt it was dragged forth, that if by their evidence, the claimant ſhould obtain poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the conteſted eſtates, they were each to have a conſiderable annuity ſettled on them for their lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:038283_0132_101196FD86DDFAF8"/>This was, alone, enough to ſhake the credit of the evidence given by theſe fellows. But when they were more particularly and ſeparately examined, as to the circumſtances of Theodore Percival's death, they were neither conſiſtent with each other, nor with their own former depoſitions, in the account they gave of it; neither did they agree in the time that elapſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his being landed at St. Domingo, and his death. On the whole, the evidence of theſe men was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the judge, and thought by the whole court, to be of too a doubtful a nature, to carry any weight with it, 'till unfortunately a paper was brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the purpoſe of corroborating their teſtimony, which, in a moment, turned the face of affairs. This paper purpoſed to be a copy of the minutes taken by the captain of the ſhip in which Theodore was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, during his voyage to St. Domingo, his ſtay at that iſland, and return home, in which was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial detail of the illneſs and death of Theodore, intermingled with ſtrong expreſſions of ſorrow for his fate, and encomiums on the goodneſs of his heart and underſtanding, and on his affable and pleaſing deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during his paſſage: and two men, one the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's mate, and the other his ſteward, ſwore to it as a faithful copy.</p>
               <p>This was evidence not to be reſiſted, when depoſed in court on oath; though ſtill a ſuſpicion pervaded the minds of many of the auditors, that there was ſome vile colluſion practiſed. By ſome it was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that mr. Percival, the claimant, was even the murderer of his relation; but others were content to ſuppoſe, that he had not only taken care to remove him out of the way ſo far, as that he might never be in danger of returning to bring him to ſhame; and it was thought, by theſe, not improbable, that he might be ſold as a ſlave in St. Domingo. Few people thought that his fate was really known.</p>
               <p>But whatever private opinions might be formed on this intereſting ſubject, private opinions could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038283_0133_10119700735C50C0"/>
a judge and jury. They could be guided only by the poſitive evidence, which was ſuch, that they were under the neceſſity of giving a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Marſini, who had attended in court during the whole time of the trial, in order that he might early the firſt tidings of the event to mrs. Percival, no ſooner heard the verdict given, than he departed, to acquaint her with it. She heard it with unruffled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, and only obſerved,</p>
               <p>'Well, then, I muſt adapt my ideas, and teach my children to adapt theirs, to live on the little we have remaining, and my Henry, inſtead of leading an idle life, muſt work for his bread. We are atoms in the immenſity of creation, and muſt perform the part allotted us, nor will it be performed in vain. One thing, however, is by thoſe means cleared up to us, and we know, at laſt, who are the parents of our dear Antoinette!'</p>
               <p>'Indeed,' ſaid Marſini, I think we muſt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, (for it can ſcarcely be doubted) that Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette is the daughter of lord Arlington's firſt marriage.'</p>
               <p>'It is ſurely ſo,' anſwered mrs. Percival, 'and wiſely did he direct that ſhe ſhould be taught to gain her living by her own induſtry, if neceſſary. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he even foreſaw the probability of the preſent event taking place. One thing only wounds me, that he could be ſo ungenerous as to pretend to marry me, when he had another wife alive. What motive could he have for ſuch baſe conduct?—What motive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?—Alas! I wrong him; he could not do ſo; I am ſure he could not?—He was miſerable, I know, too well I know it—but even now I cannot believe he was guilty. Perhaps there are yet many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in his ſtory, with which we are unacquainted, for it is ſtill dark and myſterious—time may diſcover more, and if it is part of the ſcheme of Providence, that more ſhould be diſcovered, no human arts can conceal it.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:038283_0134_1011970227D22720"/>'Indeed,' replied Marſini, 'I am ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that ſome vile colluſion has been practiſed, that I am reſolved to go immediately myſelf to the convent of Sainte Marguerite, for the purpoſe of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inveſtigating the whole buſineſs of the marri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time, madam, I inſiſt that you form no new plan for yourſelves, 'till my return. I can ſupply you with every thing you want at preſent; if you recover your eſtates, I will then be repaid, and if not, my fortune is ſufficient for us all. As for Antoinette, I have conſidered her as my child, becauſe I really believed her the child of my wife. That belief is now ſhaken; but in whatever relationſhip ſhe may appear to ſtand to me, I can never ceaſe to dote on her, and to do every thing in my power for her advancement in virtue and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.'</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival, who had heard with perfect equani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of temper her terrible reverſe of fortune, could not, with equal calmneſs, attend to this ſpeech of Marſini's.

               <p>MARSINI communicated his intended journey to mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick, who declared their approbation of it, ſaying, 'That they had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope, that evidence might thus be procured, which would ſet aſide the preſent verdict; for they were well convinced, that the witneſſes brought by mr. Thomas Percival, were a ſet of perjured raſcals, and only wanted ſome one who could confute them, to be proved ſo.'</p>
               <p>When Francis Delaval heard of Marſini's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he immediately begged to be permitted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him; to which his father and the count very readily conſented; and accordingly, they ſet off together, in a very few days after.</p>
               <p>They arrived at the convent of Sainte Marguerite, without meeting with any occurrence worth relating. They requeſted to ſee the lady abbeſs, to whom they were immediately introduced; when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to her their ſtory, and communicated the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand

they were come upon. When they had done, ſhe exclaimed,</p>
               <p>'Heavens! what a wonderful coincidence!—Yes, gentlemen, you will indeed receive here all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction you can wiſh for, and much more than you can have dared to expect. The marriage you mention, did indeed take place, and the unfortunate lady died in leſs than a year after; but what is more than all, know that the very man whoſe death has been ſo poſitively ſworn to, is now in the chapel of the convent, weeping over the tomb of his beloved wife. —If you will follow me, I will conduct you to him.'</p>
               <p>She aroſe. Marſini and Francis followed her. On entering the chapel, they beheld, at the upper end of it, a pale, wretched, emaciated figure, ſtanding by a ſmall monument, on which he reſted one elbow, while his head reclined on his hand, and in the other hand he held a picture, on which his eyes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fixed. Near was an old nun, kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an altar, who ſeemed enthuſiaſtically abſorbed in her devotions; both together forming a ſolemn and affecting ſpectacle, for each was too entirely occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with their own meditations, to appear to notice the other, or even to be ſenſible of the entrance of the abbeſs, Marſini, and Francis.</p>
               <p>As they approached Theodore, 'Behold,' ſaid the lady abbeſs, 'the man, whoſe exiſtence will put an end to your troubles.' Then coming up to him, ſhe ſaid, in a voice loud enough to be heard by the old nun, 'Mr. Percival.'—The nun ſtarted up, as if ſtruck by an electrical ſhock;</p>
               <p>'What do I hear!' ſhe ſaid, 'Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Mr. Percival,' repeated the abbeſs.</p>
               <p>'Great God!' exclaimed the nun, 'Theodore Percival.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, Theodore Percival,' replied the abbeſs.</p>
               <p>'Awful heaven!—My ſon — my ſon!' cried the nun, and fell ſenſeleſs on the pavement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:038283_0137_1011970C119E48D0"/>Her laſt words rouſed Theodore from his lethargy. 'What did I hear,' he cried, 'God of heaven! Is it poſſible!—after ſo many years! —he ſprang forward, caught the nun in his arms, and raiſed her from the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—'Can it be?' he ſaid,—'Can this be my mother?'—Then obſerving the count and Francis, 'Who are ye?' he ſaid, 'Tell me inſtantly,—is ſhe indeed my mother?'</p>
               <p>'We know not,' ſaid the abbeſs. 'We know no more than the words ſhe has this moment uttered.— But let us take her to the parlour, and endeavour to recal her ſenſes.'</p>
               <p>'Ah! ſir,' ſaid Marſini to Theodore, who ſtill held the nun in his arms, though from his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he was ſcarcely able to ſupport her, 'Let me aſſiſt you: you are incapable of ſupporting another, you ſeem ſcarcely able to ſupport yourſelf:—you ſeem very ill and weak.'</p>
               <p>Theodore, who at firſt looked rather wild, now compoſed his countenance;—'Yes, I am ill indeed,' he ſaid, 'ſick both in body and mind—overcome with aſtoniſhment— Can this be indeed my mother?'</p>
               <p>The abbeſs, by this time, had fetched a chair, and the nun was conveyed to the parlour, where, on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per applications being adminiſtered, ſhe began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive. The firſt words ſhe uttered, were,</p>
               <p>'Where is he?—Where is my ſon—my Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore?'</p>
               <p>Theodore took her hand, 'And, is it then,' he ſaid, 'my mother, whom I now behold?—Oh wonderful event! — after a ſeparation of above thirty years, in all which time I knew not whether ſhe were alive or dead!'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' ſhe ſaid, 'I am indeed your mother, the infamous wife of Edward, lord Arlington.— Oh! Theodore! How little did I ſuppoſe, that the wretched object I beheld on entering the chapel, was my ſon—the child whom I ſo ſhamefully deſerted.— But ah! anſwer me quickly, how is it that I behold

you thus?—Have you been the innocent ſufferer for my guilt?—Is it for my ſake?—Has your father?—I know not how to aſk—but indeed, when you was born, I had not been faithleſs to his bed.'</p>
               <p>'No,' anſwered Theodore, 'Haraſs not yourſelf, deareſt madam, with that idea—true, I have been a ſufferer, a ſevere ſufferer, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Well, well,' ſhe ſaid, in a hurried manner, 'Tell me all, then—tell me, does your father yet live?'</p>
               <p>'No,' anſwered Theodore, 'He has long been at reſt; long been a tenant of the peaceful grave, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a thouſand, and a thouſand times, I have wiſhed to follow him.'</p>
               <p>'Have you then been ſo very wretched?' ſaid ſhe, 'But ſay, my Theodore, did your father, in his cloſe of life, ever think of me? —Ah! he would have been a kind huſband, had I known how ſufficiently to prize him.'</p>
               <p>'Alas!' replied Theodore, 'I was not a witneſs to the latter ſcenes of his life;—I cloſed not his eyes;— I received not his parting breath;—I was then, and have been ever ſince, a voluntary exile from my home, my family,—I have been a wanderer for more than fifteen years;—I have ill-treated an excellent wife;— like you, too, my mother, I have deſerted my children. —But thoſe days are paſt; I ſhall ſoon return to them, beg their forgiveneſs, and hope to end my days in peace amongſt them.'</p>
               <p>Marſini, who had been deeply affected with the whole of the intereſting ſcene which was paſſing, could not here forbear to exclaim,</p>
               <p>'Thanks! thanks be to heaven! Oh, what joy will your preſence diffuſe in your family!'</p>
               <p>Theodore looked aſtoniſhed; he had yet no idea who Marſini was, or what was his errand; but his attention being thus ſuddenly arreſted, he, in an eager and hurried tone, cried,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:038283_0139_10119713725F1888"/>'How?—Do you know them then?—Tell me? —Are they all well?—Will they ſee me?—Speak— my heart is burſting.'</p>
               <p>Marſini was alarmed, he thought that he had been too haſty; he ſaw that Theodore's whole frame was convulſed; weak and exhauſted as he was, he could ill bear ſuch agitation. But Marſini had now gone too far to recede.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' he anſwered, 'I but lately left your wife and children at Dublin; they are well;—but, deareſt ſir, let me entreat you to attend to yourſelf; you ſhall hear ſome other time; let us take you hence, you are weak and ill;—Come, ſir, come with me.'</p>
               <p>'What! and leave my mother juſt as I have ſound her?'</p>
               <p>He anſwered with a quickneſs, that proved in the cleareſt manner the conteſt of feelings in his boſom.</p>
               <p>'But be it ſo; perhaps 'tis beſt; my head turns round;—ſupport me.—I have not ſlept nor reſted from fatigue for three days and nights.'</p>
               <p>Marſini ſaw, indeed, that he was perfectly exhauſted, and therefore, propoſed to him, to accompany him to an inn, at a ſhort diſtance from the convent, to which he was recommended by the abbeſs.</p>
               <p>'Ah!' ſaid Theodore, on hearing the inn named, 'I know the place well;—how many days have I ſpent there!—days of ſorrow and anguiſh!—but no matter! 'tis over.' Then taking his mother's hand, he ſaid, 'I will return to-morrow, I want nothing but reſt, and then we can exchange together our reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective ſtories;—mine is a chain of diſaſters.'</p>
               <p>He had juſt power to raiſe her hand to his lips, and then, ſupported by Marſini and Francis, got into the carriage, and went with them to the inn. They got him there ſome refreſhment, after which he retired to reſt, and aroſe the next morning much refreſhed and amended.</p>
               <p>It was now that he firſt enquired of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſini and Francis, who they were; what had brought them to
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:038283_0140_10119716D3F2C7F0"/>
the convent; and how it happened, that they ſeemed at once to have taken ſo deep an intereſt in him and his concerns. To which enquiries Marſini anſwered, by relating to him all that had happened to his family ſince his departure. 'And now, ſir,' he added, 'let us loſe no time, but immediately return to Ireland, and there put an end to the long years of anxiety which your family have ſuffered on your account.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' ſaid Theodore, 'I will uſe all the ſpeed in my power, but I dare not take the ſhorteſt route for my return; I am not in ſafety while I continue in France; I have run a very great riſque in coming into the kingdom again, but I could have had no peace of mind without it. It was my purpoſe, after my viſit to Sainte Marguerite's convent yeſterday, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to have ſet off for Geneva, as the ſhorteſt way out of the French territories, and after reſting there a ſhort time, to proceed on my journey, by the ſhorteſt and ſafeſt route I could plan. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occurrence of meeting with my mother, determines me to go again to the convent, and after having ſeen her, and dropped a tear once more over the tomb of my Antoinette, I will proceed as faſt as poſſible from this ſcene of peril.'</p>
               <p>'Well then,' ſaid Marſini, 'ſince it muſt be ſo, we will take the ſhorteſt way to return to Ireland, and carry to your wife and family the welcome news, that you are on your way back to them. Oh! with what tranſport they will receive me, when I am the bearer of ſuch tidings?'</p>
               <p>'And, can my wife, then, wiſh to ſee me,' anſwered Theodore, 'after all the ſufferings I have occaſioned her?—But I know her worth, and, though I deſerted her, I have never ceaſed to eſteem her.'</p>
               <p>'Doubt not,' ſaid Marſini, 'of the joy your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will occaſion; but,' he continued, 'cannot you give us ſome token by which more effectually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her, that we have ſeen you?—Will you not write to her?'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:038283_0141_1011971B011E6C38"/>'Yeſ,' ſaid Theodore, 'I will inſtantly do ſo;—he ſat down and wrote a letter to her, then taking from his pocket-book a lock of hair, and putting the letter and the hair into Marſini's hands, 'Take theſe,' ſaid he, 'my Henry will remember, that I cut this lock of hair from his head ſome ſeven years ago, 'tis the beſt token I can charge you with.'</p>
               <p>'And your ſtory,' ſaid Marſini, 'may I not be charged with that too?'</p>
               <p>'No,' anſwered Theodore, 'it is long and full of diſaſters:—Spare me the repetition of it now; at my return to Ireland, my wife ſhall know all; when ſhe will own that though in ſome reſpects I am the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of cenſure, in others I am an object of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.'</p>
               <p>'Adieu, then, for the preſent,' ſaid Marſini, 'I ſhall ſet out immediately; and truſt, that you, ſir, will uſe no unneceſſary delays. You will poſſeſs yourſelf of all do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theodore then embraced Marſini and Francis, making the warmeſt acknowledgments for their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then ſet off for Sainte Marguerite, while the latter proceeded towards Ireland.</p>
               <p>When Theodore arrived at the convent, he found his mother tolerably compoſed from the agitation oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the affecting ſcene of the preceding day; when ſhe told him, that after the elopement from his father (as mentioned in the early part of this hiſtory) ſhe continued for ſome time with the man who then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her, and accompanied him to France; but he growing tired of her, conſigned her over to a French officer, with whom ſhe lived for two years in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, though not in comfort; for,' ſaid ſhe, 'I was often haunted with remorſe for my paſt conduct, and as often wiſhed I could recal my innocence, and the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:038283_0142_1011971F357257B0"/>
affections of my huſband: but ah! How difficult is it to retrieve one falſe ſtep! Much as I wiſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him, I did not dare to attempt it, but, at length, the officer I lived with dying, I was turned out of doors by his heir, perfectly deſtitute of every thing, but the clothes on my back, and the little money I had in my pocket, which did not altogether amount, to ſo much as a louis-d'or.</p>
               <p>'In this diſtreſs I knew not which way to turn; many times did I reſolve to ſeek out my huſband, throw myſelf at his feet, and beg his protection and forgiveneſs, but, deſtitute as I was of the means of taking ſuch a journey, I knew not how to ſet about it, and, with ſhame I own it, I was alſo, in part, withheld by a falſe pride, which did not know how to bend to the humiliation I muſt undergo. I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at laſt, took refuge in the greater humiliation of proſtitution, in which courſe I continued for ſeveral years, enduring miſeries which no imagination can conceive, that has not experienced them; 'till at laſt, I was rouſed by an extraordinary circumſtance to a ſhocking ſenſe of the life I led, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'The circumſtance I allude to, was no other than the dreadful idea, that I had been led into a connexion with my own ſon; with you, my Theodore. Oh! Never ſhall I loſe the remembrance of that moment, when firſt the idea flaſhed on my mind! Hell! hell itſelf, can have no greater torments, than I than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered! I was preparing to fulfil an appointment I had made, when it was firſt ſuggeſted to me—Oh God! Oh God!—I rolled on the floor for ſome time with agony, then ſtarting up, I ran out of the houſe, not knowing whither I went, nor what was my deſign. In this ſtate I was met by a man, who ſeeing me look wild and diſtracted, took compaſſion on me, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to his houſe, which was a ſmall, but neat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:038283_0143_1011825615774CE0"/>
in the ſuburbs of Paris. He aſked me many queſtions, but it was a long time before I could give him a rational anſwer. At laſt, when he got to a knowledge of the cauſe of my diſtraction, he ſaid, he would go and inveſtigate the matter, and, leaving me under the care of his two ſervants, he ſet forth on his benevolent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>'He returned, after an abſence of about four hours, bringing with him the welcome news, that my fears were totally without foundation. The young man, whom I had apprehended from circumſtances to be you, my Theodore, was in fact an Iriſhman, but I was perfectly convinced quite a different perſon from him, whom I had dreaded finding him to be. The impreſſion left on my mind, however, was ſuch, that for worlds I could not have returned to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe, and an impulſe of penitence and remorſe having thus ſeized me, I inſtantly reſolved to quit a world, in which I had incurred ſo much guilt and miſery.</p>
               <p>'I communicated to my benefactor the reſolution I had made, who encouraged me in it; and in order to aſſiſt me in carrying it into execution, applied, in my behalf, to the lady abbeſs of this convent, who conſented to receive me; and here I have been ever ſince, which muſt now be at leaſt fifteen years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of that time, I have practiſed the moſt rigid auſterities, and been unremitted in my devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, I hope, I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She ceaſed.—'Alas!' ſaid Theodore, 'To what dreadful ſcenes will a ſingle error often lead! And how forcibly is that poſition illuſtrated, by the fates of my father, my mother, my wives and myſelf! My father erred, in ſuppoſing, that the only thing neceſſary to attach a woman to a life of retirement, was, that ſhe ſhould be educated far from the luxuries
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:038283_0144_10119725EA63F978"/>
and vanities of the world. You erred, madam, in not exerting your reſolution to follow the fortunes of my father, whatever ſituation they might throw him into. I erred, in entering ſecretly into a matrimonial connexion, which I ought to have imparted to my father in an unreſerved manner. My firſt wife erred, in aſſenting to, or even more than aſſenting to, in adviſing the ſecrecy I obſerved; and my preſent wife erred, in accepting my hand, when ſhe knew that my heart did not accompany it. And the long train of important and diſaſtrous conſequences that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from each of theſe reſpective errors, will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhew, that man can never deviate one inch from the ſtraight road of ſincerity, or endeavour to ſubſtitute falſe rules of right, for thoſe immutable and infallible ones, laid down by the creator and lord of all things, without ſuffering the puniſhment which every ſuch deviation neceſſarily draws along with it. Liſten, madam, to my ſtory, and own the truth of what I have advanced.'</p>
               <p>Theodore then related to her the hiſtory of his life, even from his boyiſh years; but as we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to relate it elſewhere, we forbear to give it a place here.</p>
               <p>After ſome hours of converſation, in which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade his mother to let application to be made for a releaſe from her vows, that ſhe might come and end her days with him in Ireland, to which ſhe could by no means be brought to conſent, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore took an affectionate leave of her.</p>
               <p>He then viſited again the tomb of his wife, and procured an atteſted copy of her death, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the convent; when having ſettled all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in thoſe parts, he proceeded on his journey, and arrived ſafely and expeditiouſly at Geneva.</p>

               <p>MARSINI and Francis met with no interruption in their journey, and arrived again at Dublin after ſo ſhort an abſence, that mrs. Percival could, at firſt ſight of them, ſcarcely believe that they had been to the diſtance which they intended at ſetting out; but when they aſſured her, that they had been at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Sainte Marguerite, ſhe ſaid, with a look of the moſt eager anxiety;</p>
               <p>'May I not hope, then, that your ſpeedy return is an indication, that you bring good news?'</p>
               <p>Marſini, with his eyes ſparkling with delight, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to her, and taking her by the hand, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'I know by experience, deareſt lady, that the thunder-ſtroke of adverſity has no power to ſhake the firmneſs of your ſoul;—but the guſhing tide of joy's overflowing cup is harder ſtill to bear;—Say, can you ſupport that too with equanimity of temper?'</p>
               <p>'Oh, yes, yes, yes!' ſhe ſaid, her heart palpitating all the time, as if it would burſt the caſe that encloſed it: 'I can, indeed, I can.—Tell me then at once, that my Theodore lives:—I read it in your eyes— your manner.'</p>
               <p>'He does live, indeed,' ſaid Marſini.</p>
               <p>'Then heaven be praiſed,' ſhe exclaimed, while convulſive ſobs and tears of ecſtacy, in which ſhe was joined by Henry and Antoinette, prevented her ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:038283_0146_101197294D335178"/>
more; nor could the ſympathizing count and Francis themſelves refrain from joining them. At laſt mrs. Percival recovering herſelf, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'Come, then, tell me all:—the burſt of tranſport is over, and I can now hear your ſtory with calmneſs.'</p>
               <p>'Can you?' ſaid Marſini, 'But what ſays my child, my Antoinette?—Will it not overcome her? And, can this dear youth, can Henry bear it?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! yes,' they both ſobbed out, 'indeed we can; you need not fear us.'</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to relate all the particulars of his viſit to the convent, and ended, with ſaying, 'That he did not doubt, but that lord Arlington would ſoon be in Ireland.' Then producing the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the lock of hair, 'and for a farther proof, madam,' he added, 'that I have ſeen your huſband, he charged me to be the bearer of theſe: my Henry,' he ſaid, 'will remember, that I cut this hair from his head ſeven years ago.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, well do I remember it,' ſaid Henry: 'but, how little did I then ſuppoſe, that it was my father, who aſked ſuch a boon of me!'</p>
               <p>Mrs. Percival read the letter, which contained ſuch pathetic expreſſions of regret for all the ſufferings he had occaſioned her, and ſuch anxious wiſhes for the future happineſs of her, and his children, that ſhe could not read it without tears.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be attended to, was to ſettle every thing with mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick, to whom Marſini immediately repaired, and imparted all the intelligence he had acquired; in conſequence of which, they proceeded according to the forms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved. A new trial was moved for, on the plea that lord Arlington was ſtill alive, and would ſoon be in Ireland; and a day was appointed for rehearing the cauſe, at ſuch a diſtant period, as it was thought would leave no doubt of lord Arlington's being arrived before that time.</p>
               <p>But fortune ſeemed determined to ſport with the
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038283_0147_1011972F1439F2B0"/>
feelings of lady Arlington to the laſt moment. Day after day paſſed over, and no lord Arlington appeared. Poſt after poſt arrived from the continent, but they brought no news of lord Arlington. The day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the trial approached; ſtill he was abſent. Lady Arlington grew uneaſy—this negligence in her huſband was worſe than all his former conduct.— How could he be ſo barbarous as to raiſe her hopes to ſuch a height, only to daſh them down again with a ten-fold violence? Marſini, too, blamed himſelf very much for having left lord Arlington;—a thouſand unpleaſant ideas crouded into his mind with regard to him;—lord Arlington's health was ſuch, that he might, perhaps, have ſunk under bodily debility;— at any rate, he wanted ſome attention to be paid him, Francis Delaval might have been diſpatched to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and he himſelf have ſtaid to attend on his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—Again, it was poſſible, that lord Arlington wanted to get rid of them, and, therefore, framed the ſtory of his not being ſafe in France, only that he might be left to himſelf; and this ſuſpicion gathered confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mation, from his begging to decline relating his ſtory to him. In fact, he thought, that if he had reaſoned properly on the ſubject, he might have ſeen, that lord Arlington for many reaſons was by no means in a proper ſituation to be left without any one with him, and he wondered, that ſuch an idea had never ſtruck him at the time; but all was then hurry and confuſion; he could not, however, excuſe himſelf for ſuch a piece of inattention.</p>
               <p>Reflections, ſuch as theſe, frequently paſſed in Marſini's mind, though he never uttered them to lady Arlington.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival, in the mean time, who had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to give up the conteſt, 'till it ſhould appear to be impoſſible for him to maintain it any longer, ſaw, with a ſecret exultation, that his opponents ſeemed to have deluded themſelves with falſe hopes. Every day he anxiouſly watched at the port for the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038283_0148_10119731091082C8"/>
arrival of ſhips; and every day ſaw with a tranſport, which he ſcarcely attempted to diſſemble, ſhip after ſhip arrive, but no lord Arlington with them.</p>
               <p>It was now but the day before that appointed for the trial;—mr. Percival was taking his uſual ſtand at the port, when the arrival of a veſſel from Leghorn, was announced by three huzzas; and very ſoon after he ſaw two men come on ſhore, one of them a middle aged man in appearance, and immediately enquired for the houſe of count Marſini. Mr. Percival was ſeized all over with a trembling; he did not know lord Arlington's perſon, but he had no doubt, that he beheld the man whoſe preſence he ſo much dreaded, and wiſhed it had then been night, that under the veil of darkneſs, he might have given him a puſh from the boat, that ſhould have ſunk him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the waves for ever.</p>
               <p>He heard the bye-ſtanders give the ſtrangers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to find Marſini's houſe, and following them at a diſtance, ſaw them enter there. All day did he hover about in the environs of that ſpot: he could hear nothing to relieve his uncertainty, nor did he retire to his own habitation till after midnight. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere he threw himſelf on his bed; but ſleep fled his eye-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s; he lay reſtleſs and uneaſy 'till day break, when he again repaired to Marſini's houſe, and ſeeing a perſon come out of the houſe, whom he knew to be a ſervant at an adjacent inn, he reſolved, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at once to ſatisfy his anxious ſoul, and enquired, therefore, of the man, 'If lord Arlington had not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the count's houſe the day before?'</p>
               <p>'Who, who ſaid the fellow?'</p>
               <p>'Lord Arlington;—did he arrive at count Marſini's houſe yeſterday?'</p>
               <p>'I know nothing of their names, there was two outlandiſh folks came;—but if you want to know their names, I'll ax the ſervants.'</p>
               <p>A ſervant then coming to the door, 'Pray if you pleaſe,' ſaid the fellow, 'this jontleman would be glad
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:038283_0149_10119721B11E6EB0"/>
to know the names of thoſe two out-landiſh lords, that came to your houſe yeſterday.'</p>
               <p>The ſervant, who was an Italian, replied, 'That they were count Carletti and his ſervant.'</p>
               <p>A drop of water to the parched lips of the fainting, wounded ſoldier, could not prove a greater cordial, than this reply did to the haraſſed ſoul of mr. Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. He flew back to his habitation, eat his breakfaſt with alacrity, and then dreſſed himſelf for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in court; whither he repaired at the hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for its meeting.</p>
               <p>Not quite ſo pleaſant were the feelings of lady Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, on the arrival of that hour, to which ſhe had once looked forward as the termination of her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. But that event ſeemed now far off, nor could it be calculated, when it was likely to arrive.</p>
               <p>The court, at length, met;—mr. Byrne aroſe, in order to ſolicit a farther delay of the trial; but he was ſcarcely on his legs, when a confuſed murmur run through the court, of, 'He is come—he is come,' and immediately appeared at the bar the ſame death-like emaciated figure, which Marſini had long before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held at Sainte Marguerite.</p>
               <p>He begged to be heard for a few minutes, and then ſaid, 'That he had been detained at ſea more than double the uſual time for the paſſage from Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa, which was the laſt port he left, by a leaky veſſel and adverſe winds; and at laſt, the ſhip, which was bound to Cork, was driven into Limerick, where ſhe had arrived two days before, having been kept above water for three former days, only by dint of inceſſant pumping, in which every paſſenger had been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to take his ſhare. He hoped, therefore, to be indulged by the court, with an adjournment of two days; for he had left two people at Limerick, who would be important witneſſes in the cauſe, and who could hardly reach Dublin before the evening of the next day.'</p>
               <p>The judge replied, 'That ſuch an indulgence
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:038283_0150_101182579E58A958"/>
could not be refuſed, when properly applied for by council.' The motion of adjournment was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, made in due form, and the court was adjourned accordingly.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington, then, requeſted of mr. Byrne, to accompany him to an inn, that he might have ſome converſation with him on the impending buſineſs, and that he might have a little time to reſt and compoſe himſelf before his firſt interview with his wife and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; 'For,' ſaid he, 'notwithſtanding the fatigue I had undergone for three days before my landing, I could not ſtop at Limerick, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rived in Dublin, when I learnt that the court was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at moment aſſembled on my buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Byrne deſired, that inſtead of going to an inn, lord Arlington would accompany him to his houſe; to which he conſented; and, as ſoon as they arrived there, they agreed to ſend for Marſini, (who knowing that nothing material could be done in court on that day, had not attended there) in order to impart to him the arrival of lord Arlington, that he might prepare his family to receive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick, however, who was preſent when this was ſettled, ſaid, 'That he would go himſelf to lady Arlington's houſe, from whence he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch Marſini to mr. Byrne's, and would himſelf ſtay with lady Arlington, 'till the count ſhould return, in order to keep guard, that no intelligence of her lord's arrival, might come too abruptly upon her.'</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick, accordingly, went to lady Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, (for by that name we ſhall henceforth call that lady) where, as he expected, he found Marſini, and told him, he was wanted at mr. Byrne's, whither Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini immediately went, and mr. Fitzpatrick continued with lady Arlington, talking to her on various ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, 'till his return, which was in about an hour, when mr. Fitzpatrick took his leave.</p>
               <p>When he was gone, Marſini ſaid, 'At length, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038283_0151_10119602B268DC88"/>
I hope we are arrived at the wiſhed for haven, and all our troubles are at an end.'</p>
               <p>'Lord!'—She could not give him time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but exclaimed, 'is he arrived then?'</p>
               <p>'He is, madam.'</p>
               <p>It was almoſt too much for her;—after a ſeparation of above fifteen years; after many weeks of anxious watching and expectation, the huſband, whom ſhe ſo much doted on, was at laſt in the ſame town with her:—ſhe gave an involuntary ſcream of ecſtacy.</p>
               <p>'But, why do I ſuffer this?' ſhe cried; 'No, let me bear this too with temper, with fortitude:—But where is he?—What has detained him ſo long?— —When ſhall I ſee him?—You have ſeen him, no doubt.'</p>
               <p>'Yes, I have ſeen him, indeed, madam: but, if poſſible, he was even a more affecting ſight than when I ſaw him before. He has undergone dreadful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues;—he is pale, emaciated, languid, yet he hardly ſeems to know it. His mind has been ſo long in a conſtant agitation, that he ſeems rendered inſenſible to bodily feelings, 'till nature is perfectly exhauſted; he has had a dreadful voyage, and a hurrying journey from Limerick, by which he is, indeed, nearly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that acmé, where nature can proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>'When I entered the room at mr. Byrne's, he was ſtretched on a ſofa, from which, however, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſaw me, he ſprang forward, while his eyes ſeemed to aſk me a thouſand queſtions at the ſame inſtant; they ſeemed to ſay, tell me of my Horatia, my Antoinette, my Henry! but in a moment after he ſunk exhauſted again on the ſofa. I enquired, if he had taken any refreſhment, ſince his arrival, to which mr. Byrne anſwered, that he had been urging him to do ſo, but had not been able to prevail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I then added my entreaties to thoſe of mr. Byrne, which were, at laſt, effectual, and he ſeemed much revived.'</p>
               <p>'Alas! then,' he ſaid, 'What can you have thought
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038283_0152_10119608038BB700"/>
of my long delay?—I muſt have been ſtrangely cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in your eyes; but I have been unfortunate in it, not faulty.'</p>
               <p>He then enquired, 'If I thought his wife would ſee him?'</p>
               <p>'Doubt it not for a moment,' I anſwered; 'ſhe will fly with tranſport into your arms.'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' he ſaid, 'Why delay a moment? —Let us inſtantly haſten to her.'</p>
               <p>'I begged of him not to think of ſeeing you at this time, but to wait 'till he was refreſhed with reſt, for I really thought him too much exhauſted to go through ſuch an affecting ſcene.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! do not name reſt,' he cried, 'I cannot reſt, 'till I have ſeen her!'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' I anſwered, 'Follow your wiſhes, for every moment of delay is a moment of rapture loſt to one of the beſt of women.</p>
               <p>'We, accordingly, came hither together, and, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, he is now below, waiting my permiſſion to come to you; and I have only kept you thus long in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to give you both a little time to compoſe yourſelves.'</p>
               <p>Lady Arlington ſcarcely heard theſe laſt words— ſhe flew down ſtairs, and in a moment found herſelf in the arms of her long-loſt huſband. Who can deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe this ſcene?—But it was a ſcene not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed; it was only to be felt. They mingled tears for a while in each other's boſom, which for ſome time were the only language which could find vent. —At laſt Theodore faltered out,</p>
               <p>'What goodneſs to meet me thus!'—he looſed his hold —He ſunk back in a chair. Lady Arlington ſat down; ſhe took his hand affectionately;</p>
               <p>'This ſcene is too much for you I fear, my love,' ſhe ſaid.</p>
               <p>'Too much, indeed,' he replied. 'Oh! had you met me with frowns and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A ſilence again enſued—then holding out his hands,</p>
               <p>'Come, my children,' he ſaid, 'You too muſt ſeal your father's pardon.'</p>
               <p>They approached him;—they eagerly ſeized the hands he extended to them;—he raiſed his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</p>

               <p>LORD Arlington aroſe the next morning, much recovered from his fatigues; he had enjoyed a repoſe, rendered doubly ſweet by having ſeen his wife and children, and having found them in ſuch good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions towards him. When he entered the breakfaſt room, he found lady Arlington already there; ſhe met him with looks of the moſt enchanting ſweetneſs and tendereſt affection, and taking his hand, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'What pleaſure it gives me, my Theodore, to ſee you look ſo much better! I begin, indeed, to ſee my huſband again,—yeſterday I hardly knew you.'</p>
               <p>'I do not wonder at it, my love,' he anſwered: 'Slavery, impriſonment, toils by ſea and land, eternal anxiety; theſe, my love, endured for fifteen years, are enough to ſubdue even the ſtrongeſt conſtitution: but theſe are over now; one unhappy paſſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, my heart is now wholly your's, and for the reſt of my life I do not doubt, but I ſhall find that happineſs in being united to you, which formerly my eſtranged heart was unable to taſte.'</p>
               <p>Theſe words were followed with ſo tender and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate an embrace, that lady Arlington, who had never before experienced ſuch ſymptoms of affection from a huſband, whom ſhe doted on, loſt, in that moment, all ſenſe of the ſorrows which ſhe had gone
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038283_0155_10119611738F4F70"/>
through, and thought of nothing, but the happineſs to which ſhe truſted ſhe might now look forwards.</p>
               <p>'Alas!' ſhe ſaid, 'Have you then undergone all that variety of troubles?—Oh! How often has my anxious heart been torn with conjectures on your fate, and wiſhed it could ſhare and ſoothe your ſorrows! —But let us not talk any more of them;—let us only now endeavour that the next fifteen years ſhall be productive of as much happineſs, as the laſt fifteen years have of miſery.'</p>
               <p>'Ah! my Horatia,' anſwered lord Arlington, 'We have but one path to purſue, to attain that deſirable end;—follow ſincerity and reaſon in every thing; 'tis to deviations from them, that we owe all our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but I truſt that we have both learnt leſſons for our future conduct, and the cauſe being removed the effect will ceaſe.'</p>
               <p>The converſation continued ſome time, in which lord Arlington gave unbounded ſcope to the eſteem and affection which he now really felt for ſo valuable a wife as his Horatia, and, perhaps, never was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo likely to impreſs a man of any feeling, with an extraordinary affection for a woman;—he had deſerted her in a ſtrange and abrupt manner, nor had he, for more than fifteen year, ever made her the object even of his ſmalleſt attention; yet at his return, ſhe received him not merely without a frown, but with an overflow of tenderneſs, which, not to have returned, muſt have ſtamped him as a monſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the brutes.</p>
               <p>At laſt they were joined by Henry and Antoinette. This interview opened a freſh ſcene of tenderneſs, which, however, in a ſhort time was broken in upon, by the arrival of Marſini, who apologized for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, but urged, in excuſe, his anxiety to hear of his friend;—but, he added afterwards,</p>
               <p>'I will own that I am a little ſelfiſh too in my viſit; I was anxious to aſk a queſtion of lord Arlington; I would have my anſwer from his mouth,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038283_0156_10119615572BBF58"/>
although I anticipate in my mind what that anſwer will be.'</p>
               <p>'I can ſcarcely refuſe to anſwer any queſtion put by count Marſini,' ſaid lord Arlington.</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' returned the count, 'You have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared yourſelf the father of the lovely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette: Who, then, was her mother?'</p>
               <p>'Her mother,' he replied, 'was Antoinette de St. Foix, daughter to the baron de St. Foix, a French nobleman.'</p>
               <p>'It is enough,' ſaid Marſini, 'her likeneſs to my Gabrielle is accounted for, and ſhe, I doubt not, was really faultleſs.'</p>
               <p>'How?' ſaid lord Arlington, 'And are you then the huſband of Gabrielle de St. Foix?'</p>
               <p>'It is even ſo,' returned Marſini.</p>
               <p>The converſation was here put an end to, by a note from mr. Byrne, requeſting lord Arlington to attend at his houſe as ſoon as poſſible, to meet mr. Fitzpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, in order that they might arrange the buſineſs of the ſucceeding day. To this note lord Arlington re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, by going immediately to mr. Byrne's; but at parting from his family, expreſſed the deepeſt regret, that he muſt leave them, probably, too, for the greateſt part of the day, as he anxiouſly wiſhed to aſk them a thouſand queſtions, and hear from their own lips, every circumſtance that had happened during his abſence; for he was not half ſatisfied with what he had learnt from Marſini, when they met in France.</p>
               <p>When he was gone, Marſini burſt forth into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed expreſſions of affectionate attachment to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette:</p>
               <p>'I have called you my daughter,' ſaid he, 'you are indeed my niece;—but be my child ſtill;—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give you up;—you ſhall have two fathers.'</p>
               <p>He could not help claſping her in his arms and kiſſing her.</p>
               <p>She returned his kind expreſſions, with like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of regard, declaring, 'That ſhe was truly
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038283_0157_1011961851AC8170"/>
rejoiced to find that ſhe really could claim to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him; though had no relationſhip ſubſiſted, his kindneſs had formed a much ſtronger claim to her regard, than any other ties could form.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the day arrived the two witneſſes from Limerick, whom lord Arlington had ſaid, he expected;—theſe were Clement Seguin, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianne de Mercier, the people who were preſent at his marriage with Antoinette, and with whom the reader will, in a ſhort time, be better acquainted.</p>
               <p>When lord Arlington was informed by mr. Byrne, of the names of the two French ſailors who had ſworn to his death, he ſaid, 'He knew them well, and knew them for a couple of complete raſcals, who were corruptible to any purpoſe, for which they might be wanted; and he thought it probable, that they had, therefore, been corrupted to ſwear to his death, for which ſtory there was not the leaſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as he had not been materially ill during the whole voyage from Rochelle to St. Domingo, which iſland he left again, only two days after his landing. But that circumſtance they did not know, and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, concluded him to be kept priſoner on the iſland, for it was the general idea in the ſhip, that ſuch was to be his fate; and it was, alſo, probable, that the idea of his being under a confinement, from whence he was not likely to eſcape, had tempted them to ſwear ſo poſitively to his death.'</p>
               <p>This clue being given to the council, they, on the day of trial, put ſuch queſtions to them, as drew forth, at laſt, the following confeſſion.</p>
               <p>'That ſo much of their former depoſition was true, as related to the manner of their becoming known to mr. Thomas Percival; but,' they now added, 'That he, in his converſations with them, often queſtioned them very cloſely, concerning the probability of Theodore's ever eſcaping from St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo; and, when they conſtantly affirmed, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they believed) that he never was likely to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038283_0158_1011961D36F03580"/>
he began to ſound them on the ſubject of ſwearing to his death, offering them large rewards, if they would accompany him to Ireland, for that purpoſe. That, allured by the proſpect of exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life of labour, for a life of idleneſs, which, by their agreement with mr. Percival, they were to be enabled to do; they conſented to ſwear to whatever he ſhould require of them. They ſaid, alſo, that the paper which had been ſworn to, as a copy from the captain's minutes, was an abſolute forgery, provided only, in caſe their (the two ſailors) evidence ſhould be deemed inſufficient; and two people from Marſeilles, were hired, under the aſſumed characters of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's mate, and ſteward, to ſwear to it.'</p>
               <p>After this ample confeſſion, minutes of which were taken down in writing, and which had diſcloſed a ſcene of villany, that would be almoſt incredible, were not ſimilar inſtances but too frequent, the ſailors were conducted out of court, under a proper guard, that they might be kept from all farther intercourſe with the claimant, or his party, and he (the claimant) was ſummoned into court.</p>
               <p>From the moment of lord Arlington's arrival, the ſtate of his mind had been ſuch, that malice itſelf could not have wiſhed him a greater torment; he ſaw all his aſpiring hopes at once daſhed to the ground, and in the firſt paroxyſm of rage and deſpair, had flown to the ſea-ſide, in order, there at once to cloſe the ſcene of his guilt and miſery. But when he caſt his eyes over the wide extended main, his ſoul ſhrunk within him, at the thought of what he was about; the boundleſs ocean before his eyes, ſeemed as a type of that ocean of futurity, in which he was going to plunge; he thought of the ſhoals and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands he might there encounter;—his courage failed him, and he returned wild and diſtracted to his own apartment. He laid himſelf down on his pillow, but the pillow proved not the friendly counſellor, which it is generally thought to be;—no; he there medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038283_0159_1011961EC5F8B790"/>
new miſchief, and determined to endeavour to prove lord Arlington an impoſtor.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, he had again recourſe to the two ſailors, and by freſh promiſes, had engaged them to freſh perjuries. But when theſe men were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and found that matters were likely to take a turn, which their employer did not expect, like true rogues, who are never faithful to each other, they thought it better, by betraying him, to endeavour to ſave themſelves.</p>
               <p>Truſting, however, to their fidelity, mr. Percival appeared in the court, with the moſt unbounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; but when the confeſſion of the ſailors was read to him, his countenance, in a moment, fell;— he was taken unawares;—his preſence of mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally forſook him—he looked abaſhed, aſhamed, and in vain attempted to falter out a denial;—but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſpoke too plain;—and when he was told, 'That if he attempted to deny what the ſailors had advanced, they would be brought up to confront him,' he ſaw that all was over, and, therefore, took refuge in confeſſion. He owned, that all they had advanced, was true, and ſaid, 'That if the court would forbear to queſtion him, and let him depart, he would, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, communicate farther particulars to lord Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.'</p>
               <p>The court acceded to his requeſt, and all things being now ſufficiently clear on the ſide of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, the former verdict was annulled, and lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington was reſtored to the quiet poſſeſſion of his title and eſtates.</p>
               <p>When the court broke up, lord Arlington deſired mr. Percival to follow him to mr. Byrne's houſe, and when they arrived there, mr. Percival confeſſed, that from the moment when he firſt heard of his (lord Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington's) ſtrange departure, which he did by means of a correſpondent at Limerick, whom he made a ſort of ſpy on the family, he conceived hopes, though he hardly knew why, that it was a circumſtance, which
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038283_0160_101196230216AB00"/>
might one day turn out to his advantage; and he had, therefore, ever ſince kept continually on the watch, for any thing that might tend to feed theſe hopes.</p>
               <p>The paper offered him by Pierre Dupont, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived might be of uſe to forward his views; and he, therefore, reſolved to purchaſe it at any rate: year after year, however, elapſed, and he gained no ground; yet he carefully kept the paper, as the golden ear from which he one day hoped to reap a plentiful har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. He heard from his correſpondent at Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erick regularly, five or ſix times a year, and knew from him every occurrence that happened in lord Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's family.</p>
               <p>At length, the two ſailors arrived at Marſeilles, and from the firſt moment when he heard their ſtory, he was continually plotting how he might uſe it to his own advantage. The death of Theodore without lawful heirs, would ſecure to him the poſſeſſion of rank and fortune, and he therefore turned his whole attention to the beſt method of procuring his death, and the illegitimacy of his ſon; and for effecting this purpoſe, he had followed the plan which had ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately tended to lay open the whole ſcene of his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany. He concluded his confeſſion, by throwing himſelf at the feet of lord Arlington, and earneſtly begging his forgiveneſs, uſing the ſtrongeſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of contrition for his paſt conduct, and promiſes of reformation for the future.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington aſſured him, that he bore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt him; that he pitied his errors, and would be glad to aſſiſt him in carrying his good reſolutions into effect. He told him to come to him the next morning, when he would have ſome farther conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with him, and then departed to his family, where mutual congratulations paſſed on the preceding events;—all care, all ſorrow, ſeemed now baniſhed from amongſt them, and they ſat down to dinner, which was received by lady Arlington, with a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that ſhe had not known for many years, in having her huſband at the table with her.</p>
               <p>After dinner, at which Marſini, his friend count Carletti, whoſe arrival has been already mentioned, Clement and Marianne, were gueſts, lord Arlington, with an apology to thoſe gueſts, for making themſelves the principal objects of the company, begged of lady Arlington to gratify him, by telling him all that had paſſed in his abſence.</p>

                  </gap>ore, at the ſame time, lord Arlington, and every one preſent, ſhe complied, and omitted no circumſtance, or incident, which ſhe thought worth relating. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, during the relation, would a tear involuntarily ſteal down her cheek, when ſhe dwelt on the many anxious moments ſhe had ſuffered; and often did ſympathetic tears ſtart into the animated eyes of her huſband; particularly, when ſhe recounted, which ſhe did with peculiar energy of expreſſion, the thouſand apprehenſions ſhe had endured, on account of her children;—the ardour with which ſhe had watched the openings of their infant minds;—the joy ſhe felt at every virtuous propenſity which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played;—and the pangs that rent her boſom, when ſhe feared that ſhe had diſcovered any of the deformed features of vice lurking about their hearts;—but thoſe fears, ſhe owned, never tormented her for any length of time, for virtue had ever been the prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating principle in both of them.</p>
               <p>When ſhe came to the time of Antoinette's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the hermit, ſhe deſired her to take up the narration, which ſhe did, and deſcribed her two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews

               <p>WHILE I was abſent on my travels, and during the time that I was detained at Vienne, by the illneſs and death of my worthy and reſpected tutor, mr. Lewſon, I became acquainted with the baron de St. Foix, who had a very fine chateau near Vienne. The baron was one of the true French nobleſſe, haughty, arrogant, ſupercilious; full of his own greatneſs, and of the antiquity of his family, and devoted to whatever he conſidered as tending to the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement of that family, of which he was ſo proud. His father had been for ſome years reſident in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, while the baron was quite young, where the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038283_0163_1011962B8F4FB550"/>
latter learnt the Engliſh language ſo completely, that he could ſpeak it as well as the French, and where, alſo, he contracted a partiality (as far as he ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a partiality for any thing, but himſelf) to the Engliſh nation, which led him to treat all ſubjects of the Britiſh empire, who could claim the rank of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, with an affability and attention which he rarely condeſcended to ſhew, even to his equals in his own country.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this condeſcenſion in the baron, I was admitted freely as a gueſt at his houſe; and, indeed, my ſituation at that time ſeemed even to have touched him with a kind of compaſſion, ſo as to make him wiſh to contribute, as far as was conſiſtent with his dignity, to my comfort, in my then afflicting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. He gave me free leave to walk in his grounds, whenever I was inclined; and even permitted me to have a key of a gate to his park, which was cloſe by the city of Vienne, and by means of which I had a much readier acceſs to his houſe, and grounds, than by the common road.</p>
               <p>His famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, at that time, conſiſted only of himſelf, a ſon, and a daughter. The ſon was in Italy, with, I ſuppoſe, count Marſini, and was, as I underſtood, a moſt amiable and accompliſhed gentleman. The daughter, the charming mademoiſelle de St. Foix, need I ſay more of her, than that ſhe was then, in every reſpect, what Antoinette is now, both in perſon, face and mind?</p>
               <p>To a ſoul ſo full of ſenſibility as her's, my ſituation ſoon became very intereſting; I was on the point of loſing a friend, to whom I was under the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and whom I truly loved and eſteemed.—I ſaw him daily ſink under the preſſure of accumulated ills; and, being far from all my friends, and in a country to the manners and cuſtoms of which I was nearly a ſtranger, ſuch a loſs would be much more ſeverely felt.</p>
               <p>She always, therefore, ſeemed to endeavour to be particularly animated in my company, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:038283_0164_1011962D361FD1D8"/>
as far as was in her power, the melancholy, which I could not conceal; and her attentions were too pleaſing to paſs unnoticed by me.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, when ſhe ſaw me taking a ſolitary walk in the garden, ſhe would join me, and by the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of her converſation, chaſe from my thoughts, for a while, the ſubject that diſtreſſed me.</p>
               <p>Ah! fatal attentions to my peace!—while ſhe ſtrove to drive one uneaſineſs from my boſom, ſhe paved the way for the introduction of a thouſand others. In ſhort, I had not long been acquainted with her, before I loved her to diſtraction; and having ſome reaſon to hope, that I was not quite indifferent to her, I was revolving in my mind how I might lay open my heart to her, when a blow fell on us, which at once cruſhed our riſing hopes, and which, at laſt, terminated in the death of Antoinette, and in my own worſe than death, in the total overthrow of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for a long ſeries of years.</p>
               <p>A correſpondence had been for ſome time carrying on between the baron de St. Foix, and the marquis de Lamoignon, a nobleman no leſs proud and arrogant, than the baron himſelf.</p>
               <p>One day the baron called Antoinette into his room, and told her, 'That he had a glorious piece of new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to impart to her; that he had juſt agreed on a match between her, and the count de St. Pol, ſon to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Lamoignon;—that the count would be at his chateau that very afternooon, and that ſhe muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare herſelf to receive him as her lover and future huſband. You will ſee, my dear Antoinette,' he added, 'how much I have conſulted your intereſt, and happineſs alone in this match, ſince I have engaged to give you a very large dower, in conſideration of the ſon of a marquis condeſcending to unite himſelf to the daughter of a baron only; not but my family is more ancient than the marquis's: but deference is certainly due to rank like his.'</p>
               <p>The aſtoniſhed Antoinette, who had not, 'till that
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038283_0165_101196303021FDB0"/>
moment, the leaſt idea of what was going on, loſt, by ſo ſudden and unexpected a ſhock, all power of ſpeech. Indeed, ſhe knew too well, her father's imperious and violent temper, to have dared to make any direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to him, unleſs driven to it by the ſtrongeſt neceſſity; and ſhe thought the beſt way was, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in ſilence, that ſhe might gain time to conſider how ſhe could beſt counteract a deſign, againſt which her heart revolted. Not that at that time ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the count de St. Pol, for even his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was unknown to her; but his character was by no means ſuch, as could make her think an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> union with him deſirable;—added to which, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfectly revolting in being thus bargained for, not only without her conſent, but even without her knowledge;—and, perhaps, more than all, if I may ſay ſo, without vanity, her heart was too partial to me, to endure the thoughts of marrying another. She made no reply, therefore, to the baron, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to give vent to the emotions of her boſom, in a retired part of the garden.</p>
               <p>I was then availing myſelf of the baron's permiſſion to reſort to his gardens at any time, and was walking in the very part, whither Antoinette had turned her ſteps. She did not, however, perceive me, and I ſaw her ſit down on a bench, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owned in tears. This was a moment which I could not reſiſt; I approached the ſeat; ſhe ſcarcely ſeemed to attend to me; I ſat down by her:</p>
               <p>'Alas!' ſaid I, 'What can thus afflict the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mademoiſelle de St. Foix? A ſoul like her's ſhould ſurely be exempt from ſorrow.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! ſir,' ſhe replied, ''tis the curſe of our ſex, that we are never to know what happineſs is. Man may ſometimes be free, but woman, unhappy woman, is eternally a ſlave to ſome tyrant or other; man is ſometimes allowed his choice in a partner in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage tie; but woman muſt ſubmit to be ſold to the firſt perſon who thinks her worth the purchaſe.'</p>
               <p>'Curſes light on the heart that could be ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:038283_0166_1011963418F6EE20"/>
as to think of holding up to ſale ſuch a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as Antoinette!' ſaid I, boiling with indignation.</p>
               <p>'Oh! hold,' ſhe ſaid, 'Curſe him not, for ſtill he is my father, and much is due to that ſacred charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though he may abuſe his power;—I would reſiſt his tyranny, but cannot bear to ſit by and hear him curſed.'</p>
               <p>'Pardon my raſh and haſty tongue,' I replied, 'I acknowledge my fault, and the juſtice of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; but, Oh! deareſt Antoinette, ſurely my eyes have not been ſuch unfaithful interpreters of my heart, as to leave you any room to doubt, that that heart is wholly, ſolely your's. Tell me, then; can I do aught to reſcue you from your preſent embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment? I cannot know a joy equal to ſerving you; —ſpeak, lovely creature! —I have ſometimes been preſumptuous enough to hope, that I was not quite indifferent to you.'</p>
               <p>She looked earneſtly at me, and after a ſilence of a minute or two, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'I know not whether you may not deem me too forward in the confeſſion I am going to make; but circumſtance, powerful circumſtance, demands, that I ſhould be explicit;—Yes, mr. Percival, I will own, that I have ſeen your partiality for me—ſeen it with a pleaſure, which I will not attempt to diſſemble, and have been induced to think, that the greateſt happineſs I could know, was to ſpend the remainder of my days with you. Judge, then, what my feelings muſt be, at receiving a poſitive command from my father, to receive the count de St. Pol, as my lover and future huſband;—a man, whom I never even ſaw, and whoſe pride and arrogance are the theme of univerſal deteſtation, by all who are not as proud and arrogant as himſelf. And this marriage has been agreed upon by my father, without his ever having even mentioned the ſubject to me. What can I do? Miſery muſt await my refuſal of this deteſted marriage; and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery muſt, in all probability, await my conſent to it;
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:038283_0167_10119637DED53FE0"/>
but that I am determined never to do. If I muſt be miſerable, at leaſt I will not have to reproach myſelf as the author of my own wretchedneſs.'</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary to detail at large the particulars of this interview; it is ſufficient to ſay, that it became at laſt ſo intereſting to us, that we exchanged reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal promiſes of unalterable fidelity to each other. and that we would preſerve that faith at all hazards. She ſaid, 'ſhe muſt ſee St. Pol that afternoon, for a refuſal to do ſo, would be a fooliſh irritation of her father, which could ſerve no good purpoſe; but was determined not to give him any encouragement:' and when we parted, ſhe appointed me to to meet her at the ſame ſpot early the next morning, that ſhe might tell me how matters were going on.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, we met the next morning, when ſhe told me, 'That her interview with St. Pol had only confirmed her reſolution, never to be his; for ſhe found, that the world had not done him injuſtice in the character it had given him. He was inſolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conception, and in that firſt interview, had treated her with all the arrogance and contempt, which are too often ſhewn by the huſband to his wife: but are ſeldom practiſed by the lover to his miſtreſs.' She then proceeded to ſay, 'When the count left us, a moſt painful ſcene indeed enſued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my father and me, in which I very plainly told him, that I could never think of giving my hand to a man, who could not behave with decent civility to me, even at our firſt meeting; and after the ſpecimen of his behaviour, which he had juſt been giving me, I ſaw very plainly what I had to expect, when the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage tie ſhould have given him a legal right to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over me: that, in ſhort, rather than give my hand to a man, ſo deſtitute as St. Pol, of every quality of mind, on which to form any rational hopes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I would take refuge in the even leſs i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'when he heard me utter theſe ſentiments, in a tone ſo firm and decided, as could leave him no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of my reſolution being ſhaken: he ſtamped on the ground, and foaming at the mouth, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by paſſion, incapable of utterance; and I know not to what lengths his ungovernable temper might have carried him, had not a domeſtic fortunately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at that moment, and informed him, that a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was arrived at the chateau, with diſpatches from the court. He, therefore, haſtily diſmiſſed me, with orders to retire to my chamber, and not to ſtir from it, but to be ready to attend his ſummons, as ſoon as his buſineſs with the meſſenger was diſpatched. No ſuch ſummons, however, has arrived, nor have I ſeen or heard of my father ſince.'</p>
               <p>We paſſed an hour in ſweet, but melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, when Antoinette ſaid, 'That ſhe muſt leave me, for ſhe dared not ſtay any longer;' and we parted with renewed proteſtations of fidelity to each other; Antoinette promiſing, 'that I ſhould hear from her, when ſhe had any tidings to communicate,' and begging, at the ſame time, 'that I would not attempt to ſee her 'till I had heard from her.'</p>
               <p>She then turned her ſteps towards the houſe, and I returned to my hotel at Vienne, to the melancholy taſk of attending my poor friend, whoſe health I ſaw every day declining more and more rapidly, and to whom, on that account only, I never imparted my affair with Antoinette, which otherwiſe, I ſhould not have thought of concealing from him.</p>
               <p>For five days I lived on the rack of expectation; but did not hear a word of my adored Antoinette. At laſt, a confuſed rumour reached my ears, by means of the phyſician who attended mr. Lewſon, that ſhe had been carried away by order of the baron, and no one knew what was become of her. What horrible images did this report raiſe in my boſom? I pictured to myſelf the object of my ardent affection, betrayed by the very perſon, who ought to have protected her
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038283_0169_1011963C5F014568"/>
from all outrage, into the arms of a man ſhe deteſted; for I concluded nothing elſe, but that the baron had forced her into the power of St. Pol.</p>
               <p>I flew in an agony to the chateau, where the firſt perſon I met with, was an old female ſervant, wife to the porter of the chateau, who had known An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette from her childhood, and loved her as well as ſhe loved her own daughter. I aſked, with trembling anxiety, 'If her young miſtreſs had left the chateau?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! yes, ſir,' ſhe replied, and burſt into tears: 'She has, indeed, and we none of us know what is become of her!'</p>
               <p>'What is it you tell me?' I cried, 'You do not know what is become of her?'</p>
               <p>'Alas! No, ſir,' ſaid ſhe, 'It is now five days ago, ſince the baron and ſhe had a very great quarrel; after which he ordered the coach to be got ready, and made my young lady get into it with him, and he returned a few hours after in the coach by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the next morning he and all his ſervants went away to Paris, and that is all I know about the matter, ſir.'</p>
               <p>For me—I cannot deſcribe my feelings at this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the old woman's.—Excuſe me, my Horatia, my deareſt wife, 'tis a remembrance, that gives me ſuch agony. Lord Arlington pauſed;—he got up; —he walked to the window;—he ſtayed there a few minutes, then returned to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat, and reſumed his narration; but ſaw that tears trickled faſt down the cheeks of ſome of his auditors.</p>
               <p>I enquired of the old woman, 'If ſhe could tell me which way the coach went?'</p>
               <p>'She knew not what road it took,' ſhe ſaid, 'after it got out of the park, and the coachman who drove it was gone to Paris with the baron.'</p>
               <p>I then thanked the old woman for the information ſhe had given me, and went to enquire in the neighbourhood, if they could give me any intelligence of the route the coach had taken, that I might trace
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:038283_0170_1011963E182313C0"/>
out, if poſſible, what was become of my deareſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette. After much enquiry, I at laſt learnt ſo far, as that the coach paſſed a houſe about five miles from Vienne; and there I ſtopped my enquiries for that day, as I had been longer than uſual abſent from my friend, whom, notwithſtanding all my anxieties on another ſubject, I could not bear the idea of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to neglect.</p>
               <p>At my return to the hotel, I found that he had ſuch ſo much in the laſt ſix hours, that it was very improbable he ſhould live the night through; and my fears were right: he expired before the morning, to my unſpeakable regret, for in him I loſt ſuch a friend, as I could ſcarcely hope ever to have again. Never, ſurely, was a man ſo well calculated to execute, with propriety, the office of travelling tutor, which he had undertaken, and I can only wiſh my Henry the exact counterpart of mr. Lewſon, if ever he ſhall ſet out on the plan that I did. But I forbear to dwell farther on his virtues and my loſs; my letters always bore honourable teſtimony to his worth, and my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, perhaps, I loſt him at the moſt critical moment that ſuch a loſs could be ſuſtained, for had he lived, prudent council might have aſſiſted me in winding my way more judiciouſly out of the labyrinth in which I was involved.</p>
               <p>The next morning, after I had given ſuch orders as were neceſſary, in conſequence of the melancholy event which had juſt taken place, I ſet out again on my purſuit of my loſt Antoinette, and, by dint of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted enquiries, at laſt traced her to the convent of Sainte Marguerite, fourteen miles from Vienne. Thus was I well aſſured of the ſituation of my beloved, and was even comforted to find her only ſhut up in a convent, after having pictured her to myſelf in the ſo much more dreadful ſituation of the legal proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of St. Pol. But, how was it poſſible to arrive at any intercourſe with her?—Supineneſs and inactivity, however, I was well aſſured, could do nothing for
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038283_0171_1011964383E4DF38"/>
me;—exertion of mind was the only thing likely to aſſiſt me in my preſent ſituation; and I was reſolved, that as ſoon as I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id the laſt ſad duties to poor Lewſon, I would take up my ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the convent, that I might be in the way to watch opportunity, and to act immediately on any emergency.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, I ſecured a lodging at an inn, only a mile from the convent, and which was the neareſt place that I could poſſibly get one at; and, as ſoon as I had ſeen my friend depoſited in the peaceful grave, and ſettled all his, and my own concerns, at Vienne, I returned to my inn, and there took up my abode.</p>
               <p>I had not been ſettled there more than two days, when I became acquainted with this good man (pointing to Clement, who ſat on the oppoſite ſide of the room) then a friar, and who was the intimate friend of father Anſelm, the confeſſor of the convent. After ſome few converſations with him, and getting what inſight I could into his character, which I found was that of one of the moſt honeſt and benevolent of men; I thought I might venture to truſt him ſo far, as to tell him I had reaſon to ſuſpect that a young lady, to whom my heart was entirely devoted, had been hurried by her father into the convent a ſhort time before, and I entreated him, if poſſible, to learn, whether any one had lately been lodged there, who might anſwer to this deſcription.</p>
               <p>He readily engaged to make the enquiries I wiſhed, and ſaid, 'That he did not doubt but by means of Anſelm, he could gain me the information I deſired; expreſſing, at the ſame time, (as though forgetting, for a moment, through benevolent feelings, that he was a friar) the greateſt abhorrence of that barbarity exerciſed by parents ſo frequently, in throwing off young and helpleſs females, whom they were bound to protect, not to perſecute, into a ſituation, which muſt preclude her from all poſſibility of enjoying real
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:038283_0172_101196452EFCE288"/>
happineſs; ſentiments which did honour to his head and heart, and which long experience has abundantly teſtified to me, were not the flimſy cant of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the ſettled principles of his ſoul.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, I had another viſit from my friend Clement, who told me, 'He had made the enquiries I deſired of his brother Anſelm, and had heard from him, that a young woman of conſummate beauty, and poſſeſſed of a firmneſs and loftineſs of ſoul, beyond what is to be found in the generality of her own ſex, and in very many of the other, was brought there about ten or twelves days before. That ſhe ſeemed in deep affliction, but inſtead of uſeleſsly yielding to, and drooping under it, ſhe exerted all her reſolution to ſuſtain herſelf with dignity and fortitude. That ſhe was watched with more than uſual ſtrictneſs; one of the ſuperiors (ſiſter Marianne) having orders never to leave her; that ſhe was never ſuffered to appear at the grate; and that it was underſtood in the convent, that as ſoon as her year of noviciate was expired, ſhe was to take the veil.'</p>
               <p>So far fortune ſeemed to have favoured me in my reſearches. I now ventured to proceed farther, and to ſound Clement, Whether I might not, by means of Anſelm, get a letter conveyed to my unfortunate Antoinette. He undertook this buſineſs too, as readily as he had undertaken the other, at the ſame time giving me the ſtrongeſt aſſurances, that I might depend on both his own, and Anſelm's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy.</p>
               <p>I accordingly wrote to Antoinette, informing her where I was, and by what means I had come to the knowledge of her ſituation, and obtained the means of communication with her, entreating her, if poſſible, to write to me, and let me know all that had befallen her ſince our laſt meeting.</p>
               <p>This letter I gave to Clement, who immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the convent, and returned to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="174" facs="unknown:038283_0173_1011964822349780"/>
who would take the firſt ſafe opportunity of conveying it into the hands of Antoinette.</p>
               <p>Clement ſpent the reſt of the day with me, and every time I ſaw him, I became more and more pleaſed with his company and converſation. I have always found him ſenſible, liberal, and well-informed, open and ingenuous, not cunning and crafty, like moſt of his order.</p>
               <p>'Excuſe me, ſir,' ſaid lord Arlington, addreſſing himſelf to Clement, 'I muſt pay you the tribute you deſerve.'</p>
               <p>The two ſucceeding days paſſed over, without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clement; and I began rather to wonder at his long delay: but on the morning of the third, he came to me, and ſaid,</p>
               <p>'That he had juſt parted from Anſelm, and learnt from him, that he had given the letter to Antoinette, who received it with tranſport, but that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe ſhould anſwer it; ſhe could only ſend through him aſſurances of her love and fidelity.—But ſir,' ſaid Clement, 'Anſelm bade me aſk you, if yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Hazard!' I exclaimed, 'Is there any danger, that I would not brave to ſee her?'</p>
               <p>'Well, then,' ſaid Clement, 'I will procure a friar's habit for you, and in that dreſs you ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to-morrow morning to the convent.'</p>
               <p>Clement then appointed me a place of meeting, whither I eagerly repaired the next morning, and ſound him waiting for me. I arrayed myſelf in my diſguiſe, and we ſet forward to the convent, where we arrived without any interruption, and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Anſelm's cell.</p>

His countenance was the perfect picture of ſorrow, reſignation, and benevolence. He ſeemed to be of a very advanced age, but his eyes ſtill full of animation, and he was perfectly upright. His whole appearance, in ſhort, ſpake the remnant of manly beauty, both in face and perſon. On my entering, he accoſted me with a benedicite, uttered in the moſt emphatic tone, and then ſaid to me, </p>
               <p>'Young man, you behold before you one, who was in his youth the devoted victim of parental per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, as I fear, alas! is too often the caſe with ſuch as are engaged in the life, to which I have been for ſo many years devoted. We are ſome of us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by our parents, to take upon us the religious vow; and others take refuge in it, when deprived, by perſecution, of all worldly happineſs.

               <p>Anſelm then conducted us into a cloſet adjoining to his cell, which belonged to him, where we could converſe freely, without fear of interruption. She then related to me all that had happened ſince our laſt interview, in the following words:</p>
               <p>'When I was returning to my chamber, after I had parted from you, I met my father on the ſtairs leading to it; at ſight of him, I was ready to ſink into the earth; he ſternly aſked me, where I had been, and, how I had dared to ſtir from my room without his permiſſion?—I replied, that I had been in the garden:—he took me by the arm, pulled me forcibly into my room, and then ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:038283_0176_101196541FB48038"/>'I have found you out, madam; this reluctance to wed the man, whom I had choſen for you, I find ariſes from the baſeſt motives.—Oh! could I have ſuppoſed that the daughter of the baron de St. Foix, could ever have harboured ſuch grovelling ideas,—I would have ſeen that raſcally Iriſhman hurled to the bottom of the ocean, before he ſhould have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter my doors.'</p>
               <p>'I ſaw plainly by this harangue,' continued An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>toinette, 'that my father had really diſcovered our attachment, and wondered much by what means it had come to his knowledge; though, as I afterwards learnt, he had gained his information from one of the ſervants, who had watched us, and overheard ſome of our converſation that morning, unobſerved by us.</p>
               <p>'My father then burſt into a torrent of the moſt violent invective againſt you, and againſt me; and at laſt ſaid,</p>
               <p>'But I am reſolved, madam: and you ſhall find, that I can be as obſtinate as yourſelf; either you ſhall ſwear to me this moment to give your hand, at the time I ſhall name, to the count de St. Pol, or this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant you ſhall be carried to a cloiſter, from whence, mark my words, it is my fixed, my unalterable deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, you ſhall never come out alive.'</p>
               <p>'He then took up a Bible, which lay on the table, and coming up to me, attempted to put it into my hands. I ſhrunk back: I entreated him to pauſe, and reflect on what he was about;—that it gave me pain ever to be obliged to conteſt any point with him, but that I never would conſent to be the wife of St. Pol, who was not merely an object of indifference to me, but the object of my thorough contempt and averſion.</p>
               <p>'I begged him only to allow himſelf a few days to reflect on this affair, when I could not but hope he would view it in a different light. That with regard to yourſelf, though I did not know by what means he had diſcovered my attachment to you, yet I certainly ſhould not diſavow it, as I thought it a paſſion rather
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:038283_0177_10119656E3C24818"/>
to glory in, than to be aſhamed of. That I could not underſtand what he meant, by calling it a baſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that you were of an illuſtrious family in your own country; and that he had himſelf often acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, with the warmeſt encomiums, that your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and mental accompliſhments were almoſt une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled.</p>
               <p>'He ſeemed to heſitate.—I threw myſelf on my knees, and taking one of his hands, which I preſſed to my boſom, entreated only three days delay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he proceeded any farther in this affair.— I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to conſider the dreadful conſequences that might enſue from hurrying matters on;— that he would not only, by that means, endanger the total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of my peace of mind, but would, perhaps, lay up for himſelf a ſtore of miſery for the remainder of his days; — miſery which he could not avoid feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if ever reflection ſhould come acroſs his mind; —and he ſhould conſider, that inſtead of being the protector of his daughter, he had been her tyrant, perhaps her murderer.'</p>
               <p>(Tears here ſtole down the cheeks of the young Antoinette; ſhe called to mind the death of the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Killarney, and ſuſpicions aroſe in her mind, that her mother's words had been prophetic of the fate of the baron. She gave an expreſſive look at lady Arlington, who ſeemed to enter into what was paſſing in her mind, and nodded her aſſent to it. Lord Arlington obſerved them: 'Yes, doubtleſs,' he ſaid, 'it will hereafter appear, that the words of thy mother, my deareſt child, were prophetic;' and then he proceeded in his narration.)</p>
               <p>My Antoinette continued her ſtory thus: 'For a moment my father ſeemed deeply impreſſed with what I ſaid; but then haſtily ſnatching away his hand:'</p>
               <p>'No,' he ſaid, 'my honour is engaged to St. Pol, and cannot be recalled;—delay is impoſſible;—I am ſummoned to court;—I muſt ſet out for Paris to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;

—either this moment then repeat the oath, which I ſhall dictate, or a cloiſter ſhall receive you; from which, I repeat my words again, you never ſhall come out alive.'</p>
               <p>'Seeing him thus determined, and that neither arguments nor entreaties could more him, I found nothing remained for me, but to be equally decided. Well then, ſir,' I anſwered, 'Since ſuch is your cruel determination, hear mine;—You may make me miſerable, but my own lips ſhall never ſeal my miſery, by conſenting to a proſtitution which my ſoul abhors; —I am reſolved never to be the wife of St. Pol.</p>
               <p>'Never ſhall I forget the look which my father gave me;—it was a mixture of unutterable rage and aſtoniſhment;—of aſtoniſhment, to find ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in a female boſom;—and of rage, at finding himſelf thus thwarted in his favourite plan of aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing his family, for ſo he conſidered the miſery to which he would have doomed me.</p>
               <p>'He burſt from me, opened the door, then violently clapped it to again; — looked ſternly at me:'</p>
               <p>'And are you thus reſolved?' he ſaid, 'But take care, for if you now let me quit your appartment, without taking the oath which I demand, the world united cannot ſave you from my juſt indignation.'.</p>
               <p>'I went up to him, took his hand, and was going to kiſs it, but he ſpurned me from him.'</p>
               <p>'I will not be thus fooled,' he ſaid, 'Take the oath this moment, or I am gone, and then—'</p>
               <p>'He pauſed, and looked for my reply.</p>
               <p>'I cannot, dare not, perjure myſelf:—Can my father wiſh that I ſhould?'</p>
               <p>'You will not take the oath then?'</p>
               <p>'I can never yield to be the wife of St. Pol;—Yet hear me, oh! my father!</p>
               <p>'I caught hold of his coat; he flung me from him, ſo that I fell on the floor; he then burſt open the door, went furiouſly out of the room, and locked it after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:038283_0179_1011965DE883C7C8"/>'I lay for ſome minutes on the floor, almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe or recollection; ſtunned ſcarcely leſs by the ferocity of my father, than by my fall. But the more I recollected myſelf, the more I was convinced of the folly I ſhould be guilty of, were I to give way to deſpondency, at an hour which called for the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exertion: that it was my duty, as well as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, not weakly to ſink under my troubles, but to endeavour to combat them; and that though others might oppreſs my body, my mind could never be conquered without my own conſent.</p>
               <p>'With theſe reflections I fortified my ſoul againſt the ſtorm, which I ſaw approaching, and riſing from the floor, began to arrange my concerns for a fate which ſeemed inevitable.</p>
               <p>'In about half an hour my father returned to me, attended by two of the ſervants.'</p>
               <p>'Take her,' he ſaid to them, 'and carry her to the coach.'</p>
               <p>'It is unneceſſary to uſe force,' I ſaid, 'I ſhall make no reſiſtance.— I walked down ſtairs with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, and ſeated myſelf in the coach, into which my father alſo got, and we drove hither. Not a word paſſed between us on the way;—my father ſeemed much agitated, but he never once looked at me.</p>
               <p>'When we arrived here, we were immediately ſhewn into the parlour, which we found empty. My father then looked full in my face, for the firſt time ſince our leaving the cheateau, and taking me by the hand.'</p>
               <p>'Antoinette,' ſaid he, ''Tis not yet too late; but this moment muſt ſeal your doom;—the oath;—you may ſtill ſave yourſelf.'</p>
               <p>'Not at that price;—Would my father have me ſeal my own damnation?'</p>
               <p>'Oh! invincible obſtinacy!' he exclaimed; 'Then here it muſt end.'</p>
               <p>'So ſaying, he ruſhed out of the room, and I ſaw
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:038283_0180_10119661AED12F08"/>
no more of him; nor did I ſee any one elſe for about an hour, when, to my ſurpriſe, he again entered the room.'</p>
               <p>'You are reſolved then, Antoinette,' he ſaid, 'to be immured here for life?'</p>
               <p>'I am reſolved never to marry the count de St. Pol.'</p>
               <p>'Good heavens!' he ſaid, 'Could I have thought it?'—He turned towards the door; he looked at me again;—'I am going, Antoinette,' he ſaid.</p>
               <p>'And, cannot I recal you, my father!'</p>
               <p>'Yes, Antoinette, there is one way, and only one;—my honour is pledged, and that I cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.'</p>
               <p>'Nor can I ever wed as you deſire.'</p>
               <p>'Good God! Good God!' he cried, and went out of the room violently agitated; and in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes I heard the coach drive off.</p>
               <p>'I was immediately put under the care of one of the ſuperiors, who has orders never to leave me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when I come here to confeſſion;—but ſhe is kind to me, and really ſeems to compaſſionate my ſituation. I am not permitted to ſee any one, and, at the expiration of a year, orders are given by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I ſhould take the veil.'</p>
               <p>Such was the relation given me by Antoinette, of the conteſts which ſhe had had with the baron, and the baron with himſelf; in which it ſeemed apparent, that the latter had ſuffered falſe notions of honour, at laſt to overcome paternal affection, though that had maintained the conteſt to the laſt moment; and it was even probable, that the baron himſelf was ſcarcely leſs a ſufferer from the conflict, than the victim of his perſecution. I then imparted to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, how much I had been urged by my father to return to Ireland, as ſoon as ever, by the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath of poor mr. Lewſon, I ſhould be releaſed from my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him; for he earneſtly wiſhed me to reach Ireland againſt the time when I was to come of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:038283_0181_10119663B6C57048"/>She begged me earneſtly not to let my attachment to her interfere with this wiſh of my father's, and urged me to ſet out immediately on my return, and leave her to her fate.</p>
               <p>'How can my Antoinette,' I ſaid, 'ſuppoſe that I could deſert her at a moment like the preſent? But I would ſuggeſt a plan, which I hope would make us mutually happy, and end our troubles at once.'</p>
               <p>'And, how can that be?' ſhe aſked eagerly.</p>
               <p>I then ventured to ſuggeſt to her the poſſibility of our being privately married in Anſelm's cell; and that by his aſſiſtance alſo, I thought it poſſible that we might accompliſh her eſcape from her convent, when ſhe might accompany me to Ireland, where ſhe would be under the protection of my father and myſelf; and as to my father, I doubted not of obtaining his ready forgiveneſs for the ſtep I had taken.</p>
               <p>She pauſed and heſitated what anſwer to make to my propoſal, and at laſt ſaid, 'She could not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what to do, but bade me meet her again in three days at Anſelm's cell, by which time ſhe would have taken her reſolution, and if it ſhould be to comply with my wiſhes, the ceremony ſhould at that time be performed; but bade me not be too ſanguine in my hopes; that even when united, our troubles would not be at an end, for ſhe ſaw nothing but rocks and ſhoals around us, on ſome of which it was ſcarcely poſſible but that we ſhould ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t.' We then took our leave of each other for that time, as ſhe ſaid ſhe did not dare ſtay any longer, and after agreeing with Anſelm that we ſhould meet again in three days, ſhe retired to her room, and I returned with Clement to my inn.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of the term agreed on, Clement and I haſtened to the place of appointment, where I had not been arrived many minutes, before Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette appeared, accompanied by the ſuperior, to whoſe care ſhe was entruſted. I ſtarted on ſeeing another perſon enter with her, but ſhe ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:038283_0182_1011966AC55A9718"/>'Do not be alarmed, my Theodore, the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Marianne has entered warmly into our cauſe, and will promote the ſucceſs of our ſchemes to the utmoſt of her power. I come now in the preſence of her, and father Clement, to receive your faith, and to pledge mine to you.—Haſte, Anſelm, perform the ceremony, let me not have more time for reflection.'</p>
               <p>The holy man pronounced the proper vows and bleſſings, and in a ſhort ſpace of time I was bleſſed with the delightful reflection, that Antoinette was my wife. She told me to remain with Anſelm, and at night Marianne ſhould conduct me to her apartment, and then hurried away, almoſt overcome with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of feelings which agitated her ſoul. To myſelf, I can hardly deſcribe my ſenſations.—One moment all other ideas were abſorbed in the happineſs I felt at being united to Antoinette;—the next moment I was almoſt weighed down with anxiety, at looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the many dangers and difficulties we might have to encounter, before we could really enjoy the poſſeſſion of each other.</p>
               <p>In theſe alternate hopes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ears, I ſpent my time, 'till the arrival of Marianne, under whoſe conduct I arrived ſafely, by various turnings and windings, at Antoinette's apartment, and returned by the ſame means to Anſelm's cell the next morning, from whence I departed undiſcovered to my inn, after he had opened to me a plan, which Marianne and he had been concerting, for Antoinette's eſcape, in which Marianne meant to accompany her, as ſhe ardently ſighed to quit her monaſtic life; and this project, he ſaid, he hoped would be more matured, when I ſhould return in the evening, which he allowed me to do.</p>
               <p>In the evening, then, he imparted to me the whole plan which they had concerted, and which was to be carried into execution in three nights from that time. I paſſed the night again in Antoinette's apartment, when we agreed to meet no more, 'till ſhe was without the walls of the convent. Every thing was ſettled

with Anſelm, before I departed in the morning, and a place was agreed on, where I was to attend with a chaiſe, on the night appointed, from whence we were to proceed, with all poſſible expedition, to Marſeilles, and there take ſhipping on board any veſſel we could find, which would convey us to a place of ſafety.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, and thoſe only, who have been in a like ſituation, can form an idea of my feelings, during the painful interval of ſuſpenſe, between the ſettling of this ſcheme, and the time of action. Oh! How truly did I feel the force of the great poet's obſervation, <q>

               <p>Only ſix hours were remaining to the appointed time of my meeting with Antoinette, when Clement came to me, and with a voice and countenance, which ſufficiently ſpake the intereſt he took in the melancholy news, of which he was the bearer, told me, that Anſelm had that morning been found dead in his cell. Of this event a vague rumour had reached his (Clement's) ears, which cauſed him to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the convent to inform himſelf, whether it were true or not, when he received a full and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly conviction, that the rumour he had heard was founded in fact. He had obtained a moment's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with Marianne, who had only time to tell him, that in conſequence of this event, all thoughts of their flight from the convent, muſt for the preſent be at an end, and that Antoinette would, if poſſible, convey a letter to me in a day or two; and, in the mean time, ſhe charged me, as I valued our mutual ſafety, not to attempt coming to the convent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:038283_0184_1011966F21593B40"/>Thus, in one dreadful moment, was the cup of joy and tranſport, which I had been flattering myſelf with the idea of draining to the bottom, at once daſhed from my lips, and I was left a prey to the moſt horrible apprehenſions for her, whom my ſoul doted on to ſuch exceſs.—But let me not think of it:—I really was half frantic, and, I believe, that nothing but the kind and friendly attentions I received from Clement, preſerved to me any portion of my ſenſes. He promiſed to do every thing in his power to aſſiſt us, and bade me hope that this delay, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dreadful it appeared, would prove only a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary diſappointment; and he promiſed to go the next day to the convent, and collect for me, if poſſible, ſome new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Three days, however, elapſed, during which time he conſtantly hovered about the convent, before he could bring me any intelligence of her. But on the third day the porter of the convent told him he was wanted in the parlour, whither he accordingly went, and found Marianne there, who put a letter into his hand, and bade him be gone again directly.</p>
               <p>He loſt no time in bringing the letter to me, which I opened and read with as much eagerneſs as the parched traveller feels, when he ſpies a lonely ſhell with one ſingle drop of water ſtanding in its cavity. It contained many aſſurances of her affection, and lamentations for our late diſappointment; but ſhe earneſtly entreated me not to think any more, at that time, of her eſcape, for it was then a matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.

A thouſand times was I on the point of diſcloſing the whole affair of my marriage to my father, but the ſecrecy enjoined me by my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, as often with-held my tongue.

               <p>At length, after ſix months ſpent in moſt dreadful ſuſpenſe, a letter arrived from my Antoinette, which brought me the pleaſing intelligence, that by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:038283_0187_10119679A01011A0"/>
of her brother, the chevalier de St. Foix, a plan was formed for her eſcape from the convent, which was to be carried into execution in the courſe of a few days, from the time of her writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that the chevalier would conduct her to Ireland, where he would ſtay 'till he heard the event of the baron's being made acquainted with their proceedings. Still ſhe wiſhed that the affair ſhould be kept ſecret from my father, 'till her arrival in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which ſhe hoped would be in about a month.</p>
               <p>She told me too, that various plans had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her eſcape, but obſtacles had occurred, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their execution; and hinted the additional anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhe felt to get away from the convent, on account of her own ſituation, which made her ſtay in it every day more and more unſafe for her. There were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions alſo to a former letter which ſhe had written to me, and to two letters from Clement, none of which, as I have already ſaid, I had ever received.</p>
               <p>My anxiety for my Antoinette was not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by this letter; I had ſtill every thing to fear for her, and yet it was impoſſible for me to attempt going to her aſſiſtance; I was vexed and fretted too, at her continuing her injunctions of ſecrecy, for it placed me in a moſt painful ſituation with regard to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom I earneſtly wiſhed to lay open my heart; but as Antoinette deſired me to be ſecret, I was determined to be ſo at all hazards.</p>
               <p>If the firſt ſix months, however, had been a ſtare of dreadful anxiety to me, judge what I muſt have ſuffered, when near ſix months longer elapſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my hearing any thing farther of the object, for whom all this anxiety was ſuffered. You know too well, my dear Horatia, to what extremities matters were brought between me and my father;—a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times had my ſecret been ready to burſt from my lips, but as often did I revolt from a diſcloſure, which I found I had every reaſon to dread. I, however, certainly ſhould have told all to my father, at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

when he had paſſed the dreadful ſentence on me, 'That I ſhould conſent in three days to wed as he deſired me, or be baniſhed his preſence for ever:' had he not gone ſo haſtily out of the room, that he left me no time to collect my ſpirits for the painful communication, and all my thoughts of that communication were immediately after put an end to by the events that followed.</p>
               <p>My father had not quitted the room more than five minutes, when a ſervant came and informed me, that a woman deſired to ſpeak to me in private I ordered her to be ſhewn to my own room, whither I immediately went myſelf, when the woman told me that ſhe brought me melancholy news of my Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette: but as the ſtory was long, ſhe hoped I would excuſe her imparting it to me then, but begged me to meet her at an inn ſhe named at Killarney. I would have accompanied her thither, but ſhe ſaid, 'It is better that we ſhould not go together.' She therefore departed, by herſelf, and I ſet out in a few minutes after, taking a different route from that which ſhe had purſued.</p>
               <p>When I arrived at the place of appointment, ſhe conducted me into a parlour, where ſate the miſtreſs of the inn, with a child in her arms.

               <p>'Behold, ſir,' ſhe ſaid, 'the dying preſent of your dear Antoinette!—She charged me to deliver this infant, and this packet, into your own hands, and here I diſcharge my truſt.'</p>
               <p>She then burſt into a torrent of tears;—I preſſed the infant to my breaſt, and fell back in my chair al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſenſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington roſe up from his ſeat;—he walked
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:038283_0189_1011967E449606C8"/>
up and down the room for a few minutes, violently agitated, then ſat down again.</p>
               <p>'Excuſe me,' he ſaid, 'I cannot dwell on this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Thoſe papers, ſir,' ſhe replied, 'contain it as far as the departed angel could tell of it;—what is wanting there I will ſupply.'</p>
               <p>I opened the packet, which contained a detail from Antoinette, of the events that had happened to her ſince her laſt letter to me, which was in ſubſtance as follows:</p>
               <p>She got ſafe from the convent at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her brother, but was unfortunately, at laſt, obliged to leave Marianne behind, for only two days before that appointed for their departure, ſhe had broken her leg by a fall, which made her flight, at that time, impoſſible; and as it was equally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Antoinette to delay her departure, ſhe was obliged to eſcape by herſelf. She found her brother in waiting for her with a chaiſe, about a quarter of a mile from the convent, and they got to Marſeilles without meeting any interruption. They there agreed for their paſſage in a ſhip, which was to ſail for Liſbon next morning; but in the evening, as they were get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the boat which conveyed them to the ſhip itſelf, another boat which they had perceived to put off from the ſhore very ſoon after theirs, came up, and four men from it jumped into their boat, and ſeized on the chevalier and Antoinette, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that they were their priſoners.</p>
               <p>The chevalier attempted to make ſome reſiſtance, in which he was ſeconded by the men belonging to his own boat, and a ſevere ſcuffle enſued, in which the brave, but unfortunate chevalier was pierced through the breaſt, by the ſword of one of the aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, when he ſtaggered againſt the ſide of the boat, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:038283_0190_1011967FD3094A80"/>'Good God!' exclaimed Marſini, 'And was ſuch the fate of the moſt amiable of men?—I had always underſtood that he was killed in a duel.'</p>
               <p>'So it was reported,' ſaid lord Arlington, 'but the fact is as I relate to you; he fell a ſacrifice to fraternal affection, which, from the account given me of him, by my poor Antoinette, he carried to a height far exceeding the uſual level of that amiable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, ſhe told you truly!' ſaid Marſini; 'But I beg your lordſhip's pardon for this interruption.— Pray go on.'</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington proceeded.—This dreadful diſaſter caſt ſuch a damp over the minds of every one, that no farther reſiſtance was made, and Antoinette was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off by the ruffians; who, without regard to any thing but their orders, hurried her away, nor ſtopped 'till they had depoſited her ſafe in the chateau de St. Foix, where ſhe was doomed to meet alone, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended, the frowns and menaces of an enraged father, to mourn the untimely fate of a brother, whom ſhe doted on, and who had fallen in her ſervice;—and to reflect on the dreadful ſituation to which an infant, ſhe was likely ſoon to bring into the world, would be expoſed.</p>
               <p>An unfortunate circumſtance had attended the flight of Antoinette, which ſhe could not foreſee or prepare againſt. The baron, whom ſhe believed ſtill at Paris, nor likely for ſome time to return to the chateau, had ſuddenly arrived there the evening of her flight. He knew that his ſon had been for ſome time returned from Italy, and had been reſident at the chateau, and he therefore inquired for him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on his arrival there, when he was told that he had gone that morning to the convent, to ſee his ſiſter, and he perhaps would not return for two or three days.</p>
               <p>As the baron was really anxious to ſee his ſon, who had ſo long been abſent from him, he reſolved
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038283_0191_10119684F305DFD8"/>
to go very early next morning to the convent, where he did not doubt but he ſhould meet with him, and where he ſhould alſo ſee his daughter, and find what temper ſhe was in, after ſome months of confinement. He, accordingly, ſet off, and arrived at the convent juſt after the firſt alarm had been ſpread, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette was miſſing; and juſt as intelligence arrived, from two ſcouts who had been ſent out to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, that a chaiſe had been ſeen going in great haſte the road to Marſeilles, which was ſuppoſed to contain the fugitives. The baron therefore loſt no time in ſending four men after them, who ſucceeded in their errand but too well.</p>
               <p>Antoinette was all aſtoniſhment when ſhe beheld her father, whom ſhe ſuppoſed to have been at that moment ſo many miles off. He approached her with eyes ſparkling with rage, and vented the moſt bitter reproaches againſt her;—but ſoon after, his reproaches were changed into expreſſions of the moſt poignant affliction for the death of his ſon, who was, he ſaid, the only ſupport in a direct line of his ancient houſe, and his titles and eſtates would now go to a collateral branch, twenty degrees removed from himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus, in alternate reproaches and bewailings, he gave vent to his feelings, 'till, at laſt, he ordered An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette to her chamber, and told her to prepare her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for returning, in a few days, to the convent.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' ſaid Antoinette firmly, 'I will prepare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to return thither, and ſhall go with the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs concern, as I know my captivity cannot be of long duration, for the grave will ſoon releaſe me from it.'</p>
               <p>The baron looked ſternly at her; 'Yes,' ſaid he, 'That is the common cant of your ſex, when they are thwarted in their perverſe inclinations; but I am not to be ſo fooled; but 'tis in your own power, madam, to ſhorten your captivity as much as you pleaſe; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to marry St. Pol, and it is at an end; otherwiſe, at the end of the year you take the veil.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:038283_0192_10119686D7698F90"/>'And I would rather,' ſhe replied, 'take the veil, than conſent to ſo deteſted an union.'</p>
               <p>She was then conducted to her chamber, and a ſervant, devoted to the baron, was ordered to attend her, and ſtrictly to guard her.</p>
               <p>In this confinement, however, ſhe was not abſolutely deſtitute of comfort. Joanna, daughter to the porter of the caſtle, was juſt then come on a viſit to her father. She had, by means of the baroneſs de St. Foix, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a much better education than young women in her ſituation uſually obtain, and being but little older than Antoinette, had been much her companion; 'till Joanna, when ſhe was about ſeventeen, went to live with a relation, who was in a very profitable branch of trade at Lyons, where ſhe married a young man in the ſame line of buſineſs as her uncle, but who died about a year after their marriage, and left her with a very fine boy, and it was not more than three months from the death of her huſband, that ſhe, with her child, came to the chateau de St. Foix, to viſit her father.</p>
               <p>She well knew the unfortunate ſituation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, and when ſhe found that ſhe was to be kept in ſuch ſtrict confinement at the chateau, ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, at the hazard of the baron's anger, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter all the conſolation to her that was in her power, for ſhe was a young woman of more than common ſpirit and reſolution, and whoſe affection for Antoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette was ſuch, that nothing ſeemed formidable to her, when ſhe thought ſhe could render her any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as the ſequel of my ſtory will ſhew. This young woman's attentions alleviated the confinement of Antoinette, while ſhe remained at the chateau, and when ſhe was carried back to the convent, which was in about ten days, ſhe promiſed often to come and viſit her.</p>
               <p>But all this time, the baron never appeared to have any ſuſpicion of his daughter's ſituation: he, indeed, ſaw her but ſeldom, and when he did ſee her, he was
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:038283_0193_1011968DB65A98B8"/>
always much more occupied in bewailing the loſs of his ſon, than in attending to her. He ſeveral times mentioned the match with St. Pol; but ſhe as conſtantly refuſed to hear any thing he had to ſay on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. When he talked of carrying her back to the convent, ſhe preſſed him to let her continue at the chateau for the ſhort remainder of her days, offering to give him her ſolemn aſſurance not to attempt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping from thence.</p>
               <p>He ridiculed the idea of her not living much longer; —ſaid that the ruddy hue of her cheeks did not look as if her end was very near; miſtaking the hectic fluſh of fever, for the florid bloom of health; and as to her promiſes, he ſaid, he knew very well how far a woman's word was to be taken; and that, as he was obliged to return again to Paris very ſoon, he ſhould chooſe to place her where he knew ſhe would be moſt effectually ſecured, and he ſhould take care that ſhe ſhould not have it in her power to eſcape again from the convent.</p>
               <p>Theſe cruel taunts wounded poor Antoinette even more deeply than all the other cruelties her father had exerciſed towards her. She plainly perceived that her health was daily declining, from the fatigues of body and anxiety of mind which ſhe had undergone, and only dreaded, that ſhe ſhould not live to bring her infant into the world. With emphatic expreſſions of theſe feelings; with the warmeſt expreſſions of her regard for me; with ardent wiſhes for my happineſs, and an anxious recommendation of her child, if it ſhould live to come into my hands, to my love and protection, ſhe cloſed the intereſting narrative ſhe ſent me, which Joanna then purſued to the following effect.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington's voice had ſeveral times been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt choaked with ſtifled agony, while he went through this affecting recital; but the moſt diſtreſſing part ſtill remained untold.—He pauſed;—he wiped away tears which he could no longer repreſs, and, at
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038283_0194_101196920CE0E000"/>
length, proceeded thus, ſpeaking in the perſon of Joanna, by whom the latter part of Antoinette's ſtory was related to him.</p>
               <p>I had frequently viſited Antoinette at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: for the abbeſs, more ſenſible to the alarming ſtate of her health, than the baron, was deſirous of affording her every poſſible comfort, and, therefore, allowed me to have free acceſs to her. She had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten talked to me of the perſecution ſhe had received from her father on St. Pol's account, and appeared as if there was more ſhe wiſhed to ſay to me, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to herſelf, but that ſhe hardly knew how to give it utterance. At laſt, one day, when I found her particularly ill and dejected, I preſſed her much to unboſom herſelf entirely to me, as I ſaw there was ſomething ſat heavy on her mind, which it would be a relief to her to diſcloſe; indeed, from her appearance, I had no difficulty to gueſs, in part, the ſecret which ſhe ſeemed hardly to have power to diſcloſe. She ſighed and heſitated what anſwer ſhe ſhould make, but at length, ſaid,</p>
               <p>'My dear Joanna, you aſk for a ſtory which I have ſcarcely power to relate; but I have received ſuch kind attention from you, as encourages me not only to tell my ſtory, but to communicate a requeſt which I have for a long time ardently wiſhed to make to you;—the boldeſt, ſure, that ever was made, but which I have reaſon to believe your reſolution, and ſtrong affection for me, will induce you to comply with.'</p>
               <p>She then related to me all the particulars of her connection with you, and concluded with ſaying,</p>
               <p>'I feel, Joanna, that it is impoſſible I ſhould ſurvive my approaching confinement; can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to take my child under your protection as ſoon as it is born, and if I ſhould die, to carry it to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and place it in the arms of its father?'</p>
               <p>To this requeſt I yielded a ready, a hearty aſſent; for the dangers of the undertaking ſeemed nothing to
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:038283_0195_101196939969B108"/>
me, when it was to gratify the wiſh of Antoinette<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never ſhall I forget the tranſports which ſparkled in her eyes, at the aſſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I had given.</p>
               <p>''Tis vain,' ſhe ſaid, 'my deareſt Joanna, for me to attempt to thank you: How poor are words, to expreſs my obligations to you, or the gratitude I feel for them?—the heart, which, like your's, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of performing ſuch an action as you have undertaken, can alone feel what is due to it for the action it performs: nor would I diſgrace you by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the common effuſions of a grateful mind.'</p>
               <p>She gave me many directions concerning the child, and ſaid, 'that ſhe had expreſſed her wiſhes with regard to it, very fully, in her letters to her huſband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhe ſhould give me to carry with the child.' She often too, after this, talked to me of her huſband, mentioning him with the moſt ardent expreſſions of affection, and regretting all the uneaſineſs which ſhe had occaſioned him.—'He was happy,' ſhe would ſay, ''till he knew me: would to heaven he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known me!'</p>
               <p>At length the moment arrived, when in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence only of Marianne, myſelf, and a ſurgeon, whom we had privately engaged for the purpoſe, this ſweet infant came into the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antoinette ſurvived her delivery, but it ſeemed ſcarcely poſſible that ſhe ſhould ſurvive it for many hours; a rapid conſumption had preyed upon her for ſome weeks, under which ſhe was apparently ſinking. She called me to her bedſide; I had the child in my arms;</p>
               <p>'Let me give her one kiſs,' ſhe ſaid, 'It is the firſt and the laſt ſhe will ever receive from her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate mother.—Take her, Joanna, take her to my Theodore, place her in his arms, and tell him 'tis the dying gift of one who fondly and faithfully loved him, and who will bleſs him with her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ateſt breath.'</p>
               <p>I took the child; I was ſo wounded in my heart, that I could not bid the mother farewel, although I was convinced that I ſhould never ſee her more; I
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:038283_0196_10119696E58B7B10"/>
wrapped the child carefully in my cloak, and having lulled her to ſleep, conveyed her away unobſerved from the convent.</p>
               <p>I carried her to my father's houſe, and I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that as my own child was perfectly healthy, and did not want my nurſing, I would transfer that nouriſhment from him, to the infant Antoinette, for ſo I called the child, after her mother; and the next day I went to the convent, where I learnt, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette had expired about an hour before my arrival there: but I did not ſee Marianne.</p>
               <p>I now began to plan all things for my intended journey. I told my father and mother what I had undertaken, and deſired them to carry my child to my uncle at Lyons, who had often ſaid he would adopt him as his ſon. They thought me raſh, but if any thing could excuſe it, they ſaid certainly the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they had to Antoinette would. My journey was haſtened too, by a rumour which came that very day to the chateau, that the baron would be there in a day or two; and I thought it would be highly imprudent in me to delay my departure 'till after his arrival.</p>
               <p>I accordingly ſet out two days after the death of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, and arrived ſafely at Marſeilles, where I had a couſin, who was maſter of a ſhip in the Liſbon trade, and by his means I got a paſſage on board that ſhip, which conveyed us to Liſbon, and by means of my couſin's connexions there, I was recommended to a captain of a ſhip, bound from Liſbon to Cork, at which place I arrived two days ſince; and, according to the directions which I received from Antoinette, came on to Killarney, and have thus, I hope, faithfully diſcharged the ſacred truſt which ſhe committed to me.</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington had, with difficulty, got through the latter part of this narrative;—he now got up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> —'Oh! Excuſe me,' he ſaid, he went out of the room;—it was ſome time before he returned. On entering again, he ſaid, 'I am aſhamed of myſelf, but I will go on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>'</p>

               <p>MY attention was now turned entirely to conſidering what courſe I had beſt purſue, with regard to my dear infant, and to the union which my father was ſo earneſt to accompliſh. At length I reſolved to comply with him, and for the preſent to keep my child in concealment. Joanna promiſed me to ſtay with her at leaſt as long as ſhe wanted a nurſe, and I therefore looked out for a ſituation for them, and ſoon engaged mrs. Roberts to take them. How many tears did—no, why tell my folly?—At the end of the time my father had allowed me to conſider of the point he had urged, I declared to him my readineſs to obey his commands, and ſoon after was united to one, with whom I ought to have been happy.—But no more of that.</p>
               <p>The letter which occaſioned my abrupt departure from you, my Horatia, and which you ſo well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my receiving, was to the following effect, as near as I can recollect.</p>

                     <p>'You have been cruelly deceived, ſir, in ſuppoſing your Antoinette to be no more; ſhe is now alive, and in the convent, where you left her.

I have an unexpected chance of ſending you this letter. I wiſh Antoinette could avail herſelf of it, to ſend one alſo, but that is impoſſible. I hope this will reach you ſafe, and that you will immediately haſten to the reſcue of your beloved Antoinette, and of your ſincere friend,</p>

               <p>'Good God!' I exclaimed, when I got out of the houſe, 'And is this greateſt of miſeries reſerved for me?—Am I then the huſband of two wives?'</p>
               <p>I flew to Killarney, to mrs. Roberts's houſe, and enquired of Joanna, whether it was ſhe who had brought the letter to me? and by what means it had come to her?—She told me that it came encloſed in a parcel to her from her father; and that as ſhe knew I was to leave Arlington caſtle the next morning, ſhe immediately carried it there for me, never ſuſpecting what the contents might be.</p>
               <p>I immediately reſolved to ſet out without delay for the convent, that I might ſatisfy myſelf of the truth or falſehood of what had thus been communicated to me; for I could not bear the idea of remaining for a moment with my ſecond wife, while there was a poſſibility that my firſt might be yet alive. When I declared my deſign to Joanna, ſhe ſaid, 'She wiſhed I would find ſome means of diſpoſing of my child, and let her accompany me, as ſhe was deſirous of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her own child and country.'</p>
               <p>This requeſt was too reaſonable for me to heſitate a moment about complying with; it was one which indeed I could not refuſe; my only difficulty was, how to diſpoſe of my Antoinette. I revolved many plans in my mind, and at laſt determined on that which I executed; and having written my letter, and given my directions to mrs. Roberts, Joanna and I ſet off for Limerick, where we got on board a veſſel bound for Bilboa, front whence we determined to croſs the Pyrenees into France.</p>

                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:038283_0199_1011978CAC4FD388"/>In the bay of Biſcay we were overtaken by a violent ſtorm, which drove us out of our courſe, and after encountering dreadful perils at ſea, we were at laſt wrecked on the coaſt of Portugal. We then made the beſt of our way to Liſbon, where we agreed for a paſſage to Marſeilles, on board a Liſbon ſhip; but after we had paſſed the ſtreights, we were overtaken by another ſtorm, more violent than that we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered in the bay of Biſcay, and which drove us towards the coaſt of Africa. Our ſhip rode it out for a conſiderable time, but at laſt the captain bid us all repair to the boats, for the ſhip could not hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for two hours longer. The boats were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hoiſted out, and as many of us as could, got into them; but here I met with another diſaſter, which rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly almoſt made me think that there was a ſomething in myſelf, which was contagious to every one who had any concern with me, and that I and misfortune were ſo coupled together, that whoever was connected with the one, muſt inevitably expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the baneful influence of the other. As my faithful and friendly Joanna was deſcending from the ſhip, her foot miſſed its hold, ſhe fell into the ſea, and a vaſt billow in a moment ſwept her from our fight.</p>
               <p>We had not left the ſhip many minutes, before we plainly perceived her foundering, and in a ſhort time ſhe vaniſhed for ever. We got ſafe, however, to the coaſt of Africa, but there we all were made ſlaves by the Algerines. I had the good fortune, however, to fall into tolerable mild hands, ſo that I had, from the firſt, a proſpect, that I might, by induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, one day work out my freedom; and ſo, in fact, I did. After a ſervitude of ſeven years, I had, by care and prudent management, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſſed a ſum ſufficient to purchaſe my freedom, and procure myſelf a paſſage to Marſeilles: and this I managed too, without part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my gold watch, which I had the fortune to conceal at my firſt landing, and the loſs of which I ſhould have regretted, as much as one who had ſo

many deeper cauſes of ſorrow, could have regretted a bauble.</p>
               <p>I no ſooner found myſelf again on French ground, than I haſtened to the chateau de St. Foix, in order to ſeek out the father of Joanna; but I met him ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling about, looking very melancholy, before I reached the chateau. He knew me the moment he caſt his eyes on me, and lifting up his hands and eyes, thanked heaven that he had ſeen me again, and eagerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for his daughter, whoſe ſad fate I related to him, cloathing it in as tender terms, as ſo ſorrowful a tale would admit of. He was deeply affected by it, but ſaid, at laſt, 'That it was more ſatisfactory to him to be certain of her fate, than to live on in the dreadful uncertainty about her, in which he had ſpent the laſt ſeven years.'</p>
               <p>I aſked him then, 'Whether the baron was at that time at the chateau?'</p>
               <p>'Alas! ſir,' he replied, 'the baron is in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſituation; deranged in his mind, I fear.'</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to tell me, that he had very lately ſold all his moveables, and as much of his eſtates as was in his power; and that the reſt of his eſtates he had conſigned over to his next heir, who was a diſtant relation; that he had then diſcharged all his ſervants, and went away himſelf by night, nor did any one know what was become of him; 'And thus, ſir,' ſaid the porter, 'I am thrown out of a place, where I had lived for ſo many years, and never failed in my duty, that I know of: to be ſure, it makes me a little heart broken; but thank God I am not ſtarving; I have enough, however, to live upon, and that is, at leaſt, ſome comfort.'</p>
               <p>I then mentioned to him the letter I had received, which reported Antoinette to be ſtill alive, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired how it came into his hands, as it was through him that it was tranſmitted to me. He ſaid, 'That he perfectly well remembered tranſmitting me a letter at the time I mentioned, and that it was brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'As to the death of Antoinette,' ſaid he, 'I never heard the truth of it doubted; but convents are ſtrange places, and we don't always know what is going forwards in them. But my maſter made a great ſtorming when he came here, and found that his daughter was buried at the convent; and he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to have the body removed to his own vault, in the chapel of the chateau; but however, he never had it done:—but to be ſure, his lordſhip was very ſtrange then, and ſo he was from that time 'till he went away; but at firſt he was all anger, and there was no ſuch thing as pleaſing him, and he would ſwear and ſtorm for nothing almoſt:—but then, all on a ſudden he grew mild and melancholy, and was always moping about;—and then he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſed to go for ever to the convent, and would come home with his eyes ſwelled with crying; and it's my opinion now, that he is gone on ſome penance.—But then,' ſaid the porter, ſtarting, 'to be ſure madame Antoinette muſt be dead, for my lord has put up a grand monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the chapel for her, and his other two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.—I could get you a ſight of it, if you like.'</p>
               <p>Though I by no means thought with the porter, that the erection of this monument was an indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof of the death of Antoinette, which from his whole ſtory ſeemed to me indeed to be very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet I wiſhed to ſee the monument he mentioned, and therefore accepted his offer. He then took me with him to his own houſe, and ſaid 'he would go and ſee how the land lay for getting to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as we could not go if monſieur de St. Foix was at home.' He preſently returned, and ſaid, 'that if I would accompany him, we might then ſee the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument.'</p>
               <p>We accordingly went:—it was indeed a beautiful

piece of ſculpture, but the inſcription on it was of ſo ſingular a nature, that it rather confirmed me in the idea, that Antoinette was ſtill alive, and was known by her father, to be ſo. On a ſarcophagus are three buſts, in white marble, of the chevalier and his two ſiſters: the chevalier in the middle, Gabrielle on the right hand, and Antoinette on the left; and below them is the following inſcription: <q>

               </p>
               <p>The body of the third is encloſed within the walls of St. Marguerite's convent!—What an equivocal kind of expreſſion! thought I within myſelf, as I read it, and I determined if poſſible to be better informed about the matter. I, therefore took my leave of the porter, and immediately ſet forwards for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
               <p>My firſt enquiries, when I arrived in its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:038283_0203_10119740148C8750"/>
were, for my worthy friend Clement; but I learnt that he had left the place a ſhort time before, without mentioning his intended departure to any one. I was then entirely at a loſs how to proceed: I would have applied to the lady abbeſs, but I thought that I ſhould hardly receive any ſatisfaction from her; and, if my Antoinette really was alive, and in the convent, enquiring of the lady abbeſs would put ſuſpicions into her head, which might tend to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate any plan, that might be formed for her eſcape.</p>
               <p>I continued to hover about the convent in a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim's garb, which I had procured at Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne, for the purpoſe of a diſguiſe, 'till I at laſt attracted the notice of the porter of the convent, who, like the generality of his profeſſion, was of a very talkative diſpoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</p>
               <p>He aſked me many queſtions relative to my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and from whence I came, and whither I was going; to all which I gave him rather evaſive anſwers, and afterwards drew him into converſation on the affairs of the convent, which he ſeemed very willing to communicate: and amongſt other things he told me, that they had had a very great buſtle in the convent, two or three weeks before, for one of the ſuperiors had eſcaped, and taken a young nun away with her.'</p>
               <p>I inſtantly caught at this ſtory, and inquired the names of the fugitives; he ſaid the old one was called Marianne, and the other, he believed Agnes; but he was not ſure of her name. He did not know how long either of them had been in the convent, for he had been there but two years, and they were both in before he came. I made particular enquiries, then, concerning the preciſe time of their flight, which the porter, after a little recollection, and tracing back a few circumſtances, and laying them together at laſt, fixed to a certain day, which he named to me. When I had made all the enquiries I wiſhed, I took my leave of the porter, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:038283_0204_10119742B40AD870"/>
that Agnes, as he called her, was my dear Antoinette, who had very likely changed her name, as it was common to do on taking the veil.</p>
               <p>I did not doubt, likewiſe, that Clement had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them; but I was determined to be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of that, by enquiring into the exact time when he diſappeared; which, by diligent inveſtigation, I at laſt made out to be the very time, when the two nuns eſcaped from the convent; and I had, therefore, no doubt remaining, that the three were all gone to Ireland, whither I was determined immediately to follow them.</p>
               <p>For a ſhort time joy, at receiving full conviction, as I thought I had done, that my Antoinette was yet alive, entirely ſuperſeded all other ſenſations in my boſom; but the dreadful reflection ſoon obtruded it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that if ſo, I had then, alas! two wives in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the ſame time; a thought that filled me with the deepeſt horror. I however reſolved, at all events, if poſſible, to find my Antoinette, and I accordingly travelled from the banks of the Rhone to Breſt, with almoſt incredible ſwiftneſs, conſidering that I went every ſtep of the way on foot, preferring that mode of travelling, as that, in which I could beſt be concealed, and for which my pilgrim's dreſs was well ſuited. When I arrived at Breſt, the weather being remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fine, I got on board an open fiſhing boat, in which I was ſafely conveyed to Cork, where I was no ſooner landed, than in ſpite of all my fatigues, I proceeded onwards, nor ſtopped 'till I arrived at the public houſe juſt by the entrance of the grounds belonging to Arlington caſtle.</p>
               <p>I cannot, by deſcription, give any idea of the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which agitated my ſoul, when I came within ſight of the manſion, which I had ſo ſtrangely left many years before. I was well convinced that I ſhould now again, in a few hours, behold my long loſt Antoinette: but alas! in what a ſituation was I to ſee her?—nor was that the only uncomfortable
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:038283_0205_10119744A58587A0"/>
ſenſation I felt; for I not only was to meet my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette as the huſband of another, but I was to meet the averted looks of a juſtly incenſed father, and of an injured wife?</p>
               <p>Such were my reflections;—but, alas! none of theſe things were to be encountered. On making en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, I found that the fugitives I was in ſearch of, whom I wiſhed, yet half dreaded to ſee, had never arrived in thoſe parts; that the father, whoſe anger I feared to encounter, was no more; and that my wife had left the caſtle half a year before, and was not likely to return to it for ſeveral years. I wiſhed however, to ſee the houſe; it was an odd kind of curioſity, but I knew not how to ſuppreſs it, nor can I give the leaſt reaſon for it. But, as I did not like to appear in my own character, or any one that I thought would lead them to ſuſpect who I was, I feigned myſeft to be diſordered in my mind.</p>
               <p>But it is needleſs to dwell on this part of my ſtory: you know my ſtrange behaviour, my Horatia, both at Arlington Caſtle, and at mr. Sidney's houſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I have often looked back with wonder at my conduct at that time, and been tempted to excuſe it to myſelf, by believing, that I really was what I feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf to be, diſordered in my ſenſes, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wounded to the ſoul, that I could not find the leaſt trace of Clement, Marianne, and Antoinette having being either in England or Ireland, and I was determined not to give up the purſuit of them, till I had either ſeen them, or arrived at ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainty with regard to them.</p>
               <p>Yet much I wiſhed to ſee my wife and children, and leave them ſome teſtimony that I was yet alive, and had not totally forgotten them. I, therefore, went to ſee my Henry at the place, where I had learned he was fixed for his education; and drawing from him that his mother and ſiſter had a houſe not far off, I went thither, in hopes of ſeeing them; but there I was diſappointed. I then went to London,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:038283_0206_10119749170A3D38"/>
in hopes of meeting with them there; but there too again I miſſed them; and I durſt not return into Hampſhire, for fear, after the alarm which I knew I muſt have raiſed there, I ſhould be in ſome manner ſecured, if I was to be ſeen there again; and I was firmly reſolved not to remain in England, or live with my Horatia, while a poſſibility re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ained, that I might have another wife alive; though, when I found the people I was in purſuit of, had never been in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or Ireland, I began much to doubt whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette could really be one of them, as I could not bear to think that ſhe would not, immediately on her emancipation, have endeavoured to find me out. Yet on the other ſide, ſhe might think, that ſhe had juſt cauſe of offence againſt me, as I muſt appear to her to have been very negligent, when ſo many years had elapſed ſince the time of the letter being ſent to me, which announced her being ſtill alive, without her hearing or ſeeing any thing of me. All theſe doubts, however, only made me more and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue the purſuit I was then engaged in; and, for that purpoſe, after a few weeks ſtay in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where I know I could be concealed, I once more croſſed the ſeas, and for the third time in my life, landed in the kingdom of France.</p>

               <p>BUT when I was landed, I was utterly at a loſs what courſe to take, in order to accompliſh the end, which I was purſuing, and almoſt left it to fortune to decide my route.</p>
               <p>At length, without knowing why, I took the road to Paris, at which city I ſoon arrived; but when there, was quite as much at a loſs as ever, in what way I was to proceed, whether to ſtay there, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go on; and if I went on, which way to go. I was exhauſted with uneaſineſs and vexation. I felt, that I wanted ſomething, but I hardly knew what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day after day I wandered about the city, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do with myſelf, and hardly knowing which way I went: indeed, ſcarcely in my ſenſes. Often did I ſtand, with my eyes fixed for many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes together, on ſome perſon or thing, till ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rouſed me, and I perceived, with chagrin, what I had been doing.</p>
               <p>In one of theſe rambles, I wandered one morning into the Fauxbourg St. Antoine, where I was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtruck with finding myſelf under the walls of

the Baſtile. A thouſand occurrences, relative to that horrible dungeon, crowded themſelves in cunfuſion into my mind, and I voluntarily fixed my eyes on the mighty fabric; it was to me like the baſiliſk, and I was like the bird <q>
                     <l>Which when its eye</l>
                     <l>By the guileful ſnake's keen glances caught,</l>
                     <l>Flutters, and flutters round, and ſtill would fain</l>
                     <l>Avert by ſpeedy flight th' impending ſtroke;</l>
                     <l>Yet ſtill it looks, ſtill drinks the deadly bane,</l>
                     <l>'Till quite intoxicated by the draught,</l>
                     <l>It ſinks, and ſinks, and ſenſeleſs drops at laſt</l>
                     <l>Within the monſter's wide extended jaws.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So my eyes once attracted by the fabric of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, could not turn aſide from it:—there they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained immoveably fixed, till, like the poor bird, I dropped into the mouth of the fell monſter; for I was only rouſed from my lethargy, by finding my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeized on by two men, and without any ceremony hurried within the walls I had been contemplating, and given in charge to the governor, to be kept a cloſe priſoner, as a dangerous man to the ſtate.

               <p>Theſe, and various ſuch reflections, occupied me, and helped to wear away the diſmal ſolitude in which I found myſelf, and to compoſe my mind into a ſettled calm; that mind, which was the only comfort the ingenious malice of my perſecutors could not deprive me of, and which daily grew ſtronger and ſtronger, and enabled me, finally, to ſtruggle, through a ſtate of exiſtence, which I am convinced is the moſt irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome that a man can be placed in, that of total inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; for after having experienced the hardſhips of a ſlavery, which, though my maſter was a comparatively lenient one, was pretty ſevere, and thoſe of a ſolitary confinement, I heſitate not to affirm, that ſlavery is even leſs galling than the horrible vacuity experienced by thoſe, who were confined in that dungeon of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm to which I was condemned.</p>
               <p>After I had collected myſelf tolerably well, and brought my mind into a ſettled ſtate, I began to compoſe, both in proſe and in poetry; and it was a great amuſement to me to impreſs on my mind, and arrange into forms, the ideas, which preſented themſelves; and ſo much did I do in this way, that I have now a large collection of eſſays, poems, &amp;c. which I formed in my mind during that time, and have ſince put down on paper, which hereafter, Horatia, you may, perhaps, like to look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He firſt introduced himſelf to me one day, while I was eating my miſerable dinner: any thing alive was a cheering ſight to me, and I reſolved to cultivate an acquaintance with him, if it was poſſible. I threw a few crumbs on the floor of the cell; he at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated from them, but afterwards finding that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moleſted him, he advanced and nibbled at them; I can ſcarcely expreſs how much I was pleaſed to ſee him feeding before me; after running about the cell for a while, he at length went away, and I ſaw no more of him that day; but as I had watched him very narrowly, I ſaw whither he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and determined to court his company, by putting ſome crumbs near his hole the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I had my breakfaſt; this I accordingly did, and he ſoon came forth, and eat the morſels I had provided for him, and in return, ran about my cell for ſome time. I continued the ſame practice for ſeveral days, and he ſeemed every day to grow leſs and leſs ſhy of me; at laſt, by dint of conſtant encouragement, grew ſo very familiar that he very ſeldom left me.</p>
               <p>He would, ſometimes, run up my leg, and ſit and eat on my knee, or out of my hand, and then hide himſelf in my clothes, and ſleep there; nor can I expreſs how great an affection I contracted for him. I really was as anxious leſt he ſhould be diſcovered by the people who brought me my food, as if he had been a child; for I knew that if he was, I ſhould be deprived of his company, and perhaps have endured the painful ſenſation of ſeeing him killed before my face, for no other offence than becauſe he had amuſed my ſolitude. I however preſerved him ſafe through ſeveral 'hair breath eſcapes,' and at laſt brought him in ſafety away with me. But, poor

               <p>I was detained a priſoner there from that time, 'till about eighteen months ago, when an officer came one morning to me, and ſaid, 'the grand monarque had been graciouſly pleaſed to allow of my releaſe from captivity, provided I would conſent to quit the kingdom immediately, and to be guarded to the port from whence I was to embark.' I was rejoiced to regain my liberty on any terms, and immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented te the ſtipularions required.

               <p>On our arrival at Rochelle, I was immediately conſigned over to the care of the captain of a St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo ſhip, on board of which I was carried the ſame evening, and in two days after we ſet ſail.

                  <pb n="213" facs="unknown:038283_0212_1011975EF98386A8"/>I told him that my earneſt wiſh was to get to Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, for I was determined, at all hazards, to go again to St. Marguerite's convent, and by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate application to the lady abbeſs, get my doubts at once reſolved. But, as I did not like to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this deſign, I determined, if poſſible, to get to Liſbon, from whence I would take a paſſage once more to Marſeilles. On our arrival at St. Domingo, therefore, the captain, as the beſt means of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my plan, procured me a paſſage to the Portugueſe ſettlement of Rio Janeiro, on the coaſt of Brazil, at which place I ſhould have frequent opportunities of making my way to Liſbon.</p>
               <p>The captain, at my departure, truſted me with a ſum of money, and letters of credit on a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his at Liſbon, which would enable me to take up a ſufficient ſum to laſt me till I got b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I made many warm acknowledgments for this kindneſs, and at firſt indeed heſitated to accept it; for I thought it almoſt too great a confidence for him to repoſe in me, as I had ſtill many hazards to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and might not at laſt, arrive ſafe at home; in which caſe he would loſe all that his generoſity had entruſted to me. But he would hardly liſten to what I urged, telling me that he had the fulleſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that I ſhould repay him, if it was in my power; and even if he were certain that he ſhould loſe every farthing, he ſhould think himſelf criminal in a caſe like mine, to with-hold his aſſiſtance from me, from paltry motives of ſelf-intereſt. I own I parted from this man with regret, but we parted with a mutual agreement, to keep up a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if I ever arrived in Ireland, and that he would, if poſſible, one day come and viſit me there.</p>
               <p>I arrived at Rio Janeiro without any interruption,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:038283_0213_101197608C15DF40"/>
but there I was unfortunately detained a conſiderable time. One day as I ſat by the ſea-ſide, when it was pretty rough, and I ſaw ſeveral veſſels toſſed about by the waves, and labouring very hard, I was touched by the ſenſe of the dangers they were at that moment encountering; dangers which I had more than taſted, for I had even drank deeply of them; and I could not help running a parallel in my mind, between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſations felt at the contemplation of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ariſing from natural cauſes, and of thoſe ariſing from moral cauſes.</p>
               <p>At length I quitted Rio Janeiro, and after a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous voyage, arrived at Liſbon. But there I heard ſuch dreadful accounts of the depredations of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines in the Mediterranean, that I was reſolved not to run the hazard of falling again into their hands, and I, therefore, determined rather to traverſe Spain and croſs the Pyrenean mountains, although I muſt then run the hazard of going over a larger part of the French territories, than if I went by ſea to Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In return to my enquiries concerning the fate of Antoinette, ſhe told me, 'that ſhe died within a

few hours after the birth of her child: that before her death, but when ſhe found it was faſt approaching, ſhe deſired Marianne to communicate to her (the lady abbeſs) under a ſtrict injunction of ſecrecy, the ſtory of her marriage, and of the birth of her child, and to entreat her to come to her bedſide, for ſhe wiſhed to ſay ſomething to her before ſhe expired.</p>
               <p>'When I went to her, ſir,' continued the lady ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, ſhe begged my pardon earneſtly for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſince ſhe had been in the convent, which ſhe ſaid reflection had convinced her had been wrong;— ſhe told me how ſhe had diſpoſed of her child, and deſired, that when ſuch a time had elapſed, as was likely to have placed the child out of her father's reach, I would tell him the ſtory of her marriage, and of the birth and diſpoſal of her child; for me ſaid, ſhe was well convinced that her father had no idea either of her marriage, or of the ſituation ſhe was in, when ſhe laſt parted from him; and ſhe ended her diſcourſe with deſiring that ſhe might be buried in the convent. All that ſhe thus requeſted, ſir,' continued the abbeſs, 'I have punctually fulfilled. The baron came to the chateau about three weeks after the death of his daughter, when I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him her death, and what ſhe had on her death-bed deſired me to impart to him.</p>
               <p>'The baron was violently incenſed at hearing the ſtory, venting the moſt bitter execretions againſt that vile Iriſhman who had thus ſeduced his dauhter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I wiſh ſhe was here herſelf, to ſatisfy you, but ſhe has been gone from hence ſome years; and to you, ſir, I will own, that I did at laſt connive at her eſcape, and at her taking with her a beautiful

young nun, whoſe name was Agnes, and whoſe caſe I thought peculiarly hard.'</p>
               <p>Thus was I at laſt ſatisfied of the truth, with regard to an affair which had kept me in a continued ſtate of agitation, in a greater or leſs degree, for fifteen years. I inquired of the abbeſs, if Antoinette was buried in the convent, and ſhe told me, 'that her body was depoſited, according to her deſire, in the chapel of the convent; and,' ſaid the abbeſs, 'from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for her ſufferings, and a love for her virtues, I was tempted, at my own expence, to erect a ſmall monument to her memory.'</p>
               <p>When I heard the abbeſs mention this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I immediately deſired ſhe would let me ſee the monument, and drop a tear over it, with which requeſt ſhe inſtantly complied, and led me to the chapel. You already know what paſſed there; it is ſufficient therefore for me to ſay now, that I met with no interruption in my progreſs to Geneva, where I had not been long arrived, when as I was wandering about the town, I met with my worthy friend, Clement Seguin. I looked hard at him, and he did ſo at me; but I firſt ſpake; ſeventeen years, which was the time that had elapſed ſince we met, had not altered him ſo much as it had altered me, and I thought that I could not be miſtaken; therefore I ſaid, 'ſurely I ſee Clement Seguin.'</p>

to accompany me to Ireland, as their teſtimonies might be of importance to me in the ſuit which I had told them was impending. I wiſhed to have engaged them to ſettle in Ireland, but of that they would not give me any expectation; they ſaid they were happy in their own ſituation; their means, it was true, were ſmall, but they were contented with their ſituation, for they were free; 'And after the lives we have formerly led,' ſaid Clement, 'to be free is every thing; for, if freedom is ſweet to thoſe who have never known any other ſtate, how much more to us, who were, for ſo many years, held in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile bondage; in a bondage of the very worſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We conſulted about the beſt means of getting to Ireland, and, at laſt, agreed to go by land to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa; from thence to make a coaſting voyage to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona, then croſſing the kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon, to go to Bilboa, where we could take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for Ireland. This route, tedious in itſelf, has proved doubly ſo to us, for we have, in one way or other, met with endleſs delays; but, thanks to that power which rules the univerſe! we have at laſt got through them all; and now I ſhall think no more of ſlavery, impriſonment, or diſaſters, and look forward to ſuch ſcenes of happineſs, as in all human calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I cannot fail to taſte, ſurrounded as I am with numerous bleſſings; and enjoying, as I do, the firſt of all bleſſings, a heart perfectly at eaſe.</p>

was more fortunate, in being the object of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's averſion, than her ſiſter was in being his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite; for he never offered to make any objections to Gabrielle's following her own inclinations in the affair of marrying, but ſeemed to feel the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indifference as to what become of her; but poor Antoinette, whom he profeſſed to be extremely fond of, he did not ceaſe to perſecute, 'till her death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved her from his cruelties.'</p>
               <p>'Your remark is juſt,' ſaid lord Arlington: 'it was a fortunate circumſtance for any one connected with the baron, to be the object of his averſion; for, when once he had got ſuch a one removed from his ſight, his averſion ſubſided into indifference, and he neither thought nor cared more about them; but thoſe whom he loved, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Amen, amen!' ſaid lord Arlington, I ſay with all my heart: and I hope that the time is not very far diſtant, when we ſhall behold this ameliorated ſtate of mankind, in its meridian ſplendour; for the early rays of that ſun of reaſon, which will undoubtedly one day illume mankind, have already begun to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above the horizon, and we now behold them ſtruggling amidſt the ſurrounding vapours; in which, though they may meet with a long and obſtinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, their glory can never quite be obſcured; and we may be well aſſured that they will, in time, repel every oppoſition that can be made to them. 'Nor,' ſaid he, 'let any one preſume to ſay, that the female mind is incapable of the higheſt degree of cultivation and improvement; or, if any one ſhould dare advance ſuch a thing, I would ſay, 'look there, and ſilence him at once;' and he caſt a moſt affectinate look at lady Arlington.</p>
               <p>She bowed in acknowledgment to the compliment, and was proceeding to make ſome remarks on lord Arlington's ſtory, but he took her hand, and ſaid,</p>
               <p>'Tis a melancholy ſubject, my Horatia: let us, therefore, drop it, and henceforward baniſh melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly from amongſt us. But,' he added, 'one thing yet remains, to ſearch the papers left by the old her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, who, I think, we muſt all by this time ſuppoſe, will appear to have been the baron de St. Foix. Will you let us ſee them, Antoinette?'</p>

                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:038283_0220_10119776ABDD2BF8"/>Antoinette immediately produced them, and gave them to lord Arlington, deſiring him to look them over. Lord Arlington unfolded them, and read from the outward cover theſe words.</p>
               <p>"To you, oh! injured daughter of that child, whom I perſecuted to her grave, are theſe pages ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, by one whoſe crimes have not been more heinous, than his ſufferings have been grievous, by thy grand-father, Rene baron de S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The papers contained a particular detail of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the baron and his children; of the death of the chevalier, and of the misfortunes and death of Antoinette; with all the circumſtances of the baron's life, ſubſequent to thoſe events. But, as all that the former part of the narrative contained, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related, we ſhall not take it up 'till the time when the lady abbeſs communicated to him the death of his daughter. After expreſſing, in the moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic terms, his diſappointment and bitter regret, at the death of his ſon, which he conſidered as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of his family, the next heir to his eſtate and title being of ſo extremely remote a branch, he thus proceeded:</p>

               <p>"Theſe ſentiments were continually working in my mind; they followed me every where by day;— I brooded over them on my pillow at night; if I to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was walking about the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens very early one morning, having left my bed at that time, tired with a ſleepleſs night, and ſeeking, if I could, to walls away from myſelf, when I overheard two people in earneſt converſation, and looking round, ſaw that they were ſeated on a bench pretty near me. I approached them without their perceiving me, as their backs were turned towards me; and almoſt without knowing why I did it, I placed myſelf in a

               <p>"I found that one of them was the porter of the caſtle, and the other was the uncle of his daughter's huſband. The former was reading a letter to the latter; and from the letter, and their ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, I collected, that the porter's daughter had been entruſted with the care of my little grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, and was with her in Ireland, at a houſe not far from that in which Theodore lived with his father; and that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The conference of theſe two people ended in the porter's telling his companion, that he ſhould very ſoon ſend a parcel to his daughter in Ireland.</p>
               <p>"This was enough for me; I ſaw plainly how I could wound the object of my malice and revenge, in the moſt ſenſible part; and I immediately wrote that letter, which, as I have found ſince I have been in theſe parts, did even more miſchief than I could have dared to hope for; then diſguiſing myſelf like a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, I carried it to the porter, and told him it came from a perſon in the convent, who deſired that he would encloſe it to his daughter."</p>
               <p>Here lord Arlington, who was reading the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, pauſed.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" ſaid he, "Then abſence was not always a curb to the baron's reſentment; for, though I was far removed from him, I was not therefore at all leſs the object of his implacable perſecution.—But I beg pardon for this interruption;" and then he proceeded, and read as follows:</p>
               <p>"But the wickedneſs I had been guilty of was ſoon followed by the moſt poignant remorſe. Oh!
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:038283_0223_1011977F82082058"/>
never let the angry man hope to derive real ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the gratification of his diſtempered feelings; a momentary flaſh of ſomething like pleaſure which dazzles his mind, may glance like lightning over it; —but like lightning, while it excites admiration, it ſcorches; and when the flame that dazzled us is paſt, nought but anguiſh is left behind.</p>
               <p>Such was truly my caſe; conſcience ſoon ſpake to my ſoul; not in gentle whiſpers, but in the loudeſt thunder, that I was one of the blackeſt of villains; that the murder of my daughter was a deed of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, when compared with the more cruel ſtab, which I had now given her huſband; a ſtab, which would perhaps make him die a lingering death, in the moſt dreadful agonies. I grew hateful to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſolitude was a torment to me, and in ſociety I was reſtleſs and miſerable. I dreaded the approach of night, for my bed was hell itſelf to me. If wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried nature ever ſunk me into a ſlumber, hideous phantoms ſeemed to flit before my eyes:—ſometimes I ſaw Theodore writhing in torments, and the ghoſt of my Antoinette looking on, and upbraiding me for my cruelty:—when ſtarting, I woke with a hideous ſhriek. At other times, I thought the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was arrived, and I ſtood before the throne of my offended God, when my three children appeared as my accuſers; my ſon, with the blood ſtreaming from his wounded breaſt, and with dripping locks pointing to them, as the effects of my brutal rage;— and when I awoke, I could hardly believe that theſe objects were not really before my eyes. Shame alone prevented me from having ſomebody to ſleep in the room with me, for it was miſery to me to be thus left to myſelf. Nor were theſe phantoms always confined to my ſleeping moments for my imagination was ſometimes wrought up to ſo exquiſite a pitch, that I have fancied, as I ſat by myſelf, attempting to read, rather than reading, that I actually ſaw the form of Theodore before my eyes, pale, ghaſtly, and expiring
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:038283_0224_101197810DBC8678"/>
with grief; and have even ſummoned my ſervants, on the moſt trifling excuſe, that my imagination might be relieved with the ſight of ſome real object. Oh! my child! my child! May I not hope that theſe torments have, in ſome meaſure, atoned for my ſins; for hell cannot have greater torments than I then ſuffered.</p>
               <p>"Almoſt worn out with them at laſt, a ſudden thought one day flaſhed on my mind, that my miſery might be relieved by the performance of ſome exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary penance, which might appeaſe an angry deity; and from the moment that that idea firſt ſtruck me, I found it a kind of relief to my ſoul:—a relief which cannot appear ſurpriſing, when it is recollected, that the impreſſion of one new idea on my mind took it off, in a degree, from the old one, which had ſo long entirely abſorbed it; and every moment of interval from thinking on that ſubject, was to me a moment of comparative eaſe.</p>
               <p>"I was not long in determining, what the nature of my penance ſhould be, I reſolved to turn as much of my property, as was in my own power, into gold and jewels, which I intended to conſign over to the injured Theodore; and then reſigning my eſtate to my next heir, to ſeek a retreat in ſome lonely ſpot; where, by living on roots and water—by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplining my body, and practiſing all ſorts of auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I might hope to gain a pardon for my ſoul.</p>
               <p>"I immediately ſettled all theſe affairs; I ſent the deeds of my eſtate to the perſon who was to inherit it, with notice, that at ſuch a certain time, he might take poſſeſſion of the chateau; and ſent round to my tenants, to notify to them, that they were from that time to conſider him as their lord.</p>
               <p>"I then went to Paris, taking with me my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal property, which though of conſiderable value, was now reduced to a ſmall compaſs, and placed it in the hands of a banker there, with a proviſion, that he ſhould not deliver it up to any one, unleſs the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:038283_0225_10119782A8CA2768"/>
perſon who claimed it, ſhould produce a paper which I then ſhewed him, and of which I left a counterpart in his hands.—That paper, my deareſt child, you will find amongſt this roll which I have bequeathed you; and it will put you into poſſeſſion of all my property, whenever you chooſe to claim it.</p>
               <p>"I referred to myſelf, however, a picture of my Antoinette, and a ſplendid croſs, which had been preſented to my ſon, for ſome ſervices he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the court; which croſs he had fortunately left, with ſome other things, at the chateau, when he went away with his ſiſter. Both theſe, my dear child, I ſhall alſo conſign to you; Oh that I could my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhew thee thy mother's picture 'ere I die?</p>
               <p>"With theſe, and a ſmall ſum of money which I had reſerved for my own uſe, I came hither, having firſt aſſumed the garb of an anchoret, which I meant to wear for the reſt of my life. I intended, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before I fixed on the ſpot for my ſecluſion, which I had planned to be amongſt the Alps, to throw myſelf at the feet of the injured Theodore, to make confeſſion of my wickedneſs, and by inveſting him with my property, to endeavour to make him all the amends in my power for the injury I had done him.</p>
               <p>"When I arrived here, I found the ſad ſituation to which the man, whom I ſought for, was reduced: that after abſenting himſelf from his family and country for ſome years, he had returned to them, in a ſtate of diſtraction. Oh God! Oh God! what ſtrokes were theſe to me? for I knew myſelf the author of all. I determined, however, to fix my abode amidſt this romantic ſcenery, 'till ſomething more was heard of the unhappy lunatic, or 'till I could ſee his daughter. Week after week, month after month, year after year, has however paſſed on, nor can I find that lord Arlington is yet reſtored to his family. Often have I anxiouſly enquired of my good friend the prieſt, who lives near me, whether
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:038283_0226_10119785DE6CA688"/>
the family were not likely to come to Arlington caſtle: for I ſhould conſider it as a bleſſing indeed to ſee my grand-daughter, the child of my Antoinette; but it is a bleſſing which I hardly dare to hope for. I truſt, however, that all I have deſtined for my wretched ſon-in-law, and his daughter, will at laſt come into the hands of one or other of them, by means of that benevolent man, to whom I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for a thouſand little acts of kindneſs and for contributing towards reſtoring me to that degree of peace I have attained ſince I came here.</p>
               <p>"When firſt I determined on my ſecluſion, I, in my uſual intemperate manner, made a raſh oath, that I never would reveal my ſtory, and the cauſe of my ſecluſion, to any one. This oath, though raſhly made, I have ſtrictly obſerved; but in leaving it thus written, for the information of thoſe whom it really concerns, I think I can hardly be guilty of violating it; at leaſt I think it is a caſe where to break the oath is leſs criminal than to conceal the ſtory. I have now been here ſeven years, I have, at times, found my mind tolerably calm, but at other times it has been a troubled ſea, toſſed about by a whirlwind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending feelings.</p>
               <p>"At length, however, the bright ſun of hope has dawned upon my ſoul. The life I had led for theſe latter years, has unavoidably thrown me into a train of deep reaſoning and reflection;—occupied by no wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dly concerns, but ſuch as were brought on by the attention I have paid to my poor neighbours. I have ſpent a great deal of time in contemplating the ſtupendous works of creation daily before my eyes. Every object I behold aſſures me, that its creator muſt be a being of the moſt unbounded benevolence.— Wherefore, then, ſhould I deſpond? Though I have been one of the worſt of ſinners, yet he knows the ſincerity of my repentance, and therefore may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly extend the arm of mercy even to me.</p>
               <p>"As far as the means which I reſerved for myſelf
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:038283_0227_1011825AB4A1A200"/>
would permit me, I have aſſiſted the needy with my purſe; but I have held, as ſacred, all that I at firſt deſtined for hapleſs Theodore and my grandchild. I have never totally remitted my penances and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, or my bodily diſcipline; for though reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has convinced me, that to mortify the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not really be pleaſing to the creator, who wiſhes all his creatures to enjoy, with thankfulneſs and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the thouſand, thouſand bleſſings which he has placed around them, yet as bodily penance had firſt awakened my ſoul to reflection and repentance, and as I dreaded nothing ſo much, as a return to the ſlavery, in which I had formerly lived, to my intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate paſſions, I have not dared entirely to remit it, left ſuch a remiſſion might be attended with fatal conſequences.</p>
               <p>"I do not mean here to recommend to general practice the life I have choſen; I have found it a wholeſome phyſic, it is true, but better, far better is it, by keeping from earlieſt youth, a ſtrict guard over the paſſions, and ſubjecting them entirely to the ſway of reaſon, never to have occaſion to ſeek our remedy in ſuch a bitter draught. That virtue is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which can only avoid falling by a cowardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the poſt of danger:—he alone, who amidſt ſurrounding ſnares and temptations, has preſerved his heart pure and uncorrupted, can be ſaid to have fought a good fight, and really to deſerve the crown of glory which is reſerved for him."</p>

               <p>YES, ſurely, exclaimed lord Arlington, as he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed reading, "thy ſins, unhappy man, will be blotted from heaven's holy archives, and only thy penitence, and latter deeds of charity, will remain enrolled there! Ah!

               <p>"It was affecting indeed," ſaid Antoinette, "ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, never ſhall I forget it! I have been witneſs to affecting ſcenes ſince; our meeting, my father, two

days ago was ſo; but the dying features of the baron have left an impreſſion on my mind, which no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage can deſcribe. Neither could language deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the emotions of his ſoul, which were ſo deeply painted on his countenance; but though language could do litttle in the deſcription, the pencil might do much. Look here, my father," ſhe ſaid, taking a painting from a cloſet in the room, "I have tried from memory to give a ſketch of his dying counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Can you trace in this penitent the features of that baron de St. Foix, whom you knew?"</p>
               <p>Lord Arlington looked at the work with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—it was the firſt ſpecimen he had ſeen of his daughter's talents in that way, and it would have been no diſgrace to the firſt maſters. He caſt his eyes firſt on the painting, then on Antoinette; "And is it poſſible," he ſaid, "that you can be the artiſt who has executed ſo finiſhed a work. Yes, indeed, theſe features are the wreck of thoſe of the baron de St. Foix; which, when not overclouded with paſſion, had ſomething commanding in them, and you have given them their full force."</p>
               <p>The introduction of this piece, inſenſibly turned the converſation into a different channel from that in which it at firſt began to flow; and the arts having been once introduced, Marſini, who was ſo great a proficient in them, had an opportunity of diſplaying his fine taſte to the greateſt advantage, and convinced lord Arlington how great an acquiſition ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion would be to him.</p>
               <p>The next morning mr. Thomas Percival attended on lord Arlington, according to appointment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his expreſſions of penitence and ſorrow for his conduct, and his reſolutions of reformation, lord Arlington told him, that relying on his ſincerity, he would do all in his power to ſerve and aſſiſt him. He gave him a large ſum of money towards defraying the great expence he had been at in his law-ſuit, and promiſed to aſſiſt him in amending his fortune, if he

would go into the mercantile line, inſtead of leading a life of idleneſs, as he had hitherto done, under the idea, that being a branch of a noble family, he ſhould degrade himſelf by going into trade; thus fooliſhly chooſing rather to keep a large family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had, in indigent gentility, than to amend their ſituations by working himſelf, and making them work too.</p>
               <p>But his mind was now ſo wrought upon by the generoſity of lord Arlington's behaviour to him, that he thankfully accepted his propoſal, and by his advice, fetched his wife and family from Marſeilles; after which, he was eſtabliſhed by lord Arlington as a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant at Cork, where, by induſtry and frugality, he ſoon roſe to affluence, and was, in time, enabled, even to diſcharge all the pecuniary obligations he was under to his truly illuſtrious relation.</p>
               <p>It is now time that we turn our attention to Francis Delaval, who, the readers will ſcarcely need to be informed, had been no unconcerned ſpectator of the ſcenes which had been paſſing.</p>
               <p>He, with his father and ſiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were invited to dine at lord Arlington's the day following the trial; in the courſe of which viſit, Francis took an opportunity of ſlipping the following jeux d'eſprit into the hands of Antoinette, as a memento of his attachment to her.</p>

Lord Arlington thought, during the whole of the day, that there ſeemed to be a good underſtanding between them, and ſaw it with pleaſure, as he was much pleaſed with that young man. When lady Arlington and he were alone, he hinted to her what he thought he had obſerved; to which ſhe replied, that he was quite in the right, and ſhe only delayed to mention the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to him, 'till he was a little leſs haraſſed with other concerns, and ſhe doubted not but the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs would be opened in form very ſoon, by the Delavals. In this ſuppoſition ſhe was perfectly right; Francis ſoon found an opportunity of renewing his ſuit to Antoinette, who now accepted his propoſals without heſitation; and when the ſubject was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to lord Arlington, he as readily aſſented to the union, and Francis and Antoinette were ſoon made happy in the poſſeſſion of each other.</p>
               <p>But before their marriage was concluded, Francis took a journey to Paris, for the purpoſe of claiming the property of the baron de St. Foix, which had been ſo long in the banker's hands there. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this journey, as lord Arlington could not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf go to Paris; end after he had ſettled all affairs in that city, he went, at lord Arlington's deſire, to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle, to look for his friendly captain. Him Francis found without difficulty, and having diſcharged all lord Arlington's obligations to him, and made him, according to his directions, a handſome compliment beſides, he embarked at Rochelle, and returned in perfect ſafety to Ireland. He would fain have brought the captain over with him, but he could not ſpare ſo much time from his buſineſs.</p>
               <p>During the abſence of Francis, count Carletti, the friend of Marſini, had had ſuch frequent opportunities of improving an acquaintance with his ſiſter, which had commenced before Francis ſet out, that at his return, Carletti deſired him to uſe his intereſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:038283_0232_1011979B393BBBC0"/>
the ſuit which he wiſhed to propoſe to Caroline; nor did Francis find his ſiſter at all averſe to receive Carletti as a lover: and his addreſſes having received the ſanction of mr. Delaval, the ſame day that gave Antoinette to Francis, alſo joined the hands of count Carletti and Caroline Delaval.</p>
               <p>When the property of the baron de St. Foix came to be examined, it appeared to amount to about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand pounds, to which lord Arlington and mr. Delaval added ſufficient to enable Francis and Antoinette to live in even more than affluence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Marſini was alſo highly liberal to his dear An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toinette, whom he never ceaſed to love as a child. He was ſcarcely ever ſeparated from her and her huſband; ſometimes living in Ireland, at the houſe he had purchaſed near Arlington, and at other times v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ting his own eſtate in Tuſcany, whither mr. and mrs. Delaval always accompanied him, and where he was alſo ſometimes viſited by lord and lady Arlington and their family, which, in time, became numerous; and at his death, which was not till he arrived at an advanced age, he left the principal part of his fortune to Francis and Antoinette.</p>
               <p>Henry Percival continued to grow in virtue as he advanced in years, and was in due time married to a very amiable woman, whoſe worth and beauty were her only fortune.</p>
               <p>Doctor Schomberg continued in lord Arlington's family, as an aſſiſtant to lord and lady Arlington, in the education of their children, and was highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and eſteemed by them both.</p>
               <p>To conclude.—Lord and lady Arlington continued to live together many years, taſting even greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in each other, from the contraſt which they
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:038283_0233_1011979DB290BB90"/>
had formerly experienced; eſteemed and beloved by all who knew them, and dealing out bleſſings all around them; and when death at laſt called them to the regions of eternal bliſs, they left behind them, in their children, faithful repreſentatives of their virtue and happineſs.</p>
