            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO ſuch as have read the Rev. Mr. JOHN WESLEY's Journals, there needs no commendation; but to ſuch as are unacquainted with this valuable part of his works, it may not be improper to obſerve, that they contain a very inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and uſeful fund of religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diverſified information. And while the reader is highly entertained in the peruſal of them, he will find they have a ſtrong tendency to raiſe in his mind the moſt beneficial ideas.</p>
            <p>We would inform the purchaſers, that it is our deſign to publiſh the whole of theſe Journals, one volume at a time, which will make it eaſier both for them and us.</p>

               <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT was in purſuance of an advice given by bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Taylor, in his <hi>Rules for Holy Living and Dying,</hi> that about fifteen years ago, I began to take a more exact account than I had done before, of the manner wherein I ſpent my time, writing down how I had employed every hour. This I continued to do, wherever I was, till the time of my leaving England. The variety of ſcenes which I then paſſed through, induced me to tranſcribe from time to time, the more material parts of my diary, adding here and there ſuch little reflections as occurred to my mind. Of this Journal thus occaſionally compiled, the following is a ſhort extract: it not being my deſign to relate all thoſe particulars which I wrote for my own uſe only, and which would anſwer no valuable end to others, however important they were to me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Indeed I had no deſign or deſire to trouble the world with any of my little affairs; as it cannot but appear to every impartial mind, from my having been ſo long <hi>as one that heareth not,</hi> notwithſtanding the loud and frequent calls I have had to anſwer for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Neither ſhould I have done it now, had not Captain Williams's affidavit, publiſhed <hi>as ſoon as he had left England,</hi> laid an obligation upon me, to do what in me lies, in obedience to that command of God, <hi>Let not the good which is in you be evil ſpoken of.</hi> With this view I do at length <hi>give an anſwer to every man that aſketh me a reaſon of the hop which is in me,</hi>
                  <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029861_0005_0FE2A854B1A8F788"/>that in all theſe things, <hi>I have a conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God and towards man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I have prefixed hereto a letter wrote ſeveral years ſince, containing a plain account of the riſe of that little ſociety in Oxford, which has been ſo variouſly repreſented. Part of this was publiſhed in 1733; but without my conſent or knowledge. It now ſtands as it was wrote; without any addition, diminution, or amendment; it being my only concern herein, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>declare the thing as it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Perhaps my employments of another kind may not allow me to give any farther anſwer to them who <hi>ſay all manner of evil of me, falſely,</hi> and ſeem to <hi>think that they do God ſervice.</hi> Suffice it, that both they and I ſhall ſhortly <hi>give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THE occaſion of my giving you this trouble is of a very extraordinary nature. On Sunday laſt I was informed (as no doubt you will be e're long) that my brother and I had killed your ſon: that the rigorous faſting which he had impoſed upon himſelf, by our advice, had increaſed his ilineſs and haſtened his death. Now though, conſidering it in itſelf, <hi>it is a very ſmall thing with me to be judged with man's judgment;</hi> yet as the being thought guilty of ſo miſchievous an imprudence might make me the leſs able to do the work I came into the world for, I am obliged to clear myſelf of it, by obſerving to you, as I have done to others, that your ſon left off faſting about a year and a half ſince, and that it is not yet half a year ſince I began to practiſe it.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not let this opportunity ſlip of doing my part towards giving you a juſter notion of ſome other particulars, relating both to him and myſelf, which have been induſtriouſly miſrepreſented to you.</p>
                     <p>In March laſt he received a letter from you, which not being able to read, he deſired me to read to him; ſeveral of the expreſſions whereof I perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſhall do, till I too am called hence. I then determined, that if God was pleaſed to take a thy your ſon before me, I would juſtify him and myſelf, which I now do with all plainneſs and ſimplicity, as both my character and cauſe requires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:029861_0007_0FE2A85C2B2E65C8"/>
In one practice for which you blamed your ſon, I am only concerned as a friend, not as a partner. That therefore I ſhall conſider firſt: your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it was in effect this, <q>He frequently went into poor people's houſes in the villages about Holt, called their children together, and inſtructed them in their duty to God, their neighbour, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He likewiſe explained to them the neceſſity of private as well as public prayer, and provided them with ſuch forms as were beſt ſuited to their ſeveral capacities: and being well apprized how much the ſucceſs of his endeavours depended on their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards him, to win upon their affections, he ſometimes diſtributed among them a little of that money which he had ſaved from gaming, and the other faſhionable expenſes of the place.</q> This is the firſt charge againſt him; upon which all that I ſhall obſerve is, that I will refer it to your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be fitter to have a place in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his faults, or of thoſe virtues, for which he is <hi>now numbered among the ſons of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If all the perſons concerned in "that ridiculous ſociety, whoſe follies you have ſo often heard repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," could but give ſuch a proof of their deſerving the glorious title
<note n="*" place="bottom">The Holy Club.</note> which was once beſtowed upon them, they would be contented that their <hi>lives</hi> too <hi>ſhould be counted madneſs, and their end thought to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honour.</hi> But the truth is, theft title to holineſs ſtands upon much leſs ſtable foundations; as you will eaſily perceive when you know the ground of this wonderful outcry, which it ſeems, England is not wide enough to contain.</p>
                     <p>In November, 1729, at which time I came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine at Oxford, your ſon, my brother, myſelf, and one more, agreed to ſpend three or four evenings in in week together Our deſign was to read over the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029861_0008_0FE2A85DC0542AE0"/>claſſicks, which we had before read in private, on common nights, and on Sunday ſome book in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In the ſummer following Mr. M. told me he had called at the gaol, to ſee a man who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed for killing his wife; and that, from the talk he had with one of the debtors, he verily believed it would do much good, if any one would be at the pains of now and then ſpeaking with them. This he ſo frequently repeated, that on the 24th of Aug. 1730, my brother and I walked with him to the caſtle. We were ſo well ſatisfied with our converſation there, that we agreed to go thither once or twice a week; which we had not done long, before he deſired me, to go with him to ſee a poor woman in the town who was ſick. In this employment too when we came to reflect upon it, we believed it would be worth while to ſpend an hour or two in a week, provided the miniſter of the pariſh, in which any ſuch perſon was, were not againſt it. But that we might not depend wholly on our own judgments, I wrote an account to my father of our whole deſign; withal begging that he, who had lived ſeventy years in the world, and ſeen as much of it as moſt private men have ever done, would adviſe us whether we had yet gone too far, and whether we ſhould now ſtand ſtill, or go forward?</p>

               <p>Part of his anſwer, dated Sept. 21, 1730, was this:</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>"And now as to your own deſigns and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what can I ſay leſs of them than <hi>valde proho:</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">I greatly approve.</note> and that I have the higheſt reaſon to bleſs God, that he has given me two ſons together at Oxford, to whom he has given grace and courage to turn the war againſt the world and the devil, which is the beſt way to conquer them. They have but one more ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to combat with, the fleſh; which if they take
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029861_0009_0FE2A860695E7FF8"/>care to ſubdue by faſting and prayer, there will be no more for them to do, but to proceed ſteadily in the ſame courſe, and expect the crown which fadeth not away. You have reaſon to bleſs God, as I do, that you have ſo faſt a friend as Mr. M. who I ſee in the moſt difficult ſervice is ready to break the ice for you. You do not know of how much good that poor wretch who killed his wife has been the providential occaſion.

That argument indeed had no ſucceſs; the young gentleman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated next week; upon which his uncle having again tried to convince him that he was in the wrong way, by ſhaking him by the throat to no purpoſe, changed his method, and by mildneſs, prevailed upon him to abſent from it the Sunday following, as he has done five Sundays in ſix ever ſince.

As to my own ſenſe of the matter, I confeſs, I cannot but heartily approve of that ſerious and religious turn of mind that prompts you and your aſſociates to thoſe pious and charitable offices; and can have no notions of that man's religion or concern for the honour of the univerſity, that oppoſes you as far as your deſign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the colleges.

As to the other branch of your deſign, as the town is divided into pariſhes, each of which has its proper incumbent, and as there is probably an eccleſiaſtic, who has the ſpiritual charge of the priſoners, prudence may direct you to conſult them: for though I dare not ſay you would be too officions, ſhould you of your own mere motion ſeek out the perſons that want your inſtructions and charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contributions, yet ſhould you have the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their proper paſtor your good offices would be more regular, and leſs liable to cenſure."</p>

It was a little before this time my brother and I were at London, when going into a bookſeller's ſhop (Mr. Rivington's in St. Paul's Church-yard) after ſome other converſation, he aſked us whether we lived in town; and upon our anſwering,

But in the ſpring following (April 20) Mr. Clayton meeting me in the ſreet, and giving Mr. Rivington's ſervice, I deſired his company to my room, and then commenced our acquaintance. At the firſt opportunity I acquainted him with our whole deſign, which he immediately and heartily cloſed with: and not long after, Mr. M— having then left Oxford, we fixed two even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a week to meet on, partly to talk upon that ſubject, and partly to read ſomething in practical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
                     <p>The two points, whereunto by the bleſſing of God, and your ſon's help, we had before attained, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hold faſt: I mean, the doing what good we can, and in order thereto communicating as often as we have opportunity. To theſe, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mr. Clayton, we have added a third, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the faſts of the church; the general neglect of which we can by no means apprehend to be a lawful excuſe for neglecting them. And in the reſolution to adhere to theſe, and all things elſe which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced God requires at our hands, we truſt we ſhall perſevere, till he calls us to give an account of our ſtewardſhip. As for the names of Methodiſts, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation-men, and ſo on, with which ſome of our neighbours are pleaſed to compliment us, we do not conceive ourſelves to be under any obligation to regard them, much leſs to take them for arguments. To the law and to the teſtimony we appeal, whereby we ought to be judged. If by theſe it can be proved we are in an error, we will immediately and gladly retract it: if not, we <hi>have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> as to renounce any part of his ſervice, though men ſhould

Your ſon already ſtands before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of him who judges righteous judgment; at the brightneſs of whoſe preſence the clouds remove; his eyes are open, and he ſees clearly whether it was "Blind zeal and a thorough miſtake of true religion, that hurried him on in the error of his way," or whether he acted like a faithful and wiſe ſervant, who from a juſt ſenſe that his time was ſhort, made haſte to finiſh his work before his Lord's coming, that when <hi>laid in the balance</hi> he might not <hi>be ſound wanting.</hi>

               <head>JOURNAL From <hi>Oct.</hi> 14, 1735, to <hi>Feb.</hi> 1, 1738.</head>
               <p>TUESDAY, Oct. 14, 1735, Mr. Benjamin Ingham, of Queen's-College, Oxford, Mr. Charles Delamotte, ſon of a merchant in London, who had offered himſelf ſome days before, my brother Charles Weſley, and myſelf, took boat for Graveſend, in order to embark for Georgia. Our end in leaving our native country, was not to avoid want (God having given us plenty of temporal bleſſings) nor to gain the dung or droſs of riches or honour: but ſingly this, to ſave our ſouls: to live wholly to the glory of God. In the afternoon we found the Simmonds off Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, and immediately went on board.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday and Thurſday we ſpent with one or two of our friends, partly on board and partly on ſhore, in exhorting one another <hi>to ſhake off every weight, and to run with patience the race ſet before us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friday 17. I began to learn German, in order to converſe with the Germans, ſix and twenty of whom we had on board. On Sunday, the weather being fair and calm, we had the morning-ſervice on quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck. I now firſt preached <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered the Lord's ſupper to ſix or ſeven communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. A little flock. May God increaſe it!</p>
               <p>Monday 20. Believing the denying ourſelves even in the ſmalleſt inſtances, might, by the bleſſing of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029861_0023_0FE2A894393C0DC8"/>God, be helpful to us, we wholly left off the uſe of fleſh and wine, and confined ourſelves to vegetable food, chiefly rice and biſcuit. In the afternoon David Nitchman, biſhop of the Germans, and two others began to learn Engliſh. O may we be, not only of one tongue, but of one mind and of one heart!</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 21. We failed from Graveſend. When we were paſt about half the Goodwin Sands, the wind ſuddenly failed. Had the calm continued till ebb, the ſhip had probably been loſt. But the gale ſprung up again in an hour, and carried us into the Downs.</p>
               <p>We now began to be a little regular. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of living was this. From four in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till five, each of us uſed private prayer. From five to ſeven we read the bible together, carefully comparing it (that we might not lean to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings) with the writings of the earlieſt ages. At ſeven we breakfaſted. At eight were the public prayers. From nine to twelve I uſually learned Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Mr. Delamotte, Greek. My brother writ ſermons, and Mr. Ingham inſtructed the children. At twelve we met to give an account to one another what we had done ſince our laſt meeting, and what we deſigned to do before our next. About one we dined. The time from dinner to four, we ſpent in reading to thoſe of whom each of us had taken in charge, or in ſpeaking to them ſeverally, as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. At four were the evening prayers; when either the ſecond leſſon was explained (as it always was in the morning) or the children were catechiſed, and inſtructed before the congregation. From five to ſix we again uſed private prayer. From ſix to ſeven I read in our cabin to two or three of the paſſengers (of whom there were about eighty Engliſh on board) and each of my brethren to a few more in theirs. At ſeven I joined with the Germans in their public ſervice; while Mr. Ingham was reading between the decks, to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029861_0024_0FE2A895CB8EC550"/>as many as deſired to hear. At eight we met again, to exhort and inſtruct one another. Between nine and ten we went to bed, where neither the roaring of the ſea, nor the the motion of the ſhip, could take away the refreſhing ſleep which God gave us.</p>
               <p>Friday 24. Having a rolling ſea, moſt of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers found the effects of it. Mr. Delamotte was exceeding ſick, for ſeveral days: Mr. Ingham for about half an hour. My brother's head ached much. Hitherto it has pleaſed God, the ſea has not diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at all; nor have I been hindered one quarter of an hour from reading, writing, compoſing, or doing any buſineſs I could have done on ſhore.</p>
               <p>During our ſtay in the Downs, ſome or other of us went, as often as we had opportunity, on board the ſhip that failed in company with us, where alſo many were glad to join in prayer and hearing the word.</p>
               <p>Friday 31. We failed out of the Downs. At eleven at night I was waked by a great noiſe. I ſoon found there was no danger. But the bare apprehenſion of it, gave me a lively conviction what manner of men thoſe ought to be, who are every moment on the bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sat. Nov. 1. We came to St. Helen's harbour, and the next day into Cowes road. The wind was fair, but we waited for the man of war, which was to fail with us. This was a happy opportunity of inſtructing our fellow-travellers. May he whoſe feed we ſow, give it the increaſe!</p>
               <p>Sund. 16. Thomas Hird, and Grace his wife, with their children, Mark, aged 21, and Phebe, about 17, late quakers, were, at their often-repeated deſire, and after careful instruction, admitted to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>Thur. 20. We fell down into Yarmouth road, but the next day were forced back into Cowes. During our ſtay here there were ſeveral ſtorms: in one of which two ſhips in Yarmouth road were loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:029861_0025_0FE2A898424E2A08"/>
The continuance of the contrary winds gave my brother an opportunity of complying with the deſire of the miniſter of Cowes, and preaching there three or four times. The poor people flocked together in great numbers. We diſtributed a few little books among the ſerious of them, which they received with all poſſible expreſſions of thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Fri. 21. One recovering from a dangerous illneſs, deſired to be inſtructed in the nature of the Lord's ſupper. I thought it concerned her to be firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the nature of Chriſtianity: and accordingly fixed an hour a day to read with her in Mr. Law's Treatiſe on Chriſtian Perfection.</p>
               <p>Sund. 23. At night I was waked by the toſſing of the ſhip and roaring of the wind, and plainly ſhewed I was unfit, for I was unwilling to die.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. Dec. 2. I had much ſatisfaction in converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one that was very ill and very ſerious. But in a few days ſhe recovered from her ſickneſs and from her ſeriouſneſs together.</p>
               <p>Sund. 7. Finding nature did not require ſo frequent ſupplies as we had been accuſtomed to, we agreed to le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Wedneſ. 10. We failed from Cowes, and in the afternoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Needles. Here the ragged rocks, with the waves daſhing and foaming at the foot of them, and the white ſide of the iſland riſing to ſuch a height, perpendicular from the beach, gave a ſtrong idea of <hi>him that ſpauneth the heavens, and holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hand!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To day I ſpoke cloſely on the head of religion, to one I had talked with once or twice before. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe ſaid, with many tears, "My mother died when I was but ten years old.

               <p>From this day to the 14th, being in the Bay of Biſcay, the ſea was very rough. Mr. Delamotte and many others were mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thurſ. 18. One who was big with child, in a high fever, and almoſt waſted away with a violent cough, deſired to receive the holy communion before fire died. At the hour of her receiving, ſhe began to recover, and in a few days was entirely out of danger.</p>
               <p>Sund. 21. We had fifteen communicants, which was our uſual number on Sundays: on Chriſtmas-day we had nineteen; but on New-year's-day fifteen only.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. Jan. 15, 1736. Complaint being made to Mr. Oglethorpe, of the unequal diſtribution of the water among the paſſengers, he appointed new officers to take charge of it.

Sund. 18. We returned God thanks for our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, of which a few appeared duly ſenſible. But the reſt (among whom were moſt of the ſailors) denied we had been in any danger. I could not have believed that ſo little good would have been done by the terror they were in before. But it cannot be that they ſhould long obey God from fear, who are deaf to the motives of love.</p>
               <p>Fri. 25. In the evening another ſtorm began. In the morning it increaſed, ſo that they were forced to let the ſhip drive. I could not but ſay to myſelf, <hi>How is it that thou haſt no faith?</hi> Being ſtill unwilling to die. About one in the afternoon, almoſt as ſoon as I had ſtept out of the great cabin door, the ſea did not break as uſual, but came with a full, ſmooth tide over the ſide of the ſhip. I was vaulted over with water in a moment, and ſo ſtunned, that I ſcarce expected to lift up my head again, till the ſea ſhould give up her dead. But, thanks be to God, I received no hurt at all. About midnight the ſtorm ceaſed.</p>

The ſhip not only rocked to and fro with the utmoſt violence, but ſhook and jarred with ſo unequal, grating a motion, that one could not but with great difficulty keep one's hold of any thing, nor ſtand a moment without it. Every ten minutes came a ſhock againſt the ſtern or ſide of the ſhip, which one would think ſhould daſh the planks in pieces. At this time, a child, privately baptised before, was brought to be received into the church. It put me in mind of Jeremiah's buying the field, when the Chaldeans were on the point of deſtroying
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029861_0028_0FE2A8A1F8A7FB88"/>Jeruſalem, and ſeemed a pledge of the mercy God deſigned to ſhew us, even in the land of the living.</p>
               <p>We ſpent two or three hours after prayers, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing ſuitably to the occaſion, confirming one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a calm ſubmiſſion, to the wiſe, holy, gracious will of God. And now a ſtorm did not appear ſo terrible as before. Bleſſed be the God of all conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation!</p>
               <p>At ſeven I went to the Germans. I had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, the great ſeriouſneſs of their behaviour. Of their humility they had given a continual proof, by performing thoſe ſervile offices for the other paſſengers, which none of the Engliſh would undertake, for which they deſired, and would receive no pay, ſaying, "It was good for their proud hearts," and "Their loving Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had done more for them." And every day had given them occaſion of ſhewing a meekneſs, which no injury could move. If they were puſhed, ſtruck, or thrown down, they roſe again and went away; but no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was found in their mouth.

He anſwered, "I thank God, No." I aſked, "But were not your women and children afraid?" He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied mildly, "No; our women and children are not afraid to die."</p>
               <p>From them I went to their crying, trembling neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and pointed out to them the difference in the hour of trial, between him that feareth God, and him
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029861_0029_0FE2A8A476EE4950"/>that feareth him not. At twelve the wind fell. This was the moſt glorious day which I have hitherto ſeen.</p>
               <p>Mond. 26. We enjoyed the calm. I can conceive no difference, comparable to that between a ſmooth and a rough ſea, except that which is between a mind calmed by the love of God, and one torn up by the ſtorms of earthly paſſions.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. Jan. 29. About ſeven in the evening, we fell in with the ſkirts of a hurricane. The rain as well as the wind was extremely violent. The ſky was ſo dark in a moment, that the ſailors could not ſo much as ſee the ropes, or ſet about furling the ſails. The ſhip muſt in all probability have overſet, had not the wind fell as ſuddenly as it roſe. Toward the end of it, we had that appearance on each of the maſts, which (it is thought) the ancients called Caſtor and Pollux. It was a ſmall ball of white fire, like a ſtar. The mariners ſay, it appears either in a ſtorm (and then commonly upon the deck) or juſt at the end of it: and then it is uſually on the maſts or ſails.</p>
               <p>Frid. 30. We had another ſtorm, which did us no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Thurſ. Feb. 5. Between two and three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, God brought us all ſafe into the Savannah river. We caſt anchor near Tybee-iſland, where the groves of pines, running along the ſhore, made an agreeable proſpect, ſhewing as it were, the bloom of ſpring, in the depth of winter.</p>

Frid. 6. About eight in the morning, we firſt ſet foot on American ground. It was a ſmall uninhabited iſland, over againſt Tybee. Mr. Oglethorpe led us to a riſing ground, where we all kneeled down to give thanks. He then took boat for Savannah. When the reſt of the people were come on ſhore, we called our little flock together to prayers. Several parts of the ſecond leſſon, Mark. vi. were wonderfully ſuited to the occaſion; in particular, the account of the courage and ſufferings of John the baptiſt; our Lord's directions to the firſt preachers of his goſpel and their toiling at ſea, and deliverance with thoſe comfortable words, <hi>It is I, be not afraid.</hi>

                  </gap>. Oglethorpe returned from Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, with Mr. Spangenberg, one of the paſtors of the Germans. I ſoon found what ſpirit he was of; and aſked his advice with regard to my own conduct. He ſaid, <q>My brother, I muſt firſt aſk you one or two queſtions.

               <p>Mond. 9. I aſked him many queſtions, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, and the church at Hernhuth. The ſubſtance of his anſwers was this.</p>
               <p>"At eighteen years old I was ſent to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Jena, where I ſpent ſome years in learning languages, and the vain philoſophy, which I have now long been labouring to forget.

I ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all company, and retired into a ſolitary place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſpend my life there. For three days I had much comfort here; but on the fourth it was all gone. I was amazed, and went for advice to an experienced Chriſtian. When I came to him, I could not ſpeak. But he ſaw my heart, and adviſed me to go back to my houſe, and follow the buſineſs providence called me to. I went back, but was fit for nothing. I could neither do buſineſs, nor join in any converſation. All I could ſay to any one, was Yes, or No. Many times I could not ſay that, nor underſtand the plaineſt thing that was ſaid to me. My friends and acquaintance looked upon me as dead, came no more to me, nor ſpoke about me.</p>
               <p>"When I grew better, I began teaching ſome poor children. Others joining with me, we taught more and more, till there were above thirty teachers and above two hundred ſcholars. I had now invitations to other univerſities. But I could not accept of any: deſiring only, if it were the will of God, to be little and unknown. I had ſpent ſome years thus, when profeſſor Breithaupt of Halle died: being then preſſed to remove thither, I believed it was the call of God, and went. I had not been long there, before many faults were found, both with my behaviour and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and offences increaſed more and more, till after half a year, a petition againſt me was ſent to the king of Pruſſia, who ſent an order to the commander at Halle, in purſuance whereof I was warned to leave the city in forty-eight hours. I did ſo, and retired to Hernhuth, to Count Zinzendorf.</p>
               <p>"The village of Hernhuth contains about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls, gathered out of many nations. They hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I aſked, "Whither he was to go next?" He ſaid, "I have thoughts of going to Pennſylvania. But what God will do with me, I know not. I am blind. I am a child. My father knows, and I am ready to go wherever he calls."</p>
               <p>Frid. 13. Some of the Indians ſent us word of their intention to come down to us. In our courſe of reading to day, were theſe words; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, It ſhall yet come to paſs that there ſhall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities. And the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of one city ſhall go to another, ſaying, Let us go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of hoſts: I will go alſo. Yea many people and ſtrong nations, ſhall come to ſeek the Lord of hoſts, and to pray before him.</hi> Zech. xiii. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. Feb. 14. About one, Tomo-Chachi, his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Thleeanouhee, his wife Sinauky, with two more women and two or three Indian children, came on board. As ſoon as we came in, they all roſe, and ſhook us by the hand, and Tomo-Chachi (one Mrs. Muſgrove intepreted) ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you are come. When I was in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land I deſired that ſome would ſpeak <hi>the great word</hi> to me. And my nation then deſired to hear it. But now we are all in confuſion. Yet I am glad you are come. I will go up and ſpeak to the wiſe men of our nation. And I hope they will hear. But we would not be made Chriſtians, as the Spaniards make Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. We would be taught, before we are baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
               <p>I anſwered, "There is but one, he that ſitteth in heaven, who is able to teach man wiſdom. Tho' we are come ſo far, we know not whether he will pleaſe to teach you by us or no If He teaches you, you will
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029861_0033_0FE2A8B200E96218"/>learn wiſdom; but we can do nothing." We then withdrew.</p>
               <p>Sund. 15. Another party of Indians came. They were all tall, well-proportioned men, and had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſoftneſs in their ſpeech, and gentleneſs in their whole behaviour. In the afternoon they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, but three, who ſtayed to go with Mr. Oglethorpe.</p>
               <p>Monday, Feb. 16. Mr. Oglethorpe ſet out for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Thurſ, 19. My brother and I took boat, and paſſing by Savannah, went to pay our firſt viſit in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, to the poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

From him we went with Mr. Spangen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg to the German brethren. About eleven we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the boat, and came to our ſhip about four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Sat. 21. Mary Welch, aged eleven days, was baptized according to the cuſtom of the firſt church, and the rule of the church of England. The child was ill then, but recovered from that hour.</p>
               <p>Tu. 24. Mr. Oglethorpe returned. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing I took my leave of moſt of the paſſengers of the ſhip; who all appeared ſerious. I may be, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the evening I went to Savannah again, whence Mr. Spangenberg, biſhop Nitſcman and Andrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, went up with us to Mrs. Muſgrove's, to chuſe a ſpot for the little houſe which Mr. Oglethorpe had promiſed to build us. Being afterward diſappointed of our boat, we were obliged to paſs the night there.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029861_0034_0FE2A8B7405BF310"/>But wherever we are, it is the ſame thing, if it be the will of our Father which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>At our return the next day (Mr. Quincy being then in the houſe wherein we afterwards were) Mr. Delamotte and I took up our lodging with the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. We had now an opportunity day by day, of obſerving their whole behaviour. For we were in one room with them from morning to night, unleſs for the little time I ſpent in walking. They were always employed, always chearful themſelves, and in good humour with one another. They had put away all anger and ſtrife, and wrath and bitterneſs and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking. They walked worthy of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith they were called, and adorned the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our Lord in all things.</p>
               <p>Sat. Feb. 28. They met to conſult concerning the affairs of their church: Mr. Spangenberg being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Sund. 29. Hearing Mr. Oglethorpe did not come any more to Savannah, before he went to Frederica, I was obliged to go down to the ſhip again (Mr Spangenberg followed me thither) and receive his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and inſtructions on ſeveral heads. From him we went to public prayers: after which we were refreſhed by ſeveral letters from England. Upon which I could not but obſerve how careful our Lord is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay whatever we give up on his account. When I left England, I was chiefly afraid of two things; one,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029861_0035_0FE2A8B9E0077A68"/>that I ſhould never again have ſo many faithful friends as I left there; the other, that the ſpark of love which began to kindle in their hearts, would cool and die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But who knoweth the mercy and power of God? From ten friends I am a while ſecluded: and he hath opened me a door into a whole church. And as to the very perſons I left behind, his ſpirit is gone forth ſo much the more, teaching them not to truſt in man, but <hi>in him that raiſed the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>About four, having taken leave of Mr. Spangen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, who was the next morning to ſet out for Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, I returned to Savannah. Sat. March 6. I had a long converſation with John Reinier, the ſon of a gentleman, who being driven out of France, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his religion, ſettled at Vivay in Swiſſerland, and practiſed phyſic there. His father died while he was a child. Some years after he told his mother, he was deſirous to leave Swiſſerland, and to retire into ſome other country, where he might be free from the temptations which he could not avoid there. When her conſent was at length obtained, he agreed with a maſter of a veſſel, with whom he went to Holland by land; thence to England, and from England to Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. He was provided with money, books and drugs, intending to follow his father's profeſſion. But no ſooner was he come to Philadelphia, than the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who had borrowed his money before, inſtead of repaying it, demanded the full pay for his paſſage, and under that pretence ſeized on all his effects. He then left him in a ſtrange country, where he could not ſpeak to be underſtood, without neceſſaries, money or friends. In this condition he thought it beſt to ſell himſelf for a ſervant, which he accordingly did, for ſeven years. When about five were expired, he fell ſick of a lingering illneſs, which made him uſeleſs to his maſter; who after it had continued half a year,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029861_0036_0FE2A8BB6E915F18"/>would not keep him any longer, but turned him out to ſhift for himſelf. He firſt tried to mend ſhoes, but ſoon after joined himſelf to ſome French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and learned to make buttons. He then went and lived with an anabaptiſt: but ſoon after hearing an account of the Germans in Georgia, walked from Pennſylvania thither, where he found the reſt, which he had ſo long ſought in vain.</p>
               <p>Sund. March 7. I entered upon my miniſtry at Savannah, by preaching on the epiſtle for the day, being the 13th of the firſt Corinthians. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leſſon, Luke xviii. was our Lord's prediction of the treatment which he himſelf (and conſequently his followers) was to meet with from the world; and his gracious promiſe to thoſe who are content, <hi>Nudi nudum Chriſtum ſequi: Verily I ſay unto you, there is no man that hath left houſe, or friends, or brethren, or wife, or children for the kingdom of God's ſake, which ſhall not receive manifold more in this preſent time, and in the world to come everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe plain declarations of our Lord, notwithſtanding my own repeated experience, notwithſtanding the experience of all the ſincere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, whom I have ever talked with, read or heard of: nay, and the reaſon of the thing, evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a demonſtration, that all who love not the light muſt hate him, who is continually labouring to pour it in upon them: I do here bear witneſs againſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that when I ſaw the number of people crowding into the church, the deep attention with which they received the word, and the ſeriouſneſs that afterwards ſat on all their faces; I could ſcarce refrain from giving the lie to experience and reaſon and ſcripture all together. I could hardly believe that the greater, the far greater part of this attentive, ſerious people, would hereafter trample under foot that word, and ſay all manner of evil falſely of him that ſpake it. O

               <p>This evening one of the Germans, who had been long ill of a conſumption, found himſelf much worſe. On my mentioning it to biſhop Nitſchman he ſmiled and ſaid, "He will ſoon be well; he is ready for the bridegroom."</p>
               <p>Sund. Mar. 14, Having before given notice of my deſign to do ſo, every Sunday and holiday, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of our church, I adminiſtered the holy communion to eighteen perſons. Which of theſe will endure to the end?</p>
               <p>Mond. Mar. 15. Mr. Quincy going for Carolina, I removed into the miniſter's houſe. It is large enough for a larger family than ours and has many convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, beſides a good garden. I could not but reflect on the well known epigram,

               <p>Sund. 28. A ſervant of Mr. Bradley's ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſpeak with me. Going to him, I found a young man ill, but perfectly ſenſible. He deſired the reſt to go out, and then ſaid, "On Thurſday night, about eleven, being in bed, but broad awake, I heard one calling aloud "Peter! Peter Wright!" And looking up, the room was as light as day, and I ſaw a man in very bright cloaths ſtand by the bed, who ſaid, <hi>"Prepare yourſelf; for your end is nigh;"</hi> and then immediately all was dark as before." I told him, "The advice was good, whenceſoever it came." In a few days he recovered from his illneſs; his whole
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029861_0038_0FE2A8C4F408C148"/>temper was changed as well as his life; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be, till after three or four weeks he relapſed and died in peace.</p>

The next day Mr. Delamotte and I began to try, whether life might not as well be ſuſtained, by one ſort as by a variety of food. We choſe to make the experiment with bread; and were never more vigorous and healthy than while we taſted nothing elſe. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the pure in heart!</hi> Who whether they eat or drink, or whatever they do, have no end therein but to pleaſe God!

               </p>
               <p>Sund. Apr. 4. About four in the afternoon, I ſet out for Frederica, in a Pettiawga (a ſort of flat-bottomed barge.) The next evening we anchored near Skidoway iſland, where the water at flood was twelve or fourteen feet deep. I wrapt myſelf up from head to foot, in a large cloak, to keep off the ſand-flies, and lay down on the quarter-deck. Between one and two I waked under water, being ſo faſt aſleep that I did not find where I was till my mouth was full of it. Having left my cloak, I know not how upon deck, I ſwam round to the other ſide of the Pettiawga, where a boat was tied, and climbed up by the rope, without any hurt, more than wetting my cloaths. Thou art the God of whom cometh ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: thou art the Lord by whom we eſcape death.</p>
               <p>The winds were ſo contrary, that on Sat. 10. we could but juſt get over-againſt Doboy iſland, twenty miles from Frederica, but could not poſſibly make the creek, having a ſtrong tide alſo againſt us. Here we
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029861_0039_0FE2A8C686A00B80"/>lay beating off till paſt one; when the lightning and rain which we had long ſeen at a diſtance, drove down full upon us; till after a quarter of an hour, the clouds parted, ſome paſſing on the right, and ſome on the left, leaving us a clear ſky, and ſo ſtrong a wind right after us, as in two hours brought us to Frederica.</p>
               <p>A little before we landed, I opened my Teſtament on theſe words, <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Coming on ſhore, I found my brother exceeding weak, having been for ſome time ill of a flux. But he mended from the hour he ſaw me. <hi>This</hi> alſo <hi>hath</hi> God wrought!</p>
               <p>Sund. April 11. I preached at the new Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe on the firſt verſe of the goſpel for the day, <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin? And if I ſay the truth, why do ye not believe me?</hi> There was a large congregation, whom I endeavoured to convince of unbelief, by ſimply propoſing the conditions of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are laid down in ſcripture, and appealing to their own hearts, whether they believed they could be ſaved on no other terms?</p>
               <p>In every one of the ſix following days, I had ſome freſh proofs of the abſolute neceſſity of following that wiſe advice of the apoſtle, <hi>Judge nothing before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. April 17. We ſet out for Savannah, and reached it on Tueſday evening. O bleſſed place, where having but one end in view, diſſembling and fraud are not: but each of us can pour out his heart without fear into his brother's boſom!</p>
               <p>Not finding as yet any door open, for the purſuing our main deſign, we conſidered, in what manner we might be moſt uſeful to the little flock at Savannah. And we agreed, 1ſt. To adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe the more ſerious
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029861_0040_0FE2A8C815EA6D88"/>among them, to form themſelves into a ſort of little ſociety, and to meet once or twice a week, in order to reprove, inſtruct and exhort one another. 2. To ſelect out of theſe a ſmaller number for a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate union with each other, which might be forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly by our converſing ſingly with each, and partly by inviting them altogether to our houſe; and this accordingly we determined to do every Sunday in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Wed. May 5. I was aſked to baptize a child of Mr. Parker's, ſecond bailiff of Savannah. But Mrs. Parker told me, "Neither Mr. P. nor I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to its being dipped." I anſwered, "If you <hi>certify that your child is weak, it will ſuffice</hi> (the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick ſays) <hi>to pour water upon it.</hi>" She replied, "Nay the child is not weak; but <hi>I am reſolved</hi> it ſhall not be dipped." This argument I could not confute. So I went home; and the child was baptized by another perſon.</p>
               <p>Sund. 9. I began dividing the public prayers, according to the original appointment of the church (ſtill obſerved in a few places in England.) The morning ſervice began at five. The communion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (with the ſermon) at eleven. The evening ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice about three. And this day I began reading prayers in the Court-houſe; a large and convenient place.</p>
               <p>Mond. 10. I began viſiting my pariſhioners in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from houſe to houſe; for which I ſet apart the time (when they can't work, becauſe of the heat, viz.) from twelve till three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Sund. May 16. We were ſurprized in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by my brother juſt come from Frederica. After ſome converſation, we conſulted how the poor people there might be taken care of, during his abſence. And it was at laſt agreed, that Mr. Ingham and I ſhould take our turns in aſſiſting them; and the firſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029861_0041_0FE2A8C9A7C2ECB0"/>was allotted me. Accordingly on Tueſ. 18. I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Thunderbolt; whence the next afternoon we ſet out in a ſmall boat: in the evening we touched at Skidoway, and had a ſmall, but attentive congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to join with us in evening prayer.</p>
               <p>Sat. May 22. About four in the afternoon we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon Doboy Sound. The wind, which was right a-head, was ſo high, when we were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it, and the ſea ſo rough, being driven in at the inlet, that the boat was on the point of ſinking every moment. But it pleaſed God to bring us ſafe to the other ſide in half an hour, and to Frederica the next morning. We had public prayers at nine, at which nineteen perſons were preſent; and (I think) nine communicants.</p>
               <p>Fri. 28. I read the commendatory prayer by Mr. Germain, who lay at the point of death. He had loſt his ſpeech and his ſenſes. His eyes were ſet, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he any diſcernable motion, but the heaving of his breaſt. While we ſtood round him, he ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his arms, rubbed his head, recovered his ſight, ſpeech and underſtanding; and immediately ſending for the bailiffs, ſettled the affairs of his family; and then lay down and died.</p>
               <p>At the firſt ſervice on Sund. May 30. were only five, at the ſecond twenty-five. The next day, I made Mr Laſſel's will; who notwithſtanding his great weakneſs, was quite revived, when any mention was made of death, or of eternity.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. June 1. After praying with him, I was ſurprized to find one of the moſt controverted queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in divinity, diſintereſted love, decided at once by a poor old man, without education or learning or any inſtructor, but the Spirit of God. I aſked him, what he thought of paradiſe (to which he had ſaid he was going?) He ſaid, "To be ſure, it is a fine
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029861_0042_0FE2A8D0079018A0"/>place. But I don't mind that. I don't care what place I am in. Let God put me where he will, or do with me what he will, ſo I may but ſet forth his honour and glory."</p>
               <p>Thurſ. June 3. Being aſcenſion-day, we had the holy communion; but only Mr. Hird's family joined with us in it. One reaſon why there were no more, was becauſe a few words which a woman had inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently ſpoken, had ſet almoſt all the town in a flame. Alas! How ſhall a city ſtand that is thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf? Where there is no brotherly love, no meekneſs, no for-bearing or forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but envy, malice, revenge, ſuſpicion, anger, clamour, bitterneſs, evil-ſpeaking, without end! Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant proof that there can be no true love of man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be built on the love of God.</p>
               <p>Sun. 6. Calling on Mr. Laſſel, and aſking how he did, "My departure (ſaid he) I hope is at hand." I aſked, "Are you troubled at that?" He replied, "O no; to depart and to be with Chriſt, is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I deſire no more of this bad world. My hope and my joy and my love is there." The next time I ſaw him he ſaid, "I deſire nothing more, than for God to forgive my many and great ſins. I would be humble. I would be the humbleſt creature living. My heart is humble and broken for my ſins. Tell me, teach me, what ſhall I do to pleaſe God. I would fain do whatever is his will." I ſaid, "It is his will you ſhould ſuffer." He anſwered, "Then I <hi>will</hi> ſuffer. I will gladly ſuffer whatever pleaſes him."</p>
               <p>Mon. 7. Finding him weaker, I aſked, "Do you ſtill deſire to die?" He ſaid, "Yes; but I dare not pray for it, for fear I ſhould diſpleaſe my heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father. His will be done. Let him work his will, in my life, or in my death."</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 10. We began to execute at Frederica what we had before agreed to do at Savannah. Our
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029861_0043_0FE2A8D2C2C0F0D8"/>deſign was on Sundays in the afternoon, and every evening after public ſervice, to ſpend ſome time with the moſt ſerious of the communicants, in ſinging, reading and converſation. This evening we had only Mark Hird. But on Sunday Mr. Hird, and two more deſired to be admitted. After a pſalm and a little converſation, I read Mr. Law's <hi>Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and concluded with another pſalm.</p>
               <p>Sat. June 12. Being with one who was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to converſe with me, "but not upon religion," I ſpoke to this effect. "Suppoſe you was going to a country, where every one ſpoke Latin and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood no other language, neither would converſe with any that did not underſtand it: ſuppoſe one was ſent to ſtay here a ſhort time, on purpoſe to teach it you: ſuppoſe that perſon, pleaſed with your company, ſhould ſpend his time in trifling with you, and teach you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he came for: would that be well done? Yet this is our caſe. You are going to a county, where every one ſpeaks the love of God. The citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of heaven underſtand no other language. They converſe with none who do not underſtand it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none ſuch are admitted there. I am ſent from God to teach you this. A few days are allotted us for that purpoſe. Would it then be well done in me, becauſe I was pleaſed with your company, to ſpend this ſhort time in trifling, and teach you nothing of what I came for? God forbid! I will rather not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you at all. Of the two extremes, this is the beſt."</p>
               <p>Wed. June 16. Another little company of us met, Mr. Reed, Davidſon, Walker, Delamotte, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We ſung, read a little of Mr. Law, and then converſed. Wedneſdays and Fridays were the days we fixed for conſtant meeting.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 17. An officer of a man of war, walking juſt behind us, with two or three of his acquaintance,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029861_0044_0FE2A8D451473BA8"/>curſed and ſwore exceedingly; but upon my reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſeemed much moved, and gave me many thanks.</p>
               <p>Sat. 19. Mr. Oglethorpe returned from the ſouth, and gave orders on Sunday the 20th, that none ſhould profane the day (as was uſual before) by fiſhing or fowling upon it. In the afternoon I ſummed up what I had ſeen or heard at Frederica, inconſiſtent with chriſtianity, and conſequently with the proſperity of the place. The event was as it ought: ſome of the hearers were profited, and the reſt deeply offended.</p>
               <p>This day, at half an hour paſt ten, God heard the prayer of his ſervant, and Mr. Laſſel, according to his deſire, was <hi>diſſolved that he might be with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 22. Obſerving much coldneſs in Mr.—'s behaviour, I aſked him the reaſon of it. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "I like nothing you do; all your ſermons are ſatires upon particular perſons. Therefore I will never hear you more. And all the people are of my mind. For we won't hear ourſelves abuſed."</p>
               <p>"Beſides, they ſay, they are pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teſtants. But as for you, they cannot tell what religion you are of. They never heard of ſuch a religion before. They do not know what to make of it. And then, your private behaviour.—All the quarrels that have been here ſince you came, have been long of you. Indeed there is neither man nor woman in the town, who minds a word you ſay. And ſo you may preach long enough; but nobody will come to hear you."</p>
               <p>He was too warm for hearing an anſwer. So I had nothing to do, but to thank him for his open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and walk away.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 23. I had a long converſation with Mr. —, upon the nature of true religion. I then aſked him, "Why he did not endeavour to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to all with whom he converſed?" He ſaid, "I did ſo once; and for ſome time, I thought I
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029861_0045_0FE2A8D6A97989D8"/>had done much good by it. But I afterwards found they were never the better, and I myſelf was the worſe. Therefore now, though I always ſtrive to be inoffenſive in my converſation, I do not ſtrive to make people religious, unleſs thoſe that have a deſire to be ſo, and are conſequently willing to hear me. But I have not yet (I ſpeak not of you, or your brother) found one ſuch perſon in America."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!</hi> Mark the tendency of this accurſed principle! If you will ſpeak only to thoſe who are <hi>willing to hear,</hi> ſee how many you will turn from the error of their ways! If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtriving to do good, you have done hurt, what then? So did St. Paul. So did the Lord of life. Even HIS word was <hi>the ſavour of death, as well as the ſavour of life.</hi> But ſhall he therefore ſtrive no more? God forbid! Strive more humbly, more calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Being to leave Frederica in the evening, I took the more notice of theſe words in the leſſon for the day. <hi>Whereunto ſhall I liken the men of this generation? They are like unto children ſitting in the market-place, and ſaying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For John the baptiſt came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye ſay, He hath a devil. The Son of Man is come eating and drinking, and ye ſay, Behold a glutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man and a wine bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> Luke vii.</p>
               <p>About eleven at night we took boat. And on Sat. 26, about one in the afternoon came to Savannah. O what de we want here, either for life or godlineſs! If ſuffering, God will ſend it in <hi>his</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Sun. June 27. About twenty joined with us in morning prayer. An hour or two after, a large party of Creek Indians came, the expectation of whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029861_0046_0FE2A8DC6B604750"/>us of our place of public worſhip, in which they were to have their audience.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 30. I hoped a door was opened, for going up immediately to the Choctaws, the leaſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the leaſt corrupted of all the Indian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But upon my informing Mr. Oglethorpe of our deſign, he objected, not only the danger of being intercepted, or killed by the French there; but much more, the inexpediency of leaving Savannah deſtitute of a miniſter. Theſe objections I related to our brethren in the evening, who were all of opinion, "We ought not to go yet."</p>
               <p>Thurſ. July 1. The Indians had an audience, and another on Saturday, when Chicali, their head-man, dined with Mr. Oglethorpe. After dinner, I aſked the grey-headed old man, "What he thought he was made for?" He ſaid, "He that is above knows what he made us for. We know nothing. We are in the dark. But white men know much. And yet white men build great houſes, as if they were to live for ever. But white men cannot live for ever. In a little time, white men will be duſt as well as I." I told him, "If red men will learn the good book, they may know as much as white men. But neither we nor you can underſtand that book, unleſs we are taught y him that is above: and he will not teach, unleſs you avoid, what you already know is not good." He anſwered, "I believe that. He will not teach us, while our hearts are not white. And our men do what they know is not good. They kill their own children. And our women do what they know is not good. They kill the child before it is born. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he that is above, does not ſend us the good book."</p>
               <p>Hearing the younger of the Miſs Boveys was not well, I called upon them this evening. I found ſhe had only the prickly heat, a ſort of raſh, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029861_0047_0FE2A8DF5049A998"/>here in ſummer. We ſoon fell into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, after I had aſked, "If they did not think they were too young to trouble themſelves with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion yet? And, whether they might not defer it ten or a dozen years?" To which one of them replied, "If it will be reaſonable ten years hence, to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, it is ſo now: I am not for deferring one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. July 7. I called there again, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined now to ſpeak more cloſely. But meeting company there, <hi>prudence</hi> induced me to put it off till another opportunity.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 8. Mr. O. being there again, and caſually ſpeaking of ſudden death, Miſs Becky ſaid, "If it was the will of God, I ſhould chooſe to die without a lingering illneſs." Her ſiſter ſaid, "Are you then always prepared to die?" She replied, "Jeſus Chriſt is always prepared to help me. And little ſtreſs is to be laid on ſuch a preparation for death, as is made in a ſit of ſickneſs."</p>
               <p>Sat. July 10. Juſt as they had done drinking tea, Mrs. Margaret ſeeing her colour change, aſked, if ſhe was well? She did not return any anſwer; and Dr. Tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er ſoon after going by, ſhe deſired him to ſtep in, and ſaid, "Sir, my ſiſter, I fear is not well." He looked earneſtly at her, felt her pulſe, and repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Well, madam! Your ſiſter is dying." However he thought it not impoſſible, bleeding might help. She bled about an ounce, leaned back and died.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I heard of it, I went to the houſe, and begged they would not lay her out immediately, there being a poſſibility, at leaſt, ſhe might only be in a ſwoon: of which indeed there was ſome ſlight hope, ſhe not only being as warm as ever, but having a freſh colour in her cheeks, and a few drops of blood ſtarting out, upon bending her arm: but there was no pulſe and no breath; ſo that having waited ſome
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029861_0048_0FE2A8E0DEB3AA38"/>hours, we found her <hi>ſpirit was indeed returned to God who gave it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I never ſaw ſo beautiful a corpſe in my life. Poor comfort to its late inhabitant! I was greatly ſurprized at her ſiſter. There was in all her behaviour, ſuch an inexpreſſible mixture of tenderneſs and reſignation. The firſt time I ſpoke to her, ſhe ſaid, "All my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are nothing to this. I have loſt not only a ſiſter, but a friend. But it is the will of God. I rely on him; and doubt not but he will ſupport me under it."</p>
               <p>This evening we had ſuch a ſtorm of thunder and lightning, as I never ſaw before even in Georgia. This voice of God too, told me I was not fit to die; ſince I was afraid, rather than deſirous of it! O when ſhall I wiſh to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt! When I love him with all my heart.</p>
               <p>Almoſt the whole town was the next evening at the funeral: where many doubtleſs made a world of good reſolutions. O how little trace of moſt of theſe will be left in the morning! 'Tis a true ſaying, "Hell is paved with good intentions."</p>
               <p>Tueſ. July 20. Five of the Chicaſaw Indians (twenty of whom had been in Savannah ſeveral days) came to ſee us, with Mr. Andrews, their interpreter. They were all warriors; four of them head men. The two chiefs were Pauſtoobee and Mingo Mattaw. Our conference was as follows:</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, there is one above who is over all things?</p>
               <p>Pauſtoobee anſwered, We believe there are four beloved things above, the clouds, the ſun, the clear ſky, and he that lives in the clear ſky.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, there is but one that lives in the clear ſky?</p>
               <p>A. We believe, there are two with him, three in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:029861_0049_0FE2A8E32D003BB0"/>
Q. Do you think he made the ſun, and the other beloved things?</p>
               <p>A. We cannot tell. Who hath ſeen?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he made you?</p>
               <p>A. We think he made all men at firſt.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he make them at firſt?</p>
               <p>A. Out of the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he loves you?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know. I cannot ſee him.</p>
               <p>Q. But has he not often ſaved your life?</p>
               <p>A. He has. Many bullets have gone on this ſide, and many on that ſide, but he would never let them hurt me. And many bullets have gone into theſe young men; and yet they are alive?</p>
               <p>Q. Then, cannot he ſave you from your enemies now?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, but we know not, if he will. We have now ſo many enemies round about us, that I think of nothing but death. And if I am to die, I ſhall die, and I will die like a man. But if he will have me to live I ſhall live. Though I had ever ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he can deſtroy them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>A. From what I have ſeen. When our enemies came againſt us before, then the beloved clouds came for us. And often much rain, and ſometimes hail has come upon them, and that in a very hot day. And I ſaw, when many French and Choctaws and other nations came againſt one of our towns. And the ground made a noiſe under them, and the beloved ones in the air behind them. And they were afraid, and went away, and left their meat and drink and their guns. I tell no lie. All theſe ſaw it too.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard ſuch noiſes at other times?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, often: before and after almoſt every battle.</p>
               <p>Q. What ſort of noiſes were they?</p>
               <p>A. Like the noiſe of drums and guns and ſhouting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:029861_0050_0FE2A8EA5AAAEF50"/>
Q. Have you heard any ſuch lately?</p>
               <p>A. Yes: four days after our laſt battle with the French.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard nothing before it?</p>
               <p>A. The night before I dreamed, I heard many drums up there: and many trumpets there, and much ſtamping of feet and ſhouting. Till then I thought we ſhould all die. But then I thought the beloved ones were come to help us. And the next day I heard above a hundred guns go off, before the fight began. And I ſaid, "When the ſun is there, the beloved ones will help us; and we ſhall conquer our enemies." And we did ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you often think and talk of the beloved ones?</p>
               <p>A. We think of them always, wherever we are. We talk of them and to them, at home and abroad; in peace, in war, before and after we fight; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whenever and wherever we meet together.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you think your ſouls go after death?</p>
               <p>A. We believe the ſouls of red men walk up and down near the place where they died, or where their bodies lie. For we have often heard cries and noiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> near the place where any priſoners had been burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do the ſouls of white men go after death?</p>
               <p>A. We cannot tell. We have not ſeen.</p>
               <p>Q. Our belief is, that the ſouls of bad men only walk up and down; but the ſouls of good men go up.</p>
               <p>A. I believe ſo too. But I told you the talk of the nation.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Andrews. They ſaid at the burying, "They knew what you was doing. You was ſpeaking to the beloved ones above, to take up the ſoul of the young woman.")</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:029861_0051_0FE2A8EBF1D143F0"/>
Q. We have a book that tells us many things of the beloved ones above, would you be glad to know them?</p>
               <p>A. We have no time now, but to fight. If we ſhould ever be at peace, we ſhould be glad to know?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect ever to know what the white men know?</p>
               <p>(Mr. Andrews. They told Mr O. They believe the time will come, when the red and white men will be one)</p>
               <p>Q. What do the French teach you?</p>
               <p>A. The French black
<note n="*" place="bottom">So they call the prieſts.</note> kings never go out. We ſee you go about. We like that. That is good.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your nation by the knowledge they have?</p>
               <p>A. As ſoon as ever the ground was ſound, and fit to ſtand upon, it came to us, and has been with us ever ſince. But we are young men. Our old men know more. But all of them do not know. There are but a few; whom the beloved one chuſes from a child, and is in them, and takes care of them, and teaches them. They know theſe things: and our old men practiſe: therefore they know. But I do not practiſe. Therefore I know little.</p>
               <p>Mond. July 26. My brother and I ſet out for Charleſton, in order to his embarking for England. But the wind being contrary, we did not reach Port. Royal, 40 miles from Savannah, till Wedneſday evening. The next morning we left it. But the wind was ſo high in the afternoon, as we were croſſing the neck of St. Helena's ſound, that our oldeſt ſailor cried out "Now every one muſt take care for himſelf." I told him, "God would take care for us all." Almoſt as ſoon as the words were ſpoken, the maſt fell. I kept on the edge of the boat, to be clear of her when ſhe ſunk (which we expected every moment) though with little proſpect of ſwimming aſhore, againſt ſuch a
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029861_0052_0FE2A8ED879F56F8"/>wind and ſea. But, <hi>How is it that thou hadſt no faith?</hi> The moment the maſt fell, two men caught it and pulled it into the boat; the other three rowed with all their might, and <hi>God gave command to the wind and ſeas,</hi> ſo that in an hour we were ſafe on land.</p>
               <p>Sat. July 31. We came to Charleſton. The church is of brick, but plaiſtered over like ſtone. I believe it would contain three or four thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. About three hundred were preſent at the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice the next day (when Mr. Garden deſired me to preach) about fifty at the holy commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>. I was glad to ſee ſeveral negroes at church, one of whom told me, "She was there conſtantly; and that her old miſtreſs (now dead) had many times inſtructed her in the Chriſtian religion. I aſked her, "What religion was?" She ſaid, "She could not tell." I aſked, "If ſhe knew what a ſoul was?" She anſwered, "No." I ſaid, "Do not you know there is ſomething in you, different from your body? Something you cannot ſee or feel?" She reply'd, "I never heard ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore." I added, "Do you think then, a man dies altogether as a horſe dies?" She ſaid, "Yes, to be ſure." O God, where are thy tender mercies? Are they not over all thy works? When ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſe on theſe outcaſts of men, with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his wings!</p>
               <p>Mond. Auguſt 2. I ſet out for the lieutenant governor's ſeat, about thirty miles from Charleſton, to deliver Mr. Oglethorpe's letters. It ſtands very pleaſant, on a little hill, with a vale on either ſide, in one of which is a thick wood; the other is planted with rice and Indian corn. I deſigned to have gone back by Mr. Skeene's, who has about fifty Chriſtian negroes. But my horſe tiring, I was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the ſtraight way to Charleſton.</p>
               <p>I had ſent the boat we came in back to Savannah, expecting a paſſage thither myſelf in Col. Bull's. His
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029861_0053_0FE2A8F02120B680"/>not going ſo ſoon, I went to Aſhley-ferry on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, intending to walk to Port-Royal. But Mr. Belinger not only provided me a horſe, but rode with me himſelf ten miles, and ſent his ſon with me to Cumbee-ferry twenty miles farther? whence having hired horſes and a guide, I came to Beaufort (on Port-Royal) the next evening. We took boat in the morning; but the wind being contrary, and very high, did not reach Savannah till Sunday in the afternoon.— Finding Mr. Oglethorpe was gone, I ſtayed only a day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Savannah: and leaving Mr. Ingham and Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motte there, ſet out on Tueſday morning for Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derica. In walking to Thunderbolt, I was in ſo heavy a ſhower, that all my cloaths were as wet as if I had gone through the river. On which occaſion I cannot but obſerve that vulgar error, concerning the hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the rains and dews of America. I have been throughly wet with theſe rains more than once; yet without any harm at all. And I have lain many nights in the open air, and received all the dews that fell. And ſo I believe might any one, if his conſtitution was not impaired by the ſoftneſs of a genteel educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>At Thunderbolt we took boat, and on Friday, Aug, 13. came to Frederica, where I delivered Mr. O. the letters I had brought from Carolina. The next day he ſet out for Fort St. George. From that time I had leſs and leſs proſpect of doing good at Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derica; many there being extremely zealous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigably diligent to prevent it: and few of the reſt daring to ſhew themſelves of another mind, for fear of their diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Sat. 28. I ſet apart (out of the few we had) a few books towards a library at Frederica. In the afternoon I walked to the fort on the other ſide of the iſland. About five we ſet out homeward. But my guide not being perfect in the way, we were ſoon loſt in the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029861_0054_0FE2A8F6C7390790"/>woods. We walked on however as well as we could, till between nine and ten, when being heartily tired, and throughly wet with dew, we lay down and ſlept till morning.</p>
               <p>About day-break, on Sunday the 29th, we ſet out again endeavouring to walk ſtraight forward, and ſoon after ſun-riſe found ourſelves in the Great Savannah near Frederica. By this good providence I was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from another fear, that of lying in the woods, which experience ſhewed, was to one in tolerable health a mere <hi>lion in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thurſ. Sept. 2. I ſet out in a ſloop, and about ten on Sunday morning, came to Skidoway; which (after reading prayers, and preaching to a ſmall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) I left and came to Savannah in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mond. 13. I began reading with Mr. Delamotte, biſhop Beveridge's <hi>Pandect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Mond. 20. We ended (of which alſo I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. I once thought more highly than I ought to think) the apoſtolical canons; ſo called, as biſhop Beveridge obſerves, <hi>becauſe partly grounded upon, partly agreeing with, the traditions delivered down from the apoſtles.</hi> But he farther obſerves (in the 159th page of his <hi>Code<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Tueſd. October 12. We conſidered if any thing could yet be done, for the poor people of Frederica. And I ſubmitted to the judgment of my friends, which was, that I ſhould take another journey thither:
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029861_0055_0FE2A8F85617B360"/>Mr. Ingham undertaking to ſupply my place at Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, for the time I ſhould ſtay there. I came thither on Sat. the 16th, and found few things better than I expected. The morning and evening prayers, which were read for a while after my leaving the place, had been long diſcontinued, and from that time every thing grew worſe and worſe: not many retaining any more of the form than the power of godlineſs.</p>
               <p>I was at firſt a little diſcouraged, but ſoon remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the word which cannot fail, <hi>Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.</hi> I cried to God to <hi>ariſe and maintain his own cauſe:</hi> and after the evening prayers were ended, invited a few to my houſe (as I did every night while I ſtayed at Frederica.) I read to them one of the exhortations of Ephraim Syrus, the the moſt awakening writer (I think) of all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. We concluded our reading and converſation with a pſalm, and I truſt, our God gave us his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>Mond. 18. Finding there were ſeveral Germans at Frederica, who not underſtanding the Engliſh tongue, could not join in our public ſervice, I deſired them to meet me at my houſe; which they did every day at noon from thence forward. We firſt ſung a German hymn, then I read a chapter in the New Teſtament, then explained it to them as well as I could. After another hymn we concluded with prayer.</p>
               <p>Mond. 25. I took boat, and after a flow and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſage, came to Savannah on Sunday the 31ſt.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. Novem. 23. Mr. Oglethorpe ſailed for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, leaving Mr. Ingham, Mr. Delamotte and me at Savannah, but with leſs proſpect of preaching to the Indians, than we had the firſt day we ſet foot in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Whenever I mentioned it, it was immediately replied, "You cannot leave Savannah without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter." To this indeed my plain anſwer was, "I know

                  </gap>, that I neither would nor could take charge of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any longer than till I could go among the Indians." If it was ſaid, "But did not the truſtees of Georgia appoint you to be miniſter of Savannah?" I replied "They did; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore I cannot conceive that appointment to lay me under any obligation of continuing there, any longer than till a door is opened to the Heathens; and this I expreſsly declared, at the time I conſented to accept of that appointment." But though I had no other obligation not to leave Savannah now, yet that of love I could not break through: I could not reſiſt the importunate requeſt of the more ſerious pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, "To watch over their ſouls yet a little longer, till ſome one came who might ſupply my place." And this I the more willingly did, becauſe the time was not come to preach the goſpel of peace to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; all their nations being in a ferment: and Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoobee and Mingo Mattaw, having told me, in terms, in my own houſe, "Now our enemies are all about us, we can do nothing but ſight: but if the beloved ones ſhould ever give us to be at peace, then we would hear the <hi>great word.</hi>"</p>

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029861_0057_0FE2A8FB734D7FC8"/>an hour or two we came to a Cypreſs Swamp, which lay directly acroſs our way: there was not time to walk back to Savannah before night; ſo we walked through it, the water being about breaſt-high. By that time we had gone a mile beyond it, we were out of all path; and it being now paſt ſun-ſet, we ſat down, intending to make a fire, and to ſtay there till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but finding our tinder wet, we were at a ſtand; I adviſed to walk on ſtill: but my companions being faint and weary, were for lying down, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did about ſix o'clock: the ground was as wet as our cloaths, which (it being a ſharp froſt) were ſoon froze together; however, I ſlept till ſix in the morning. There fell a heavy dew in the night, which covered us over as white as ſnow. Within an hour after ſun-riſe, we came to a plantation, and in the evening, without any hurt to Savannah.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 28. We ſet out by land with a better guide for Frederica. On Wedneſday evening we came to Fort-Argyle, on the back of the river Ogeechy. The next afternoon we croſſed Cooanoochy river in a ſmall cano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, our horſes ſwimming by the ſide of it. We made a fire on the bank, and notwithſtanding the rain, ſlept quietly till the morning.</p>
               <p>Sat. Jan. 1, 1737. Our proviſions fell ſhort, our journey being longer than we expected: but having a little barbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>On Monday evening we left Darien, and on Wed. 5. came to Frederica. Moſt here were as we expected, cold and heartleſs: we found not one who retained his firſt love. O ſend forth thy light and thy truth, that
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029861_0058_0FE2A902CBA1A170"/>they may guide them! Let them not yet follow their own imaginations!</p>
               <p>After having <hi>beaten the air</hi> in this unhappy place for twenty days, on January 26, I took my final leave of Frederica. It was not any apprehenſion of my own danger (though my life had been threatened many times) but an utter deſpair of doing good there, which made me content with the thought of ſeeing it no more.</p>
               <p>In my paſſage home, having procured a celebrated book, the works of Nicholas Machiavel, I ſet myſelf carefully to read and conſider it. I began with a prejudice in his favour; having been informed, he had often been miſunderſtood, and greatly miſrepreſented. I weighed the ſentiments that were leſs common; tranſcribed the paſſages wherein they were contained; compared one paſſage with another, and endeavoured to form a cool, impartial judgment. And my cool judgment is, that if all the other doctrines of devils which have been committed to writing, ſince letters were in the world, were collected together in one volume, it would fall ſhort of this: and, that ſhould a prince form himſelf by this book, ſo calmly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending hypoeriſy, treachery, lying, robbery, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, adultery, whoredom and murder of all kinds; Domitian or Nero would be an angel of light, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that man.</p>
               <p>Mon. Jan. 31. We came to Savannah. Tueſday Feb. 1. being the anniverſary feaſt, on account of the firſt convoy's landing in Georgia, we had a ſermon and the holy communion. Thurſ. 24. It was agreed Mr. Ingham ſhould go for England, and endeavour to bring over (if it ſhould pleaſe God) ſome of our friends to ſtrengthen our hands in his work. Sat. 26. He left Savannah.</p>
               <p>By Mr. Ingham I writ to Dr. Bray's aſſociates, who had ſent a parochial library to Savannah. It is
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029861_0059_0FE2A9051491C710"/>expected of the miniſters who receive theſe, to ſend an account to their benefactors of the method they uſe in catechiſing the children, and inſtructing the youth of their reſpective pariſhes. That part of the letter, was as follows:</p>
               <p>"Our general method is this: A young gentleman who came with me, teaches between thirty and forty children to read, write, and caſt accounts. Before ſchool in the morning, and after ſchool in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, he catechizes the loweſt claſs, and endeavours to fix ſomething of what was ſaid, in their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as well as their memories. In the evening he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the larger children. On Saturday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I catechize them all. The ſame I do on Sunday before the evening ſervice. And in the church, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the ſecond leſſon, a ſelect number of them having repeated the catechiſm and been examined in ſome part of it, I endeavour to explain at large, and to enforce that part, both on them and the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>"Some time after the evening ſervice, as many of my pariſhioners as deſire it, meet at my houſe (as they do alſo on Wedneſday evening) and ſpend about an hour in prayer, ſinging and mutual exhortation. A ſmaller number (moſtly thoſe who deſign to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the next day) meet here on Saturday evening: and a few of theſe come to me on the other evenings, and paſs half an hour in the ſame employment."</p>
               <p>Fri. March 4. I writ the truſtees for Georgia an account of our year's expence from March 1, 1736, to March 1, 1737. Which, deducting extraordinary expences (ſuch as repairing the parſonage houſe, and journies to Frederica) amounted for Mr. Delamotte and me to 44<hi>

               <p>From the directions I received from God this day, touching an affair of the greateſt importance, I could not but obſerve (as I had done many times before) the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029861_0060_0FE2A906A47363F0"/>entire miſtake of thoſe, who aſſert, "God will not anſwer your prayer, unleſs your heart be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to his will." My heart was not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to his will. Therefore, not daring to depend on my own judgment, I cried the more earneſtly to him, to ſupply what was wanting in me. And I know and am aſſured, he heard my voice, and did ſend forth his light and his truth.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 24. A fire broke out in the houſe of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Hows, and in an hour burnt it to the ground. A collection was made for him the next day; and the generality of the people ſhewed a ſurprizing will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs, to give a little out of their little, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a neceſſity greater than their own.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cy of Thunderbolt called upon me; when obſerving him to be in a deep ſadneſs, I aſked, what was the reaſon of it? And a terrible one indeed he gave in the relation following.</p>
               <p>In 1733, David Jones, a ſadler, a middle-aged man, who had for ſome time before lived at Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, being at Briſtol, met a perſon there; who after giving him ſome account of Georgia, aſked, Whether he would go thither? Adding, his trade (that of a ſadler) was an exceeding good trade there, upon which he might live creditably and comfortably. He objected his want of money to pay his paſſage, and buy ſome tools which he ſhould have need of. The gentleman (Capt. W.) told him, he would ſupply him with that, and hire him a ſhop when he came to Georgia, wherein he might follow his buſineſs, and ſo repay him, as it ſuited his convenience. Accordingly to Georgia they went; where ſoon after his arrival, his maſter (as he now ſtiled himſelf) ſold him to Mr. Lacy, who ſet him to work with the reſt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in clearing land. He commonly appeared much more thoughtful than the reſt, often ſtealing into the woods alone. He was now ſent to do ſome work on
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029861_0061_0FE2A90908682538"/>an iſland, three or four miles from Mr. Lacy's great plantation. Thence he deſired the other ſervants to return without him, ſaying, <hi>He would ſtay and kill a deer.</hi> This was on Saturday. On Monday they found him on the ſhore, with his gun by him, and the fore-part of his head ſhot to pieces. In his pocket was a paper-book, all the leaves thereof were fair, except one, on which ten or twelve verſes were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; two of which were theſe (which I tranſcribed thence, from his own hand, writing)
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Death could not a more ſad retinue find;</hi>

               <p>Sun. April 3. And every day in this great and holy week, we had a ſermon and the holy communion.</p>
               <p>Mon. 4. I began learning Spaniſh, in order to converſe with my Jewiſh Pariſhioners: ſome of whom ſeem nearer the mind that was in Chriſt, than many of thoſe who call him Lord.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 12. Being determined, if poſſible, to put a ſtop to the proceedings of one in Carolina, who had married ſeveral of my pariſhioners without either banns or licence, and declared, "He would do ſo ſtill:" I ſet out in a ſloop for Charleſton. I landed there on Thurſday, and related the caſe to Mr. Garden, the biſhop of London's commiſſary, who aſſured me, "he would take care no ſuch irregularity ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the future."</p>
               <p>Sun. 17. Mr. Garden (to whom I muſt ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge myſelf indebted for many kind and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous offices) deſiring me to preach, I did ſo, on thoſe words of the epiſtle for the day, <hi>Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the world.</hi> To that plain account of the Chriſtian ſtate which theſe words naturally lead me to give, a man of education and character ſeriouſly objected. (what is indeed a great truth) <hi>"Why if this
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029861_0062_0FE2A90FA39FB0A0"/>be Chriſtianity, a Chriſtian muſt have more courage than Alexander the Great."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 19. We left Charleſton; but meeting with ſtormy and contrary winds, after loſing our anchor, and beating out at ſea all night, on Thurſ. 21, we with ſome difficulty got back into Charleſton harbour.</p>
               <p>Fri. 22. It being the time of their annual viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I had the pleaſure of meeting with the clergy of South Carolina: among whom in the afternoon there was ſuch a converſation for ſeveral hours, on "Chriſt our Righteouſneſs," as I had not heard at any viſitation in England, or hardly on any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>Sat. 23. Mentioning to Mr. Thompſon, miniſter of St. Bartholomew's, near Ponpon, my being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of a paſſage home by water, he offered me one of his horſes, if I would go by land, which I gladly accepted of. He went with me twenty miles, and ſent his ſervant to guide me the other twenty to his houſe. Finding a young negro there, who ſeemed more ſenſible than the reſt, I aſked her how long ſhe had been in Carolina? She ſaid, two or three years; but that ſhe was born in Barbadoes, and had lived there in a miniſter's family from a child. I aſked, Whether ſhe went to church there? She ſaid, Yes, every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,—to carry my miſtreſs's children. I aſked what ſhe had learned at church? She ſaid, <hi>Nothing; I heard a deal; but did not underſtand it.</hi> But what did your maſter teach you at home? <hi>Nothing.</hi> Nor your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs? <hi>No.</hi> I aſked, "But don't you know, that your hands and feet, and this you call your body, will turn to duſt in a little time? She anſwered, <hi>Yes.</hi> But there is ſomething in you that will not turn to duſt, and this is what they call your ſoul. Indeed, you can't ſee your ſoul, though it is within you, as you can't ſee the wind, though it is all about you. But if you had not a ſoul in you, you could no more ſee,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029861_0063_0FE2A911338E1EC0"/>or hear, or feel, than this table can. What do you think will become of your ſoul, when your body turns to duſt? <hi>I don't know.</hi> Why, it will go out of your body, and go up there, above the ſky, and live always. God lives there. Do you know who God is? <hi>No.</hi> You can't ſee him, any more than you can ſee your own ſoul. It is he that made you and me, and all men and women, and all beaſts and birds, and all the world. It is he that makes the ſun ſhine, and rain fall, and corn and fruits to grow out of the ground. He makes all theſe for us. But why do you think he made us? What did he make you and me for? <hi>I can't tell.</hi> He made you to live with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above the ſky. And ſo you will, in a little time,—if you are good. If you are good, then when your body dies, your ſoul will go up, and want nothing, and have whatever you can deſire. No one will beat or hurt you there. You will never be ſick, You will never be ſorry any more, nor afraid of any thing. I can't tell you, I don't know how happy you will be: for you will be with God.</p>
               <p>The attention with which this poor creature liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſtruction is inexpreſſible. The next day ſhe remembered all, readily anſwered every queſtion; and ſaid, <hi>She would aſk him that made her, to ſhew her how to be good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sun. 24. I preached twice at Ponpon chapel, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> judgment againſt thoſe who hear it not, when it is preached at their own doors!</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 27. I came to Mr. Belinger's plantation at Chulifinny, where the rain kept me till Friday. Here I met with an half Indian (one that had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian mother, and a Spaniſh father) and ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, who were very deſirous of inſtruction. One
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029861_0064_0FE2A912C8B3C0B0"/>of them ſaid, "When I was at Aſhley-Ferry, I went to church every Sunday. But here we are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the woods. Though if there was any church within five or ſix miles, I am ſo lame I can't walk, but I would orawl thither."</p>
               <p>Mr. Belinger ſent a negro lad with me to Purryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, or rather to the poor remains of it. O how hath God ſtretched over this place <hi>the lines of confuſion, and the ſtones of emptineſs!</hi> Alas for thoſe whoſe lives were here vilely caſt away, through oppreſſion, through divers plagues and troubles! O earth! How long wilt thou hide their blood! How long wilt thou cover thy ſlain?</p>
               <p>This lad too I found both very deſirous and very capable of inſtruction. And perhaps one of the eaſieſt and ſhorteſt ways to inſtruct the American negroes in Chriſtianity, would be firſt to enquire after and find out ſome of the moſt ſerious of the planters. Then having enquired of them, which of their ſlaves <hi>were beſt inclined</hi> and underſtood Engliſh, to go to them from plantation to plantation, ſtaying as long as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary at each. Three or four gentlemen in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina I have been with, that would be ſincerely glad of ſuch an aſſiſtant; who might purſue his work with no more hindrance than muſt every where attend the preaching of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>Sat. 30. I came to Savannah, and found my little flock in a better ſtate than I could have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: God having been pleaſed greatly to bleſs the endeavours of my fellow-labourer, while I was abſent from them.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. May 18. I diſcovered the firſt convert to deiſm that (I believe) has been made here. He was one that for ſome time had been zealouſly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily religious. But indulging himſelf in <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> company, he firſt made ſhipwreck of his zeal, and then of his faith. I have ſince found ſeveral others
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029861_0065_0FE2A91456FE98C0"/>that have been attacked. They have as yet maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ground. But I doubt the devil's apoſtles are too induſtrious to let them long halt between two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 25. I was ſent for by one who had been ſeveral years of the church of Rome; but was now deeply convinced (as were ſeveral others) by what I had occaſionally preached, of the grievous errors that church is in, and the great danger of continuing a member of it. Upon this occaſion I could not but reflect on the many advices I had received, to beware of the increaſe of Popery: but not one (that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) to beware of the increaſe of infidelity. This was quite ſurpriſing, when I conſidered, 1. That in every place where I have yet been, the number of the converts to Popery bore no proportion to the number of the converts to infidelity. 2. That as bad a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Popery is, no religion is ſtill worſe; a baptized infidel being always found upon the trial, two-fold worſe than even a bigotted Papiſt. 3. That as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a ſtate as a Papiſt is in, with regard to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Deiſt is in a yet more dangerous ſtate, if he be not (without repentance) an aſſured heir of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And laſtly, That as hard as it is to recover a Papiſt, it is ſtill harder to recover an infidel: I myſelf having known many Papiſts, but never one Deiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.</p>
               <p>May 29. Being Whitſunday, four of our ſcholars, after having been inſtructed daily for ſeveral weeks, were at their earneſt and repeated deſire, admitted to the Lord's table. I truſt their zeal hath ſtirred up many, to remember their Creator in the days of their youth, and to redeem the time, even in the midſt of an evil and adulterous generation.</p>
               <p>Indeed about this time we obſerved the Spirit of God to move upon the minds of many of the children. They began more carefully to attend to the things
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029861_0066_0FE2A91BE10815D0"/>that were ſpoken both at home and at church, and a remarkable ſeriouſneſs appeared in their whole behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and converſation. Who knows but ſome of them may <hi>grow up, to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>June 25. Mr. Cauſton (the ſtore-keeper and chief magiſtrate of Savannah) was ſeized with a ſlow fever. I attended him every day (as I did any of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, who were in any painful or dangerous ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and had a good hope from the thankfulneſs he ſhewed, that my labour was not in vain.</p>
               <p>Sun. July 3. Immediately after the holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I mentioned to Mrs. Williamſon (Mr. Cauſton's neice) ſome things which I thought reproveable in her behaviour. At this ſhe appeared extremely angry, and ſaid, <hi>She did not expect ſuch uſage from me;</hi> and at the turn of the ſtreet (through which we were walking home) went abruptly away. The next day Mrs. Cauſton endeavoured to excuſe her, told me, She was exceedingly grieved for what had paſſed the day before, and deſired me to tell her in writing what I diſliked; which I accordingly did the day following.</p>
               <p>But firſt, I ſent Mr. Cauſton the following note:

               <p>Wedneſ. 6.

               <p>Sat. 9. Meeting with a Frenchman of New Orleans on the Miſſiſippi, who had lived ſeveral months among the Chicaſaws, he gave us a full and particular account of many things which had been variouſly related. And hence we could not but remark, What is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of nature properly ſo called; or, that religion which flows from natural reaſon, unaſſiſted by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that, even in thoſe who have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many truths; and who converſe with their beloved ones day and night. But too plainly does it appear by the fruits, <hi>That the gods of theſe Heathens to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of his account was this; Some years paſt the Chicaſaws and French were friends. The French were then mingled with the Nautchee Indians, whom they uſed as ſlaves; till the Nautchees made a general riſing, and took many of the French, priſoners. But ſoon after, a French army ſet upon them, killed many and carried away the reſt. Among thoſe that were killed were ſome Chicaſaws, whoſe death the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſaw nation reſented; and ſoon after a French boat was going through their country, they fired into it,

On the 25th, they were attacked by two hundred Chicaſaws. The French attempted to force their way through them. Five or ſix and twenty did ſo; the reſt were taken priſoners. The priſoners were ſent two or three to a town to be burnt. Only the commanding officer and one or two more were put to death on the place of the engagement."</p>
               <p>"I (ſaid he) and one more, were ſaved by the warrior who took us. The manner of burning the reſt was, holding lighted canes to their arms and legs and ſeveral parts of their bodies for ſome time, and then for a while taking them away. They likewiſe ſtuck burning pieces of wood into their fleſh all round, in which condition they kept them from morning till evening. But they commonly beat them before they burn them. I ſaw the prieſt that was with us carried to be burnt: and from head to foot, he was as black as your coat with the blows which they had given him."</p>
               <p>I aſked him, "What was their manner of life?" He ſaid, "They do nothing but eat, and drink, and ſmoak, from morning till night, and in a manner from night till morning. For they riſe at any hour of the night when they wake; and after eating and drinking as much as they can, go to ſleep again." See <hi>The religion of nature</hi> truly <hi>delineated!</hi>

               <p>Wedneſ. 27. I rejoiced to meet once more with that good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt, Auguſt Spangenberg; with whom on Monday, Auguſt 1, I began my long intended journey to Ebenezer. In the way I told him, "The calm we had ſo long enjoyed, was now draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an end: that I hoped he would ſhortly ſee I was not (as ſome had told him) a reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but was determined (God being my helper) to behave indifferently to all, rich or poor, friends or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies." I then aſked his advice as to the difficulty I foreſaw, and reſolved, by God's grace to follow it.</p>
               <p>In the evening we came to New Ebenezer, where the poor Saltzburghers are ſettled. The induſtry of this people is quite ſurprizing. Their ſixty huts are neatly and regularly built; and all the little ſpots of ground between them, improved to the beſt advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. One ſide of the town, is a field of Indian corn; on the other are the plantations of ſeveral private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: all which together one would ſcarce think it poſſible for a handful of people to have done in one year.</p>

               <p>The evening leſſon on Tueſday, was the 11th of the Hebrews; in reading which I was more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly encouraged by his example, who <hi>choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The leſſon on Wedneſday began with theſe words, <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we are compaſt about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight—and run with patience the race that is ſet before us: looking unto Jeſus the author and ſiniſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>

               <p>In the Thurſday leſſon were theſe comfortable words, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee. So that we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of St. James, read on Friday were, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation:</hi> and thoſe on Saturday, <hi>My brethren, Have not the faith of our Lord Jeſus-Chriſt—with reſpect of perſons.</hi>

So that on Sunday 14, more were preſent at the morning prayers, than had been for ſome months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Many of them obſerved thoſe words in the firſt leſſon, <hi>Set Naboth on high among the people; and ſet two men, ſons of Belial, before him, to bear witneſs againſt him.</hi>

               <p>Tueſ. 16. Mrs. Williamſon ſwore to and ſigned an affidavit, inſinuating much more than it aſſerted; but aſſerting, "That Mr. Weſley had many times propoſed marriage to her, all which propoſals ſhe had rejected." Of this I deſired a copy: Mr. Cauſton replied, "Sir, You may have one from any of the News papers in America."</p>
               <p>On Thurſday or Friday was delivered out a liſt of twenty-ſix men, who were to meet as a grand jury, on Monday the 22d. But this liſt was called in the next day, and twenty-four names added to it. Of this grand jury (forty-four of whom only met) one was a Frenchman, who did not underſtand Engliſh, one a papiſt, one a profeſt Infidel, three Baptiſts, ſixteen or ſeventeen others, Diſſenters, and ſeveral others who had perſonal quarrels againſt me, and had openly vowed revenge.</p>
               <p>To <hi>this</hi> grand jury, on Monday the 22d, Mr. Cauſton gave a long and earneſt charge, <hi>To beware of ſpiritual tyranny, and to oppoſe the now, illegal authority which was uſurped over their conſciences.</hi> Then Mrs. Williamſon's affidavit was read: after which Mr. Cauſton <hi>delivered to the grand jury,</hi> a paper intitled</p>

               <p>This was ſigned by twelve of the grand jurors, of whom three were conſtables, and ſix more, tything<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: who conſequently would have made a majority, had the jury conſiſted, as it regularly ſhould have done, of only fifteen members, viz. the four conſtables and eleven tythingmen.</p>
               <p>Friday, Sept. 30. Having ended the homilies, I began reading Dr. Rogers's eight ſermons to the congregation: hoping they might be a timely anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the poiſon of infidelity, which was now with great induſtry propagated among us.</p>
               <p>October the 7th, I conſulted my friends, whether God did not call me, to return to England? The reaſon for which I left it had now no force; there being no poſſibility as yet of inſtructing the Indians: neither had I as yet found or heard of any Indians on the continent of America, who had the leaſt deſire of being inſtructed. And as to Savannah, having never engaged myſelf, either by word or letter, to ſtay there a day longer than I ſhould judge convenient, nor ever take charge of the people any otherwiſe, than as in my paſſage to the Heathens, I looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on myſelf to be fully diſcharged therefrom, by the vacating of that deſign. Beſides, there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of doing more ſervice to that unhappy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in England, than I could do in Georgia, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029861_0078_0FE2A941AB09CE98"/>without fear or favour to the truſtees, the real ſtate the colony was in. After deeply conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, they were unanimous, <hi>That I ought to go: but not yet.</hi> So I laid the thoughts of it aſide for the preſent: being perſuaded, that when the time was come, God would <hi>make the way plain before my face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. Oct. 15. Being at Highgate, a village five miles from Savannah, conſiſting of (all but one) French families, who, I found, knew but little of the Engliſh tongue, I offered to read prayers there in French every Saturday in the afternoon. They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the offer gladly. On Saturday the 22d I read prayers in German likewiſe, to the German villagers of Hampſtead: and ſo continued to do, once a week. We began the ſervice (both at Highgate and Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead) with ſinging a pſalm. Then I read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained a chapter in the French or German teſtament, and concluded with prayers and another pſalm.</p>
               <p>Sat. Oct. 22. Some of the French of Savannah were preſent at the prayers at Highgate. The next day I received a meſſage from them all, "That as I read prayers to the French of Highgate, who were but few, they hoped I would do the ſame to thoſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, where there was a large number who did not underſtand Engliſh." Sund. 30, I began ſo to do: and now I had full employment for that holy day. The firſt Engliſh prayers laſted from five till half an hour paſt ſix. The Italian (which I read to a few Vaudois) began at nine. The ſecond ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Engliſh (including the ſermon and the holy communion) continued from half an hour paſt ten, till about half an hour paſt twelve. The French ſervice began at one. At two I catechiſed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. About three began the Engliſh ſervice. After this was ended, I had the happineſs of joining with as many as my largeſt room would hold, in reading,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029861_0079_0FE2A9433A7B1D78"/>prayer, and ſinging praiſe. And about ſix the ſervice of the Moravians, ſo called, began: at which I was glad to be preſent, not as a teacher, but a learner.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. Nov. 3. I appeared again, at the court holden on that day: and again, at the court held Tueſday, Nov. 22. On which day Mr. Cauſton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with me. He then read me ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits which had been made, Sept. 15, laſt paſt: in one of which it was affirmed, "That I then abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Cauſton in his own houſe, calling him liar, villain, and ſo on." It was now likewiſe repeated before ſeveral perſons (which indeed I had forgot) "That I had been reprimanded at the laſt court, for an enemy to, and hinderer of, the public peace."</p>
               <p>I again conſulted my friends, who agreed with me, that the time we looked for was now come. And the next morning calling on Mr. Cauſton, I told him, "I deſigned to ſet out for England immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly." I ſet up an advertiſement in the Great-ſquare to the ſame effect, and quietly prepared for my journey.</p>
               <p>Fri. Dec. 2. I propoſed to ſet out for Carolina about noon, the tide then ſerving. But about ten the magiſtrates ſent for me, and told me, "I muſt not go out of the province; for I had not anſwered the allegations laid againſt me." I replied, <hi>I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at ſix or ſeven courts ſucceſſively, in order to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. But I was not ſuffered ſo to do, when I deſired it time after time.</hi> Then they ſaid, "However, I muſt not go, unleſs I would give ſecurity to anſwer thoſe allegations at their court." I aſked, "What ſecurity?" After conſulting together about two hours, the Recorder ſhewed me a kind of bond, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging me under a penalty of fifty pounds, to appear at their court when I ſhould be required. He added, <hi>But Mr. Williamſon too has deſired of us, that you ſhould give bail to anſwer his action.</hi> I then told him plainly,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029861_0080_0FE2A944CFF24298"/>
                  <hi>Sir, you uſe me very ill, and ſo you do the truſtees. I will give neither any bond, nor any bail at all. You know your buſineſs, and I know mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the afternoon the magiſtrates publiſhed an order, requiring all the officers and centinels, to prevent my going out of the province; and forbidding any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to do. Being now only a priſoner at large, in a place where I knew by experience, every day would give freſh opportunity, to procure evidence of words I never ſaid, and actions I never did; I ſaw clearly the hour was come for leaving this place: and as ſoon as evening prayers were over, about eight o'clock, the tide then ſerving, I ſhook off the duſt of my feet, and left Georgia, after having preached the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there (not as I ought, but as I was able) one year, and nearly nine months.</p>
               <p>During this time I had frequent opportunities of making many obſervations and enquiries, concerning the real ſtate of thie province (which has been ſo variouſly repreſented) the Engliſh ſettlements therein, and the Indians that have intercourſe with them. Theſe I minuted down from time to time; a ſmall extract of which I have ſubjoined.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Georgia lies in the 30th and 31ſt degree of north latitude. The air is generally clear, the rains being much ſhorter, as well as heavier, than in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The dews are very great. Thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are expected almoſt every day, in May, June, July, and Auguſt. They are very terrible, eſpecially to a ſtranger. During thoſe months, from ten in the morning to four in the afternoon, the ſun is extremely ſcorching. But the ſea-breeze generally blows, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en till three or four. The winter is nearly of the ſame length as in England. But the mid-day ſun is always warm, even when the mornings and evenings are very ſharp, and the nights piercing cold.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:029861_0081_0FE2A9465C5111B8"/>
2. The land is of four ſorts, pine-barren, oak-land, ſwamp and marſh. The pine-land is of far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt extent, eſpecially near the ſea-coaſts. The ſoil of this is a dry, whitiſh ſand, producing ſhrubs of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts, and between them a ſpiry, coarſe graſs, which cattle do not love to feed on. But here and there is a little of a better kind, eſpecially in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannahs (ſo they call the low, watry meadows, which are uſually intermixed with pine-lands). It bears na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally two ſorts of fruit, wortle-berries (much like thoſe in England) and Chincopin-nuts; a dry, harſh nut, about the ſize of a ſmall acorn. A laborious man may in one year clear and plant four or five acres of this land: it will produce the firſt year, from two to four buſhels of Indian corn, and from four to eight of Indian peaſe <hi>per</hi> acre. The ſecond year it uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bears half as much; the third, leſs; the fourth, nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Vines, mulberries and peach-trees it bears well. The white mulberry is not good to eat. The black is about the ſize of a black-berry, and has much the ſame flavour. In freſh pine-land, Indian potatoes grow well (which are more luſcious and larger than the Iriſh). And ſo do water-melons and ſewee-beans, about the ſize of our ſcarlet, but to be ſhelled and eaten like Windſor beans.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Oak-land commonly lies in narrow ſtreaks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween pine-land and ſome ſwamp, creek or river. The ſoil is a blackiſh ſand, producing ſeveral kinds of oak (though none exactly like the Engliſh) bay, laurel, aſh, walnut, ſumac-trees, gum-trees (a fort of ſycamore) dog-trees (covered in ſpring with large white flowers) and many hickory-trees, which bear a bad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd of walnut. In the moiſteſt part of this land ſome parſimmon-trees grew (which bear a ſort of yellow, clear, luſcious plumb) and a few mulberry and cherry-trees. The common wild grapes are of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029861_0082_0FE2A94E51E6A828"/>two ſorts, both red: the fox-grape grows two or three only on a ſtalk, is thick-ſkinned, large-ſtoned, of a harſh taſte, and of the ſize of a ſmall Kentiſh cherry. The cluſter-grape is of a harſh taſte too, and about the ſize of a white currant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This land requires much labour to clear; but when it is cleared, it will bear any grain, for three, four, or ſometimes five years, without laying any manure upon it. An acre of it generally bears ten buſhels of Indian corn, beſides five of peaſe, in a year. So that this at preſent is juſtly eſteemed the moſt valuable land in the province.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſwamp is, any low, watry place, which is covered with trees or canes. They are here of three ſorts, cypreſs, river and cane ſwamps. Cypreſs ſwamps are, moſtly, large ponds, in and round which cypreſſes grow. Moſt river-ſwamps are overflown every tide, by the river which runs through or near them. If they were drained, they would produce good rice; as would the cane-ſwamps alſo; which in the mean time are the beſt feeding for all ſorts of cattle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The marſhes are of two ſorts: ſoft marſh, which is all a quagmire, and abſolutely good for nothing: and hard-marſh, which is a firm, but barren ſand, bearing only ſower ruſhes. Marſhes of both ſorts abound on the ſea iſlands, which are very numerous and contain all ſorts of land. And upon theſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, near creeks and runs of water, juniper-trees and cedars grow.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Savannah ſtands on a flat <hi>bluff</hi> (ſo they term any high-land hanging over a creek or river) which riſes forty-five feet perpendicular from the river, and commands it ſeveral miles both upward and downward. The ſoil is a white ſand for above a mile in breadth, ſouth-eaſt and north-weſt. Beyond this, eaſtward, is a river-ſwamp; weſtward a ſmall wood, in which was the old Indian town. On the other ſide of the river
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029861_0083_0FE2A94FE3226A50"/>is a marſhy iſland, covered with large trees. South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt of the town is a large pine-barren, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends backward to a branch of the Altamahaw river.</p>
               <p n="9">9. St. Simon's iſland, having on the ſouth-caſt the gulph of Florida; on the other ſides, branches of the Altamahaw, is about one hundred miles ſouth of Savannah, and extends in length about twenty, in breadth from two to five miles. On the weſt ſide of it, on a low bluff, ſtands Frederica, having woods to the north and ſouth; to the eaſt, partly woods, partly ſavannahs, and partly marſhes. The ſoil is moſtly a blackiſh ſand. There is not much pine-land on the iſland; the greateſt part being oak-land, intermixed with many ſavannahs, and old Spaniſh or Indian fields.</p>
               <p n="10">10. On the ſea-point, about five miles ſouth-eaſt of the town, is the fort where the ſoldiers are ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the ſtorehouſe in Frederica better deſerves that name; being encompaſſed with regular ramparts of earth, and a paliſaded ditch, and mounted with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which intirely command the river.</p>
               <p n="11">11. About twenty miles north-weſt from St. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's is Darien, the ſettlement of the Scotch High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, a mile from Fort King George, which was built about ſeventeen and abandoned about eleven years ſince. The town lies on the main-land, cloſe to a branch of the Altamahaw, on a bluff about thirty feet above the river, having woods on all ſides. The ſoil is a blackiſh ſand. They built at firſt many ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered huts; but laſt ſpring (1736) expecting the Spaniards, they built themſelves a large fort, and all retired within the walls of it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Auguſta, diſtant from Savannah one hundred and fifty miles, and five from old Savannah Town, is deſigned to ſtand in an old Indian field, on a bluff, about thirty feet high. A ſmall fort of wooden piles was built there in 1737; but no houſe was then built,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029861_0084_0FE2A9517174F708"/>nor any more ground cleared, than Mr. Lacy and his men found ſo.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Old Ebenezer, where the Saltzburghers ſettled at firſt, lies twenty-five miles weſt of Savannah. A ſmall creek runs by the town, down to the river, and many brooks run between the little hills: but the ſoil is a hungry, barren ſand; and upon any ſudden ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the brooks riſe ſeveral feet perpendicular, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow whatever is near them. Since the Saltzburghers removed, two Engliſh families have been placed there: but theſe too ſay, <hi>That the land is good for nothing; and that the creek is of little uſe: it being by water twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles to the river; and the water generally ſo low in ſummer-time, that a boat cannot come within ſix or ſeven miles of the town.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. New Ebenezer, to which the Saltzburghers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, in March 1736, lies ſix miles eaſtward from the old, on a high bluff, near the Savannah river. Here are ſome tracts of fruitful land, though the greateſt part of that adjoining to the town, is pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barren. The huts, ſixty in number, are neatly and regularly built; the little piece of ground allotted to each for a garden, is every where put to the beſt uſe, no ſpot being left unplanted. Nay, even one of the main ſtreets, being one more than was as yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bore them this year a crop of Indian corn.</p>
               <p n="15">15. About ten miles eaſt of this, on a creek, three miles from the river, was the village of Abercorn. Ten families ſettled here in 1733; but it is now without inhabitants. Four miles below the mouth of Abercorn-creek in Joſeph's-town, is the ſettlement of two Scotch gentlemen. A mile below was Sir Francis Bathurſt's plantation. And a quarter of a mile from this, Walter Auguſtine's ſettlement. But both theſe are left without inhabitant.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A mile below this is Capt. Williams's plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: a mile from thence, Mrs. Matthews's, (late
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029861_0085_0FE2A95303BF5DA8"/>Muſgrove) commonly known by the name of the Cowpens: adjoining to which is the land belonging ſo Capt. Watſon; on which is an unfiniſhed houſe, ſwiftly running to ruin. A mile from this is Irene, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſtands on a ſmall, round hill, in a little piece of fruitful ground, given by the Indians to Mr. Ingham. The Indian town is within a furlong of it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Five miles ſouth-weſt of Savannah, on a ſmall riſe, ſtands the village of Highgate. It has pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on three ſides, and a ſwamp on the fourth. Twelve families were placed here in 1733; nine whereof remain there. A mile eaſtward of this is Hampſtead, ſettled with twelve families alſo, a little before Highgate; five of which are ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Six miles ſouth-eaſt of Savannah is Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt. Three families are ſettled here, near a ſmall, ruinous fort: four miles ſouth of this is the iſland of Skidoway: on the north-eaſt point whereof ten fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were placed in 1734; (a ſmall fort was built here likewiſe) but nine of them are either dead, or removed to other places. A ſmall creek divides Skidoway from Tybee iſland, on the ſouth-eaſt part of which, fronting the inlet, the light-houſe is built. Ten families were ſettled here in 1734; but they are part dead, and part removed, ſo that the iſland is now again without any fixed inhabitant.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Twelve miles ſouthward from Savannah (by land) is Mr. Houſtoun's plantation: and forty or fifty miles from him, up Ogeechy river, that where Mr. Sterling for ſome time lived. Fort Argyle ſtands twenty miles from this, on a high bluff, by the river Ogeechy. It is a ſmall, ſquare, wooden fort, muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. Ten freeholders were ſettled near it; but eight of them are gone, and the land they had clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029861_0086_0FE2A95AF51D9860"/>lying waſte, will in a few years be as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The ſouthernmoſt ſettlement in Georgia, is Fort St. Andrew. It ſtands fifty miles ſouth of Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derica, on the ſouth-weſt ſide of Cumberland-iſland, upon a high neck of land, which commands the river both ways. The walls are of wood, filled up with earth, round which are a ditch and paliſade.</p>
               <p n="21">21. It is hard to pick out any conſiſtent account of the Georgian Indians, from the contradictory relations of their traders. The following is extracted, partly from thoſe wherein all, or the generality of them agree; partly from the relations of ſuch as have been occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amongſt them, and have no intereſt in making them better or worſe than they are.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Of the Georgian Indians in general it may be obſerved, That they are not ſo properly nations, as tribes or clans, who have wandered thither at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times; perhaps expelled their native countries by ſtronger tribes; but how or when they cannot tell, being none of them able to give any rational account of themſelves. They are inured to hardſhips of all kinds, and ſurpriſingly patient of pain. But as they have no letters, ſo they have no religion, no laws, no civil government. Nor have they any kings or princes, properly ſpeaking; their Meekos or head-men, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no power either to command or puniſh, no man obeying them any farther than he pleaſes. So that every one doth what is right in his own eyes; and if it appears wrong to his neighbour, the perſon aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſually ſteals on the other unawares, and ſhoots him, ſcalps him, or cuts off his ears: having only two ſhort rules of proceeding, to do what be will, and what he can.</p>
               <p n="23">23. They are likewiſe all, except (perhaps) the Choctaws, gluttons, drunkards, thieves, diſſemblers,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029861_0087_0FE2A95CC71CF7F8"/>liars. They are implacable, unmerciful: murderers of fathers, murderers of mothers, murderers of their own children: it being a common thing for a ſon to ſhoot his father or mother, becauſe they are old and paſt labour; and for a woman either to procure abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to throw her child into the next river, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe will go with her huſband to the war. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed huſbands, ſtrictly ſpeaking, they have none: for any man leaves his wife (ſo called) at pleaſure, who, frequently, in return, cuts the throats of all the children ſhe has had by him. Whoredom they account no crime, and few inſtances appear of a young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian woman's refuſing any one. Nor have they any fixed puniſhment for adultery; only, if the huſband take his wife with another man, he will do what he can to both, unleſs ſpeedily pacified by the preſent of a gun or a blanket.</p>

The Choctaws only have ſome appearance of an entire nation, poſſeſſing a large extent of land, eight or nine hundred miles weſt of Savannah, and many well inhabited towns. They are ſaid to have ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, united under one head. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are in league with the French, who have ſent ſome prieſts among them; by whom (if one may credit the Choctaw traders) ten or twelve have been baptized.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Next to theſe, to the north-eaſt, are the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſaws: Their country is flat, full of meadows, ſprings and rivers. In their fields, though ſix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

They are eminently gluttons, eating, drinking, and ſmoaking all day, and almoſt all night. They are extreme indolent and lazy, except in war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> then they are the moſt indefatigable, and the moſt valiant of all the Indians; but they are equally cruel
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029861_0088_0FE2A91D7370DE78"/>with the reſt, torturing and burning all their priſoners, whether Indian or European.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Eaſt of them, in the latitude of 35 and 36, about three or four hundred miles from Savannah, lie the Cherokees. Their country is very mountainous, fruitful, and pleaſant. They have fifty-two towns, and above three thouſand fighting men. In each town are three or more head-men, who keep up a ſort of ſhadow of government, having power to ſet the reſt to work, and to puniſh ſuch as will not join in the common labour. They are civil to ſtrangers, and will do any thing for them, <hi>for pay;</hi> being always willing, for a ſmall piece of money, to carry a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for fifty or ſixty miles, and, if required, a heavy burthen too: but they are equally cruel to priſoners with the Chicaſaws, though not equally valiant. They are ſeldom intemperate in drinking, but when they can be ſo on free-coſt. Otherwiſe, love of drink yields to covetouſneſs: a vice ſcarcely to be found in any Indian but a Cherokee.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The Uchees have only one ſmall town left (near two hundred miles from Savannah) and about forty fighting men. The Creeks have been many times on the point of cutting them off. They are indeed hated by moſt, and deſpiſed by all the other nations, as well for their cowardice, as their ſuperlative diligence in thieving, and for out-lying all the Indians upon the continent.</p>
               <p n="28">28. The Creek Indians are about four hundred miles from Savannah. They are ſaid to be bounded on the weſt by the Choctaws, to the north by the Chicaſaws, to the eaſt by the Cherokees, and to the ſouth by the Alatamahaw river. They have many towns, a plain, well-watered country, and fifteen hundred ſighting men. They have often three or four Meekos in a town; but without ſo much as the ſhadow of authority, only to give advice, which every one is at
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029861_0089_0FE2A960A17C9220"/>liberty to take or leave. But age and reputation for valour and wiſdom, have given Chicali, a Meeko of the Coweta-town, a more than ordinary influence over the nation; though not even the ſhew of regal power. Yet neither age, wiſdom nor reputation can reſtrain him from drunkenneſs. Indeed all the Creeks, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been moſt converſant with white men, are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with an inſatiate love of drink, as well as many other European vices, They are more exquiſite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers than the reſt of their countrymen. They know not what friendſhip or gratitude means. They ſhew no inclination to learn any thing; but leaſt of all, Chriſtianity; being full as opiniated of their own parts and wiſdom, as either the modern Chineſe, or ancient Romans.</p>
               <p>Sat. Dec. 3. We came to Purryſburg early in the morning, and endeavoured to procure a guide to Port-Royal. But none being to be had, we ſet out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one, an hour before ſun-riſe. After walking two or three hours, we met with an old man, who led us into a ſmall path, near which was a line of <hi>blazed</hi> trees, (i. e. marked by cutting off part of the bark) by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing which, he ſaid, we might eaſily come to Port-Royal in five or ſix hours.</p>
               <p>We were four in all; one of whom intended to go to England with me; the other two to ſettle in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. About eleven we came into a large ſwamp, where we wandered about till near two. We then found another <hi>blaze,</hi> and purſued it, till it divided into two; one of theſe we followed through an almoſt impaſſable thicket, a mile beyond which it ended. We made through the thicket again, and traced the other <hi>blaze</hi> till that ended too. It now grew toward ſun-ſet, ſo we ſat down, faint and weary, having had no food all day, except a ginger-bread cake, which I had taken in my pocket. A third of this we had divided among us at noon; another third we took
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029861_0090_0FE2A9660EE79128"/>now; the reſt we reſerved for the morning; but we had met with no water all the day. Thruſting a ſtick into the ground, and finding the end of it moiſt, two of our company fell a digging with their hands, and at about three feet depth, found water. We thanked God, drank, and were refreſhed. The night was ſharp; however, there was no complaining among us; but after having commended ourſelves to God, we lay down cloſe together, and (I at leaſt) ſlept till near ſix in the morning.</p>
               <p>Sun. Dec. 24. God renewing our ſtrength, we aroſe neither faint nor weary, and reſolved to make one trial more, to find out a path to Port-Royal. We ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ed due eaſt; but finding neither path nor blaze, and the woods growing thicker and thicker, we judged it would be our beſt courſe to return, if we could, by the way we came. The day before, in the thickeſt part of the woods, I had broke many young trees, I knew not why, as we walked along: theſe we found a great help in ſeveral places, where no path was to be ſeen; and between one and two God brought us ſafe to Benjamin Arieu's houſe, the old man we left the day before.</p>
               <p>In the evening I read French prayers to a numerous family, a mile from Mr. Arieu's; one of whom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to guide us to Port-Royal. In the morning we ſet out. About ſun-ſet, we aſked our guide, if he knew where he was? Who frankly anſwered, No. However, we puſhed on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wedneſ. 7. We walked to Beaufort; where Mr. Jones (the miniſter of Beaufort) with whom I lodged during my ſhort ſtay here, gave me a lively idea of the old Engliſh hoſpitality. On Thurſ. Mr. Delamotte came; with whom, on Friday the 9th, I took boat
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029861_0091_0FE2A9685C0CE498"/>for Charleſton. After a ſlow paſſage by reaſon of contrary winds, and ſome conflict (our proviſions fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort) with hunger as well as cold, we came thither early in the morning, on Tueſday the 13th. Here I expected trials of a different kind, and far more dangerous. For contempt and want are eaſy to be borne: but who can bear reſpect and abundance?</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 14. Being deſired to read public prayers, I was much refreſhed with thoſe glorious promiſes, contained both in the 72d Pſalm, and in the firſt leſſon, the 40th chapter of Iſaiah.

               <p>Sat. 24. We ſailed over Charleſton bar, and about noon loſt ſight of land.</p>
               <p>The next day the wind was fair, but high, as it was on Sunday 25, when the ſea affected me more than it had done in the ſixteen weeks of our paſſage to America. I was obliged to lie down the greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Mon. 26. I began inſtructing a negro-lad in the principles of Chriſtianity. The next day I reſolved to break off living delicately, and return to my old ſimplicity of diet: and after I did ſo, neither my ſtomach nor my head much complained of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhip.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 28. Finding the unaccountable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of I know not what danger (the wind being ſmall, and the ſea ſmooth) which had been upon me ſeveral days, increaſe; I cried earneſtly for help; and it pleaſed God as in a moment to reſtore peace to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Let me obſerve hereon, 1. That not one of theſe hours ought to paſs out of my remembrance, till I attain another manner of ſpirit, a ſpirit equally willing to glorify God by life or by death. 2. That whoever is uneaſy on any account (bodily pain alone except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) carries in himſelf his own conviction, that he is ſo far an unbeliever. Is he uneaſy at the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of death? Then he believeth not, That <hi>to die is gain.</hi> At any of the events of life, then he hath not a firm belief, That <hi>all things work together for</hi> his <hi>good.</hi> And if he bring the matter cloſe, he will always find, beſide the general want of faith, every particular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs is evidently owing to the want of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtian temper.</p>

Sun. Jan. 1, 1738. All in the ſhip (except the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſteerſman) were preſent both at the morning and evening ſervice, and appeared as deeply attentive, as even the poor people of Frederica did, while the word of God was new to their ears. And it may be, one or two among theſe likewiſe, may <hi>bring forth fruit with patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mon. 2. Being ſorrowful and very heavy (though I could give no particular reaſon for it) and utterly unwilling to ſpeak cloſe to any of my little flock (about twenty perſons) I was in doubt, whether my neglect of them was not one cauſe of my own heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? In the evening therefore, I began inſtructing the cabin-boy; after which I was much eaſier.</p>
               <p>I went ſeveral times the following days, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſpeak to the ſailors, but could not, I mean, I was quite averſe from ſpeaking; I could not ſee how to make an occaſion, and it ſeemed quite abſurd to ſpeak without. Is not this what men commonly mean by, "I could not ſpeak?" And is this a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of ſilence, or no? Is it a prohibition from the Good Spirit? Or a temptation from nature or the evil one? Fri. 6. I ended the abridgment of Mr. de Renty's life. O that ſuch a life ſhould be related by ſuch a hiſtorian! Who by inſerting all, if not more than all the weak things that holy man ever ſaid or did, by his commendation of almoſt every action or word which either deſerved or needed it not; and by his injudicious manner of relating many others, which were indeed highly commendable; has caſt the ſhade of ſuperſtition and folly over one of the brighteſt patterns of heavenly wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Sat. 7. I began to read and explain ſome paſſages of the bible to the young negro. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, another negro who was on board, deſired to be a hearer too. From them I went to the poor French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who underſtanding no Engliſh, had none elſe
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029861_0094_0FE2A9736E408BB0"/>in the ſhip with whom he could converſe. And from this time, I read and explained to him a chapter in the teſtament every morning.</p>
               <p>Sun. 8. In the fulneſs of my heart, I wrote the following words:</p>
               <p>By the moſt infallible of proofs, inward feeling, I am convinced</p>

               <p>On Mond. 9, and the following days, I reflected much on that vain deſire, which had purſued me for ſo many years, of being in ſolitude, in order to be a Chriſtian. I have now, thought I, ſolitude enough. But am I therefore the nearer being a Chriſtian? Not if Jeſus Chriſt be the model of Chriſtianity, I doubt indeed I am much nearer that myſtery of Satan, which ſome writers affect to call by that name. So near, that I had probably ſunk wholly into it, had not the great mercy of God juſt now thrown me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reading St. Cyprian's works. <hi>O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret!

               </p>
               <p>Frid. 13. We had a thorough ſtorm, which obliged us to ſhut all cloſe, the ſea breaking over the ſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. I was at firſt afraid; but cried to God and was ſtrengthened. Before ten I lay down. I bleſs God, without fear. About midnight we were awaked by a confuſed noiſe, of ſeas and wind and men's voices, the like to which I had never heard before. The ſound of the ſea breaking over, and againſt the ſides of the ſhip, I could compare to nothing but large cannon, or American thunder. The rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtarting, quivering motion of the ſhip, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled what is ſaid of earthquakes. The captain was upon deck in an inſtant. But his men could not hear what he ſaid. It blew a complete harricane; which beginning at ſouth weſt, then went weſt, north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, north, and in a quarter of an hour, round by the eaſt to the ſouth-weſt point again. At the ſame
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029861_0096_0FE2A976F7D05C50"/>time the ſea running (as they term it) mountain high, and that from many different points at once, the ſhip would not obey the helm; nor indeed could the ſteerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, through the violent rain, ſee the compaſs. So he was forced to let her run before the wind, and in half an hour the ſtreſs of the ſtorm was over.</p>
               <p>About noon the next day it ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>I no ſooner executed this reſolution, than my ſpirit revived; ſo that from this day I had no more of that fearfulneſs and heavineſs, which before almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually weighed me down.

in the morning (the wind continuing ſoutherly) the clouds began to fly juſt contrary to the wind, and to the ſurprize of us all, ſunk down under the ſun, ſo that at noon we had an exact obſervation; and by this we found we were as well as we could deſire, about eleven leagues ſouth of Scilly.</p>

               <p>Here the wind turned againſt us, and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blew freſh, ſo that we expected (the tide being likewiſe ſtrong againſt us) to be driven ſome leagues backward in the night: but in the morning, to our great ſurprize, we ſaw Beachy-head juſt before us, and found we had gone forwards near forty miles.</p>
               <p>Toward evening was a calm; but in the night a ſtrong north-wind brought us ſafe into the Downs. The day before Mr. Whitefield had failed out, neither of us then knowing any thing of the other. At four in the morning we took boat, and in half an hour landed at Deal: it being Wedneſday, February 1. the anniverſary feſtival in Georgia for Mr. Oglethorpe's landing there.</p>
               <p>It is now two years and almoſt four months, ſince I left my native country, in order to teach the Georgian Indians, the nature of Chriſtianity: but what have I learned myſelf in the mean time? Why (what I the leaſt of all ſuſpected) that I who went to America to convert others, was never myſelf converted to God.
<note n="*" place="bottom">I am not ſere of this.</note> 
                  <hi>I am not mad,</hi> though I thus ſpeak; but <hi>I ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs;</hi> If haply ſome of thoſe who ſtill <hi>dream</hi> may <hi>awake,</hi> and ſee, that as I am, ſo are they.—</p>
               <p>Are they read in <hi>philoſophy?</hi> So was I. In ancient or modern <hi>tongues?</hi> So was I alſo. Are they verſed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029861_0099_0FE2A98225657C80"/>in the <hi>ſcience</hi> of <hi>divinity?</hi> I too have ſtudied it many years. Can they talk fluently upon ſpiritual things? The very ſame could I do. Are they plenteous in <hi>alms?</hi> Behold, I gave all my goods to feed the poor. Do they give of their labour as well as of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? I have laboured more abundantly than they all. Are they willing to ſuffer for their brethren? I have thrown up my friends, reputation, eaſe, country; I have put my life in my hand, wandering into ſtrange lands; I have given my body to be devoured by the deep, parched up with heat, conſumed by toil and wearineſs, or whatſoever God ſhould pleaſe to bring upon me. But does all this (be it more or leſs, it matters not) make me acceptable to God? Does all I ever did or can <hi>know, ſay, give, do,</hi> or <hi>ſuffer,</hi> juſtify me in his ſight? Yea, or <hi>the conſtant uſe of all the means of grace?</hi> (which nevertheleſs is meet, right, and our bounden duty). Or, that <hi>I know nothing of myſelf,</hi> that I am as touching outward, moral righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, blameleſs? Or (to come cloſer yet) the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>rational conviction</hi> of all the truths of Chriſtianity? Does all this give me a claim to the holy, heavenly, divine character of <hi>a Chriſtian?</hi> By no means. If the oracles of God are true, if we are ſtill to abide by <hi>the law and the teſtimony;</hi> all theſe things, though when ennobled by faith in Chriſt, they are holy, and juſt and good, yet without it are <hi>dung and droſs,</hi> meet only to be purged away by <hi>the ſire that never ſhall be quenched.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This then have I learned in the ends of the earth, that I am <hi>fallen ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> that my whole heart is <hi>altogether corrupt and abominable,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently my whole life (ſeeing it cannot be, that <hi>an evil tree</hi> ſhould <hi>bring forth good fruit):</hi> that <hi>alienated</hi>

               <p>If it be ſaid, that I have faith (for many ſuch things have I heard, from many miſerable comforters) I anſwer, So have the devils,—<hi>a ſort</hi> of faith; but ſtill they are ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe.

            <head>AN EXTRACT OF THE REV. MR. JOHN WESLEY's JOURNAL, From February 1, 1738, To his return from Germany.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them which ſhould hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him to life everlaſting.

               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THAT <hi>men revile me and ſay all manner of evil againſt me,</hi> that <hi>I am become as it were a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto many,</hi> that the zealous of almoſt every deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination cry out, <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth:</hi> this gives me with regard to myſelf, no degree of uneaſineſs. For I know the ſcripture muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>If they have called the moſter of the houſe Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, how much more them of his houſehold?</hi> But it does give me a concern, with regard to thoſe, who by this artifice of the devil, are prevented from hearing that <hi>word, which is able to ſave their ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the ſake of theſe, and indeed of all who deſire to hear the truth of thoſe things which have been ſo variouſly related, I have been induced to publiſh this farther account: and I doubt not but it will even hence appear, to all candid and impartial judges, <hi>that</hi> I have <hi>hitherto lived in all good conſcience toward God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall be eaſily excuſed by thoſe who either <hi>love</hi> or ſeek <hi>the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity,</hi> for ſpeaking ſo largely of the Moravian church, <hi>a city</hi> which ought to be <hi>ſet upon an hill.</hi> Their light hath been too long hid <hi>under a buſhel:</hi> it is high time it ſhould at length break forth, and <hi>ſo ſhine before men, that</hi> others alſo <hi>may glorify their Father which is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If any ſhould aſk, "But do you think even this church is perfect, <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing?</hi>" I anſwer plainly, No; though I truſt it
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029861_0104_0FE2A991C932C068"/>will be, when <hi>patience has had its perfect work.</hi> But neither do I think it right, to entertain the world with the ſpots of God's children.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It has been farther aſked, "Whether I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine God is to be found, only among them?" I reply, "By no means. I know there is a God in England, and we need not go to ſeek him in ſtrange lands." I know that in our own he is very nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that call upon him: and therefore I think thoſe unwiſe (to ſay no more) who run to enquire after him in Holland or Germany.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When I went, the caſe was widely different. God had not then <hi>made bare his arm</hi> before us as he hath now done: in a manner (I will be bold to ſay) which had not been known either in Holland or Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, at that time, when he who ordered all things wiſely, according to the counſels of his own will, was pleaſed by me to open the intercourſe between the Engliſh and the Moravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The particular reaſon which obliged me to relate ſo much of the converſation I had with thoſe holy men, is this. In September, 1738, when I returned from Germany, I exhorted all I could to follow after that great ſalvation, which is through faith in the blood of Chriſt; waiting for it, <hi>in all the ordinances of God,</hi> and in <hi>doing good as they bad opportunity, to all men.</hi> And many found the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that ſalvation, <hi>being juſtified freely,</hi> having <hi>peace with God through Chriſt, rejoicing in hope of the glory of God,</hi> and having <hi>his love ſhed abroad in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But about September, 1739, while my brother and I were abſent, certain men crept in among them unawares, greatly <hi>troubling and ſubverting their ſouls:</hi> telling them, "They were in a deluſion, that they had deceived themſelves, and had <hi>no true faith</hi> at all. For (ſaid they) none has any juſtifying faith, who
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029861_0105_0FE2A99450940C90"/>has ever any doubt or fear (which you know you have) or who has not a clean heart, which you know you have not: nor will you ever have it, till you leave off uſing the means of grace (ſo called) till you leave off running to church and ſacrament, and praying, and ſinging, and reading either the bible, or any other book. For you can't <hi>uſe</hi> theſe things without <hi>truſting</hi> in them. Therefore, till you leave them off, you can never have true faith; you can never till then truſt in the blood of Chriſt."</p>
               <p n="9">9. And this doctrine from the beginning to this day has been taught, as the doctrine of the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian church. I think therefore it is my bounden duty, to clear the Moravians from this aſperſion. And the more, becauſe I am perhaps the only perſon now in England that both <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will</hi> do it. And I believe it is the peculiar providence of God that I <hi>can:</hi> that two years ſince the moſt eminent members of that church, ſhould ſo fully declare both their experience and judgment, touching the very points now in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſum of what has been aſſerted, as from them, is this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. "That a man <hi>can't have any degree</hi> of juſtifying faith, till he is wholly freed from all doubt and fear, and till he has (in the fall, proper ſenſe) a new, a clean heart."</p>
               <p n="2">2. "That a man <hi>may not uſe</hi> the ordinances of God, the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in particular, before he has ſuch a faith as excludes all doubt and fear, and implies a new, a clean heart."</p>
               <p>In flat oppoſition to this I aſſert,</p>
               <p n="1">1. "That a man <hi>may have a degree</hi> of juſtifying faith, before he is wholly freed from all doubt and fear, and before he has, in the full, proper ſenſe, a new, a clean heart."</p>
               <p n="2">

2. "That a man <hi>may uſe</hi> the ordinances of God, the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in particular, before he has ſuch a ſaith as excludes all doubt and fear, and implies a new, a clean heart."</p>
               <p>I farther aſſert, "This I learned (not only from the Engliſh, but alſo) from the Moravian church."</p>
               <p>And I hereby openly and earneſtly call upon that church (and upon Count Zinzendorf in particular, who I truſt is not aſhamed nor afraid to avow any part of the goſpel of Chriſt) to correct me and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves, if I have miſunderſtood or miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them.</p>

               <head>JOURNAL From <hi>Feb.</hi> 1, 1738, to <hi>Sept.</hi> 16, 1738.</head>
               <p>WEDNESDAY, Feb. 1. After reading prayers and explaining a portion of ſcripture to a large company at the inn, I left Deal, and came in the evening to Feverſham.</p>
               <p>I here read prayers, and explained the 2d leſſon, to a few of thoſe who were called Chriſtians, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were more ſavage in their behaviour than the wildeſt Indians I have yet met with.</p>
               <p>Fri. 3. I came to Mr. Delamotte's at Blendo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, where I expected a cold reception. But God had prepared the way before me: and I no ſooner men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned my name, than I was welcomed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as conſtrained me to ſay, <hi>Surely God is in this place, and I knew it not! Bleſſed be ye of the Lord! Ye have ſhewn more kindneſs in the latter and than in the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening I came once more to London, whence I had been abſent two years and near four months.</p>
               <p>Many reaſons I have to bleſs God, though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign I went upon did not take effect, for my having been carried into that ſtrange land, contrary to all my preceding reſolutions. Hereby I truſt he hath in ſome meaſure <hi>humbled me and proved me, and ſhewn me what was in my heart.</hi> Hereby I have been taught, to <hi>beware of men.</hi> Hereby I am come to know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029861_0108_0FE2A9A2A0EF9C30"/>that if <hi>in all our ways we acknowledge God,</hi> he will where reaſon fails, <hi>direct our path,</hi> by the other means which he knoweth. Hereby I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the fear of the ſea, which I had both dreaded and abhorred from my youth.</p>
               <p>Hereby God has given me to know many of his ſervants, particularly thoſe of the church of Hern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huth. Hereby my paſſage is opened to the writings of holy men in the German, Spaniſh and Italian tongues. I hope too ſome good may come to others hereby. All in Georgia have heard the word of God. Some have believed, and began to run well. A few ſteps have been taken towards publiſhing the glad tidings both to the African and American Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Many children have learned <hi>how they ought to ſerve God,</hi> and to be uſeful to their neighbour. And thoſe whom it moſt concerns have an opportunity of knowing the true ſtate of their infant colony, and laying a firmer foundation of peace and happineſs to many generations.</p>
               <p>Sat. 4. I told my friends ſome of the reaſons; which a little haſtened my return to England. They all agreed it would be proper to relate them to the truſtees of Georgia.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the next morning I waited on Mr. Oglethorpe, but had not time to ſpeak on that head. In the afternoon I was deſired to preach at St. John the Evangeliſt's. I did ſo on thoſe ſtrong words, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> I was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards informed, <hi>Many of the beſt in the pariſh were ſo offended, that I was not to preach there any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 6. I viſited many of my old friends, as well as moſt of my relations. I find the time is not yet come when I am to be <hi>hated of all men.</hi> O may I be prepared for that day!</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 7. (A day much to be remembered) at the houſe of Mr. Weinantz, a Dutch merchant, I met
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029861_0109_0FE2A9A500B06058"/>Peter Bohler, Schulius Richter and Wenſel Neiſer, juſt then landed from Germany. Finding they had no acquaintance in England, I offered to procure them a lodging, and did ſo near Mr. Hutton's, where I then was. And from this time I did not willingly loſe any opportunity of converſing with them, while I ſtayed in London.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 8. I went to Mr. Oglethorpe again, but had no opportunity of ſpeaking as I deſigned. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I waited on the board of truſtees, and gave them a ſhort but plain account of the ſtate of the colony: an account, I fear, not a little differing from thoſe which they had frequently received before: and for which I have reaſon to believe, ſome of them have not forgiven me to this day.</p>
               <p>Sund. 12. I preached at St. Andrew's, Holborn, on, <hi>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.—O hard ſayings! Who can hear them?</hi> Here too (it ſeems) I am to preach no more.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 15. I waited on the truſtees again, and gave them in writing the ſubſtance of what I had ſaid at the laſt board. Whatſoever farther queſtions they aſked concerning the ſtate of the province, I likewiſe anſwered to the beſt of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Fri. 17. I ſet out for Oxford with Peter Bohler, where we were kindly received by Mr. Sarney, the only one now remaining here, of many who at our embarking for America, were uſed <hi>to take ſweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together,</hi> and rejoice in <hi>bearing the reproach of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. 18. We went to Stanton-Harcourt, to Mr. Gambold, and found my old friend recovered from his <hi>myſtic</hi> deluſion, and convinced that St. Paul was a better writer than either Tauler or Jacob Behman. The next day I preached once more at the caſtle (in Oxford) to a numerous and ſerious congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:029861_0110_0FE2A9ACE6482BC0"/>
All this time I converſed much with Peter Bohler, but I underſtood him not: and leaſt of all when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>Mi frater, mi frater, excoquenda eſt iſta tua phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophia.</hi>
                  </q> (My brother, my brother, that philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of your's muſt be purged away.)</p>
               <p>Mond. 20. I returned to London. On Tueſday I preached at Great St. Helen's, on, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſt daily and follow me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedn. 22. I was with the truſtees again, to whom I then gave a ſhort account (and afterwards delivered it to them in writing) of the reaſons why I leſt Georgia.</p>
               <p>Sun. 26. I preached at ſix at St. Lawrence's; at ten, in St. Katherine's Creed-church; and in the afternoon, at St. John's, Wapping. I believe it pleaſed God to bleſs the firſt ſermon moſt, becauſe it gave moſt offence; being indeed an open defiance of that myſtery of iniquity which the world calls <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> grounded on thoſe words of St. Paul to the Galatians; <hi>As many as deſire to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, they conſtrain you to be circumciſed, only leſt they ſhould ſuffer perſecution for the croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 27. I took coach for Saliſbury, and had ſeveral opportunities of converſing ſeriouſly with my fellow travellers. But endeavouring to mend the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, by the worldly wiſdom of prefacing ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with light converſation, and afterwards following that advice of the <hi>myſtics, leave them to themſelves,</hi> all I had ſaid was written on the ſand. <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to my charge!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 28. I ſaw my mother once more. The next day I prepared for my journey to my brother at Tiverton. But on Thurſday morning, March 2d, a meſſage <hi>that my brother Charles was dying at Oxford</hi> obliged me to ſet out for that place immediately. Calling at an odd houſe in the afternoon, I found

               <p>With regard to my own behaviour, I now renewed and wrote down my former reſolutions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To uſe abſolute openneſs and unreſerve, with all I ſhould converſe with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To labour after continual ſeriouſneſs, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly indulging myſelf, in any the leaſt levity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, or in laughter, no not for a moment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſpeak no word which does not tend to the glory of God, in particular, not to talk of worldly things. Others may, nay, muſt. But what is that to thee? And</p>
               <p n="4">4. To take no pleaſure which does not tend to the glory of God; thanking God every moment for all I do take, and therefore rejecting every ſort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, which I feel I cannot ſo thank him <hi>in</hi> and <hi>for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. 4. I found my brother at Oxford, recovering from his pleuriſy; and with him Peter Bohler: by whom (in the hand of the great God) I was on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 5th clearly convinced of unbelief, of the want of <hi>that faith whereby alone we are ſaved with full chriſtian ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately it ſtruck into my mind <q>Leave off preaching. How can you preach to others, who have not faith yourſelf?</q> I aſked Bohler, whether he thought I ſhould leave it off, or not? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "By no means." I aſked, <q>But what can I preach?</q> He ſaid, <q>Preach faith <hi>till</hi> you have it, and then, <hi>becauſe</hi> you have it, you <hi>will</hi> preach faith.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly, Monday 6, I began preaching this new doctrine, though my ſoul ſtarted back from the work. The firſt perſon to whom I offered <hi>ſalvation by faith alone,</hi> was a priſoner under ſentence of death.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:029861_0112_0FE2A9B01532B260"/>His name was Clifford. Peter Bohler had many times deſired me to ſpeak to him before. But I could not prevail on myſelf ſo to do; being ſtill (as I had been many years) a zealous aſſertor of <hi>the impoſſibility of a death-bed repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fri. 10. Peter Bohler returned to London. Tueſ. 15. I ſet out for Mancheſter, with Mr. Kinchin, Fellow of Corpus Chriſti, and Mr. Fox, late a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the city priſon. Between five and ſix we called at Chappel on the Heath, where lived a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> man, ſometime priſoner in the caſtle of Oxford. He was not at home; but his wife came to us, to whom Mr. Kinchin ſpoke a few words, which ſo melted her heart, that ſhe burſt out into tears, and we went on rejoicing and praiſing God.</p>
               <p>About eight, it being rainy and very dark we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p>The next day we dined at Birmingham, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> after we left it, were reproved for our negligence them (in letting thoſe who attended us go, without exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inſtruction) by a ſevere ſhower of hail. At Hedgeſord, about five, we endeavoured to be more faithful; and all who heard, ſeemed ſerious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>In the evening we came to Stafford. The miſtreſs of the houſe joined with us in family-prayer. The next morning, one of the ſervants appeared deeply affected, as did the hoſtler before we went. Soon after breakfaſt, ſtepping into the ſtable, I ſpake a few words to thoſe who were there. A ſtranger who heard me, ſaid, <hi>Sir, I wiſh I was to travel with you.</hi> And wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> I went into the houſe followed me, and began abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Sir, I believe you are a good man, and I come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="115" facs="unknown:029861_0113_0FE2A9B1A7F74ED8"/>you a little of my life.</hi> The tears ſtood in his eyes all the time he ſpoke; and we hoped not a word which was ſaid to him was loſt.</p>
               <p>At Newcaſtle, whither we came about ten, ſome to whom we ſpoke at our inn, were very attentive; but a gay young woman waited on us, quite unconcerned: however we ſpoke on. When we went away, ſhe fixed her eyes, and neither moved nor ſaid one word, but appeared as much aſtoniſhed as if ſhe had ſeen one riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>Coming to Holms-chapel about three, we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at being ſhewn into a room, where a cloth and plates were laid. Soon after two men came in to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Mr. Kinchin told them, "If they pleaſed, that gentleman would aſk a bleſſing for them." They ſtared, and <hi>as it were</hi> conſented; but ſat ſtill while I did it, one of them with his hat on. We began to ſpeak on turning to God, and went on, though they appeared utterly regardleſs. After a while their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances changed, and one of them ſtole off his hat, and laying it down behind him ſaid, <q>All we ſaid was true; but he had been a grievous ſinner, and not conſidered it as he ought: but he was reſolved, with God's help, now to turn to him in earneſt.</q> We exhorted him and his companion, who now likewiſe drank in every word, to cry mightily to God, that <hi>he would ſend them help from his holy place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being faint in the evening, I called at Altringham, and there light upon a Quaker, well ſkilled in, and therefore (as I ſoon found) ſufficiently fond of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. After an hour ſpent therein (perhaps not in vain) I adviſed him, <q>To diſpute as little as poſſible, but rather follow after holineſs, and walk humbly with his God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Late at night we reached Mancheſter. Friday the 17th, we ſpent intirely with Mr. Clayton, by whom, and the reſt of our friends here, we were much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029861_0114_0FE2A9BAB789A6C0"/>and ſtrengthened. Mr. Hoole, the rector of St. Ann's church being taken ill the next day, on Sunday 19, Mr. Kinchin and I officiated at Salford chapel in the morning, by which means Mr. Clayton was at liberty to perform the ſervice of St. Ann's: and in the afternoon, I preached there on thoſe words of St. Paul, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Early in the morning we left Mancheſter, taking with us Mr. Kinchin's brother, for whom we came, to be entered at Oxford. We were fully determined to loſe no opportunity of awakening, inſtructing, or exhorting any whom we might meet with in our journey. At Knutsford, where we firſt ſtopped, all we ſpake to, thankfully received the word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But at <hi>Talk in the hill,</hi> where we dined, ſhe with whom we were, was ſo much of a gentlewomen, that for near an hour our labour ſeemed to be in vain. However we ſpoke on. Upon a ſudden, ſhe looked as one juſt awaked out of a ſleep. Every word ſunk into her heart. Nor have I ſeen ſo entire a change both in the eyes, face, and manner of ſpeaking, of any one in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
               <p>About 5. Mr. Kinchin riding by a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man double-horſed, the man ſaid, "Sir, you ought to thank God it is a fair day,; for if it rained, you would be ſadly dirty with your little horſe." Mr. Kinchin anſwered, "True: and we ought to thank God for our life and health, and food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all things." He then rode on, Mr. Fox following the man ſaid, "Sir, my miſtreſs would be glad to have ſome more talk with that gentleman." We ſtayed, and when they came up, began to ſearch one another's hearts. They came to us again in the evening, at our inn at Stone, where I explained both to them and many of their acquaintance who were come together, that great truth, <hi>"Godlineſs, hath
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029861_0115_0FE2A9BCDE26D770"/>the promiſe both of this life, and of that which is to come."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 21. Between 9 and 10 we came to Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Juſt then, one was giving an account of a young woman, who had dropped down dead there the day before. This gave us a fair occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all that were preſent, <hi>So to number their own days that they might apply their hearts unto wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the afternoon one overtook us whom we ſoon found more inclined to ſpeak than to hear. However we ſpoke and ſpared not. In the evening we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a young man, a Quaker, who afterwards came to us, to our inn at Henley, whither he ſent for the reſt of his family, to join with us in prayer: to which I added, as uſual, the expoſition of the 2d leſſon. Our other companion went with us a mile or two in the morning, and then not only ſpoke leſs than the day before; but took in good part a ſerious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt talkativeneſs and vanity.</p>
               <p>An hour after, we were overtook by an elderly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who ſaid, "He was going to enter his ſon at Oxford." We aſked, "At what college?" He ſaid, "he did not know: having no acquaintance there on whoſe recommendation he could depend." After ſome converſation, he expreſſed a deep ſenſe of the good providence of God, and told us, "He knew God had caſt us in his way, in anſwer to his prayer." In the evening we reached Oxford, rejoicing in our having received ſo many freſh inſtances of that great truth, <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thurſ. 23. I met Peter Bohler again, who now amazed me more and more, by the account he gave of the fruits of living faith, the holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he affirmed to attend it. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I began the Greek Teſtament again, reſolving to abide by <hi>the law and the teſtimony,</hi> and being confident,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029861_0116_0FE2A9BE8DE6D680"/>that God would hereby ſhew me, <hi>whether</hi> this <hi>doctrine was of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sund. 26. I preached at Whitam, on <hi>the new creature,</hi> and went in the evening to a ſociety in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where (as my manner then was at all ſocieties) after uſing a collect or two and the Lord's prayer, I expounded a chapter in the New Teſtament, and concluded with three or four more collects and a pſalm.</p>
               <p>Mond. 27. Mr. Kinchin went with me to the caſtle, where after reading prayers and preaching, on, <hi>It is appointed for men once to die,</hi> we prayed with the condemned man, firſt in ſeveral forms of prayer, and then in ſuch words as were given us in that hour. He kneeled down in much heavineſs and confuſion, having <hi>no reſt in his bones, by reaſon of his ſins.</hi> After a ſpace he roſe up, and eagerly ſaid, <hi>I am now ready to die. I know Chriſt has taken away my ſins, and there is no more condemnation for me.</hi> The ſame compoſed cheerfulneſs he ſhewed, when he was carried to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and in his laſt moments he was the ſame, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying a perfect peace, in confidence that he was <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. April 1. Being at Mr. Fox's ſociety, my heart was ſo full that I could not confine myſelf to the forms of prayer, which we were accuſtomed to uſe there. Neither do I purpoſe to be confined to them any more; but to pray indifferently, with a form or without, as I may find ſuitable to particular occaſions.</p>
               <p>Sund. 2. Being Eaſter-day, I preached in our college chapel, on, <hi>The hour cometh and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:029861_0117_0FE2A9C01BE0AC48"/>
Believing it would be better for me to wait for the accompliſhment of it in ſilence and retirement, on Mond. 3. I complied with Mr. Kinchin's deſire, and went to him at Dummer in Hampſhire. But I was not ſuffered to ſtay here long; being earneſtly preſſed to come up to London, if it were only for a few days. Thither therefore I returned, on Tueſ. 17th.</p>
               <p>Sat. 21. I met Peter Bohler once more. I had now no objection to what he ſaid of the nature of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is (to uſe the words of our church) <hi>A ſure truſt and confidence which a man hath in God, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> through the merits of Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>ſins are forgiven, and</hi> he <hi>reconciled to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avour of God.</hi> Neither could I deny either the happineſs or holineſs which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as fruits of this living faith. <hi>The Spirit it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God:</hi> and, <hi>He that believeth hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> fully convinced me of the former: As, <hi>Whatſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin;</hi> and <hi>Whoſoever believeth, is born of God,</hi> did of the latter. But I could not comprehend what he ſpoke of an <hi>inſtantaneous work.</hi> I could not underſtand how this faith ſhould be given in a moment: how a man could <hi>at once</hi> be thus turned from darkneſs to light, from ſin and miſery to righteouſneſs and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. I ſearched the ſcriptures again, touching this very thing, particularly the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cts of the apoſtles.</hi> But, to my utter aſtoniſhment, found ſcarce any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances there of other than <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> converſion; ſcarce any ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>low as that of St. Paul, who was three days in the pangs of the new birth. I had but one retreat leſt, <hi>viz.</hi> "<hi>Thus,</hi> I grant God wrought in the <hi>firſt</hi> ages of Chriſtianity: but the times are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What reaſon have I to believe, he works in the ſame manner now?"</p>
               <p>But on Sund. 22. I was beat out of this retreat too, by the concurring evidence of ſeveral living wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029861_0118_0FE2A9C96104DD98"/>who teſtified <hi>God had thus wrought in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> giving them in a moment, ſuch a faith in the blood of his Son, as tranſlated them out of darkneſs into light, out of ſin and fear into holineſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Here ended my diſputing. I could now only "cry out, <hi>Lord help thou my unbelief!</hi>"</p>
               <p>I aſked P. Bohler again, "Whether I ought not to refrain from teaching others?" He ſaid, "No; Do not hide in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arth the talent God hath given you." Accordingly on Tueſ. 25. I ſpoke clearly and fully at Blendon to Mr. Delamotte's family, of the nature and fruits of faith. Mr. Broughton and my brother were there. Mr. Broughton's great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was, <hi>He could never think that I had not faith, who had done and ſuffered ſuch things.</hi> My brother was very angry, and told me <hi>I did not know what miſchief I had done by talking thus.</hi> And indeed it did pleaſe God then to kindle a fire, which I truſt ſhall never be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſ. 21. The day fixed for my return to Oxford, I once more waited on the truſtees for Georgia: but being ſtraitened for time, was obliged to leave the papers for them, which I had deſigned to give into their own hands. One of theſe was the inſtrument whereby they had appointed me miniſter of Savannah; which having no more place in thoſe parts, I thought it not right to keep any longer.</p>
               <p>P. Bohler walked with me a few miles, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted me not to ſtop ſhort of the grace of God. At Gerrard's Croſs I plainly declared to thoſe whom. God gave into my hands, <hi>The faith as it is in Jeſus:</hi> as I did next day to a young man I overtook on the road, and in the evening to our friends at Oxford. A ſtrange doctrine, which ſome, who did not care to contradict, yet knew not what to make of; but one or two, who were throughly bruiſed by ſin, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly heard, and received it gladly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:029861_0119_0FE2A9CB620B35C0"/>
In the day or two following, I was much confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>truth that is after godlineſs,</hi> by hearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> experiences of Mr. Hutchins (of Pembroke-college) and Mrs. Fox: two living witneſſeſs that God <hi>can</hi> (at leaſt, if he <hi>does</hi> not always) give that faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cometh ſalvation in a moment, as lightning falling from heaven.</p>
               <p>Mond. May 1. The return of my brother's ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs obliged me again to haſten to London. In the evening I found him at James Hutton's, better as to his health, than I expected; but ſtrongly averſe from what he called The <hi>New Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This evening our little ſociety began, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards met in Fetter-lane. Our fundamental rules were as follow.</p>
               <p>In obedience to the command of God by St. James, and by the advice of Peter Bohler, it is agreed by us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we will meet together once a week to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our faults one to another, and pray one for another, that we may be healed:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the perſons ſo meeting be divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>bands,</hi> or little companies, none of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of fewer than five or more than ten perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That every one in order ſpeak as freely, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conciſely as he can, the real ſtate of his heart, with his ſeveral temptations and deliverances, ſince the laſt time of meeting.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all the bands have a conference at eight every Wedneſday evening, began and ended with ſinging and prayer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That any who de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:029861_0120_0FE2A9CCEFF07218"/>
6. That when any new member is propoſed, every one preſent ſpeak clearly and freely whatever objection he has to him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That thoſe againſt whom no reaſonable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears, be in order for their trial, formed into one or more diſtinct bands, and ſome perſon agreed on to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That after two months trial, if no objection then appear, they may be admitted into the ſociety.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That every fourth Saturday be obſerved as a day of general interceſſion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That on the Sunday ſeven-night following be a general love-feaſt, from ſeven till ten in the evening.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That no particular member be allowed to act in any thing, contrary to any order of the ſociety: and that if any perſons, after being thrice admoniſhed, do not conform thereto, they be not any longer eſteemed as members.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 3. My brother had a long and particular converſation with Peter Bohler. And it now pleaſed God to open his eyes; ſo that he alſo ſaw clearly, what was the nature of that one, true living faith, whereby alone, <hi>through grace we are ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thurſ. 4. Peter Bohler left London in order to embark for Carolina. O what a work hath God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, ſince his coming into England! Such an one as ſhall never come to an end, till heaven and earth paſs away.</p>
               <p>Friday and Saturday, I was at Blendon. They now <hi>believed our report.</hi> O may <hi>the arm of the Lord</hi> be ſpeedily <hi>revealed unto them!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sun. 7. I preached at St. Lawrence's in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and afterwards at St. Katherine's Creed-church. I was enabled to ſpeak ſtrong words at both; and was therefore the leſs ſurprized at being informed, <hi>I was not to preach any more in either of thoſe churches.</hi>

Tueſ. 9. I preached at Great St. Helen's, to a very numerous congregation, on, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> My heart was now ſo enlarged, to declare the love of God, to all that were oppreſſed by the <hi>devil,</hi> that I did not wonder in the leaſt, when I was afterwards told, <hi>"Sir, you muſt preach here no more."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 10. Mr. Stonhouſe, Vicar of Iſlington, was convinced of <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi> From this time till Saturday 13, I was ſorrowful and very heavy; being neither able to read, nor meditate, nor ſing, nor pray, nor do any thing. Yet I was a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by Peter Bohler's letter, which I inſert in his own words.</p>

               <p>Sun. 14. I preached in the morning at St. Ann's, Alderſgate; and in the afternoon at the Savoy chapel, free ſalvation by faith in the blood of Chriſt. I was quickly apprized, that at St. Ann's likewiſe, I am to preach no more.</p>
               <p>So true did I find the words of a friend, wrote to my brother about this time.</p>
               <p>"I have ſeen upon this occaſion, more than ever I could have imagined, how intolerable the doctrine of faith is to the mind of man; and how peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to <hi>religious</hi> men. One may ſay the moſt unchriſtian things, even down to deiſm; the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic things, ſo they proceed but upon mental raptures, lights and unions; the moſt ſevere things, even the whole rigour of aſcetic mortification; and all this will be forgiven. But if you ſpeak of faith in ſuch a manner as makes Chriſt a Saviour to the utmoſt, a moſt univerſal help and refuge; in ſuch a manner as takes away glorying, but adds happineſs to wretched man; as diſcovers a greater pollution in the beſt of us, than we could before acknowledge, but brings a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deliverance from it than we could before expect: if any one offers to talk at this rate, he ſhall be heard with the ſame abhorrence, as if he was going to rob
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029861_0124_0FE2A9DBD8AE9E68"/>mankind of their ſalvation, their mediator, or the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hopes of forgiveneſs. I am perſuaded that a <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> or a <hi>Novatian,</hi> who from the height of his purity ſhould look down with contempt upon poor ſinners, and exclude them from all mercy, would not be thought ſuch an overthrower of the goſpel, as he who ſhould learn from the author of it, to be a friend of Publicans and Sinners, and to ſit down upon the level with them, as ſoon as they begin to repent."</p>
               <p>"But this is not to be wondered at. For all <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> people have ſuch a quantity of righteouſneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by much painful exerciſe, and formed at laſt into current habits; which is their wealth, both for this world and the next. Now all other ſchemes of religion, are either ſo complaiſant, as to tell them, they are very rich, and have enough to triumph in: or elſe only a little rough, but friendly in the main, by telling them, their riches are not yet ſufficient, but by ſuch arts of ſelf-denial, and mental refinement, they may enlarge the ſtock. But the doctrine of faith is a downright robber. It takes away all this wealth, and only tells us, it is depoſited for us with ſome body elſe, upon whoſe bounty we muſt live like mere beggars. Indeed they that are truly beggars, vile and filthy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners till very lately, may ſtoop to live in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent condition: it ſuits them well enough. But they who have long diſtinguiſhed themſelves from the herd of vicious wretches, or have even gone beyond <hi>moral</hi> men; for them to be told, that they are either not ſo well, or but the ſame needy, impotent, inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant veſſels of mercy, with the others: this is more ſhocking to reaſon, than tranſubſtantiation. For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had rather reſign its pretenſions to judge what is bread or fleſh, than have this honour wreſted from it to be the architect of virtue and righteouſneſs. But where am I running? My deſign was only to give you
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029861_0125_0FE2A9DD682CA330"/>warning, that wherever you go, <hi>this fooliſhneſs of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will alienate hearts from you, and open mouths againſt you."</p>
               <p>Fri. 19. My brother had a ſecond return of his pleuriſy. A few of us ſpent Saturday night in prayer. The next day, being Whitſunday, after hearing Dr. Heylin preach a truly Chriſtian ſermon (on, <hi>They were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and ſo, ſaid he, may <hi>all you</hi> be, if it is not your own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I preached at St. John's W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Monday, Tueſday and Wedneſday, I had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſorrow and heavineſs in my heart; ſomething of which I deſcribed, in the broken manner I was able, in the following letter to a friend.</p>
               <p>"O why is it, that ſo great, ſo wiſe, ſo holy a God will uſe ſuch an inſtrument as me! Lord <hi>let the dead bury their dead?</hi> But wilt thou ſend the dead to raiſe the dead? Yea, thou ſendeſt whom thou <hi>wilt</hi> ſend, and ſheweſt mercy by whom thou <hi>wilt</hi> ſhew mercy! Amen! Be it then according to thy will! If thou ſpeak the word, Judas ſhall caſt out devils.</p>
               <p>I feel what you ſay (though not enough) for I am under the ſame condemnation. I ſee that the whole law of God is holy, juſt and good. I know every thought, every temper of my ſoul, ought to bear God's image and ſuperſcription. But how am I fallen from the glory of God! I feel, that <hi>I am ſold
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029861_0126_0FE2A9E8C742CB90"/>under ſin.</hi> I know, that I too deſerve nothing but wrath, being full of all abominations: and having no good thing in me to atone for them, or to remove the wrath of God. All my works, my righteouſneſs, my prayers, need an atonement for themſelves. So that my mouth is ſtopped. I have nothing to plead. God is holy, I am unholy. God is a conſuming fire. I am altogether a ſinner, meet to be conſumed.</p>
               <p>"Yet I hear a voice (and is it not the voice of God?) ſaying, <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved. He that believeth, is paſſed from death unto life. God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"O let no one deceive us by vain words, as if we had already attained this ſaith! i. e. The proper chriſtian faith. By its fruits we ſhall know. Do we already feel <hi>peace with God,</hi> and <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Does <hi>his Spirit bear witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God?</hi> Alas, with mine he does not. Nor, I fear with yours. O thou Saviour of men, ſave us from truſting in any thing but <hi>thee!</hi> Draw us after thee! Let us be emptied of ourſelves, and then fill us with all peace and joy in believing, and let nothing ſeparate us from thy love, in time or in eternity!"</p>
               <p>What occurred on Wedneſday 24, I think beſt to relate at large, after premiſing what may make it the better underſtood. Let him that cannot receive it, aſk of the Father of lights, that he would give more light to him and me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I believe, till I was about ten years old, I had not ſinned away that <hi>initial grace</hi> which was given me in infancy having been ſtrictly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and carefully taught, that I could only be ſaved <hi>by univerſal obedience, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029861_0127_0FE2A9EAA8624990"/>outward duties and ſins, I gladly received, and often thought of. But all that was ſaid to me of inward obedience, or holineſs, I neither underſtood nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. So that I was indeed as ignorant of the true meaning of the law, as I was of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next ſix or ſeven years were ſpent at ſchool: where outward reſtraints being removed, I was much more negligent than before even of outward duties, and almoſt continually guilty of outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However I ſtill read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſaid my prayers, morning and evening. And what I now hoped to be ſaved by, was, 1. <hi>Not being ſo bad a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Being removed to the univerſity, for five years, I ſtill ſaid my prayers both in public and in private, and read with the ſcriptures ſeveral other books of religion, eſpecially comments on the New Teſtament. Yet I had not all this while ſo much as a notion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſs: nay, went on habitually and for the moſt part) very contentedly, in ſome or other known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in: indeed with ſome intermiſſion and ſhort ſtruggles, eſpecially before and after the Holy Communion, which I was obliged to receive thrice a year: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well tell, what I hoped to be ſaved by now, when I was continually ſinning againſt the little light I had: unleſs by thoſe tranſient fits of what many divines taught me to call <hi>repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When I was about 22, my father preſſed me to enter into holy orders. At the ſame time the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God directing me to Kempis<hi>'s Chriſtian Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> I began to ſee, that true religion was ſeated in the heart, and that God's law extended to all our thoughts as well as words and actions. I was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029861_0128_0FE2A9EC37717758"/>very angry at Kempis, for being <hi>too ſtrict,</hi> though I read him only in Dean Stan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ope's tranſlation. Yet I had frequently much ſenſible comfort in reading him, ſuch as I was an utter ſtranger to before: and meeting likewiſe with a religious friend, which I never had till now, I began to alter the whole form of my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and to ſet in earneſt upon <hi>a new life.</hi> I ſet apart an hour or two a day for religious retirement. I communicated every week. I watched againſt all ſin, whether in word or deed. I began to aim at, and pray for inward holineſs. So that now, <hi>doing ſo much, and living ſo good a life,</hi> I doubted not but I was a good Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Removing ſoon after to another college, I exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted a reſolution, which I was before convinced was of the utmoſt importance, ſhaking off at once all my trifling acquaintance. I began to ſee more and more the value of time. I applied myſelf cloſer to ſtudy. I watched more carefully againſt actual ſins; I adviſed others to be religious, according to that ſcheme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by which I modelled my own life. But meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now with Mr. Law's <hi>Chriſtian Perfection and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Call</hi> (although I was much offended at many parts of both, yet) they convinced me more than ever of the exceeding height, and breadth, and depth of the law of God. The light flowed in ſo mightily upon my ſoul, that every thing appeared in a new view. I cried to God for help, and reſolved not to prolong the time of obeying him as I had never done before. And by my continued <hi>endeavour to keep his whole law,</hi> inward and outward, <hi>to the utmoſt of my power,</hi> I was perſuaded that I ſhould be accepted of him, and that I was even then in a ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0, I began viſiting the priſons, aſſiſting the poor and ſick in town, and doing what other good I could by my preſence or my little fortune to the bodies and ſouls of all men. To this end I abridged
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029861_0129_0FE2A9EDCBB22BD0"/>myſelf of all ſuperfluities, and many that are called neceſſaries of life. I ſoon became a <hi>by-word</hi> for ſo doing, and I rejoiced that my <hi>name was caſt out as evil.</hi> The next ſpring I began obſerving the Wedneſday and Friday faſts, commonly obſerved in the ancient church; taſting no food till three in the afternoon. And now I knew not how to go any farther. I dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſtrove againſt all ſin. I omitted no ſort of ſelf-denial which I thought lawful: I carefully uſed, both in public and private, all the means of grace at all opportunities. I omitted no occaſion of doing good; I for that reaſon ſuffered evil. And all this I knew to be nothing, unleſs as it was directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inward holineſs. Accordingly this, the image of God, was what I aimed at in all, by doing his will, not my own. Yet when after continuing ſome years in this courſe, I apprehended myſelf to be near death, I could not find that all this gave me any comfort, or any aſſurance of acceptance with God. At this I was then not a little ſurprized: not imagining I had been all this time building on the ſand, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that <hi>other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid by God, even Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Soon after, a contemplative man convinced me ſtill more than I was convinced before, that outward works are nothing, being alone; and in ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations inſtructed me, how to purſue inward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or a union of the ſoul with God. But even of his inſtructions (though I then received them as the words of God) I cannot but now obſerve, 1. That he ſpoke ſo incautiouſly againſt <hi>truſting</hi> in <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works,</hi> that he diſcouraged me from <hi>doing</hi> them at all. 2. That he recommended (as it were, to ſupply what was wanting in them) <hi>mental prayer,</hi> and the like exerciſes, as the moſt effectual means of purifying the ſoul, and uniting it with God. Now theſe were in truth, as much <hi>my own works</hi> as viſiting
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029861_0130_0FE2A9FBD0E19050"/>the ſick or cloathing the naked, and the <hi>union with God</hi> thus purſued, was as really <hi>my own righteouſneſs,</hi> as any I had before purſued, under another name.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In this refined way of truſting to my own works and my own righteouſneſs (ſo zealouſly inculcated by the myſtic writers) I dragged on heavily, finding no comfort or help therein, till the time of my leaving England. On ſhipboard however I was again active in outward works; where it pleaſed God of his free mercy, to give me 26 of the Moravian brethren for companions, who endeavoured to ſhew me a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way. But I underſtood it not at firſt. I was too learned and too wiſe. So that it ſeemed fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto me. And I continued preaching and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after and truſting in that righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no fleſh can be juſtified.</p>
               <p n="9">9. All the time I was at Savannah I was thus <hi>beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the air.</hi> Being ignorant of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which by a living faith in him bringeth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>to every one that believeth,</hi> I ſought to eſtabliſh my own righteouſneſs, and ſo laboured in the fire all my days. I was now, properly <hi>under the law;</hi> I knew that <hi>the law</hi> of God was <hi>ſpiritual; I conſented to it, that it was good.</hi> Yea, <hi>I delighted in it, after the inner man.</hi> Yet was I <hi>carnal, ſold under ſin.</hi> Every day was I conſtrained to cry out, <hi>What I do, I allow not; for what I would, I do not, but what I hate, that I do. To will is indeed preſent with me: but how to perform that which is good, I find not.</hi> For <hi>the good which I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me:</hi> even <hi>the law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers warring againſt the law of my mind,</hi> and ſtill <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me into captivity to the law of ſin.</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029861_0131_0FE2A9FD64515148"/>willingly, but ſtill I ſerved it. I fell and roſe, and fell again. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ometimes I was overcome, and in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Sometimes I overcame, and was in joy. For as in the former ſtate, I had ſome foretaſtes of the terrors of the law, ſo had I in this, of the comforts of the goſpel. During this whole ſtruggle between nature and grace (which had now continued above ten years) I had many remarkable returns to prayer, eſpecially when I was in trouble: I had many ſenſible comforts, which are indeed no other than ſhort anticipations of the life of faith. But I was ſtill <hi>under the law,</hi> not <hi>under grace</hi> (the ſtate moſt who are called Chriſtians are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live and die in.) For I was only <hi>ſtriving with,</hi> not <hi>freed from ſin:</hi> neither had I <hi>the witneſs of the Spirit with my ſpirit,</hi> and indeed could not; for <hi>I ſought it not by faith, but (as it were) by the works of the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. In my return to England, January 1738, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in imminent danger of death, and very uneaſy on that account, I was ſtrongly convinced that the cauſe of that uneaſineſs was unbelief, and that the gaining a true, living faith, was the <hi>one thing needful for</hi> me. But ſtill I fixed not this faith on its right object: I meant only faith in God, not faith in or through Chriſt. Again, I knew not that I was <hi>wholly void of this faith;</hi> but only thought, <hi>I had not enough</hi> of it. So that when Peter Bohler, whom God prepared for me as ſoon as I came to London, affirmed of true faith in Chriſt (which is but one) that it had thoſe two fruits inſeparably attending it, "Dominion over ſin, and conſtant peace from a ſenſe of forgiveneſs," I was quite amazed, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a new goſpel. If this was ſo, it was clear, I had not faith. But I was not willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this. Therefore I diſputed with all my might, and laboured to prove, that faith might be where theſe were not; eſpecially where the ſenſe of
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029861_0132_0FE2A9FEF2E2C390"/>forgiveneſs was not: for all the ſcriptures relating to this, I had been long ſince taught to conſtrue away, and to call all Preſbyterians who ſpoke otherwiſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I well ſaw, no one could (in the nature of things) have ſuch a ſenſe of forgiveneſs, and not <hi>feel</hi> it. But I felt it not. If then there was no faith without this, all my pretenſions to faith dropped at once.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When I met Peter Bohler again, he conſented, to put the diſpute upon the iſſue which I deſired, viz. Scripture and experience. I firſt conſulted the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But when I ſet aſide the gloſſes of men, and ſimply conſidered the word of God, comparing them together, endeavouring to illuſtrate the obſcure by the plainer paſſages, I found they all made againſt me, and was forced to retreat to my laſt hold, "That experience would never agree with the <hi>literal interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of thoſe ſcriptures. Nor could I therefore allow it to be true, till I found ſome living witneſſes of it." He replied, "He could ſhew me ſuch at any time; if I deſired it the next day." And accordingly the next day, he came again with three others, all of whom teſtified of their own perſonal experience, that a true living faith in Chriſt, is inſeparable from a ſeaſe of pardon for all paſt, and freedom from all preſent ſins. They added with one mouth, that this faith was the gift, the free gift of God, and that he would ſurely beſtow it upon every ſoul, who earneſtly and perſeveringly ſought it. I was now throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; and by the grace of God, I reſolved to ſeek it unto the end, 1. By abſolutely renouncing all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, in whole or in part, upon <hi>my own</hi> works or righteouſneſs, on which I had really grounded my hope of ſalvation, though I knew it not, from my youth up. 2. By adding to <hi>the conſtant uſe of all the other means of grace,</hi> continual prayer for this very thing, juſtifying, ſaving faith, a full reliance on the blood of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029861_0133_0FE2AA008B796890"/>Chriſt ſhed for <hi>me;</hi> a truſt in him, as <hi>my</hi> Chriſt, as <hi>my</hi> ſole juſtification, ſanctification, and redemption.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I continued thus to ſeek it (though with ſtrange indifference, dulneſs and coldneſs, and uſually frequent relapſes into ſin) till Wedneſday, May 24. I think it was about five this morning, that I opened my Teſtament on thoſe words. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>There are given unto us exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, even that ye ſhould be partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 2 Pet. i. 4. Juſt as I went out, I opened it again on thoſe words, <hi>Thou art not far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> In the afternoon I was aſked to go to St. Paul's. The anthem was, <hi>Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord hear my voice. O let thine ears conſider well the voice of my complaint. If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, O Lord, who may abide it? But there is mercy with thee; therefore thou ſhalt be feared. O Iſrael, truſt in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. And he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his ſins</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 In the evening I went very unwillingly to a ſociety in Alderſgate-ſtreet, where one was reading Luther's preface to the epiſtle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was deſcribing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Chriſt, I felt my heart ſtrangely warmed. I felt I did truſt in Chriſt, Chriſt alone for ſalvation: and an aſſurance was given me, that he had taken away <hi>my</hi> ſins, even <hi>mine,</hi> and ſaved <hi>me</hi> from the law of ſin and death.</p>
               <p n="15">15. I began to pray with all my might for thoſe who had in a more eſpecial manner deſpitefully uſed me and perſecuted me. I then teſtified openly to all there, what I now firſt felt in my heart. But it was not long before the enemy ſuggeſted, "This cannot
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029861_0134_0FE2AA0A46934DC8"/>be faith; for where is thy joy?" Then was I taught, that <hi>peace and victory over ſin, are eſſential to faith in the Captain of our ſalvation: but, that as to the tranſports of joy</hi> that uſually attend the beginning of it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe who have mourned deeply, <hi>God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giveth, ſometimes with-holdeth them, according to the counſels of his own will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. After my return home, I was much buffeted with temptations: but cried out, and they fled away. They returned again and again. I as often lifted up my eyes, and he <hi>ſent me help from his holy place.</hi> And herein I found the difference between this and my former ſtate chiefly conſiſted. I was ſtriving, yea, fighting with all my might under the law, as well as under grace. But then I was ſometimes, if not often, conquered; now, I was always conqueror.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Thurſ. May 25. The moment I awaked, "Jeſus, Maſter," was in my heart and in my mouth; and I found all my ſtrength lay in keeping my eye ſixed upon him, and my ſoul waiting on him continually. Being again at St. Paul's in the afternoon, I could taſte the good word of God in the anthem, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, <hi>My ſong ſhall be always of the loving-kindneſs of the Lord: with my mouth will I ever be ſhewing forth thy truth from one generation to another.</hi> Yet the enemy injected a fear, "If thou doſt believe, why is there not a more ſenſible change? I anſwered (yet not I) that I know not. But this I know, I have <hi>now peace with God.</hi> And <hi>I ſin not to day,</hi> and Jeſus my Maſter has forbid me to take thought for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row."</p>
               <p n="18">18. "But is not <hi>any</hi> ſort of <hi>fear</hi> (continued the tempter) a proof that thou doſt not believe?" I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my maſter to anſwer for me; and opened his book upon thoſe words of St. Paul. <hi>Without were fightings, within were fears.</hi> Then inferred I, well may
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029861_0135_0FE2AA0BD8382A30"/>fears be within <hi>me;</hi> but I muſt go on, and tread them under my feet.</p>
               <p>Friday, May 26. My ſoul continued in peace, but yet in heavineſs, becauſe of manifold temptations. I aſked Mr. Telching the Moravian, What to do? He ſaid you muſt not fight with them, as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but flee from them, the moment they appear, and take ſhelter in the wounds of Jeſus. The ſame I learned alſo from the afternoon anthem, which was, <hi>My ſoul truly waiteth ſtill upon God, for of him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my ſalvation; he verily is my ſtrength and my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is my defence ſo that I ſhall not greatly fall. O put your truſt in him always, ye people; pour out your hearts before him; for God is our hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. 27. Believing one reaſon of my want of joy, was want of time for prayer, I reſolved to do no buſineſs till I went to church in the morning, but to continue pouring out my heart before him. And this day my ſpirit was enlarged; ſo that though I was now alſo aſſaulted by many temptations, I was more than conqueror, gaining more power thereby to truſt and rejoice in God my Saviour.</p>
               <p>Sunday 28. I waked in peace, but not in joy. In the ſame even quiet ſtate I was till the evening, when I was roughly attacked in a large company as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt, a ſeducer, and a ſetter forth of new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. By the bleſſing of God I was not moved to anger, but after a calm and ſhort reply went away; though not with ſo tender concern as was due to thoſe, who were ſeeking death in the error of their life.</p>
               <p>This day I preached in the morning at St. George's Bloomſbury, on, <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith;</hi> and in the afternoon at the chapel in Long-Acre, on God's juſtifying the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the laſt time (I underſtand) I am to preach at either. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:029861_0136_0FE2AA0D65FA59E0"/>
Mond. 29 I ſet out for Dummer with Mr. Wolf, one of the firſt-fruits of Peter Bohler's miniſtry in England. I was much ſtrengthened by the grace of God in him: yet was his ſtate ſo far above mine, that I was often tempted to doubt, whether we had one faith? But, without much reaſoning about it, I held here; "Though his be <hi>ſtrong</hi> and mine <hi>weak,</hi> yet that God hath given ſome <hi>degree</hi> of faith even to me, I know by its fruits. For I have <hi>conſtant peace;</hi> not one uneaſy thought. And I have <hi>freedom from ſin:</hi> not one unholy deſire."</p>
               <p>Yet on Wedneſday did I grieve the Spirit of God, not only by not <hi>watching unto prayer,</hi> but likewiſe by ſpeaking with ſharpneſs inſtead of tender love, of one that was not ſound in the faith. Immediately God hid his face and I was troubled; and in this heavineſs I continued till the next morning, June 1. When it pleaſed God, while I was exhorting another, to give comfort to my ſoul, and (after I had ſpent ſome time in prayer) to direct me to thoſe gracious words, <hi>Having therefore boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus—Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith. Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering; (for he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that promiſed) and let us conſider one another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto love and to good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. June 3. I was ſo ſtrongly aſſaulted by one of my old enemies, that I had ſcarce ſtrength to open my lips, or even to look up for help. But after I had prayed, faintly, as I could, the temptation vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away.</p>
               <p>Sun. 4. Was indeed a feaſt-day. For from the time of my riſing till paſt one in the afternoon, I was praying, reading the ſcriptures, ſinging praiſe, or calling ſinners to repentance. All theſe days I ſcarce remember to have opened the teſtament, but upon ſome great and precious promiſe. And I ſaw more
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029861_0137_0FE2AA0EF3503EE8"/>than ever, that the goſpel, is in truth but one great promiſe, from the beginning of it to the end.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 6. I had ſtill more comfort, and peace, and joy: on which I fear I began to preſume. For in the evening I received a letter from Oxford which threw me into much perplexity. It was aſſerted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, "That no doubting could conſiſt with the leaſt degree of true faith: that whoever at any time felt any doubt or fear, was not <hi>weak in faith,</hi> but had <hi>no faith</hi> at all: and that none hath any faith, till the law of the ſpirit of life has made him <hi>wholly</hi> free from the law of ſin and death."</p>
               <p>Begging of God to direct me, I opened my teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on 1 Cor. iii. ver. 1, &amp;c. where St. Paul ſpeaks of thoſe whom he terms <hi>babes</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who were <hi>not able to bear ſtrong meat,</hi> nay (in a ſenſe) <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> to whom nevertheleſs he ſays, <hi>Ye are God's build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ye are the temple of God.</hi> Surely then theſe men had <hi>ſome degree</hi> of faith; though it is plain, their faith was but <hi>weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſome hours ſpent in the ſcripture and prayer, I was much comforted. Yet I felt a kind of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my heart, ſo that I found my wound was not fully healed. O God, ſave thou me, and all that are <hi>weak in the faith,</hi> from <hi>doubtful diſputations!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſday, June 7. I determined, if God ſhould permit, to retire for a ſhort time into Germany. I had fully propoſed before I left Georgia ſo to do, if it ſhould pleaſe God to bring me back to Europe. And I now clearly ſaw the time was come. My weak mind could not bear to be thus ſawn aſunder. And I hoped the converſing with theſe holy men, who were themſelves living witneſſes of the full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith, and yet able to bear with thoſe that are weak, would be a means, under God, of ſo eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſoul, that I might <hi>go on from faith to faith, and from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi>

Thurſ. 8. I went to Saliſbury to take leave of my mother. The next day I left Sarum, and on Saturday came to Stanton-harcourt. Having preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith in Chriſt there on Sunday 11, I went on to Oxford; and thence on Monday to London, where I found Mr. Ingham juſt ſetting out. We went on board the next day, Tueſday 13, and fell down to Graveſend that night. About four in the afternoon on Wedneſday we loſt ſight of England. We reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meaſe at eight on Thurſday morning, and in an hour and a half landed at Rotterdam.</p>
               <p>We were eight in all, five Engliſh and three Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Dr. Koker, a phyſician of Rotterdam, was ſo kind, when we ſet forward in the afternoon, as to walk an hour with us on our way. I never before ſaw any ſuch road as this. For many miles together, it is raiſed for ſome yards above the level, and paved with a ſmall ſort of brick, as ſmooth and clean as the Mall in St. James's. The walnut-trees ſtand in even rows on either ſide: ſo that no walk in a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's garden is pleaſanter. About ſeven we came to Goudart, where we were a little ſurprized, at meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a treatment which is not heard of in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Several inns utterly refuſed to entertain us; ſo that it was with difficulty we at laſt found one, where they did us the favour to take our money for ſome meat and drink, and the uſe of two or three bad b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They preſſed us much in the morning to ſee their church, but were diſpleaſed at our pulling off our hats when we went in; telling us, "We muſt not do ſo; it was not the cuſtom there." It is a large old building, of the Gothic kind, reſembling ſome of our Engliſh cathedrals. There is much hiſtory-painting in the windows, which they told us, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired. About eight we leſt Goudart, and in a little more than ſix hours reached Yſſelſtein.</p>

Here we were at Baron Wattevil's, as at home. We found with him a few German brethren and ſiſters, and ſeven or eight of our Engliſh acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who had ſettled here ſome time before. They lodged juſt without the town, in three or four little houſes, till one ſhould be built that would contain them all. Saturday 17, was their interceſſion-day. In the morning, ſome of our Engliſh brethren deſired me to adminiſter the Lord's ſupper: the reſt of the day was ſpent with all the brethren and ſiſters, in hearing the wonderful work which God is beginning to work over all the earth, and in making our requeſts known unto him, and giving him thanks for the mightineſs of his kingdom.</p>
               <p>At ſix in the morning we took boat. The beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gardens lie on both ſides the river, for great part of the way to Amſterdam, whither we came about five in the evening. The exact neatneſs of all the buildings here, the nice cleanneſs of the ſtreets (which, we were informed, were all waſhed twice a week) and the canals which run through all the main ſtreets, with rows of trees on either ſide, make this the pleaſanteſt city which I have ever ſeen. Here we were entertained with truly Chriſtian hoſpitality, by Mr. Decknatel, a miniſter of the Mennoniſts, who ſuffered us to want nothing while we ſtayed here, which was till the Thurſday following. Dr. Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſen (a phyſician, a Muſcovite by nation) who had been with Mr. Decknatel for ſome time, ſhewed us likewiſe all poſſible kindneſs. <hi>Remember them, O Lord, for good!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 17. I was at one of the ſocieties, which laſted an hour and an half. About ſixty perſons were preſent. The ſinging was in Low-Dutch (Mr. Decknatel having tranſlated into Low-Dutch, part of the Hernhuth hymn-book) but the words were ſo very near the German, that any who underſtood
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029861_0140_0FE2AA1DD96E1DD8"/>the original, might underſtand the tranſlation. The expounding was in High Dutch. I was at another of the ſocieties on Tueſday, where were preſent about the ſame number. On Wedneſday, one of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany found a ſheep that had been loſt: his ſiſter, who had lived here for ſome time with one whom ſhe loved too well, as he did her. But they were now both reſolved, by the grace of God (which they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly executed without delay) <hi>To pluck out the right eye, and caſt it from them.</hi>
               </p>

A little before eight we came to Beurn, a ſmall ill-built city, belonging to the Prince of Orange. Setting out early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we came to Nimwegen, the laſt town in Holland, about two in the afternoon: and leaving it at four, came before eight to an inn, two hours ſhort of Cleve.</p>
               <p>Sun. 25. After ſpending an hour in ſinging and prayer, we walked till near noon, before we could meet with any refreſhment. The road would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared exceeding pleaſant, being broad and ſtrait, with tall trees on either ſide, had not wearineſs and rain prevented. We hoped to reach Reinberg in the evening, but could not; being obliged to ſtop two hours ſhort of it, at a little houſe, where many good Lutherans were concluding the Lord's-day (as is uſual among them) with fiddling and dancing!</p>
               <p>Mond. 26. We breakfaſted at Reinberg, left it at half an hour paſt ten, and at four came to Urding. Being much tired, we reſted here, ſo that it was near ten at night before we came to Neus. Having but a few hours walk from hence to Colen, we went thither eaſily, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Wedneſ. 28. We went to the cathedral, which is mere heaps upon heaps; a huge, miſhapen thing, which has no more of ſymmetry, than of neatneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. I was a little ſurprized to obſerve, that neither in this, nor in any other of the Romiſh churches where I have been, is there, properly ſpeaking any ſuch thing as joint worſhip: but one prays at one ſhrine or altar, and another at another, without any regard to, or communication with one another. As we came out of the church, a proceſſion began on the other ſide of the church-yard. One of our company ſcrupling to pull off his hat, a zealous Catholic pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cried out, <hi>Knock down the Lutheran dog.</hi> But we prevented any conteſt, by retiring into the church.</p>
               <p>Walking on the ſide of the Rhine in the afternoon, I ſaw to my great ſurprize (for I always thought before, no Romaniſt of any faſhion believed any thing of the ſtory) a freſh painting, done laſt year at the public expence, on the outſide of the city wall, <hi>in memory of the bringing in the heads of the three kings</hi> (ſays the Latin inſcription) <hi>through the gate adjoining:</hi> which indeed, in reverence (it ſeems) to them, has been ſtopped up ever ſince.</p>
               <p>At four we took boat, when I could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the decency of the Papiſts, above us who are called reformed. As ſoon as ever we were ſeated (and ſo every morning after) they all pulled off their hats, and each uſed by himſelf, a ſhort prayer for our proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous journey. And this juſtice I muſt do to the very boatmen (who upon the Rhine are generally wicked even to a proverb) I never heard one of them take the name of God in vain, or ſaw any one laugh when any thing of religion was mentioned. So that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the glory of <hi>ſporting with ſacred things,</hi> is peculiar to the Engliſh nation!</p>
               <p>We were four nights on the water, by reaſon of the ſwiftneſs of the ſtream, up which the boat was drawn

On Sunday evening, July 2, we came to Mentz; and Monday the 3d, at half an hour paſt ten, to Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Faint and weary as we were, we could have no admittance here, having brought no paſſes with us, which indeed we never imagined would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in a time of ſettled general peace. After waiting an hour at the gates, we procured a meſſenger, whom we ſent to Mr. Bohler (Peter Bohler's father) who immediately came, procured us entrance into the city, and entertained us in the moſt friendly manner. We ſet out early in the morning on Tueſday the 4th, and about one came to Marienborn. But I was ſo ill, that after talking a little with Count Zinzendorf, I was forced to lie down the reſt of the day.</p>
               <p>The family at Marienborn conſiſts of about ninety perſons, gathered out of many nations. They live for the preſent in a large houſe hired by the Count, which is capable of receiving a far greater number; but are building one, about three (Engliſh) miles off, on the top of a fruitful hill. <hi>O how pleaſant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thurſ. 6. The Count carried me with him to the Count of Solmes, where I obſerved with pleaſure the German frugality. Three of the young Counteſſes (though grown up) were dreſt in linen; the Count and his ſon in plain cloth. At dinner, the next day, a glaſs of wine and a glaſs of water were ſet by every one, and if either were emptied, a ſecond. They all converſed freely and unaffectedly. At ten at night we took coach again, and in the morning reached Marienborn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:029861_0143_0FE2AA295F08A808"/>
I lodged with one of the brethren at Eckerſhauſen, an Engliſh mile from Marienborn, where I uſually ſpent the day, chiefly in converſing with thoſe who could ſpeak either Latin or Engliſh; not being able, for want of more practice, to ſpeak German readily. And here I continually met with what I ſought for, viz. Living proofs of the power of faith: perſons <hi>ſaved from</hi> inward as well as outward <hi>ſin, by the love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts;</hi> and from all doubt and fear, by the abiding <hi>witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt given unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sund. 9. The Count preached in the old caſtle at Runneberg (about three Engliſh miles from Marien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born) where is alſo a ſmall company of thoſe who ſeek the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity. Wedneſday 12, was one of the conferences for ſtrangers; where one of Frankfort propoſing the queſtion, Can a man be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not know it? The Count ſpoke largely and ſcripturally upon it to this effect:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Juſtification is, the forgiveneſs of ſins.</item>
                  <item>2. The moment a man flies to Chriſt he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</item>
                  <item>3. And has peace with God, but not always joy:</item>
                  <item>4. Nor perhaps may he know he is juſtified, till long after.</item>
                  <item>5. For the aſſurance of it is diſtinct from juſtification itſelf.</item>
                  <item>6. But others may know he is juſtified by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over ſin, by his ſeriouſneſs, his love of the brethren, and his <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, which alone prove the ſpiritual life to be begun.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. To be juſtified is the ſame thing as to be born of God. (Not ſo.)</item>
                  <item>8. When a man is awakened, he is begotten of God, and his fear and ſorrow and ſenſe of the wrath of God, are the pangs of the new birth.</item>

                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:029861_0144_0FE2AA2AEFAC9700"/>
I then recollected what Peter Bohler had often ſaid upon this head, which was to this effect:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When a man has living faith in Chriſt, then is he juſtified:</item>
                  <item>2. This is always given in a moment,</item>
                  <item>3. And in that moment he has peace with God;</item>
                  <item>4. Which he cannot have, without knowing that he has it:</item>
                  <item>5. And being born of God, he ſinneth not:</item>
                  <item>6. Which deliverance from ſin he cannot have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing that he has it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Sat. 15. Was the interceſſion day, when many ſtrangers were preſent from different parts. On Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 17, having ſtayed here ten days longer than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (my firſt deſign being only to reſt one or two days) I propoſed ſetting out for Hernhuth; but Mr. Ingham deſiring me to ſtay a little longer, I ſtayed till Wedneſday 19, when Mr. Hauptman (a native of Dreſden) Mr. Brown and I ſet out together.</p>
               <p>We breakfaſted at Gehlenhauſen, an old, unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome town, dined at Offenau (where is a ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of moderation, a church uſed every Sunday, both by the Papiſts and the Lutherans alternately) and notwithſtanding ſome ſharp ſhowers of rain, in the evening reached Steinau. Thurſday 20 we dined at Braunſal, and paſſing through Fulda in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon (where the Duke has a pleaſant palace) travelled through a delightful country of hills and vales, and in the evening came to Rickherſch. The next night (after having had the moſt beautiful proſpect which I think I ever ſaw, from the top of a high hill, commanding a vaſt extent of various land on every ſide) we, with ſome difficulty, and many words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a poor accommodation at an inn in Markſul. Saturday 22, having paſſed through Elſenach in the morning, we came through a more level open country, to Saxe-Gotha in the afternoon, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029861_0145_0FE2AA2C83CAF280"/>city, in which the Prince's palace is indeed a fine building. We ſtopped an hour here with a friendly man, and in the evening came to Ditleben; and thence in the morning to Erfurt, where we were kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by Mr. Reinhurt, to whom we were directed by ſome of the brethren at Marienborn. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we came to Weymar, where we had more difficulty to get through the city than is uſual, even in Germany: being not only detained a conſiderable time at the gate, but alſo carried before I know not what great man (I believe, the Duke) in the ſquare: who after many other queſtions, aſked, What we were going ſo far as Hernhuth for? I anſwered, "To ſee the place where the Chriſtians live." He looked hard, and let us go.</p>
               <p>Mond. 24. We came early to Jena, which lies at the bottom of ſeveral high, ſteep, barren hills. The ſtudents here are diſtinguiſhed from the townſmen by their ſwords. They do not live together in colleges (nor indeed in any of the German univerſities) as we do in Oxford and Cambridge; but are ſcattered up and down the town; in lodging or boarding-houſes. Thoſe of them to whom we were recommended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved as brethren indeed. O may brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every good word and work, abound in them more and more!</p>
               <p>At Jena the ſtone pillars begin, ſet up by the Elector of Saxony, and marking out every quarter of a German mile, to the end of his Electorate. Every mile is a large pillar, with the names of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring towns, and their diſtances inſcribed. It were much to be wiſhed, that the ſame care were taken in England, and indeed in all countries.</p>
               <p>We left Jena early on Tueſday, reached Weiſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feltz in the evening, and Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029861_0146_0FE2AA3560D983F0"/>thither at two in the afternoon. But we could not be admitted into the town, when we came. The King of Pruſſia's tall men, who kept the gates, ſent us backward and forward, from one gate to another, for near two hours. I then thought of ſending in a note to profeſſor Francke, the ſon of that Auguſt Herman Francke, whoſe name, is indeed as precious ointment. O may I follow him, as he did Chriſt! And <hi>by manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth, commend myſelf to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not in town. However we were at length admitted into the orphan-houſe, that amazing proof, that <hi>all things are</hi> ſtill <hi>poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> There is now a large yearly revenue for its ſupport, beſide what is continually brought in by the Printing office, the books ſold there, and the apothecary's ſhop, which is furniſhed with all ſorts of medicines. The building reaches backward from the front is two wings, for, I believe, a hundred and fifty yards. The lodging-chambers for the children, their dining room, their chapel, and all the adjoining apartments, are ſo conveniently contrived, and ſo exactly clean, as I have never ſeen any before. Six hundred and fifty children (we were informed) are wholly maintained there, and three thouſand (if I miſtake not) taught. Surely ſuch a thing neither we nor our fathers have known, as this great thing which God has done here!</p>
               <p>Thurſday 27. We returned to Merſeberg, and at five in the evening came to the gates of Leipſig. After we had ſent in our paſs, and waited an hour and an half, we were ſuffered to go to a bad inn in the town.</p>
               <p>Friday 28. We found out Mr. Merſchall, and the other gentlemen of the univerſity, to whom we were directed. They were not wanting in any good office while we ſtayed, and in the afternoon went with us an hour forward in our journey.</p>

After a pleaſant walk on Saturday, on Sunday 30, about ſeven in the morning, we came to Meiſſen. In Meiſſen-Caſtle, the German china-ware is made, which is full as dear as that imported from the Indies; and as finely ſhaped, and beautifully coloured, as any I have ever ſeen. After breakfaſt we went to church. I was greatly ſurprized at all I ſaw there: at the coſtlineſs of apparel in many, and the gaudineſs of it in more; at the huge fur caps worn by the women, of the ſame ſhope with a Turkiſh turban; which generally had one or more ribbands hanging down a great length behind. The miniſter's habit was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gold and ſcarlet, and a vaſt croſs both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind and before. Moſt of the congregation ſat (the men generally with their hats on, at the prayers as well as ſermon) and all of them ſtayed, during the holy communion, tho' but very few received. Alas, alas! what a <hi>reformed</hi> country is this!</p>
               <p>At two in the afternoon we came to Dreſden, the chief city of Saxony. Here alſo we were carried for above two hours from one magiſtrate or officer to another, with the uſual impertinent ſolemnity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were ſuffered to go to our inn. I greatly wonder that common ſenſe and common humanity (for theſe doubtleſs ſubſiſt in Germany as well as England) do not put an end to this ſenſeleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human uſage of ſtrangers, which we met with at al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every German city, tho' more particularly at Frankfort, Weymar, Halle, Leipſig and Dreſden. I know nothing that can reaſonably be ſaid in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in a time of full peace, being a breach of all the common, even heathen laws of hoſpitality. If it is a cuſtom, ſo much the worſe; the more is the pity and the ſhame.</p>
               <p>In the evening we ſaw the palace the late elector was building, when God called him away. The ſtone-work he had very near finiſhed, and ſome of the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029861_0148_0FE2AA3888AC7198"/>apartments within. It is a beautiful and magnificent deſign; but all is now ſwiftly running to ruin. The new church on the outſide reſembles a theatre. It is eight ſquare, built of fine free-ſtone. We were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired alſo to take notice of the great bridge which joins the new with the old town; of the large, braſs crucifix upon it, generally admired for the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and of the late king Auguſtus's ſtatue on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, which is at a ſmall diſtance from it. Alas! Where will all theſe things appear, when <hi>the earth and the works thereof ſhall be burnt up?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between five and ſix the next evening (having left Mr. Hauptman with his relations in Dreſden) we came to Neuſtadt, but could not procure any lodging in the city. After walking half an hour, we came to another little town, and found a ſort of an inn there: but they told us plainly, <hi>we ſhould have no lodging with them; for they did not like our looks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About eight we were received at a little houſe in another village, where God gave us ſweet reſt.</p>
               <p>Tueſday, Auguſt 1, At three in the afternoon, I came to Hernhuth, about thirty Engliſh miles from Dreſden. It lies in Upper-Luſatia, on the borders of Bohemia, and contains about an hundred houſes, built on a riſing ground, with evergreen woods on two ſides, gardens and corn-fields on the others, and high hills at a ſmall diſtance. It has one long ſtreet, through which the great road from Zittan to Lobau goes. Fronting the middle of this ſtreet is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan-houſe; in the lower part of which is the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's ſhop, in the upper, the chapel, capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſix or ſeven hundred people. Another row of houſes runs at a ſmall diſtance from either end of the orphan-houſe, which accordingly divides the reſt of the town (beſide the long ſtreet) into two ſquares. At the caſt end of it is the Count's houſe, a ſmall, plain building like the reſt: having a large garden behind
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029861_0149_0FE2AA3A1841AFB0"/>it, well laid out, not for ſhow, but for the uſe of the community.</p>
               <p>We had a convenient lodging aſſigned us in the houſe appointed for ſtrangers: and I had now abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant opportunity, of obſerving whether what I had heard was enlarged by the relators, or was neither more nor leſs than the naked truth.</p>
               <p>I rejoiced to find Mr. Hermſdorf here, whom I had ſo often converſed with in Georgia. And there was nothing in his power which he did not do, to make our ſtay here uſeful and agreeable. About eight we went to the public ſervice, at which they frequently uſe other inſtruments with their organ. They began (as uſual) with ſinging. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expounding, cloſed by a ſecond hymn: prayer followed this; and then a few verſes of a third hymn; which concluded the ſervice.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday 2. At four in the afternoon was a love-feaſt of the married men, taking their food with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, and with the voice of praiſe and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>Thurſday 3. (and ſo every day at eleven) I was at the bible conference, wherein Mr. Miller (late maſter of a great ſchool in Zittau, till he left all to follow Chriſt) and ſeveral others, read together, as uſual, a portion of ſcripture in the original. At five was the conference for ſtrangers, when ſeveral queſtions concerning juſtification were reſolved. This evening Chriſtian David came hither. O may God make him a meſſenger of glad tidings.</p>
               <p>On Friday and Saturday (and ſo every day in the following week) I had much converſation with the moſt experienced of the brethren, concerning the great work which God had wrought in their ſouls, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by faith: and with Martin Dober, and the other teachers and elders of the church, concerning the diſcipline uſed therein.</p>

Sund. 6. We went to church at <hi>Bertholdſdorf,</hi> a Lutheran village about an Engliſh mile from <hi>Hern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huth.</hi> Two large candles ſtood lighted upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: the laſt ſupper was painted behind it; the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit was placed over it, and over that, a braſs image of Chriſt on the croſs.</p>
               <p>The miniſter had on a ſort of pudding-ſleeve gown, which covered him all round. At nine began a long voluntary on the organ, cloſed with a hymn, which was ſung by all the people ſitting (in which poſture, as is the German cuſtom, they ſung all that followed.) Then the miniſter walked up to the altar, bowed; ſung theſe latin words, <hi>Gloria in excelſis Deo;</hi> bowed again and went away. This was followed by another hymn, ſung as before, to the organ by all the people. Then the miniſter went to the altar again, bowed, ſung a prayer, read the epiſtle and went away. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a third hymn was ſung, he went a third time to the altar, ſung a verſicle (to which all the people ſung a reſponſe) read the third chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and went away. The people having then ſung the creed in rhyme, he came and read the goſpel, all ſtanding. Another hymn followed, which being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the miniſter in the pulpit uſed a long extemporary prayer, and afterwards preached an hour and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on a verſe of the goſpel. Then he read a long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>After the evening ſervice at Hernhuth was ended, all the unmarried men (as is their cuſtom) walked quite round the town, ſinging praiſe with inſtruments of muſic; and then on a ſmall hill, at a little diſtance from it, caſting themſelves into a ring, joined in prayer. Thence they returned into the great ſquare, and a little after eleven, commended each other to God.</p>

Tueſday 8. A child was buried. The burying ground (called by them Gottes Acker, i. e. God's ground) lies a few hundred yards out of the town, under the ſide of a little wood. There are diſtinct ſquares in it for married men and unmarried; for married and unmarried women; for male and female children, and for widows. The corpſe was carried from the chapel, the children walking firſt: next the Orphan-father (ſo they call him who has the chief care of the Orphan-houſe) with the miniſter of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholdſdorf: then four children bearing the corpſe, and after them, Martin Dober and the father of the child. Then followed the men, and laſt of all the women and girls. They all ſung as they went. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into the ſquare where the male-children are buried, the men ſtood on two ſides of it, the boys on the third, and the women and girls on the fourth. There they ſung again: after which the miniſter uſed (I think read) a ſhort prayer, and concluded with that bleſſing, <hi>"Unto God's gracious mercy and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I commit you."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing the father (a plain man, a taylor by trade) looking at the grave, I aſked, "How do you find yourſelf?" He ſaid, "Praiſed be the Lord, never better. He has taken the ſoul of my child to himſelf. I have ſeen, according to my deſire, his body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to holy ground. And I know that when it is raiſed again, both he and I ſhall ever be with the Lord."</p>
               <p>Several evenings this week I was with one or other of the private bands. On Wedneſday and Thurſday I had an opportunity of talking with Michael Linner, the eldeſt of the church, and largely with Chriſtian David, who, under God, was the firſt planter of it.</p>
               <p>Four times alſo I enjoyed the bleſſing of hearing him preach, during the few days I ſpent here: and every time he choſe the very ſubject which I ſhould
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029861_0152_0FE2AA440B1B6DF8"/>have deſired, had I ſpoken to him before. Thrice he deſcribed the ſtate of thoſe who are <hi>weak in ſaith,</hi> who are juſtified, but have not yet a new, clean heart; who have received forgiveneſs through the blood of Chriſt, but have not received the conſtant indwelling of the Holy Ghoſt. This ſtate he explained once, from, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;</hi> when he ſhewed at large from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſcriptures, that many are children of God and heirs of the promiſes, long before their hearts are ſoftened by holy mourning, before they are <hi>comforted</hi> by the abiding witneſs of the Spirit, melting their ſouls into all gentleneſs and <hi>meekneſs;</hi> and much more, before they are renewed in all that <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which they <hi>hungered and thirſted</hi> after, before they are <hi>ſure in heart</hi> from all ſelf-will and ſin, and <hi>merciful</hi> as their Father which is in heaven is merciful.</p>
               <p>A ſecond time he pointed out this ſtate from thoſe words, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death! I thank God, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Hence alſo he at large both proved the exiſtence, and ſhewed the nature of that intermediate ſtate, which moſt experience between that bondage which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 7th chapter of the epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and the full glorious liberty of the children of God, deſcribed in the eighth and in many oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> parts of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>This he yet again explained from the ſcriptures which deſcribe the ſtate the apoſtles were in, from our Lord's death (and indeed for ſome time before) till the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt at the day of Pentecoſt. They were then <hi>clean</hi> as Chriſt himſelf had borne them witneſs, <hi>by the word which he had ſpoken unto them.</hi> They then <hi>had faith,</hi> otherwiſe he could not have prayed for them, that their <hi>faith</hi> might
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029861_0153_0FE2AA4599864D40"/>
                  <hi>not fail.</hi> Yet they had not in the full ſenſe <hi>new hearts;</hi> neither had they received <hi>the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth ſermon which he preached, concerning the ground of faith, made ſuch an impreſſion upon me, that when I went home, I could not but write down the ſubſtance of it, which was as follows:</p>
               <p>"The word of reconciliation which the apoſtles preached, as the foundation of all they taught was, that <hi>we are reconciled to God, not by our own works, nor by our own righteouſneſs, but wholly and ſolely by the blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"But you will ſay, muſt I not grieve and mourn for my ſins? Muſt I not humble myſelf before God? Is not this juſt and right? And muſt I not do this before I can expect God to be reconciled to me? I anſwer, it is juſt and right. You muſt be humbled before God. You muſt have a broken and contrite heart. But then, obſerve, this is not your own work. Do you grieve that you are a ſinner? This is the work of the Holy Ghoſt. Are you contrite? Are you humbled before God? Do you indeed mourn, and is your heart broken within you? All this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſelf-ſame ſpirit.</p>
               <p>"Obſerve again, this is not the foundation. It is not this by which you are juſtified. This is not the righteouſneſs, this is no part of the righteouſneſs by which you are reconciled unto God. You grieve for your ſins. You are deeply humble. Your heart is broken. Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all this is nothing to your juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The remiſſion of your ſins is not owing to this cauſe, either in whole or in part. Your humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contrition have no influence on that. Nay, obſerve farther, that it may hinder your juſtification, that is, if you build any thing upon it; if you think, I muſt be <hi>ſo or ſo</hi> contrite. I muſt grieve <hi>more,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can be juſtified. Underſtand this well. To think you muſt be <hi>more</hi> contrite, <hi>more</hi> humble, <hi>more</hi> grieved, <hi>more</hi> ſenſible of the weight of ſin, before
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029861_0154_0FE2AA4E37CA5170"/>you can be juſtified; is, to lay your contrition, your grief, your humiliation for the foundation of your being juſtified; at leaſt for a part of the foundation. Therefore it hinders your juſtification; and a hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it is which muſt be removed, before you can lay the right foundation. The right foundation is, not <hi>your</hi> contrition (though that is not your <hi>own)</hi> not <hi>your</hi> righteouſneſs, nothing of <hi>your own:</hi> nothing that is wrought <hi>in you</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt: but it is ſomething <hi>without you,</hi> viz. The righteouſneſs and the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>"For this is the word, <hi>To him that believeth on God that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is founted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> See ye not, that the foundation is nothing in us? There is no connexion between God and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. There is no tie to unite them. They are altogether ſeparate from each other. They have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in common. There is nothing leſs or more in the ungodly, to join them to God. Works, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, contrition? No, Ungodlineſs only. This then do, if you will lay a right foundation. Go ſtraight to Chriſt with all your ungodlineſs. Tell him, thou whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire ſearching my heart, ſeeſt that I am ungodly. I plead nothing elſe. I do not ſay, I am humble or contrite; but I am ungodly. Therefore bring me to him that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ungodly. Let thy blood be the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me. For there is nothing in me but ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p>"Here is a myſtery. Here the wiſe men of the world are loſt, are taken in their own craftineſs. This the learned of the world cannot comprehend. It is fooliſhneſs unto them: ſin is the only thing which divides men from God. Sin (let him that heareth underſtand) is the only thing which unites them to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the only thing which moves the Lamb of

                  </gap> give them acceſs to the Father.</p>
               <p>"This is the <hi>word of reconciliation</hi> which we preach. This is the foundation which never can be moved. By faith we are built upon this foundation; and this faith alſo is the gift of God. It is his free gift, which he now and ever giveth to every one that is willing to receive it. And when they have received this gift of God, then their hearts will melt for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that they have offended him. But this gift of God lives in the heart, not in the head. The faith of the head, learned from men or books, is nothing worth. It brings neither remiſſion of ſins, nor peace with God. Labour then to believe with your whole heart. So ſhall you have redemption through the blood of Chriſt. So ſhall you be cleanſed from all ſin. So ſhall ye go on from ſtrength to ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed day by day in righteouſneſs, and all true holineſs."</p>
               <p>Satur. 12. Was the interceſſion day, when many ſtrangers were preſent, ſome of whom came twenty or thirty miles. I would gladly have ſpent my life here: but my Maſter calling me to labour in another part of his vineyard, on Monday 14, I was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take my leave of this happy place; Martin Dober, and a few others of the brethren, walking with us about an hour.

               </p>
               <p>It was on Auguſt 10 (old ſtile) that I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſpending ſome hours with Chriſtian Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. He is a carpenter by trade, more than middle aged, though I believe not fifty yet. Moſt of his words I underſtood well; if at any time I did not, one of the brethren who went with me, explained them in Latin. The ſubſtance of what he ſpoke, I immediately after wrote down; which was as follows:</p>
               <p>"When I was young, I was much troubled at hearing ſome affirm that the Pope was Antichriſt. I read the Lutheran books writ againſt the Papiſts, and the Popiſh books writ againſt the Lutherans. I eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw that the Papiſts were in the wrong; but not that the Lutherans were in the right. I could not underſtand what they meant by being juſtified by faith, by faith alone, by faith without works. Neither did I like their talking ſo much of Chriſt. Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think, How can Chriſt be the Son of God? But the more I reaſoned with myſelf upon it, the more confuſed I was, till at laſt I loathed the very name of Chriſt. I could not bear to mention it. I hated the ſound of it; and would never willingly have either read or heard it. In this temper I left Moravia, and wandered through many countries, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt but finding none.</p>
               <p>In theſe wandering; I fell among ſome Jews. Their objections againſt the new teſtament, threw me into freſh doubts. At laſt I ſet myſelf to read over the old teſtament, and ſee if the prophecies therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained were fulfilled. I was ſoon convinced they were. And thus much I gained, a fixed belief that Jeſus was the Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſoon after this, a new doubt aroſe, Are the new teſtament prophecies fulfilled! This I next ſet myſelf to examine. I read them carefully over, and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029861_0157_0FE2AA53485C2EB8"/>could not but ſee every event anſwered the prediction: ſo that the more I compared the one with the other, the more fully I was convinced that <hi>All ſcripture was given by inſpiration of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſtill my ſoul was not in peace: nor indeed did I expect it, till I ſhould have openly renounced the errors of Popery: which accordingly I did at Berlin. I now alſo led a very ſtrict life. I read much, and prayed much. I did all I could to conquer ſin; yet it profited not; I was ſtill conquered by it. Neither found I any more reſt among the Lutherans, than I did before among the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>At length, not knowing what to do, I liſted my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſoldier. Now I thought I ſhould have more time to pray and read, having with me a new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a hymn-book. But in one day both my books were ſtole. This almoſt broke my heart. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo in this way of life all the inconveniencies which I thought to avoid by it, after ſix months I returned to my trade, and followed it two years. Removing then to Gorlitz in Saxony, I fell into a dangerous illneſs. I could not ſtir hand nor foot for twenty weeks. Paſtor Sleder came to me every day. And from him it was, that the goſpel of Chriſt came firſt with power to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Here I found the peace I had long ſought in vain; for I was aſſured <hi>my</hi> ſins were forgiven. Not indeed all at once, but by degrees; not in one moment, nor in one hour. For I could not immediately believe, that I <hi>was</hi> forgiven, becauſe of the miſtake I was then in concerning forgiveneſs. I ſaw not then, that the firſt promiſe to the children of God is, <hi>Sin ſhall no more reign over you;</hi> but thought, I was to <hi>feel it in me</hi> no more, from the time it was forgiven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although I had the maſtery over it, yet I often feared it was not forgiven, becauſe it ſtill <hi>ſtirred in me,</hi> and at ſome times <hi>thruſt ſore at me, that I might fall:</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="unknown:029861_0158_0FE2AA5BF73B9660"/>becauſe though it did not <hi>reign,</hi> it did <hi>remain</hi> in me; and I was continually <hi>tempted,</hi> though not <hi>overcome,</hi> This at that time threw me into many doubts: not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that the devil <hi>tempts,</hi> properly ſpeaking, only thoſe whom he perceives to be eſcaping from him. He need not tempt his own: for they <hi>lie in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one</hi> (as St. John obſerves) and do his will with greedineſs. But thoſe whom Chriſt is ſetting free, he tempts day and night, to ſee if he can recover them to his kingdom. Neither ſaw I then, that the <hi>being juſtified,</hi> is widely different from the having <hi>the full aſſurance of faith.</hi> I remembered not, that our Lord told his <hi>apoſtles</hi> before his death, <hi>Ye are clean;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was not till many days after it, that they were fully aſſured by the Holy Ghoſt then received, of their reconciliation to God, through his blood. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe fruits of the Spirit was as yet hid from me; ſo that I was hardly and ſlowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I had the one, becauſe I had not the other.</p>
               <p>When I was recovered from my illneſs, I reſolved to return into Moravia, and preach Chriſt to my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there Thence I came back to Gorlitz, when I continued five years, and there was a great awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening both in the town and country round about. In this ſpace I made two more journies into Moravia, where more and more came to hear me, many of whom promiſed to come to me, wherever I was, when a door ſhould be opened for them.</p>
               <p>After my return from my third journey, Count Zinzendorf ſent to Gorlitz, the miniſter of Bertholdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf being dead, for Mr. Rothe who was in a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's family there, to be miniſter of that place. Mr. Rothe told him of me, and he writ to me to come to him, and when I came, ſaid, <q>Let as many as will of your friends come hither; I will give them land to build on, and Chriſt will give them the reſt.</q> I went immediately into Moravia and told them, God
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029861_0159_0FE2AA5DA1485708"/>had now found out a place for us. Ten of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me then; ten more the next year; one more in my following journey. The Papiſts were now alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſet a price upon my head, and levelled the houſe I had lodged in, even with the ground. I made howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eleven journies thither in all, and conducted as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as deſired it to this place, the way to which was now ſo well known that many came of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Eighteen years ago we built the firſt houſe. We choſe to be near the great road rather than at Bert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdſdorf (for the Count gave us our choice) hoping we might thereby find opportunities of inſtructing ſome that travelled by us. In two years we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a hundred and fifty; when I contracted an intimate acquaintance with a Calviniſt, who after ſome time brought me over to his opinion touching election and reprobation: and by me were moſt of our brethren likewiſe brought over to the ſame opinions. About this time we were in great ſtraits, wherewith many were much dejected. I endeavoured to comfort them with the ſenſe of God's love towards them. But they anſwered, <q>Nay, it may be he hath no love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; it may be we are not of the election: but God hated us from eternity, and therefore he has ſuffered all theſe things to come upon us.</q> The Count obſerving this, deſired me to go to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring miniſter, paſtor Steinm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tz, and talk with him, fully on that head, "Whether Chriſt died for all?" I did ſo, and by him God fully convinced me of that important truth. And not long after, the Count de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired we might all meet together, and conſider theſe things throughly. We met accordingly at his houſe, and parted not for three days. We opened the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſidered the account which is given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, of the whole oeconomy of God with man, from the creation to the conſummation of all things, and by the bleſſing of God we came all to one mind; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029861_0160_0FE2AA5F31948CF8"/>in that fundamental point, that <hi>He willeth all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of his truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometime after, the Jeſuits told the Emperor, that the Count was gathering together all the Moravians and Bohemians, forming them into one body, and making a new religion. Commiſſioners were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent to Hernhuth, to examine the truth of this. The ſubſtance of the final anſwer returned through them to the Emperor was as follows.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                     <p n="1">1. WE believe the church of the Bohemian and Moravian brethren, from whom we are deſcended, to have been a holy and undefiled church, as is owned by Luther and all other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant divines: who own alſo that our doctrine agrees with theirs. But our diſcipline they have not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But we do not reſt upon the holineſs of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; it being our continual care to ſhew that we are paſt from death unto life, by worſhipping God in Spirit and in truth. Nor do we account any man a brother, unleſs he has either preſerved inviolate the covenant he made with God in Laptiſm, or, if he has broken it, been born again of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. On the other ſide, whoſoever they are who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſprinkled by the blood of Chriſt, are ſanctified through faith, we receive them as brethren, although in ſome points they may differ from us. Not that we can renounce or give up any doctrine of God, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in holy writ; the leaſt part of which is dearer unto us, than thouſands of gold and ſilver.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Diſcipline we judge to be neceſſary in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, for all thoſe who have any knowledge of divine truth: and we can therefore in no wiſe forſake
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:029861_0161_0FE2AA60C621B3C0"/>that, which we have received from our forefathers. Yet if it ſhould ever be (which God forbid) that any of us ſhould ſpeak or act perverſe things, we could only ſay, with St. John, <hi>They went forth from us, but were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The public worſhip of God at Bertholdſdorf, which we have hitherto frequented, we are the leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now to forſake, becauſe we have there an aſſembly of true believers, a doctrine free from error, and a paſtor who <hi>having laboured much in the word, is worthy of double honour.</hi> Therefore we have no cauſe to form any congregation, ſeparate from this; eſpecially ſeeing we both uſe that liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us; and ſo often experience the power of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which is taught there, and agree with the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical proteſtants (i. e. Lutherans) in all truths of importance. As for the controverted points, which require a ſubtle wit, we either are ignorant of them, or deſpiſe them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The name of brethren and ſiſters we do not reject, as being agreeable both to ſcripture and to Chriſtian ſimplicity. But we do not approve of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by the name of any man: as knowing, <hi>we have one father, even him which is in heaven.</hi>

Retiring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the year 1453, to a place on the borders of Sileſm and Moravia, they lived in peace, till the time of Luther and Calvin, with both of whom, as with their followers, they maintained a friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, eſpecially when by the providence of God, they were placed among thoſe of either opinion.</p>

And hence it was that the Romiſh paſtors bore with them; being little concerned what their private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were. But hence it alſo was, that continually uſing diſſimulation, and not walking in ſimplicity, they were no longer fervent in ſpirit, as of old time, neither could they find any peace to their ſouls.</p>

The ſame did many others ſoon after, as finding no ſafety, either for body or ſoul in their own country: whence about the ſame time, Michael and Martin Linner, and the Haberlands were driven out, with their families, after having ſuffered the loſs of all things, for not conforming to the Romiſh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and for receiving thoſe they called Heretics into to their houſes.</p>

               <p>"In the mean time we found a great remiſſneſs of behaviour had crept in among us. And indeed the ſame was to be found in moſt of thoſe round about us, whether Lutherans or Calviniſts, ſo inſiſting on faith, as to forget at leaſt in practice, both holineſs and good works.</p>
               <p>Obſerving this terrible abuſe of preaching Chriſt <hi>given for us,</hi> we began to inſiſt more than ever, on Chriſt <hi>living in us.</hi> All our exhortation and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned on this; we ſpoke, we writ, of nothing elſe. Our conſtant inquiries were, "Is Chriſt formed <hi>in you?</hi> Have you a new heart? Is your ſoul renewed in the image of God? Is the whole body of ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in you? Are you fully aſſured, beyond all doubt or fear, that you are a child of God? In what manner, and at what moment did you receive that full aſſurance?" If a man could not anſwer all theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029861_0164_0FE2AA6C8D057730"/>we judged he had no true faith. Nor would we permit any to receive the Lord's ſupper among us, till he could.</p>
               <p>In this perſuaſion we were, when I went to Groen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, five years ago. There I had a correſpondence by letter with a Daniſh miniſter, on the head of juſtification. And it pleaſed God to ſhew me by him (though he was by no means a holy man, but openly guilty of groſs ſins) that we had now leaned too much to this hand, and were run into another extreme: that Chriſt <hi>in us</hi> and <hi>Chriſt for us,</hi> ought indeed to be both inſiſted on; but firſt and principally <hi>Chriſt for us,</hi> as being the ground of all. I now clearly ſaw, we ought not to inſiſt on any thing we <hi>feel,</hi> any more than any thing we do, as if it were neceſſary previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to juſtification, or the remiſſion of ſins. I ſaw, that leaſt of all ought we ſo to inſiſt on the full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith, or the deſtruction of the body of ſin, and the extinction of all its motions, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thoſe who had not attained this from the Lord's table, or to deny that they had any faith at all. I plainly perceived, this full aſſurance was a diſtinct gift from juſtifying faith, and often not given till long after it: and that juſtification does not imply, that fin ſhould not <hi>ſtir</hi> in us, but only that it ſhould not <hi>conquer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now firſt it was, that I had that full aſſurance of my own reconciliation to God, through Chriſt. For many years I had had the forgiveneſs of my ſins, and a meaſure of the peace of God; but I had not till now, that witneſs of his Spirit, which ſhuts out all doubt and fear. In all my trials I had always a confidence in Chriſt, who had done ſo great things for me. But it was a confidence mixed with fear: I was afraid, <hi>I had not done enough.</hi> There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething dark in my ſoul till now. But now the clear light ſhined: and I ſaw that what I had hitherto ſo conſtantly inſiſted on, the <hi>doing</hi> ſo much and <hi>feeling</hi> ſo
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029861_0165_0FE2AA6EF0FDD308"/>much, the long repentance and preparation for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, the bitter ſorrow for ſin, and that deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of heart which is found in ſome, where by no means eſſential to juſtification. Yea, that wherever the free grace of God is rightly preached, a ſinner in the full career of his ſins, will probably receive it, and be juſtified by it, before one who inſiſts on ſuch previous preparation.</p>
               <p>After my return to Hernhuth, I found it difficult at firſt, to make my brethren ſenſible of this, or to perſuade them not to inſiſt on the aſſurance of faith, as a neceſſary qualification for receiving the Lord's ſupper. But from the time they were convinced, which is now three years ſince, we have all chiefly inſiſted on <hi>Chriſt given for us;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">I dare ſay, this is right.</note> This we urge as the principal thing, which if we rightly believe, Chriſt will ſurely be <hi>formed in us.</hi> And this preaching we have always found to be accompanied with power, and to have the bleſſing of God following it. By this, believers receive a ſteady purpoſe of heart, and a more unſhaken reſolution, to endure with a free and cheerful ſpirit whatſoever our Lord is pleaſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The ſame day I was with Michael Linner, the eldeſt of the church; the ſum of whoſe converſation was this:</p>
               <p>"The church of Moravia was once a glorious church. But it is now covered with thick darkneſs. It is about ſixteen years ago, that I began to ſeek for light. I had a New Teſtament which I conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read; upon which I often ſaid to myſelf, "This ſays, I ought to be humble, and meek, and pure in heart. How comes it that I am not ſo?" I went to the beſt men I knew, and aſked, "Is not this the word of God? And if ſo, ought I not to be ſuch as this requires, both in heart and life?" They anſwered,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029861_0166_0FE2AAC223DE4428"/>"The firſt Chriſtians were ſuch; but it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>us</hi> to be ſo perfect." This anſwer gave me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſatisfaction. I knew God could not mock his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eatures, by requiring of them what he ſaw it was impoſſible for them to perform. I aſked others, but had ſtill the ſame anſwer, which troubled me more and more.</p>
               <p>About fourteen years ago, I was more than ever convinced, that I was wholly different from what God required me to be. I conſulted his word again and again; but it ſpoke nothing but condemnation; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill at laſt I could not read, nor indeed do any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, having no hope and no ſpirit leſt in me. I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een in this ſtate for ſeveral days, when being muſing by myſelf, theſe words came ſtrongly into my mind, <hi>"God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that all who believe in him, ſhould not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the full aſſurance of faith I had not yet; nor for the two years I continued in Moratia. When I was driven out thence by the Jeſuits, I retired hither, and was ſoon after received into the church. And here after ſome time it pleaſed our Lord to manifeſt himſelf more clearly to my ſoul, and give me that full ſenſe of acceptance in him, which excludes all doubt and fear.</p>
               <p>Indeed the leading of the ſpirit is different in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſouls. His more uſual method, I believe is, to give in one and the ſame moment the forgivneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and a full aſſurance of that forgiveneſs. Yet in many he works as he did in me: giving firſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and after ſome weeks or months <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:029861_0167_0FE2AA789441F578"/>
This great truth was farther confirmed to me the next day by the converſation I had with David Nitſch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, one of the teachers or paſtors of the church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> who expreſſed himſelf to this effect:</p>
               <p>"In my childhood I was very ſerious; but as I grew up, was ſo careleſs, that at eighteen years old, I had even forgot to read. When I found this, I was ſtartled. I ſoon learned again, and then ſpent much time in reading and prayer. But I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my heart, till about the age of twenty-ſix, I bought a bible, and began to read the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The farther I read, the more I was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I found a law which I did not, could not keep. I had a will to avoid all ſin: but the power I had not. I continually ſtrove; but was continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. The thing which <hi>I would I did not;</hi> but what I <hi>would</hi> not have done, that I did. In this bondage I was, when I fell into a ſit of ſickneſs; during my recovery from which I felt a ſtronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire than ever, to avoid all ſin. At the ſame time I felt the power. And ſin no longer reigned over me.</p>
               <p>But ſoon after I fell into grievous temptations; which made me very uneaſy. For though I yielded not to them, yet they returned again, and again, as faſt as they were conquered. Then it came into my mind, "I take all this pains to ſerve God. What if there be no God? How do I know there is?" And on this I muſed more and more, till I ſaid in my heart, "There is no God!"</p>
               <p>In this ſtate I was when I came to Hernhuth, about fourteen years ago. And every day for a full year, from morning to night, I groaned under this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. Yet I prayed continually, unbelieving as I was; particularly one Sunday, when being in the church of Bertholdſdorf, and quite weary of hearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> much of him, whoſe very being I did not believe,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029861_0168_0FE2AA7A232D8610"/>I vehemently ſaid, "O God, If thou be a God, thou muſt manifeſt thyſelf, or I cannot believe it." In walking home, I thought of an expreſſion of Paſtor Rothe's, "Only <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> theſe things are ſo: <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> there be a God." I ſaid to myſelf, "Well, I with I <hi>do</hi> ſuppoſe it." Immediately I felt a ſtrange ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my ſoul, which increaſed every moment till the next morning: and from that time, if all the men upon earth, and all the devils in hell had joined in denying it, I could not have doubted the being of God, no, not for one moment. This firſt ſweetneſs laſted for ſix weeks, without any intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>I then fell into doubts of another kind. I believed in God; but not in Chriſt. I opened my heart to Martin Dober, who uſed many arguments with me, but in vain. For above four years I found no reſt, by reaſon of this unbelief, till one day, as I was ſitting in my houſe deſpairing of any relief, thoſe words ſhot into me, <hi>"God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf."</hi> I thought, "Then God and Chriſt are one." Immediately my heart was filled with joy; and much more at the remembrance of theſe words which I now felt I <hi>did believe. "The word was with God, and the word was God. And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in a few days I was troubled again. I believed Chriſt was the Saviour of the world. But I could not call him <hi>my</hi> Saviour, neither did I believe, he would ſave <hi>me.</hi> And one day, as I was walking acroſs the ſquare, that text came ſtrongly into my mind, <hi>"The unbelieving ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone."</hi> I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home, terrified beyond expreſſion, and inſtantly began crying out to our Saviour, telling him, "I deſerved no leſs than hell, and gave myſelf up, if it were his will, to ſuffer what I had deſerved." In a
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029861_0169_0FE2AA7BF5F4AAF8"/>moment I found a gleam of hope, that he <hi>would</hi> have mercy even on me.</p>
               <p>But this in a ſhort time vaniſhed away, and my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs returned again. Many endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me that I had, but I knew I had not, a right faith in Chriſt. For I had no confidence in him; nor could I lay hold upon him as <hi>my</hi> Saviour. Indeed reading one day (in Arndt's True Chriſtianity) "That if all the ſins of all the men upon earth were joined in one man, the blood of Chriſt was ſufficient to cleanſe that man from all ſin:" I felt for a time comfort and peace: but it was but for a time, and then I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed as before with ſadneſs and unbelief. And I was oppreſſed almoſt beyond my ſtrength, when

Now which of the two conſequences will you chuſe (for one or the other is unavoidable) Either that a man may preach the goſpel, yea (and with the demonſtration of the Spirit) who has no ſaith? or that a man who has a degree of true faith, may yet have doubts and fears?</note> a year ago I went into this little wood. At firſt I was tempted to break out into impatience; but then I thought, our Saviour knows beſt; nor would he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this trouble to continue ſo long, if he did not ſee it was good for me. I delivered myſelf wholly into his hands, to diſpoſe of me according to his good pleaſure. In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some of the circumſtances of this uncommon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were made more clear to me, by the account I
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029861_0170_0FE2AA8447173368"/>received in the afternoon from a ſtudent at Hernl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uth, Albinus Theodorus Feder.</p>
               <p>"I (ſaid he) for three years ſought againſt ſin with all my might, by faſting and prayer and all the other means of grace. But notwithſtanding all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I gained no ground; ſin ſtill prevailed over me; till at laſt, not knowing what to do farther, I was on the very brink of deſpair. Then it was that having no other refuge left, I fled to my Saviour as one loſt and undone, and that had no hope but in his power and free mercy. In that moment I found my heart at reſt, in good hope that my ſins were forgiven; of which, I had a ſtronger aſſurance ſix weeks after, when I received the Lord's ſupper here. But I dare not affirm, I am a child of God; neither have I the ſeal of the Spirit. Yet I go on quietly doing my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's will, taking ſhelter in his wounds, from all trouble and ſin, and knowing he will perfect his work in his own time."</p>
               <p>Martin Dober, when I deſcribed my ſtate to him, ſaid, "He had known very many believers, who if aſked the queſtion, would not have dared to affirm, that they were the children of God. And he added, It is very common for perſons to receive remiſſion of ſins, or juſtification through faith in the blood of Chriſt, before they receive the full aſſurance of faith, which God many times with-holds, till be has tried whether they will work together with him, in the uſe of the firſt gift. Nor is there any need (continued he, Dober) to incite any one to ſeek that aſſurance by telling him, the faith he has is nothing. This will be more likely to drive him to deſpair, than to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to preſs forward. His ſingle buſineſs, who has received the firſt gift is, <hi>credendo credere &amp; in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo perſeverare</hi> (to believe on, and to hold faſt that whereunto he hath obtained). To go on, doing his
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:029861_0171_0FE2AA8634EB2A38"/>Lord's will, according to the ability God hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given; chearfully and faithfully to uſe what he has received, without ſolicitude for the reſt."</p>
               <p>In the converſation I afterwards had with Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Neuſſer, a knife-ſmith (another of the paſtors or teachers of the church, about ſixty years of age) as alſo with his brothers, Wenſel, and Hantz Neuſſer, the nature of true faith and ſalvation was yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explained to me.</p>
               <p>Auguſtine Neuſſer ſpoke to this effect:</p>
               <p>"By experience I know, that we cannot be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the blood of Chriſt, till we feel that all our righteouſneſs and good works avail nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our juſtification. Therefore what men call <hi>a good life,</hi> is frequently the greateſt of all hinderances to their coming to Chriſt. For it will not let them ſee, that they are loſt, undone ſinners, and if they ſee not this, they cannot come unto him.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with me. I had led a good life from a child. And this was the great hinderance to my coming to Chriſt. For, abounding in good works, and diligently uſing all the means of grace, I perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf for thirteen or fourteen years, that all was well, and I could not fail of ſalvation. And yet, I cannot ſay my ſoul was at reſt, even till the time when God ſhewed me clearly, that my heart was as corrupt, notwithſtanding all my good works, as that of an adulterer or murderer. Then my ſelf-depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence withered away. I wanted a Saviour, and fled naked to him. And in him I found true reſt to my ſoul, being fully aſſured that all <hi>my</hi> ſins were forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Yet I cannot tell the hour or day, when I firſt received that full aſſurance. For it was not given me at firſt, neither at once; but grew up in me by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029861_0172_0FE2AA87CB9F1130"/>But from the time it was confirmed in me, I never loſt it; having never ſince doubted, no, not for a moment."</p>
               <p>What Wenſel Neuſſer ſaid was as follows:</p>
               <p>"From a child I had many fits of ſeriouſneſs, and was often uneaſy at my ſins: this uneaſineſs was much increaſed fifteen years ſince, by the preaching of Chriſtian David. I thought the way to get eaſe was, to go and live among the Lutherans, whom I ſuppoſed to be all good Chriſtians. But I ſoon found they, as well as the Papiſts, were carnal, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded men. About thirteen years ago I came from among them to Hernhuth; but was ſtill as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy as before: which I do not wonder at now (though I did then) for all this time, though I ſaw clearly, I could not be ſaved, but by the death of Chriſt, yet I did not truſt in that <hi>only</hi> for ſalvation, but depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my own righteouſneſs <hi>alſo,</hi> as the joint conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my acceptance.</p>
               <p>After I was ſettled here, ſeeing the great diverſity of ſects wherewith we were ſurrounded, I began to doubt whether any religion was true? For half a year theſe doubts perplexed me greatly; and I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten juſt on the point of caſting off all religion, and returning to the world. The fear of doing this threw me into a deeper concern than ever I had been in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Nor could I find how to eſcape, for the more I ſtruggled the more I was entangled. I often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on my former courſe of life, as more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than this. And one day, in the bitterneſs of my ſoul, beſought our bleſſed Saviour, "at leaſt to reſtore me to that ſtate, which I was in before I left Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via." In that moment he manifeſted himſelf to me, ſo that I could lay hold on him as <hi>my</hi> Saviour, and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:029861_0173_0FE2AA895BBAA200"/>ſhewed me, it is <hi>only</hi> the blood of Chriſt which cleanſeth us from all ſin. This was ten years ſince, and from that hour, I have not had one doubt of my acceptance. Yet I have not any tranſports of joy. Nor had I when he thus revealed himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Only I well remember, that manifeſtation of himſelf was like a cool, refreſhing wind, to one that is fainting away with fultry heat. And ever ſince my ſoul has been ſweetly at reſt, deſiring no other portion in earth or heaven."</p>
               <p>"I was awakened (ſaid Hantz Neuſſer) by my grandfather when a child, and by him carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the new teſtament. I married young, and being from that time weak and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ckly, was the more earneſt to work out my ſalvation: and nineteen or twenty years ago, I had a ſtrong confidence in our. Saviour, and was continually warning others againſt truſting in themſelves, in their own righteouſneſs or good works. Yet I was not free from it myſelf. I did not truſt in him <hi>only</hi> for acceptance with God. And hence it was, that not building on the right foundation, the blood and righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, I could not gain a full victory over my ſins, but ſometimes conquered them, and ſometimes was conquered by them. And therefore I had not a full or conſtant peace, though I was commonly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and hoping for mercy.</p>
               <p>Sixteen years ago (on Saturday next) I came to my brother Auguſtine at Hernhuth. There was then only one little houſe here. Here I continued eight years in much the ſame ſtate, thinking I truſted in Chriſt alone; but indeed truſting partly in his and partly in my own righteouſneſs. I was walking one day in this little wood, when God diſcovered my heart to me. I ſaw I had till that hour truſted in my own righteouſneſs, and at the ſame time, that I had
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:029861_0174_0FE2AA945BAE5590"/>no righteouſneſs at all, being altogether corrupt and abominable, and fit only for the fire of hell. At this ſight I fell into bitter grief, and an horrible dread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed me, expecting nothing (as I ſaw I deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing elſe) but to be ſwallowed up in a moment. In that moment I beheld the Lamb of God, taking away my ſins. And from that time I have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, and full aſſurance of it. I have that peace in him which never fails, and which admits of no doubt or fear. Indeed I am but a little one in Chriſt; therefore I can receive as yet but little of him. But from his fulneſs I have enough; and I praiſe him, and am ſatisfied."</p>
               <p>In the three or four following days I had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of talking with Zacharias Neuſſer (couſin to Hantz) David Schneider, Chriſtopher Demuth, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Gradin (now at Conſtantinople) and ſeveral others of the moſt experienced brethren. I believe no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is needful to the account they gave of God's dealings with their ſouls, which I doubt not will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>"I was born (ſaid Zacharias Neuſſer) on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Moravia, and was firſt awakened by my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Wenſel, who ſoon after carried me to hear Mr. Steinmetz, a Lutheran miniſter, about thirty Engliſh miles off. I was utterly aſtoniſhed. The next week I went again: after which, going to him in private, I opened my heart, and told him all my doubts, thoſe eſpecially concerning Popery. He offered to receive me into communion with him, which I gladly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; and in a ſhort time after I received the Lord's ſupper from his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. While I was receiving, I felt Chriſt had died for <hi>me.</hi> I knew I was reconciled to God. And all the day I was overwhelmed with joy: having thoſe words continually on my mind, <hi>This day is ſalvation come to my houſe: I alſo</hi> am a ſon <hi>of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:029861_0175_0FE2AA968CB11D70"/>This joy I had continually for a year and a half, and my heart was full of love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>After this I had thoughts of leaving Moravia. I was convinced it would be better for my ſoul. Yet I would not do it, becauſe I got more money here than I could elſewhere. When I reflected on this, I ſaid to myſelf, "This is mere covetouſneſs. But if I am covetous, I am not a child of God." Hence I fell into deep perplexity, nor could I find any way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape out of it. In this ſlavery and miſery I was for five years; at the end of which I fell ſick: in my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs my heart was ſet at liberty, and peace returned to my ſoul. I now prayed earneſtly to God, to reſtore my health, that I might leave Moravia. He did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, and I immediately returned to Hernhuth. After I had been here a quarter of a year, the Count preached one day, upon the nature of ſanctification. I found I had not experienced what he deſcribed, and was greatly terrified. I went to my couſin Wenſel, who adviſed me to read over the 3d, 4th and 5th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the epiſtle to the Romans. I did ſo. I had read them an hundred times before, yet now they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared quite new, and gave me ſuch a ſight of God's juſtifying the ungodly, as I never had before. On Sunday I went to church at Bertholdſdorf, and while we were ſinging thoſe words, <hi>"Wir glauben auch in Jeſum Chriſt,"</hi> (we believe alſo in Jeſus Chriſt) I clearly ſaw him as my Saviour. I wanted immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be alone, and to pour out my heart before him. My ſoul was filled with thankfulneſs, and with a ſtill, ſoft, quiet joy, ſuch as it is impoſſible to expreſs. I had full aſſurance that <hi>my Beloved was mine, and I was his,</hi> which has never ceaſed to this day. I ſee by a clear light, what is pleaſing to him, and I do it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in love. I receive daily from him peace and joy; and I have nothing to do but to praiſe him."</p>

The moſt material part of David Schneider's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was this:</p>
               <p>"Both my father and mother feared God, and carefully inſtructed me in the holy ſcriptures. I was from a child earneſtly deſirous to follow their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and more ſo after my father's death. Yet as I grew up, many ſins got the dominion over me. Of which God began to give me a ſenſe, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Paſtor Steinmetz; who ſpeaking one day of drunkenneſs, to which I was then addicted, I was ſo grieved and aſhamed, that for ſeveral days I could not bear to look any one in the face. It pleaſed God afterwards to give me, though not all at once, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nſe of my other both outward and inward ſins. And before the time of my coming out of Moravia, I knew that my ſins were forgiven. Yet I cannot ſix on any particular time, when I knew this firſt. For I did not clearly know it at once: God having always done every thing in my ſoul by degrees.</p>
               <p>When I was about twenty-ſix I was preſſed in ſpirit to exhort and inſtruct my brethren. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly many of them met at my houſe to read pray, and ſing pſalms. They uſually came about ten or eleven, and ſtayed till one or two in the morning. When Chriſtian David came to us, we were much quickened and comforted, and our number greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. We were undiſturbed for two years. But then the Papiſts were informed of our meeting. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſearch was made. All our books were ſeized, and we were ordered to appear before the Conſiſtory. I was examined many times; was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, releaſed and impriſoned again five times in one year. At laſt I was adjudged to pay fifty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> re-hearing, the ſentence was changed, and I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be ſent to the gallies. Before this ſentence
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029861_0177_0FE2AA99B828F400"/>was executed, I eſcaped out of priſon, and came to Sorau in Sileſia. Many of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> brethren followed me, and here for near ten years I taught the children in the orphan-houſe. I ſoon ſem for my wife and children. But the magiſtrates had juſt then ordered that the wives and children of all thoſe who had fled, ſhould be taken into ſafe cuſtody. The night before this order was to be executed, ſhe eſcaped and came to Sorau.</p>
               <p>Soon after, ſome of my brethren who had been there, preſſed me much to remove to Hernhuth: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian David in particular, by whoſe continued impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, I was at length brought to reſolve upon it. But all my brethren at Sorau were ſtill as ſtrongly againſt it, as I myſelf had formerly been. For a whole year I was ſtruggling to break from them or to perſuade them to go too. And it coſt me more pains to get from Sorau, than it had done to leave Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia.</p>
               <p>At length I broke looſe and came to Hernhuth, which was about three years ago. Finding I could ſcarce ſubſiſt my family here by hard labour, whereas at Sorau all things were provided for me, I grew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſy. The more uneaſy I was, the more my brethren refrained from my company;
<note n="*" place="bottom">This was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I tried all ways, but found no help. In this miſerable ſtate I was about a year ago, when the brethren caſt lots concerning me, and were thereby directed to admit me to the Lord's table. And from that hour my ſoul received comfort, and I was more and more aſſured that I had an advocate with the Father, and that I was fully reconciled to God by his blood."</p>

                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:029861_0178_0FE2AAA2A33A99B8"/>
Chriſtopher Demuth ſpoke to this effect:</p>
               <p>"My father was a pious man from his youth. He carefully inſtructed all his children. I was about fifteen when he died. A little before he died, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been all his life-time under the law, he received at once remiſſion of ſins, and the full witneſs of the Spirit. He called us to him and ſaid, "My dear children, let your whole truſt be in the blood of Chriſt. Seek ſalvation in this, and in this alone, and he will ſhew to you the ſame mercy he has to me. Yea, and he will ſhew it to many of your relations and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, when his time is come."</p>
               <p>From this time till I was twenty-ſeven years old I was more and more zealous in ſeeking Chriſt. I then removed into Sileſia, and married. A year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was much preſſed in ſpirit, to return and viſit my brethren in Moravia. I did ſo. We had the New Teſtament, our Moravian hymns, and two or three Lutheran books. We read and ſung, and prayed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and were much ſtrengthened. One day as we were together at my houſe, one knocked at the door. I opened it and he was a Jeſuit. He ſaid, "My dear Demuth, I know you are a good man, and one that inſtructs and exhorts your friends, I muſt ſee what books you have." And going into the inner room, he found the teſtament, and the reſt together. He took them all away; nor did we dare to hinder him. The next day we were ſummoned before the Conſiſtory, and after a long examination, ordered to appear in the church before the congregation, on the following Sunday. There they read a long confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, and afterwards bid us ſay, "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt." We did ſo, though not knowing what they meant. They then told us, "We had abjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lutheran errors, and had called the bleſſed
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029861_0179_0FE2AAA4B7E02F18"/>Trinity to witneſs, that we aſſented to that confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith." My heart ſunk within me when I heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. I went home, but could find no reſt. I thought I had now denied my Saviour, and could expect no more mercy from him. I could not bear to ſtay in Moravia any longer, but immediately returned into Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia. There I continued ſix years, but there too I was perpetually terrified with the thoughts of what I had done. I often enquired after my brethren whom I had left in Moravia. Some of them I heard were thrown into priſon, and others eſcaped to a little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in Luſatia called Hernhuth. I wiſhed I could go to that place myſelf, and at laſt meeting with one who had the ſame deſire, we agreed to go together. But our deſign being diſcovered he was apprehended and thrown into priſon. Expecting the ſame treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I earneſtly prayed, "That God would ſhew me a token for good." Immediately my ſoul was filled with joy, and I was ready to go to priſon or to death.</p>
               <p>Two days paſſed, and no man aſked me any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when doubting, what I ought to do, I went into a neighbouring wood, and going into a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave, fell on my face and prayed, "Lord, thou ſeeſt I am ready to do what thou wilt. If it be thy will I ſhould be caſt into priſon, thy will be done. If it be thy will, that I ſhould leave my wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I am ready. Only ſhew thy will." Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately I heard a loud voice ſaying, <hi>"Fort, fort, fort"</hi> (Go on, go on) I roſe joyful and ſatisfied; went home and told my wife, "It was God's will I ſhould now leave her; but that I hoped to return in a ſhort time, and take her and my children with me." I went out of the door, and in that moment was filled with peace and joy and comfort.</p>
               <p>We had above two hundred miles to go (thirty-five German) and neither I, nor my friend who went
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:029861_0180_0FE2AAA64B53EED0"/>with me, had one Kreutzer.
<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſmall coin of about a half-penny value.</note> But God provided things convenient for us, ſo that in all the way we wanted nothing.</p>
               <p>In this journey God gave me the full aſſurance that my ſins were forgiven. This was twelve years ago, and ever ſince, it has been confirmed more and more, by my receiving from him every day freſh ſupplies of ſtrength and comfort.</p>
               <p>By comparing my experience with that of others, you may perceive, how different ways God leads dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſouls. But though a man ſhould be led in a way different from that of all other men, yet if his eye be at all times fixed on his Saviour, if his conſtant aim be to do his will; if all his deſires tend to him; if in all trials he can draw ſtrength from him; if he fly to him in all troubles, and in all temptations find ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his blood; in this there can be no deluſion: And whoſoever is thus minded, however or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it began, is ſurely reconciled to God through his Son."</p>
               <p>Arvid Gradin (a Swede, born in Dalecarlia) ſpoke to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>"Before I was ten years old, I had a ſerious ſenſe of religion, and great fervour in my prayer. This was increaſed by my reading much in the New Teſtament; but the more I read, the more earneſtly I cried out, "Either theſe things are not true, or we are not Chriſtians." About ſixteen my ſenſe of religion began to decline, by my too great fondneſs for learning, eſpecially the oriental tongues, wherein I was inſtructed by a private preceptor, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did all that in him lay, to inſtruct me in true divinity.</p>
               <p>At ſeventeen I went to the univerſity of Upſal, and a year or two after was licenſed to preach. But
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:029861_0181_0FE2AAA8C4546218"/>at twenty-two meeting with Arndt's True Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, found I myſelf was not a Chriſtian. Immediately I left off preaching, and betook myſelf wholly to philoſophy. This ſtifled all my convictions for ſome years; but when I was about twenty-ſeven, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and continued the year after, when I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be domeſtic tutor to the children of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State. I now felt I was <hi>carnal, ſold under ſin,</hi> and continually ſtruggled to burſt the bonds, till (being about thirty-one years old) I was unawares entangled in much worldly buſineſs. This cooled me in my purſuit of holineſs; yet for a year and a half my heart was never at peace. Being then in a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller's ſhop, I ſaw the account of the church at Hernhuth. I did not think there could be any ſuch place, and aſked the bookſeller, if that was a real ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? His anſwer, "That it was no more than the plain truth," threw me into deep thought, and fervent prayer, that God would bring me to that place. I went to the Secretary, and told him, "I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſtay at Upſal, having a deſire to travel." He ſaid, "He had a deſire his ſon ſhould travel, and was glad of an opportunity to ſend him with me." I was grieved but knew not how to refuſe any thing to my patron and benefactor. Accordingly we left Upſal together, and after a year ſpent in ſeveral parts of Germany, went through Holland into France, and ſo to Paris, where we ſpent another year. But I was more and more uneaſy till I could be diſengaged from my charge, that I might retire to Hernhuth. In our return from France, my pupil's elder brother return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Italy met us at Leipſig. I immediately writ to his father, and having obtained his conſent, delivered him into his hands.</p>
               <p>April 23, 1738, (N. S.) I came hither. Here I was as in another world. I deſired nothing but to be cleanſed inwardly and outwardly from ſin, by the
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029861_0182_0FE2AAAF16AF1548"/>blood of Jeſus Chriſt. I found all here laying the ſame foundation. Therefore, though I did not think with them in all points of doctrine, I waved theſe, and ſingly purſued reconciliation with God through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of May laſt, I could think of nothing but, <hi>He that believeth hath everlaſting life.</hi> But I was afraid of deceiving myſelf, and continually prayed I might not build without a foundation. Yet I had a ſweet, ſettled peace, and for five days this ſcripture was always in my thoughts. On the 28th thoſe words of our Lord were as ſtrongly impreſſed upon me, <hi>"If ye being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Ghoſt to them that aſk him."</hi> At the ſame time I was inceſſantly carried out, to aſk, that he would give me the witneſs of his Spirit. Or the 29th I had what I aſked of him, viz. the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III. The rulers of the church, <hi>i. e.</hi> The elders, teachers, helpers, have a conference every week, purely concerning the ſtate of ſouls, and another concerning the inſtitution of youth. Beſide which, they have
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029861_0184_0FE2AAB375BAC6A8"/>one every day, concerning outward things relating to the church.</p>
               <p>The overſeers, the monitors, the almoners, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders on the ſick, the ſervants, the ſchool-maſters, the young men, and the children, have likewiſe each a conference once a week, relating to their ſeveral offices and duties.</p>
               <p>Once a week alſo is a conference for ſtrangers; at which any perſon may be preſent, and propoſe any queſtion or doubt, which he deſires to have reſolved.</p>
               <p>In Hernhuth is taught reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Engliſh, hiſtory and geography.</p>
               <p>There is a Latin, French, and an Engliſh lecture every day, as well as an hiſtorical and geographical one. On Monday, Wedneſday, Friday and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is the Hebrew lecture; the Greek on Tueſday and Thurſday.</p>
               <p>In the Orphan-houſe, the larger children riſe at five (the ſmaller, between five and ſix.) After a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle private prayer they work till ſeven. Then they are at ſchool till eight, the hour of prayer. At nine thoſe who are capable of it learn Latin, at ten French. At eleven they all walk. At twelve they dine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and walk till one. At one they work or learn writing; at three arithmetic; at four hiſtory; at five they work; at ſix ſup and work; at ſeven, after a time ſpent in prayer, walk; at eight the ſmaller chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren go to bed, the larger to the public ſervice. When this is ended, they work again, till (at ten) they go to bed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Every morning at eight is ſinging and expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcripture; and commonly ſhort prayer.</p>
               <p>At eight in the evening, there is commonly only mental prayer,
<note n="*" place="bottom">This is unſcriptural.</note> joined with the ſinging and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:029861_0185_0FE2AAB505C93F38"/>
The faithful afterwards ſpend a quarter of an hour in prayer, and conclude with the kiſs of peace.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning the ſervice begins at ſix; at nine the public ſervice at Bertholdſdorf. At one the eldeſt gives ſeparate exhortations to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church, divided into fourteen little claſſes for that purpoſe, ſpending about a quarter of an hour with each claſs. At four begins the evening ſervice at Bertholdſdorf, cloſed by a conference in the church. At eight is the uſual ſervice; after which the young men, ſinging praiſes round the town, conclude the day.</p>
               <p>On the firſt Saturday in the month, the Lord's ſupper is adminiſtered. From ten in the morning till two, the eldeſt ſpeaks with each communicant in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, concerning the ſtate of his ſoul. At two they dine; then waſh one another's feet, after which they ſing and pray. About ten they receive in ſilence without any ceremony, and continue in ſilence till they part at twelve.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond Saturday is the ſolemn prayer-day for the children: the third is the day of general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and thankſgiving: and on the fourth is the great monthly conference of all the ſuperiors of the church.</p>

And to this head we refer whatever directly and in itſelf tends to hinder the ſalvation of ſouls: or, whatſoever things Chriſt and his holy apoſtles (who we know meddled not with outward worldly things) took charge of, and performed, as neceſſary for the conſtituting and well-ordering of his church. In theſe things we acknowledge no head but Chriſt; and are determined, God being our helper, to give up, not only our goods (as we did before) but life itſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this liberty which God hath given us.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. As it behoves all Chriſtians not to be ſlothful in buſineſs, but diligently to attend the works of their calling; there are perſons choſen by the church, to ſuperintend all thoſe who are employed in outward buſineſs.

                           <p n="10">10. In the year 1727, four and twenty men and as many women agreed, That each of them would ſpend an hour in every day, in praying to God for his bleſſing on his people: and for this purpoſe both the men and the women choſe a place, where any of their own ſex, who were in diſtreſs, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them. The ſame number of unmarried wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of unmarried men, of boys, and of girls, were afterwards at their deſire, added to them; who pour out their ſouls before God, not only for their own brethren, but alſo for other churches and perſons, that have deſired to be mentioned in their prayers. And this perpetual interceſſion has never ceaſed day or night ſince its firſt beginning.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. And as the members of the church are divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to their reſpective ſtates and ſexes; ſo they are alſo, with regard to their proficiency in the knowledge of God. Some are dead, ſome quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of God: of theſe, ſome again are untractable, ſome diligent, ſome zealous, burning with their firſt love; ſome babes, and ſome young men. Thoſe who are ſtill dead, are viſited every day. And of the babes in Chriſt eſpecial care is taken alſo, that they may be daily inſpected and aſſiſted to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus,</p>

12. In the Orphan-houſe, about ſeventy children are brought up ſeparate, according to their ſex: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide which, ſeveral experienced perſons are appointed to conſult with the parents, touching the education of the other children. In teaching them Chriſtianity, we make uſe of Luther's catechiſm, and ſtudy the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their wills as well as their underſtanding; finding by experience, that when their will is moved, they often learn more in a few hours, than otherwiſe in many months. Our little children we inſtruct chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by hymns; whereby we find the moſt important truths moſt ſucceſsfully inſinuated into their minds.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. We highly reverence marriage, as greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the kingdom of Chriſt. But neither our young men nor women enter into it till they aſſuredly know, they are married to Chriſt. When any know it is the will of God, that they ſhould change their ſtate, both the man and woman are placed for a time, with ſome married perſons, who inſtruct them how to behave, ſo that their married life may be pleaſing to God. Then their deſign is laid before the whole church, and after about fourteen days, they are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly joined, though not otherwiſe habited, than they are at other times. If they make any entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

If any woman is with child, not only eſpecial mention is made of her in the public prayers, but ſhe is alſo exhorted in private, wholly to give herſelf up into the hands of her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator. As ſoon as a child is born, prayer is made for it, and if it may be, it is baptized in the preſence of the whole church. Before it is weaned, it is brought into the aſſembly on the Lord's days.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. Whoever either of the male or female children, ſeek God with their whole heart, need not be much

Once or twice a month, either at Bertholdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, or if it may be, at Hernhuth, all the church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Lord's ſupper. It cannot be expreſſed how great the power of God is then preſent among us. A general confeſſion of ſins is made by one of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the name of all. Then a few ſolid queſtions are aſked; which when they have anſwered, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or remiſſion of ſins is either pronounced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſeniors firſt receive; then the reſt in order, without any regard had to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignity, in this, any more than in any other of the ſolemn offices of religion. After receiving, all the men (and ſo the women) meet together, to renew their covenant with God, to ſeek his face, and exhort one another to the patience of hope and the labour of love.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. They have a peculiar eſteem for lots, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly uſe them both in public and private, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide points of importance, when the reaſons brought on each ſide appear to be of equal weight. And they believe this to be then the only way, of wholly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide their own will, of acquitting themſelves of all blame, and clearly knowing what is the will of God.</p>

At eight in the morning, and in the evening we meet to pray to and praiſe God, and to read and hear the holy ſcriptures: the time we uſually ſpend in ſleep, is from eleven at night till four in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                           <p n="18">18. Two men keep watch every night in the ſtreet, as do two women, in the women's apartment: that they may pour out their ſouls for thoſe that ſleep; and by their hymns raiſe the hearts of any who are awake to God.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. For the farther ſtirring up the gift which is in us, ſometimes we have public, ſometimes private love-feaſts: at which we take moderate refreſhment, with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, and the voice of praiſe and thankſgiving.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. If any man among us, having been often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, and long forborn, perſiſts in walking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his holy calling, he is no longer admitted to the Lord's ſupper. If he ſtill continues in his fault, hating to be reformed, the laſt ſtep is, publicly, and often in the midſt of many prayers and tears, to caſt him out of our congregation. But great is our joy, if he then ſee the error of his ways, ſo that we may receive him among us again.</p>

               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHEN at firſt men began to ſay to my charge, things which I knew not, I often thought, "Had I but two or three intimate friends, who knew what my life and converſation were, they might eaſily ſpeak what they had ſeen and heard, and all ſuch aſperſions would fall to the ground." But I perceived my miſtake, as ſoon as I had two or three, who were my friends indeed, not in name only. For a way was eaſily found to prevent their being of any ſuch uſe as I once imagined they would be. This was done at a ſtroke, and that once for all, by giving them and me a <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w name:</hi> a name, which however inſignificant in itſelf, yet had this peculiar effect, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to diſable me from removing, whatever accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might for the time to come be caſt upon me, by invalidating all which thoſe who knew me beſt, were able to ſay in my behalf: nay, which any others could ſay. For how notorious is it, that if any man dare to open his mouth in my favour, it needs only be replied, "I ſuppoſe you are a <hi>Methodiſt</hi> too," and all he has ſaid is to paſs for nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence, on the one hand, many who knew what my converſation was, were afraid to declare the truth; leſt the ſame reproach ſhould fall upon them: and theſe few who broke through this fear, were ſoon diſabled from declaring it with effect, by being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ranked with him they defended. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial man then can refuſe to ſay, <hi>It is permitted to
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029861_0195_0FE2AAD6314F4E68"/>thee to anſwer for thyſelf?</hi> Only do not add, but, "Thou <hi>ſhalt not</hi> perſuade me, though thou <hi>doſt</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I am reſolved to think as I did before." Not ſo, if you are a candid man. You have heard one ſide already. Hear the other. Weigh both. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for human weakneſs. And then judge as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be judged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What I deſign in the following extract is, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to declare to all mankind, what it is that the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> (ſo called) have done, and are doing now; or rather, what it is that God hath done, and is ſtill doing in our land. For it is not the work of man which hath lately appeared. All who calmly obſerve it muſt ſay, <hi>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Such a work this hath been in many reſpects, as neither we nor our fathers had known. Not a few whoſe ſins were of the moſt flagrant kind, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, ſwearers, thieves, whoremongers, adulterers, have been brought <hi>from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Many of theſe were rooted in their wickedneſs, having long gloried in their ſhame, perhaps for a courſe of many years, yea, even to hoary hairs. Many had not ſo much as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faith, being Jews, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians, Deiſts or Atheiſts. Nor has God only made bare his arm in theſe laſt days, in behalf of open Publicans and Sinners; but many <hi>of the Phariſees</hi> alſo <hi>have believed on him,</hi> of the <hi>righteous that needed no repentance:</hi> and having <hi>received the ſentence of death in themſelves, have then heard the voice that raiſeth the dead:</hi> have been made partakers of an inward, vital religion, even <hi>righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The manner wherein God hath wrought this work in many ſouls, is as ſtrange as the work itſelf. It has gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>the coming of the Son of Man,</hi> either to bring peace or a ſword; either to wound or to heal, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of ſin, or to give remiſſion of ſins in his blood. And the other circumſtances attending it have been equally remote from what human wiſdom would have expected. So true is that word, <hi>My ways are not as your ways, nor my thoughts as your thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe extraordinary circumſtances ſeem to have been deſigned by God, for the further manifeſtation of his work, to cauſe his power to be known, and to awaken the attention of a drowſy world. And yet even from theſe, ſome have drawn their grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the whole work. <hi>We never ſaw it,</hi> ſay they, <hi>on this faſhion. Therefore,</hi> the work is not of God. To prove which farther, they have not only greatly miſrepreſented many circumſtances that really were, but have added many that were not, often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard either to truth or probability. A bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of thoſe facts which were <hi>not done in a corner,</hi> is the beſt anſwer to this ſort of objections. To thoſe which have been judged to be of more weight, I have occaſionally given a more particular anſwer.</p>
               <p>Yet I know even this will by no means ſatisfy the far greater part of thoſe who are now offended. And for a plain reaſon, becauſe they <hi>will never read it:</hi> they are reſolved to hear one ſide, and one only. I know alſo, that many who <hi>do</hi> read it, will be juſt of the ſame mind they were before; becauſe they have fixed their judgment already, and <hi>do not regard any thing which ſuch a fellow can ſay.</hi> Let them ſee to that. I have done my part. I have delivered mine own ſoul. Nay, I know that many will be greatly offended at this very account. It muſt be ſo from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things, which are therein related. And the beſt appellation I expect from them is, that of a fool, a madman, an enthuſiaſt. All that in me lies is, to relate ſimple truth, in as inoffenſive a manner
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:029861_0197_0FE2AADB08F98FC8"/>as I can. Let God give it the effect which pleaſeth him, and which is moſt for his glory!</p>

               <head>JOURNAL From <hi>Aug.</hi> 12, 1738, to <hi>Nov.</hi> 1, 1739.</head>
               <p>SATURDAY, Aug. 12. About ſeven in the evening we came to Neu-Kirche, a town about twenty-four miles from Hernhuth. Mr. Schneider (the miniſter of it who had deſired us to take his houſe in our way) was not at home: but we found one Mr. Manoetius there, the miniſter of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town, who walked with us in the morning ten miles to Hauſwald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, where he lived. He told us, "That the Lutherans as well as the Papiſts, were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable enemies to the brethren of Hernhuth: that the generality of the Lutheran clergy, were as bitter againſt them as the Jeſuits themſelves: that none of his neighbours durſt go thither (unleſs by ſtealth) being ſure of ſuffering for it, if diſcovered; that to prevent any of Hernhuth from coming to them, the Elector had forbid, under a ſevere penalty, any number of perſons, exceeding three, to meet together on a religious account; and that he himſelf, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little ſociety in his own pariſh, had been ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear before the Conſiſtory at Dreſden." Yea, let the <hi>kings of the earth ſtand up, and the rulers take counſel together againſt the Lord and againſt his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed! He that ſitteth in heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorn; the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We left Hauſwalde in the afternoon, and in the evening came to Dreſden. But the officer at the gate would not ſuffer us to come in; ſo that we were
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:029861_0199_0FE2AAE16960E540"/>obliged to go on to the next village: which leaving early in the morning, on Thurſday in the afternoon we came to Leipſig.</p>
               <p>We were now kept only an hour at the gate, and then conducted to Mr. Arnold's, who had invited us when we were in the town before, to make his houſe our home. A few we found here too, who deſire to <hi>know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> And from them we had letters to Halle, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we came on Friday 18. But the king of Pruſſia's tall men (who kept the gates) would not ſuffer Mr. Brown to come in. Me they admitted (in honour of my profeſſion) after I had waited about two hours: and one of them we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t with me to the Prince of Heſſe, who after a few queſtions, gave me leave to lodge in the city. Thence he ſhewed me to Mr Gotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lck's lodgings, to whom I had letters from Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſig. He read them and ſaid, <hi>My brother, what you find here, you will uſe as your own. And if you want any thing elſe, tell us and you ſhall have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told them, "My companion was without the gate." They ſoon procured admittance for him. And we were indeed as at home; for I have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen ſuch little children as theſe, even at Hern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huth.</p>
               <p>Satur. 19. I waited on Profeſſor Francke, who behaved with the utmoſt humanity; and afterwards on Profeſſor Knappe, to whom alſo I am indebted for his open, friendly behaviour. Between ten and eleven, ſeven of the brethren ſet out with us, one of whom went with us two days journey. It was the duſk of the evening on Sunday 20, when, wet and weary, we reached Jena.</p>
               <p>Mond. 21. We viſited the ſchools there; the riſe of which (as we were informed) was occaſioned thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="unknown:029861_0200_0FE2AAE2F751DD80"/>
About the year 1704 Mr. Stoltius, a ſtudent at Jena, began to ſpeak of <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt; which he continued to do, till he took his maſter's degree, and read public lectures. About twelve or fifteen ſtudents were awakened, and joined with him in prayer and building up one another. At this (after various ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies ſpread abroad and divers perſecutions occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned thereby) the Conſiſtory was offended, and iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a commiſſion to examine him. In conſequence of the report made to the Conſiſtory by theſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, he was forbid to read any public lectures, or to hold any meetings with his friends. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an order was given, by which he was excluded from the holy communion. He was alſo to have been expelled the univerſity: but this he prevented by a voluntary retirement.</p>
               <p>Yet one of the commiſſioners, who had been ſent by the Duke of Weymar (one of the Lords of Jena) informed the Duke, that according to his judgment Stoltius was an innocent and holy man. On this the Duke ſent for him to Weymar, and fixed him in a living there. There likewiſe he awakened many, and met with them to pray and read the ſcriptures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it was not long that the city could bear him. For he boldly rebuked all vice, and that in all perſons, neither ſparing the courtiers, nor the Duke himſelf. Conſequently, his enemies every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and many perſecutions followed. In fine, he was forbid to have any private meetings, and was to have been depoſed from the miniſtry; when God call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to himſelf, took him away from the evil to come.</p>
               <p>Before Stoltius left Jena, Boddaeus alſo began to preach the real goſpel, as did Chriſtius ſoon after; whereby ſome awakening continued till the year 1724. A few of the townſmen then agreed, to maintain a ſtudent, to be a ſchoolmaſter for ſome poor children.
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029861_0201_0FE2AAE58437E138"/>They afterwards kept ſeveral ſchoolmaſters: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1728, all of them going away, the ſchool was broke up, and the children quite neglected. Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Buddaeus being informed of this, earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the conſideration of it to the ſtudents in his houſe: and about ten of them, among whom was Mr. Spangenberg, took upon themſelves the care of thoſe children. Their number ſoon increaſed, which gave great offence to the other ſchool-maſters in the town; and not long after to the magiſtrates of the town, and to the ſenate of the univerſity. The offence ſoon ſpread to the paſtors, the profeſſors, the conſiſtory, and the princes who are lords of Jena. But it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to move one of them, the prince of Eiſnach, who had the chief power there, to ſtop the open per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, by forbidding either the ſenate or conſiſtory to moleſt them. He likewiſe wholly exempted them from the juriſdiction of both, ordering that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt them for the time to come ſhould be cognizable only by himſelf. But during the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the number of ſchools was increaſed from one to three, (one in each ſuburb of the city) the number of teachers to above thirty, and of children to above three hundred.</p>
               <p>There are now thirty conſtant teachers, ten in each ſchool, and three or four ſupernumerary, to ſupply accidental defects. Four of the maſters are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to puniſh, who are affixed to no one ſchool. Each of the ſchools being divided into two claſſes, and taught five hours a day, every one of the thirty maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters has one hour in a day to teach. All the maſters have a conference about the ſchools every Monday. They have a ſecond meeting on Thurſday, chiefly for prayers. And a third every Saturday.</p>
               <p>Once in half a year they meet to fill up the places <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe maſters who are gone away. And the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029861_0202_0FE2AAECDCE95A18"/>has never decreaſed; freſh ones ſtill offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the former leave the univerſity.</p>
               <p>The preſent method wherein they teach is this.</p>
               <p>There are always two claſſes in each ſchool. In the lower, children from ſix to ten or twelve years old are taught to read. They are then removed to the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aſs, in which are taught, the holy ſcriptures, arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic, and whatever elſe it may be uſeful for children to learn.</p>
               <p>In the morning from eight to nine they are all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized, and inſtructed in the firſt principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, either from Luther's ſmaller catechiſm, or from ſome texts of holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>From nine to ten the ſmaller children are taught their letters and ſyllables; and the larger read the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. From ten to eleven thoſe in the lower claſs learn and repeat ſome ſelect verſes of holy ſcripture, chiefly relating to the foundation of the faith. Mean while thoſe in the upper, learn arithmetic.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon from one to two all the children are employed as from nine to ten in the morning. From two to three the ſmaller children learn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat Luther's ſmaller catechiſm, while the larger are taught to write.</p>
               <p>Every Sunday there is a public catechizing on ſome text of ſcripture; at which all perſons who deſire it may be preſent.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon we left Jena, ſeveral of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren accompanying us out of town. At five hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt paſſed through Weymar, we met Mr. Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham going for Hernhuth. We all turned aſide to a neighbouring village, where having ſpent a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evening together, in the morning we commended each other to the grace of God, and went on our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways.</p>
               <p>We breakfaſted at Erfurt with Mr. Reinhart, ſpent the evening with ſome Brethren at Saxe-Gotha, and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029861_0203_0FE2AAEE884FBF20"/>by long journeys came to Marienborn on Friday, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 25.</p>
               <p>Monday 28, I took my leave of the Counteſs (the Count being gone to Jena) and ſetting out early the next morning came about three in the afternoon to Frankfort. From Mr. Bohler's we went to the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, where one of the brethren from Marienborn offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed free redemption through the blood of Chriſt to ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſeventy perſons.</p>
               <p>Wedneſday 30. In the afternoon we came to Mentz, and agreed for our paſſage to Colen by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for a florin per head: which was but half what we gave before, though (it ſeems) twice as much as we ought to have given.</p>
               <p>Thurſday 31. We ſpent half an hour in the great church, a huge heap of irregular building; full of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, adorned (or loaded rather) with abundance of gold and ſilver. In going out, we obſerved a paper on the door, which was of ſo extraordinary a nature, that I thought it would not be labour loſt to tranſcribe it. The words were as follow:
<q>Vollkommener ablaſs fur die arme ſeelen im feg-ſeur.</q>

A full releaſe for the poor ſouls in purgatory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His papal holineſs, Clement the XIIth, hath this year</hi> 1738, <hi>on the ſeventh of Auguſt, moſt graciouſly priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cathedral church of St. Chriſtopher in Mentz, ſo that every prieſt, as well ſecular as regular, who will read maſs at an altar for the ſoul of a Chriſtian departed, on any holiday, or on any day within the octave thereof, or on two extraordinary days, to be appointed by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, of any week in the year, may each time deliver a ſoul out of the fire of purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I deſire to know, whether any Romaniſt of common ſenſe, can either defend or approve of this?</p>
               <p>At eight we took boat, and on Saturday, Sept. 2, about eleven came to Colen; which we left at one, and between ſeven and eight reached a village, an hour ſhort of Neus. Here we overtook a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Switzers, men, women and children, ſinging, dancing and making merry, being all going <hi>to make their fortunes in Georgia.</hi> Looking upon them as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into my hands by God, I plainly told them, what manner of place it was. If they now leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire with open eyes, their blood is on their own head.</p>
               <p>Mond. 4. Before noon we came to Cleve, and to Nimwegen in the evening. The next night we lay at a little village near Tiel; which leaving early in the morning, we walked by the ſide of many pleaſant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and in the afternoon came to Yſſelſtein. We ſtayed only one night with the brethren, (in the new houſe, called Herndyke, an Engliſh mile from the town) and haſting forward came the next afternoon to Dr. Koker's at Rotterdam.</p>
               <p>I cannot but acknowledge the civility of this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, all the time we ſtayed in his houſe. In the morning, Frid. 8, we went to the Engliſh epiſcopal church, which is a large, handſome, convenient build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029861_0205_0FE2AAF1A5467EE8"/>The miniſter read prayers ſeriouſly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to a ſmall, well-behaved congregation. Being informed our ſhip was to ſail the next day (Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) we took leave of our generous friend, and went to an inn cloſe to the key, that we might be ready when called to go aboard. Having waited till paſt four in the afternoon, we ſtepped into the Jews ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, which lies near the water-ſide. I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſo many Jews (eſpecially thoſe who have any re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>The ſhip lingering ſtill, I had time to exhort ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Engliſh, whom we met with at our inn, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue inward religion; the renewal of their ſouls in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. In the morning a daughter of affliction came to ſee me, who teaches a ſchool at Rotterdam. She had been for ſome time under deep convictions; but could find none to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct or comfort her. After much converſation, we joined in prayer, and her ſpirit a little revived. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nine and ten we went on board. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I read prayers, and preached in the great cabin. The wind being contrary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Sunday, Sept. 17. I began again to declare in my own country the glad tidings of ſalvation, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three times, and afterwards expounding the holy ſcripture to a large company in the Minories. On Monday I rejoiced to meet with our little ſociety, which now conſiſted of 32 perſons. The next day I went to the condemned felons in Newgate, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them free ſalvation. In the evening I went to a ſociety in Bear-yard, and preached repentance and

               <p>Thurſday, 21. I went to a ſociety in Gutterlane; but I could not declare the mighty works of God there; as I did afterwards at the Savoy in all ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. And the word did not return empty.</p>
               <p>Finding abundance of people greatly exaſperated by groſs miſrepreſentations of the words I had ſpoken, I went to as many of them in private, as my time would permit.

               <p>On Sat. 23. I was enabled to ſpeak ſtrong words both at Newgate and Mr. E's ſociety; and the next day at St. Anne's, and twice at St. John's Clerken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: ſo that I fear they will bear me there no longer.</p>

               <p>Sat. 30. One who had been a zealous oppoſer of <hi>this way,</hi> ſent and deſired to ſpeak with me immediately. He had all the ſigns of ſettled deſpair, both in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and behaviour. He ſaid, "He had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to ſin many years, eſpecially to drunkenneſs; that he had long uſed all the means of grace, had conſtantly gone to church, and ſacrament, had read the ſcripture, and uſed much private prayer, and yet was nothing profited." I deſired we might join in prayer. After a ſhort ſpace he roſe and his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no longer ſad. He ſaid, "Now I know, God loveth <hi>me,</hi> and has forgiven <hi>my</hi> ſins. And ſin ſhall not have dominion over me: for Chriſt hath ſet me free." And according to his faith it was unto him.</p>
               <p>Sund. Oct. 1. I preached both morning and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at St. George's in the Eaſt. On the following days I endeavoured to explain the way of ſalvation, to many who had miſunderſtood what had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning it.</p>
               <p>Frid. 6. I preached at St. Antholin's once more. In the afternoon I went to the Rev. Mr. Bedford, to tell him between me and him alone, of the injury he had done both to: God and his brother, by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029861_0208_0FE2AAFC53A403E0"/>and printing that very weak ſermon on aſſurance, which was an <hi>ignoratio clenchi</hi> from beginning to end; ſeeing the aſſurance we preach is of quite another bind from that he writes againſt. We ſpeak of an aſſurance <hi>of our preſent pardon;</hi> not (as he does) <hi>of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> final perſeverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening I began expounding at a little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in Wapping. On Sunday 8. I preached at the Savoy chapel (I ſuppoſe the laſt time) on the parable (or hiſtory rather) of the Phariſee and Publican pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the temple. On Mond. 9. I ſet out for Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. In walking I read the truly ſurprizing narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the converſions lately wrought in and about the town of Northampton in New-England. Surely <hi>this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An extract from this I wrote to a friend, concerning the ſtate of thoſe who are <hi>weak in faith.</hi> His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which I received at Briſtol, on Sat. 14, threw me into great perplexity, till after crying to God, I took up a bible, which opened on theſe words; <hi>And Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>z called on the God of Iſrael, ſaying, Oh, that thou wouldſt bleſs me indeed, and inlarge my coaſt! And that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldſt keep me from evil that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requeſted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This however, with a ſentence in the evening leſſon, put me upon conſidering my own ſtate more deeply. And what then occurred to me was as follows:</p>
               <p>"Examine yourſelves, whether ye be in the faith." Now the ſureſt teſt whereby we can examine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether we be indeed in the faith, is that given by St. Paul, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature. Old things are paſt away. Behold all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, His judgments are new his judgment of himſelf, of happineſs, of holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="unknown:029861_0209_0FE2AAFDF4EF1DF0"/>
He judges himſelf to be altogether fallen ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the glorious image of God. To have no good thing abiding in him; but all that is corrupt and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: in a word, to be wholly earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh: a motly mixture of beaſt and devil.</p>
               <p>Thus, by the grace of God in Chriſt, I judge of myſelf. Therefore I am, in this reſpect, a new creature.</p>
               <p>Again. His judgment concerning happineſs is new. He would as ſoon expect to dig it out of the earth, as to find it in riches, honor, pleaſure (ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) or indeed in the enjoyment of any creature: he knows there can be no happineſs on earth, but in the enjoyment of God, and in the foretaſte of thoſe <hi>rivers of pleaſure which flow at his right-hand for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, by the grace of God in Chriſt, I judge of happineſs. Therefore I am, in this reſpect, a new creature.</p>
               <p>Yet again. His judgment concerning holineſs is now. He no longer judge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it to be an outward thing: to conſiſt either, in doing no harm, in doing good, or in uſing the ordinances of God. He ſees it is, the life of God in the ſoul; the image of God freſh ſtamped on the heart: an entire renewal of the mind in every temper and thought, after the likeneſs of him that created it.</p>
               <p>Thus, by the grace of God in Chriſt, I judge of holineſs. Therefore I am, in this reſpect, a new creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are new. It is the deſign of his life, not to heap up treaſures upon earth, not to gain the praiſe of men, not to indulge the deſires of the fleſh, the deſire of the eye, or the pride o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> life; but to regain the image of God; to have the life of God again planted in his ſoul; and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029861_0210_0FE2AAFF864E0F38"/>after his likeneſs, in righteouſneſs and all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue holineſs.</p>
               <p>This, by the grace of God in Chriſt, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of my life. Therefore I am, in this reſpect, a new creature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His deſires are new, and indeed the whole train of his paſſions and inclinations. They are no longer fixed on earthly things. They are now ſet on the things of heaven. His love, and joy, and hope, his ſorrow, and fear, have all reſpect to things above. They all point heaven-w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd. Where his treaſure is, there is his heart alſo.</p>
               <p>I dare not ſay I am a new creature in this reſpect. For other deſires often <hi>ariſe</hi> in my heart. But they do not <hi>reign.</hi> I put them all under my feet through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me. Therefore I believe he is <hi>creating</hi> me anew in this alſo, and that he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, though not finiſhed, his work.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His converſation is new. It <hi>is always ſeaſoned with ſalt, and fit to miniſter grace to the bearers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So is mine, by the grace of God in Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this reſpect, I am a new creature.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His actions are new. The tenor of his life ſingly points at the glory of God. All his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and time are devoted thereto. <hi>Whether he eats or drinks, or whatever he does,</hi> it either ſprings from, or leads to, the love of God and man.</p>
               <p>Such, by the grace of God in Chriſt, is the tenor of my life. Therefore, in this reſpect, I am a new creature.</p>
               <p>But St. Paul tells us elſewhere, that <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is love, peace, joy, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, temperance.</hi> Now although, by the grace of God in Chriſt, I find a meaſure of ſome of theſe in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, viz. of peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, temperance: yet others I find not. I cannot
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029861_0211_0FE2AB0B5F9FB018"/>find in myſelf the love of God or of Chriſt. Hence my deadneſs and wanderings in public prayer. Hence it is that even in the holy communion, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no more than a cold attention.</p>
               <p>Again, I have not that joy in the Holy Ghoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no ſettled, laſting joy. Nor have I ſuch a peace as excludes the poſſibility either of fear or doubt. When holy men have told me, "I had no faith," I have often doubted, whether I had or no. And thoſe doubts have made me very uneaſy, till I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> relieved by prayer and the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Yet upon the whole, although I have not yet that joy in the Holy Ghoſt, nor the full aſſurance of faith, much leſs am I, in the full ſenſe of the words, <hi>in Chriſt a new creature:</hi> I nevertheleſs truſt that I have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> meaſure of faith, and am <hi>accepted in the Beloved:</hi> I truſt, <hi>the hand-writing that was againſt me is blotted out,</hi> and that I am <hi>reconciled to God</hi> through his Son.</p>
               <p>Sund. 15. I preached twice at the caſtle, and afterwards expounded at three ſocieties. Wedneſday evening I came to London again, and on Friday met a ſociety (of ſoldiers chiefly) at Weſtminſter. On Sunday 22, I preached at Bloomſbury in the morning, and at Shadwell in the afternoon. Wedneſday 25, I preached at Baſingſhaw church: on Friday morning at St. Antholin's: on Sunday at Iſlington and at London-Wall.</p>
               <p>In the evening being troubled at what ſome ſaid, of <hi>the kingdom of God within us,</hi> and doubtful of my own ſtate, I called upon God, and received this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from his word, <hi>He himſelf alſo waited for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> "But ſhould not I wait in ſilence and retirement?" was the thought that immediately ſtruck into my mind. I opened my teſtament again, on thoſe words, <hi>Seeſt thou not, how faith wrought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his works? And by works was faith made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:029861_0212_0FE2AB0D36CC3E78"/>
Friday Nov. 3. I preached at St. Antholin's, Sunday 5, in the morning at St. Botolph's, Biſhopſ-gate, in the afternoon at Iſlington, and in the evening to ſuch a congregation as I never ſaw before, at St. Clement's in the Strand. As this was the firſt time of my preaching here, I ſuppoſe it is to be the laſt.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday my brother and I went, at their earneſt deſire, to do the laſt good office to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned malefactors. It was the moſt glorious inſtance I ever ſaw, of faith triumphing over ſin and death. One obſerving the tears run faſt down the cheeks of one of them in particular, while his eyes were ſteadily fixed upwards, a few moments before he died, aſked, "How do you feel your heart now?" He calmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "I feel a peace, which I could not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be poſſible. And I know it is the peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding."</p>
               <p>My brother took that occaſion of declaring the goſpel of peace, to a large aſſembly of publicans and ſinners. <hi>O Lord God of my fathers,</hi> accept even <hi>me</hi> among them, and <hi>caſt me not out from among thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening I proclaimed mercy to my fellow-ſinners at Baſingſhaw church: and the next morning at St. Antholin's. Friday 10, I ſet out, and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 11, ſpent the evening with a little company at Oxford. I was grieved to find, <hi>prudence</hi> had made them leave off ſinging pſalms. I fear it will not ſtop here. God deliver me, and all that ſeek him in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, from what the world calls <hi>Chriſtian prudence!</hi>

               <p>Sunday 12. I preached twice at the caſtle. In the following week, I began more narrowly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what the doctrine of the church of England is, concerning the much controverted point of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by FAITH. And the ſum of what I found in the homilies, I extracted and printed for the uſe of others.</p>

Sund. 19. I only preached in the afternoon at the caſtle. On Monday night I was greatly troubled in dreams, and about eleven o'clock waked in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable conſternation, without being able to ſleep again. About that time (as I found in the morning) one who had been deſigned to be my pupil, but was not, came into the Porter's lodge (where ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſitting) with a piſtol in his hand. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this, as in ſport, firſt at one and then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He then attempted twice or thrice to ſhoot himſelf, but it would not go off. Upon his laying it down, one took it up, and blew out the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iming. He was very angry, went and got freſh prime, came in again, ſat down, beat the flint with his key; and about twelve, pulling off his hat and wig, ſaid, "He would die like a gentleman," and ſhot himſelf through the head.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 23. Returning from preaching at the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I met once more with my old companion in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, C. D. who ſtayed with me till Monday. His laſt converſation with me was as follows:</p>
               <p>"In this you are better than you was at Savannah. You know that you was then quite wrong. But you are not right yet. You know that you was then blind. But you do not ſee now.</p>
               <p>"I doubt not but God <hi>will</hi> bring you to the right foundation. But I have no hope for you, while you are on your preſent foundation. It is as different from the true, as the right hand from the left. You have all to begin anew.</p>
               <p>"I have obſerved all your words and actions, and I ſee you are of the ſame ſpirit ſtill. You have a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: but it is a ſimplicity of your own. It is not the ſimplicity of Chriſt. You think you do not truſt in your own works. But you do truſt in your own works. You do not believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="unknown:029861_0214_0FE39C6BEA14A4E0"/>
"You have a preſent freedom from ſin. But it is only a temporary ſuſpenſion of it, not a deliverance from it. And you have a peace. But it is not a true peace. If death were to approach, you would find all your fears return.</p>
               <p>"But I am forbid to ſay any more. My heart ſinks in me like a ſtone."</p>
               <p>I was troubled. I begged of God an anſwer of peace, and opened on thoſe words, <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> I was aſking in the evening, that God would fulfil all his promiſes in my ſoul, when I opened my teſtament on thoſe words, <hi>My hour is not yet come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sund. Dec. 3. I began reading prayers at Bocar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do (the city priſon) which had been long diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the afternoon I received a letter, earneſtly deſiring me, to publiſh my account of Georgia: and another as earneſtly diſſuading me from it, "becauſe it would bring much trouble upon me." I conſulted God in his word and received two anſwers; the firſt Ezek. xxxiii. 2—6. The other, <hi>Thou therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hardſhip, as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. Dec. 5. I began reading prayers and preaching in Glouceſter-green workhouſe, and on Thurſday in that belonging to St. Thomas's pariſh. On both days I preached at the caſtle. At St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's was a young woman, raving mad, ſcreaming and tormenting herſelf continually. I had a ſtrong deſire to ſpeak to her. The moment I began ſhe was ſtill.

About this time, being deſirous to know how the work of God went on among our brethren at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I wrote to many of them concerning the ſtate of their ſouls. One or two of their anſwers I have ſubjoined.</p>

                     <p>I Know <hi>my</hi> Saviour's voice, and my heart burns with love and deſire to follow him in the regeneration. I have no confidence in the fleſh. I loath myſelf and love him only. My dear brother, my ſpirit even at this moment rejoices in God my Saviour, and the love which is ſhed abroad in my heart by the Holy Ghoſt, deſtroys all ſelf-love, ſo that I could lay down my life for my brethren. I know that my Redeemer liveth, and have confidence towards God, that through his blood my ſins are forgiven. He hath begotten me of his own will, and ſaves me from ſin, ſo that it has no dominion over me. His Spirit bears witneſs with my ſpirit, that I am his child by adoption and grace. And this is not for works of righteouſneſs which I have done. For I am his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works: ſo that all boaſting is excluded. It is now about eighteen years ſince Jeſus took poſſeſſion of my heart. He then opened my eyes and ſaid unto me, Be of good cheer, thy ſins are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee. My dear friend, bear with my relating, after what manner I was born of God. It was an <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> act. My whole heart was filled with a divine power, drawing all the faculties of my ſoul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, which continued three or four nights and days.

                  <hi>My moſt dear and honoured father in Chriſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the twentieth year of my age, 1737, God was pleaſed to open my eyes, and to let me ſee that I did not live as became a child of God. I found my ſins were great (though I was what they call a ſober perſon) and that God kept an account of them all. However I thought, if I repented, and led a good life, God would accept me. And ſo I went on for about half a year, and had ſometimes great jay. But laſt winter, I began to find, that whatever I did, was nothing, and the enemy of ſouls laid ſo many things to my charge, that ſometimes I deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of heaven. I continued in great doubts and fears till April 9, when I went out of town. Here for a time I was greatly tranſported, in ſeeing the glorious works of God: but in about three weeks I was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently aſſaulted again. God then offered a Savious to me, but my ſelf-righteouſneſs kept me from laying hold on him.</p>
               <p>On Whitſunday I went to receive the bleſſed ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with a heart as hard as a ſtone. Heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden I was indeed, when God was pleaſed to let me ſee a crucified Saviour. I ſaw there was a fountain opened in his ſide for me to waſh in and be clean. But alas! I was afraid to venture, fearing I ſhould but too preſumptuous. And I know, I at that time
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029861_0217_0FE2AB1AAEB2D198"/>refuſed the atonement which I might then have hath Yet I received great comfort. But in about nine days time, my joy went out, as a lamp does for want of oil, and I fell into my old ſtate. Yet I was not without hope; for ever after that time I could not deſpair of ſalvation: I had ſo clear a fight of the fountain opened in the ſide of our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſtill when I thought of death, or the day of judgment, it was a great terror to me. And yet I was afraid to venture to lay all my ſins upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This was not all. But whenever I retired to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I had a violent pain in my head. This only ſeized me when I began to pray earneſtly, or to cry out aloud to Chriſt. But when I cried to him againſt this alſo, he gave me eaſe. Well, I found God did love me, and did draw me to Chriſt. I hungered and thirſted after him; but was ſtill afraid to go boldly to Chriſt, and to claim him as <hi>my</hi> Saviour.</p>
               <p>July 3. My dear ſiſter came down to ſee me. She had received the atonement on St. Peter's day. I told her, I thought, Chriſt died for <hi>me,</hi> but as to the aſſurance ſhe mentioned, I could ſay nothing.</p>
               <p>July 5. She went. That night I went into the garden, and conſidering what ſhe had told me, I ſaw him by faith, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, him who juſtifieth the ungodly. I told him I was ungodly, and it was for <hi>me</hi> that he died. His blood did I plead with great faith, to blot out the hand-writing that was againſt me. I told my Saviour, that he had promiſed to give reſt, to all that were heavy-laden. This promiſe I claimed, and I ſaw him by faith, ſtand condemned before God in my ſtead. I ſaw the fountain opened in his ſide. I found, as I hungered, he fed me: as my ſoul thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he gave me out of that fountain to drink. And ſo ſtrong was my faith, that if I had had all the ſins of the world laid upon me, I knew and was ſure one drop of his blood was ſufficient to alone for
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:029861_0218_0FE2AB1C42642AD8"/>all. Well, I clave unto him, and he did waſh me in his blood. He heath preſented me to his Father and my Father, to his God and my God, a pure, ſpotleſs Virgin, as if I had never committed any ſin, It is on Jeſus I ſtand, the Saviour of ſinners. It is he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

While I ſtand on this rock, I am ſure the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt me. It is by faith that I am juſtified, and have peace with God through him. His blood has made reconciliation to God for me. It is by faith I have received the atonement. It is by faith I have the Son of God and the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in me. And what then ſhall ſeparate me from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord?</p>
               <p>You muſt think what a tranſport of joy I was then in, when I that was loſt and undone, dropping into hell, felt a Redeemer come, who is <hi>mighty to ſave, to ſave unto the uttermoſt.</hi> Yet I did not receive the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit at that time. But in about half an hour, the devil came with great power to tempt me. However I minded him not, but went in and lay down pretty much compoſed in my mind. Now St. Paul <hi>ſays after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> So it was with me. After I had believed on him that <hi>juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> I received that ſeal of the ſpirit, which is the <hi>earneſt of our inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>July 6. In the morning, being by myſelf, I found the work of the ſpirit was very powerful upon me (altho you know God does not deal with every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

I who had nothing but devils ready to drag me to hell, now found I had angels to guard me to my reconciled father, and my judge, who juſt before ſtood ready to condemn me, was now become my righteouſneſs. But I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what God hath done for my ſoul. No; this is to be my everlaſting employment when I have put off this frail, finful body, when I join with that great multitude which no man can number, in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſes to the Lamb that loved us, and gave himſelf for us! O how powerful are the workings of the Almighty in a new-born ſoul! The love of God was ſhed abroad in my heart, and a flame kindled there, ſo that my body was almoſt torn aſunder. I loved. The Spirit cried ſtrong in my heart. I trembled. I ſung. I joined my voice with thoſe that excel in ſtrength. My ſoul was got up into the holy mount. I had o thoughts of coming down again into the body. I who not long before had called to the rocks to fall on me, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to cover me, could now call for nothing elſe but <hi>come,</hi> Lord Jeſus, <hi>come quickly.</hi> Then I could cry out with great boldneſs, there, O God, is my ſurety! There, O death, is thy plague! There, O grave, is thy deſtruction! There, O ſerpent, is the ſeed, that ſhall for ever bruiſe thy head. O I thought my head was a fountain of water! I was diſſolved in love. <hi>My beloved is mins, and I am his.</hi> He has all charms. He has raviſhed my heart. He is my comforter, my friend, my all. He is now in his

               </p>
               <p>Sunday 10. I adminiſtered the Lord's Supper at the Caſtle. At one I expounded at Mr. Fox's as uſual. The great power of God was with us, and one who had been in deſpair ſeveral years, received a witneſs that ſhe was a child of God.</p>
               <p>Mond. 11. Hearing Mr. Whitefield was arrived from Georgia, I haſtened to London; and on Tueſ. 12. God gave us once more to take ſweet counſel together.</p>
               <p>Fri. 15. I preached at St. Antholin's.</p>
               <p>Sat. 16. One who had examined himſelf by the reflections wrote Oct. 14, made the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the ſtate of his own ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I <hi>judge</hi> thus of myſelf. But I feel it not. Therefore there is in me ſtill, the old heart of ſtone.</p>

               <p>But the eyes of my underſtanding are not yet fully opened.</p>
               <p n="2">II. "This is the deſign of <hi>my</hi> live." But a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little deſigns are daily ſtealing into my ſoul. This is my <hi>ultimate</hi> deſign; but <hi>intermediate</hi> deſigns are continually creeping in upon me; deſigns (tho' often diſguiſed) of pleaſing myſelf, of doing my own will; deſigns, wherein I do not eye God, at leaſt, not him ſingly.</p>

                  <pb n="224" facs="unknown:029861_0221_0FE2AB29844F0700"/>
Therefore my eye is not yet ſingle; at leaſt, not always ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Are my deſires new? Not all. Some are new, ſome old. My deſires are like my deſigns. My <hi>great</hi> deſire is, To have <hi>Chriſt formed in my heart by faith.</hi> But little deſires are daily ſtealing into my ſoul. And ſo my great hopes and fears have reſpect to God. But a thouſand little ones creep in between them.</p>
               <p>Again, my deſires, paſſions and inclinations in general are mixed: having ſomething of Chriſt and ſomething of earth. I love you, for inſtance. But my love is only partly ſpiritual, and partly natural. Something of <hi>my own</hi> cleaves to that which is of God. Nor can I divide the earthly part from the heavenly.</p>
               <p>Sund. 17. I preached in the afternoon at Iſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: in the evening at St. Swithin's, for the laſt time. Sund. 24.

               <p>Wed. 27. I preached at Baſingſhaw church; Sund. 31, to many thouſands, in St. George's, Spital-Fields. And to a yet more crouded congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at Whitechapel, in the afternoon, I declared thoſe glad tidings (O that they would know the things which make for their peace!) <hi>I will heal their backſliding: I will love them freely.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thurſd. 4. One who had had the form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs many years, wrote the following reflections.</p>
               <p>"My friends affirm <hi>I am mad,</hi> becauſe I ſaid <hi>I was not a Chriſtian a year ago.</hi> I affirm, I am not a Chriſtian now.

But that I am not a Chriſtian at this day, I as aſſuredly know, as that Jeſus is the Chriſt.</p>
               <p>"For a Chriſtian is one who has the fruits of the Spirit of Chriſt, which (to mention no more) are love, peace, joy. But theſe I have not. I have not any love of God. I do not love either the Father or the Son. Do you aſk, How do I know whether I love God? I anſwer by another queſtion, How do you know, whether you love me? Why, as you know, whether you are not or cold. You <hi>feel</hi> this moment, that you do or do not love me. And I <hi>feel</hi> this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I do not love God; which therefore I <hi>know,</hi> becauſe I <hi>feel</hi> it. There is no word more proper, more dear, or more ſtrong.</p>
               <p>"And I know it alſo by St. John's plain rule, <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> For I love the world.

               <p>"Again, joy in the Holy Ghoſt I have not. I have now and then ſome ſtarts of joy in God: but it is not <hi>that</hi> joy. For it is not abiding.

               <p>Wedneſday 17. I was with two perſons, who I doubt are properly <hi>enthuſiaeſts.</hi> For, firſt, they think to attain the end without the means, which is <hi>enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſin,</hi> properly ſo called.

               <p>Sund. 21. We were ſurprized in the evening, while I was expounding in the Minories. A well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:029861_0224_0FE2AB35686F0748"/>middle-aged woman, ſuddenly cried out, as in the agonies of death. She continued ſo to for ſome time, with all the ſigns of the ſharpeſt anguiſh of ſpirit. When ſhe was a little recovered, I deſired her to call upon me the next day. She then told me, that about three years before, ſhe was under ſtrong convictions of ſin, and in ſuch terror of mind, that he had no comfort in any thing, nor any reſt, day or night: that ſhe ſent for the miniſter of her pariſh and told him the diſtreſs ſhe was in: upon which he told her huſband ſhe was ſtark mad, and adviſed him to ſend for a phyſician immediately. A phyſician was ſent for accordingly, who ordered her to be blooded, bliſtered, and ſo on. But this did not heal her wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit. So that ſhe continued much as ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: till the laſt night, he whoſe word ſhe at firſt found to be <hi>ſharper than any two-edged ſword,</hi> gave her a faint hope, that he would undertake her cauſe, and heal the ſoul which had ſinned againſt him.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 25. I baptized John Smith (late an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt) and four other adults at Iſlington. Of the adults I have known baptized lately, one only was at that time born again, in the full ſenſe of the word, that is, found a thorough, inward change, by the love of God filling her heart. Moſt of them were only born again in a lower ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> received the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſins. And ſome (as it has ſince too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared) neither in one ſenſe nor the other.</p>
               <p>Sund. 28. I went (having been long importuned thereto) about five in the evening, with four or five of my friends to a houſe where was one of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called French <hi>prophets.</hi> After a time, ſhe came in. She ſeemed about four or five and twenty, of an agreeable ſpeech and behaviour. She aſked, Why we came? I ſaid, "To try the ſpirits, whether they be of God." Preſently after ſhe leaned back in her chair, and ſeemed to have ſtrong workings in her
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:029861_0225_0FE2AB36F9D7CCE0"/>breaſt, with deep ſighings intermixed. Her head and hands, and by turns, every part of her body ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo to be in a kind of convulſive motion. This continued about ten minutes, till (at ſix) ſhe began to ſpeak (though the workings, ſighings, and contorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her body, were ſo intermixed with her words, that ſhe ſeldom ſpoke half a ſentence together) with a clear, ſtrong voice, "Father, Thy will, thy will be done. Thus faith the Lord, if of any of you that is a father, his child aſk bread, will he give him a ſtone? If he aſk a fiſh, will he give him a ſcorpion? Aſk bread of me, my children, and I will give you bread. I will not, will not give you a ſcorpion. By this judge of what ye ſhall now hear."</p>
               <p>She ſpoke much (all as in the perſon of God, and moſtly in ſcripture words) of the fulfilling of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, the coming of Chriſt now at hand, and the ſpreading of the goſpel over all the earth. Then ſhe exhorted us, not to be in haſte, in judging her ſpirit, to be or not to be of God; but to wait upon God, and he would teach us, if we conferred not with fleſh and blood. She added, with many inforcements, "That we muſt watch and pray, and take up our croſs, and <hi>be ſtill before</hi> God."</p>
               <p>Two or three of our company were much affected, and believed ſhe ſpoke by the Spirit of God. But this was in no wiſe clear to me. The motion might be either hyſterical or artificial. And the ſame words, any perſon of a good underſtanding and well verſed in the ſcriptures might have ſpoken. But I let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone: knowing this, that <hi>if it be not of God, it will come to nought.</hi>

               <p>Sat. 17. A few of us prayed with him; and from that time (as his parents ſince informed us) he had more reſt (altho' not a full deliverance) than he had had for two years before.</p>
               <p>Sund. 18. I was deſired to preach at Sir George Wheeler's Chapel, in Spital-Fields, morning and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon. I did ſo in the morning, but was not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conclude my ſubject (as I had deſigned) in the afternoon; a good remembrance, that I ſhould, if poſſible, declare at <hi>every</hi> time, the <hi>whole</hi> counſel of God.</p>

                  <pb n="230" facs="unknown:029861_0227_0FE2AB4383F0D9A0"/>
Sund. 25. I preached in the morning to a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous congregation, at St. Katherine's, near the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; at Iſlington in the afternoon. Many here were (as uſual) deeply offended. But the counſel of the Lord it ſhall ſtand.</p>
               <p>Frid. March 2. It was the advice of all our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that I ſhould ſpend a few days at Oxford, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I accordingly went on Saturd. 3. A few names I found here alſo, who had not denied the faith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been aſhamed of their Lord, even in the midſt of a perverſe generation. And every day we were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we had convincing proof, ſuch as it had not before entered into our hearts to conceive, that <hi>he is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt all that come unto God thro' him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the moſt ſurpriſing inſtances of his power which I ever remember to have ſeen, was on the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following; when I viſited one who was above meaſure enraged at <hi>this new way,</hi> and zealous in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it. Finding argument to be of no other effect, than to inflame her more and more, I broke off the diſpute and deſired we might join in prayer, which ſhe ſo far conſented to, as to kneel down. In a few minutes ſhe fell into an extreme agony, both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul; and ſoon after cried out with the utmoſt earneſtneſs. "Now I know, I am forgiven for Chriſt's fake." Many other words ſhe uttered to the ſame effect, witneſſing a hope full of immortality. And from that hour, God hath ſet her face as a flint to declare the faith which before ſhe perſecuted.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 8. I called upon her and a few of her neighbours, who were met together in the evening, among whom I found a gentleman of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhe had been of, earneſtly labouring to pervert the truth of the goſpel. To prevent his going on, as the leſs evil of the two, I entered directly into the controverſy, touching both the cauſe and the fruits
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:029861_0228_0FE2AB4654E960D8"/>of juſtification: In the midſt of the diſpute, one who ſat at a ſmall diſtance, felt as it were the piercing of a ſword, and before ſhe could be brought to another houſe, whither I was going, could not avoid crying out aloud, even in the ſtreet. But no ſooner had we made our requeſt known to God, than he ſent her help from his holy place.</p>
               <p>At my return from hence, I found Mr. Kinchin, juſt come from Dummer, who earneſtly deſired me, inſtead of ſetting out for London the next morning (as I deſigned) to go to Dummer and ſupply his church on Sunday. On Friday morning I ſet out, according to his deſire, and in the evening came to Reading, where I found a young
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Cennick</note> man who had in ſome meaſure <hi>known the power of the world to come.</hi> I ſpent the evening with him and a few of his ſerious friends; and it pleaſed God much to ſtrengthen and comfort them.</p>
               <p>Sat. 10. In the afternoon I came to Dummer; and on Sunday morning had a large and attentive congregation. I was deſired to expound in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Baſingſtoke. The next day I returned to Reading, and thence on Tueſday to Oxford, where I found many more and more rejoicing in God their Saviour. Wedneſday 14, I had an opportunity of preaching once again to the poor priſoners in the Caſtle. Thurſd. 15. I ſet out early in the morning, and in the afternoon came to London.</p>
               <p>During my ſtay here, I was fully employed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our own ſociety, in Fetter-lane, and many others, where I was continually deſired to expound: ſo that I had no thought of leaving London, when I received (after ſeveral others) a letter from Mr. Whitefield, and another from Mr. Seward, entreating me in the moſt preſſing manner, to come to Briſtol without delay. This I was not at all forward to do;

               <p>Wed. 28. My journey was propoſed to our ſociety in Fetter-lane. But my brother Charles would ſcarce bear the mention of it; till appealing to the oracles of God, he received thoſe words, as ſpoken to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and anſwered not again: <hi>Son of man, behold I take from thee the deſire of thine eyes with a ſtroke: Yet ſhalt thou not mourn or weep, neither ſhall thy tears run down.</hi> Our other brethren however continuing the diſpute, without any probability of their coming to one concluſion, we at length all agreed, to decide it by lot. And by this it was determined, "I ſhould go." Several afterwards deſiring, we might open the bible, concerning the iſſue of this, we did ſo on the ſeveral portions of ſcripture, which I ſhall ſet down without any reflection upon them.<note n="§" place="bottom">2 Sam. iii. 1.</note>

I have here therefore ſubjoined the letter I wrote ſeveral years ago on that occaſion:
<floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                           <dateline>Oxford, <date>Dec. 10, 1734.</date>
                           </dateline>

                        <p n="1">1. THE authority of a parent and the call of providence are things of ſo ſacred a nature, that a queſtion in which theſe are any way concerned, deſerves the moſt ſerious conſideration. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greatly obliged to you, for the pains you have taken to ſet our queſtion in a clear light; which I now intend to conſider more at large with the utmoſt attention of which I am capable. And I ſhall the more cheerfully do it, as being aſſured of your joining with me in imploring his guidance, who will not ſuffer thoſe that truſt in him, to ſeek death in the error of their life.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I entirely agree, "That the glory of God and the different degrees of promoting it, are to be our ſole conſideration and direction in the choice of any courſe of life:" and conſequently, that it muſt wholly turn upon this ſingle point, which I ought to prefer, a college life, or that of rector of a pariſh? I do not ſay, the glory of God is to be my firſt or my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal conſideration: but my <hi>only</hi> one; ſince all that are not implied in this, are abſolutely of no weight. In preſence of this, they all vaniſh away: they are leſs than the ſmall duſt of the balance.</p>
                        <p n="3">

3. And indeed, till all other conſiderations were ſet aſide, I could never come to any clear determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: till my eye was ſingle, my whole mind was full of darkneſs. Whereas ſo long as it was fixed on the glory of God, without any other conſideration, I have no more doubt of the way wherein I ſhould go, than of the ſhining of the mid-day ſun.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Now that life tends moſt to the glory of God, wherein we moſt promote holineſs in ourſelves and others; I ſay, of ourſelves and others, as being fully perſuaded, that theſe can never be put aſunder. And if not, then whatever ſtate is beſt on either of theſe accounts, is ſo on the other likewiſe. If it be on the whole beſt for others, ſo it is for ourſelves: if it be beſt for ourſelves, it is ſo for them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. However, when two ways of life are propoſed, I would chooſe to conſider firſt, which have I reaſon to believe, will be beſt for <hi>my own ſoul?</hi> Will moſt forward me in holineſs? By holineſs meaning, not faſting (as you ſeem to ſuppoſe) or bodily auſterities; but the mind that was in Chriſt. A renewal of ſoul in the image of God. And I believe the ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am, will moſt forward me in this, becauſe of the peculiar advantages I now enjoy.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The firſt of theſe is daily converſe with my friends. I know no other place under heaven, where I can have ſome always at hand, of the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and engaged in the ſame ſtudies; perſons who are awakened into a full conviction, that they have but one work to do upon earth; who ſee at a diſtance, what that one work is, even the recovery of a ſingle eye and a clean heart; who in order to this, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their power, abſolutely devoted themſelves to God, and follow after their Lord, denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and taking up their croſs daily. To have even a ſmall number of ſuch friends, conſtantly watching over my ſoul, and adminiſtering, as need it, reproof
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:029861_0232_0FE2AB53E0005260"/>or advice with all plainneſs and gentleneſs, is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing I know not where to find, in any other part of the kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Another bleſſing which I enjoy here in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree than I could expect elſewhere, is retirement.

<pb n="241" facs="unknown:029861_0238_0FE2AB660F01A108"/>aſſertion.

Remember</hi> (ye that would fain forget or evade this) <hi>the word which I ſaid unto you, the ſervant is not greater than his Lord: If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you.</hi> And as for that vain hope, that this belongs only to the firſt followers of Chriſt, hear ye him; <hi>All theſe things they will do unto you, becauſe they know not him that ſent me.</hi> And again, <hi>Becauſe ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Both the perſons who are hated, the perſons who hate them, and the cauſe of their hating them, are ſet down. <hi>The hated</hi> are all that are not of the world, that know and love God: <hi>the haters</hi> are all that are of the world, that know not, love not God. <hi>The cauſe of their hatred</hi> is the entire, irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable difference between their deſigns, judgments and affections: becauſe theſe know not God, and thoſe we determined to know and purſue nothing beſide him.

               <p>Thurſ. March 29. I left London, and in the evening expounded to a ſmall company at Baſingſtoke. Sat. 31. In the evening I reached Briſtol, and met Mr. Whitefield there. I could ſcarce reconcile my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at firſt to this <hi>ſtrange way</hi> of preaching in the fields, of which he ſet me an example on Sunday; having been all my life (till very lately) ſo tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that I ſhould have thought the ſaving of ſouls <hi>almoſt a ſin,</hi> if it had not been done <hi>in a church.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 10. I was defired to go to Bath; where I offered to about a thouſand ſouls, the free grace of God to <hi>heal their backſlidings,</hi> and in the morning to (I believe) more than two thouſand.

Tueſday 17. At five in the afternoon, I was at a little ſociety in the Back-Lane. The room in which we were was propped beneath; but the weight of the people made the floor give way, ſo that in the beginning of the expounding the poſt which propped it, fell down with a great noiſe. But the floor ſunk no further, ſo that after a little ſurpriſe at firſt, they quietly attended to the things that were ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to Baldwin-ſtreet, and expounded as it came in courſe, the 4th chap. of the Acts. We then called upon God to confirm his word. Immediately one that ſtood by (to our no ſmall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe) cried out aloud, with the utmoſt vehemence, even as in the agonies of death. But we continued in prayer, till <hi>a new ſong was put in her mouth, a thankſgiving unto our God.</hi> Soon after, two other perſons (well known in this place, as labouring to live in all good conſcience towards all men) were ſeized with ſtrong pain, and conſtrained to roar <hi>for the diſquietneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The laſt who called upon God as out of the belly of hell, was I— E— a ſtranger in Briſtol. And in a ſhort ſpace he alſo was overwhelmed with joy and love, knowing that God had healed his backſlidings. So many living witneſſes hath God given, that <hi>his hand is</hi> ſtill <hi>ſtretched out to heal,</hi> and that <hi>ſigns and wonders are even now wrought, by his holy child Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 18. In the evening L—a S— (late a quaker, but baptized the day before) R—a M— and a few others, were admitted into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. But R—a M— was ſcarcely able, either to ſpeak or look up. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed her about, the pains of hell got hold upon her.</hi> We pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out our complaints before God, and ſhewed him of her trouble. And he ſoon ſhewed, he is a God <hi>that heureth prayer,</hi> ſhe felt in herſelf, that <hi>being juſtified
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:029861_0244_0FE2AB851AA97850"/>freely, ſhe had peace with God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> She <hi>rejoiced in hope of the glory of God, and the love of God was ſhed abroad in her heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>April 20. Being Good-Friday, E—th R—n, T—l W—s, and one or two others firſt knew they had <hi>redemption in the blood of Chriſt, the remiſſion of</hi> their <hi>ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. 21. At Weaver's-hall a young man was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeized with a violent trembling all over, and in a few minutes, <hi>the ſorrows of his heart being enlarged,</hi> ſunk down to the ground. But we ceaſed not calling upon God, till he raiſed him up full of <hi>peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On Eaſter-Day, it being a thorough rain, I could only preach at Newgate at eight in the morning, and two in the afternoon; in a houſe near Hannam-Mount at eleven: and in one near Roſe-green at five. At the ſociety in the evening, many were cut to the heart, and many comforted.</p>
               <p>Mond. 23. On a repeated invitation I went to Pensford, about five miles from Briſtol. I ſent to the miniſter, to aſk leave to preach in the church, but having waited ſome time and received no anſwer, I called on many of the people who were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an open place, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> At four in the afternoon there were above three thouſand, in a convenient place near Briſtol, to whom I declared, <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I preached at Bath to about a thouſand on Tueſday morning, and at four in the afternoon to the poor colliers, at a place about the middle of Kingſwo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, I explained that glorious ſcripture (deſeribed in the ſtate of every true believer in Chriſt, every one who by faith is born of God) <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thurſd. 25. While I was preaching at Newgate on theſe words, <hi>He that believeth hath everlaſting life;</hi> I was inſenſibly led, without any previous deſign, to declare ſtrongly and explicitly, That <hi>God willeth all men to be thus ſaved;</hi> and to pray that, <q>If this were not the truth of God, he would not ſuffer the blind to go out of the way; but if it were, he would bear witneſs to his word.</q> Immediately one, and mother, and another ſunk to the earth: they dropped on every ſide as thunderſtruck. One of them cried aloud. We beſought God in her behalf, and he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her heavineſs into joy. A ſecond being in the ſame agony, we called upon God for her alſo; and he ſpoke peace unto her ſoul. In the evening I was again preſſed in ſpirit to declare, that <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for all.</hi> And almoſt before we called upon him, to ſet to his ſeal, be anſwered. One was ſo wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſword of the ſpirit, that you would have imagined ſhe could not live a moment. But imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately his abundant kindneſs was ſhewed, and ſhe loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſang of his righteouſneſs.</p>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 26. All Newgate rang with the cries of thoſe whom the word of God cut to the heart. Two of whom were in a moment filled with joy, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that beheld them.</p>
               <p>Sund. 28. I declared the free grace of God to about four thouſand people, from thoſe words, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall be not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> At that hour it was, that one who had long continued in fin, from a deſpair of finding mercy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:029861_0246_0FE2AB885F7C8430"/>a full, clear ſenſe of his pardoning love, and power to ſin no more. I then went to Clifton (a mile from Briſtol) at the miniſter's deſire, who was dangerouſly ill, and thence returned to a little plain, near Hannam-mount, where about three thouſand were preſent. After dinner I went to Clifton again. The church was quite full at the prayers and ſermon, as was the church-yard at the burial which followed. From Clifton we went to Roſe-green, where were (by computation) near ſeven thouſand, and thence to Glouceſter-lane Society. After which was our firſt Love-feaſt in Baldwin-ſtreet. O how has God renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſtrength! Who uſed ten years ago to be ſo faint and weary, with preaching <hi>twice</hi> in one day!</p>
               <p>Mond. 29. We underſtood that many were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the cries of thoſe on whom the power of God came: among whom was a phyſician, who was much afraid there might be fraud or impoſture in the caſe. To-day one whom he had known many years, was the firſt (while I was preaching at Newgate) who broke out into <hi>ſtrong cries and ſears.</hi> He could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe his own eyes and ears. He went and ſtood cloſe to her, and obſerved every ſymptom, till great drops of ſweat ran down her face, and all her bones ſhook. He then knew not what to think, being clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, it was not fraud, nor yet any natural diſorder. But when both her ſoul and body were healed in a moment, he acknowledged the finger of God.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. May 1. Many were offended again, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, much more than before. For at Baldwin-ſtreet my voice could ſcarce be heard amidſt the groanings of ſome, and the cries of others calling aloud to <hi>him that is mighty to ſave.</hi> I deſired all that were ſincere of heart, to beſeech with me <hi>the Prince exalted for us,</hi> that he would <hi>proclaim deliverance to the captives.</hi> And he ſoon ſhewed that he heard our voice. Many of
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:029861_0247_0FE2AB931C8617F0"/>thoſe who had been long in darkneſs, ſaw the dawn of a great light: and ten perſons (I afterwards ſound) then began to ſay in ſaith, <hi>my</hi> Lord <hi>and my</hi> God!</p>
               <p>A Quaker who ſtood by, was not a little diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>the diſſimulation of thoſe creatures,</hi> and was biting his lips and knitting his brows, when he dropped down as thunder-ſtruck. The agony he was in, was even terrible to behold. We beſought-God, not to lay folly to his charge. And he ſoon lifted up his voice and cried aloud, "now I know, Thou art a prophet of the Lord."</p>
               <p>Wed. 2. At Newgate, another mourner was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted. I was deſired to ſtep thence to a neighbouring houſe to ſee a letter wrote againſt me, as <hi>a deceiver of the people,</hi> by teaching that God <hi>willeth</hi> all men <hi>to be ſaved.</hi> One who long had aſſerted the contrary was there, when a young woman came in (who could ſay before, "I know that <hi>my</hi> Redeemer liveth") all in tears and in deep anguiſh of ſpirit. She ſaid, "She had been reaſoning with herſelf, how theſe things could be, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I again rejoice in God <hi>my</hi> Saviour." Juſt as we roſe from giving thanks, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon reeled four or five ſteps, and then dropped down. We prayed with her, and left her ſtrongly convinced of ſin, and earneſtly groaning for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
               <p>I did not mention one J—n H—n, a weaver, who was at Baldwin-ſtreet the night before. He was (I underſtood) a man of a regular life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one that conſtantly attended the public prayers and ſacrament, and was zealous for the church, and againſt diſſenters of every denomination.

<pb n="251" facs="unknown:029861_0248_0FE2AB95119F7D68"/>leſs ſatisfied than before; inſomuch that he went about to his acquaintance one after another, till one in the morning, and laboured above meaſure to convince them "It was a deluſion of the devil." We were going home, when one met us in the ſtreet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, "That J—n H— was fallen raving mad." It ſeems he had ſat down to dinner, but had a mind firſt to end a ſermon he had borrowed on <q>Salvation by ſaith.</q> In reading the laſt page, he changed colour, fell off his chair, and began ſcreaming ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly and beating himſelf againſt the ground. The neighbours were alarmed and flocked together to the houſe. Between one and two I came in, and found him on the floor, the room being full of people, whom his wiſe would have kept without; but he cried aloud, "No; let them all come, let all the world ſee the juſt judgment of God." Two or three men were holding him as well as they could. He immediately fixed his eyes upon <hi>me,</hi> and ſtretching out his hand, cried, <q>Ay, this is he, who I ſaid was a deceiver of the people. But God has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken me. I ſaid, it was all a deluſion. But this is no deluſion.</q> He then roared out, "O thou devil! Thou curſed devil! Yea, thou legion of devils! Thou canſt not ſtay. Chriſt will caſt thee out. I know his work is begun. Tear me to pieces, if thou wilt: but thou canſt not hurt me." He then beat himſelf againſt the ground again; his breaſt heaving at the ſame time, as in the pangs of death, and great drops of ſweat trickling down his face. We all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took ourſelves to prayer. His pangs ceaſed, and both his body and ſoul were ſet at liberty.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to Baptiſt-mills, -and declared him whom God <hi>hath exalted to be a prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto Iſrael and remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to J—n H—, we found his voice was loſt, and his body weak as that of an infant. But
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:029861_0249_0FE2AB96A0DA9560"/>his ſoul was in peace, full of love, and <hi>rejoicing in hope of the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The women of our ſociety met at ſeven. During our prayer, one of them fell into a violent agony: but ſoon after began to cry out with confidence, My Lord and <hi>my</hi> God! Sat. 5. I preached at the deſire of an unknown correſpondent, on thoſe excellent words (if well underſtood as recommending faith, reſignation, patience, meekneſs) <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sund. 6. I preached in the morning, to 5 or 6000 people, on, <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> (The ſame words on which I preached the next day, and on Wed. at Baptiſt-mills.) On Hannam-mount I preached to about three thouſand, on The <hi>ſcripture hath concluded all under ſin:</hi> at two at Clifton church, on Chriſt our <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption; and</hi> about five, at Roſe-green, on the <hi>promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, which is given to them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 7. I was preparing to ſet out for Pensford, having now had leave to preach in the church, when I received the following note:</p>
               <p>Sir, <hi>Our miniſter, having been informed, you are beſide yourſelf, does not care you ſhould preach in any of his churches.</hi>—I went however, and on Prieſt-Down, about half a mile from Pensford, preached Chriſt our <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 8. I went to Bath, but was not ſuffered to be in the meadow where I was before: which occaſioned the offer of a much more convenient place; where I preached Chriſt to about a thouſand ſouls.</p>
               <p>Wed. 9. We took poſſeſſion of a piece of ground, near St. James's church-yard, in the Horſe Fair, where it was deſigned to build a room, large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both the ſocieties of Nicholas and Baldwin-ſtreet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch of their acquaintance as might deſire to be
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:029861_0250_0FE2AB9830E46B20"/>preſent with them, at ſuch time as the ſcripture was expounded. And on Sat. 12. the firſt ſtone was laid, with the voice of praiſe and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>I had not at firſt the leaſt apprehenſion or deſign, of being perſonally engaged, either in the expenſe of this work, or in the direction of it: having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed eleven feoffees, on whom I ſuppoſed theſe burthens would fall of courſe. But I quickly found my miſtake; firſt with regard to the expenſe: for the whole undertaking muſt have ſtood ſtill, had not I immediately taken upon myſelf the payment of all the workmen; ſo that before I knew where I was, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a debt of more than an hundred and fifty pounds. And this I was to diſcharge how I could; the ſubſcriptions of both ſocieties not amounting to one quarter of the ſum. And as to the direction of the work, I preſently received letters from my friends in London, Mr. Whitefield in particular, backed with a meſſage by one juſt come from thence, that neither he nor they would have any thing to do with the building, neither contribute any thing towards it, unleſs I would inſtantly diſcharge all feoffees, and do every thing in my own name. Many reaſons they gave for this; but one was enough, viz. "That ſuch feoffees always would have it in their power, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul me, and if I preached not as they liked, to turn me out of the room I had built." I according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to their advice, and calling all the feoffees together, cancelled (no man oppoſing) the inſtrument made before, and took the whole management into my own hands. Money, it is true, I had not, nor any human proſpect or probability of procuring it. But I knew <hi>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> and in his name ſet out, nothing doubting.</p>
               <p>In the evening, while I was declaring, that Jeſus Chriſt had <hi>given himſelf a ranſom for all,</hi> three perſons almoſt at once, ſunk down as dead, having all their
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:029861_0251_0FE2ABA15978B8B0"/>ſins ſet in array before them. But in a ſhort- time they were raiſed up, and knew that <hi>the Lamb of God who taketh away the ſin of the world,</hi> had taken away their ſins.</p>
               <p>Sund. 13. I began expounding in the morning, the xiiith chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. At Hannam I farther explained, the promiſe given by faith; as I did alſo at Roſe-green. At Clifton it pleaſed God to aſſiſt me greatly, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe words, <hi>He that drinketh of this water ſhall thirſt again; but whoſo drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt: but the water which I ſhall give him ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ordinary employment (in public) was now as follows: Every morning I read prayers and preached at Newgate. Every evening I expounded a portion of ſcripture, at one, or more of the ſocieties. On Monday in the afternoon I preached abroad near Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol; on Tueſday at Bath and Two-Mile-hill alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. On Wedneſday at Baptiſt-mills. Every other Thurſday near Pensford. Every other Friday in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of Kingſwood. On Saturday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon and Sunday morning, in the Bowling-green (which lies near the middle of the city.) On Sunday at eleven near Hannam-mount. At two at Clifton, and at five on Roſe-green. And hitherto <hi>as my day is, ſo my ſtrength hath been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 15. As I was expounding in the Back-lane, on the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, many who had before been righteous in their own eyes, abhorred themſelves as in duſt and aſhes. But two, who ſeemed to be more deeply convinced than the reſt, did not long ſorrow as men without hope; but found in that hour, that they had <hi>an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> as did three others in Glonceſter-lane the evening before, and
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029861_0252_0FE2ABA36CACD420"/>three at Baldwin-ſtreet this evening. About ten, two who after ſeeing a great light, had again reaſoned themſelves into darkneſs, came to us, heavy laden. We cried to God, and they were again <hi>filied with peace and joy in believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 16. While I was declaring at Baptiſt-mills, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> a middle-aged man began violently beating his breaſt, and crying to him <hi>by whoſe ſtripes we are healed.</hi> During our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, God put a new ſong in his mouth. Some mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and others owned the hand of God. Particularly a woman of Baptiſt-mills, who was now convinced of her own want of an advocate with God, and went home full of anguiſh, but was in a few hours filled with joy, knowing he had <hi>blotted out all her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſcripture which came in turn at Newgate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, was the viith of St. John. The words which I chiefly inſiſted on as applicable to every miniſter of Chriſt, who in any wiſe follows the ſteps of his Maſter, were theſe, <hi>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtify of it, that its deeds are evil. There was a murmuring therefore concerning him among the multitude; for ſome ſaid, He is a good man: others ſaid, Nay, but he deceiveth the people.</hi> After ſermon I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſheriffs had ordered, "I ſhould preach he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for the future, <hi>but once a week.</hi>" Yea, and this is <hi>once too often,</hi> if <hi>he deceiveth the people:</hi> but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why not once a day?</p>
               <p>Satur. 19. At Weaver's-hall, a woman firſt, and then a boy (about fourteen years of age) was overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſin, and ſorrow, and fear. But we cried to God, and their ſouls were delivered.</p>
               <p>Sund. 20. Seeing many of the rich at Clifton church, my heart was much pained for them, and I was earneſtly deſirous that ſome even of them might <hi>enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> But full as I was, I
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:029861_0253_0FE2ABA5802F68B8"/>knew not where to begin, in warning them to flee from the wrath to come, till my teſtament opened on thoſe words, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance:</hi> in applying which, my ſoul was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, that methought I could have cried out (in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe than poor, vain Archimedes) "Give me where to ſtand, and I will ſhake the earth." God's ſending forth lightning with the rain, did not hinder about fifteen hundred from ſtaying at Roſe-green. Our ſcripture was, <hi>It is the glorious God that muketh the thunder. The voice of the Lord is mighty in operation, the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.</hi> In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſpoke to three whoſe ſouls were all ſtorm and tempeſt, and immediately there was a great calm.</p>
               <p>During this whole time, I was almoſt continually aſked, either by thoſe who purpoſely came to Briſtol, to enquire concerning this ſtrange work, or by my old or new correſpondents, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> And innumerable cautions were given me (generally grounded on groſs miſrepreſentations of things) "Not to regard viſions or dreams; or to fancy people had remiſſion of ſins, becauſe of their cries, or tears, or bare outward profeſſions." To one who had many times wrote to me on this head, the ſum of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was as follows:</p>
               <p>"The queſtion between us turns chiefly, if not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on matter of fact. You deny, that God does <hi>now</hi> work <hi>theſe</hi> effects: at leaſt, that he works them in <hi>this</hi> manner. I affirm both; becauſe I have heard theſe things with my own ears, and have ſeen them with my eyes. I have ſeen (as far as a thing of this kind can be ſeen) very many perſons changed in a moment, from the ſpirit of fear, horror, deſpair, to the ſpirit of love, joy and peace; and from ſinful deſire till then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them, to a pure deſire of doing the will of God. Theſe are matters of fact, whereof I have been, and almoſt daily am, an eye or ear-witneſs,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:029861_0254_0FE2ABA70FED1A48"/>What I have to ſay touching viſions or dreams is this: I know ſeveral perſons in whom this great change was wrought, in a dream, or during a ſtrong repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the eye of their mind, of Chriſt either on the croſs or in glory. This is the fact; let any judge of it as they pleaſe. And that ſuch a change was <hi>then</hi> wrought, appears (not from their ſhedding tears only, or falling into fits, or crying out: theſe are not the fruits, as you ſeem to ſuppoſe, whereby I judge, but) from the whole tenor of their life, <hi>till then</hi> many ways wicked; <hi>from that time,</hi> holy, juſt and good.</p>
               <p>"I will ſhew you him that was a lion <hi>till then,</hi> and is now a lamb; him that <hi>was</hi> a drunkard, and <hi>is</hi> now exemplarily ſober: the whoremonger that <hi>was,</hi> who now abhors the very garment ſpotted by the fleſh. Theſe are my living arguments for what I aſſert, viz. <hi>That God does now, as aforetime, give remiſſion of ſins and the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, even us and to our children: yea, and that always ſuddenly, as far as I have known, and often in dreams or in the viſions of God.</hi> If it be not ſo, I am found a falſe witneſs before God. For theſe things I <hi>do,</hi> and by his grace <hi>will,</hi> teſtify."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it might be, becauſe of the hardneſs of our hearts, unready to receive any thing, unleſs we ſee it with our eyes, and hear it with our ears, that God in tender condeſcenſion to our weakneſs, ſuffered ſo many outward ſigns of the very time when he wrought this inward change, to be continually ſeen and heard among us. But although they ſaw <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> (for ſo I muſt term them) yet many would not believe. They could not indeed <hi>deny</hi> the facts; but they could <hi>explain</hi> them away. Some ſaid, <q>Theſe were purely <hi>natural</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; the people fainted away, only becauſe of the heat and cloſeneſs of the rooms.</q> And others were ſure, <q>It was all a cheat: they might help it
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:029861_0255_0FE2ABB1844AC528"/>if they would. Elſe why were theſe things only in their private ſocieties? Why were they not done in the face of the ſun?</q> To-day Mond. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, our Lord anſwered for himſelf. For while I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing theſe words, <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God,</hi> he began to make bare his arm, not in a cloſe room, neither in private, but in the open air, and before more than two thouſand witneſſes. One, and another, and another was ſtruck to the earth; exceedingly trembling at the preſence of his power. Others cried, with a loud and bitter cry, <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> And in leſs than an hour, ſeven perſons, wholly unknown to me till that time, were rejoicing, and ſinging, and with all their might giving thanks to the God of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>In the evening, I was interrupted at Nicholas-ſtreet, almoſt as ſoon as I had begun to ſpeak, by the cries of one who was <hi>pricked at the heart,</hi> and ſtrongly groaned for pardon and peace. Yet I went on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what God had already done, in proof of that important truth, That he is <hi>not willing</hi> any <hi>ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that</hi> all <hi>ſhould come to repentance.</hi> Another perſon dropped down, cloſe to one who was a ſtrong aſſerter of a contrary doctrine. While he ſtood aſtoniſhed at the ſight, a little boy near him was ſeized in the ſame manner. A young man who ſtood up behind, fixed his eyes on him, and ſunk down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as one dead: but ſoon began to roar out and beat himſelf againſt the ground, ſo that ſix men could ſcarcely hold him. His name was Thomas Maxfield. Except J—n H—n, I never ſaw one ſo torn of the evil one. Mean while many others began to cry out to the <hi>Saviour of all,</hi> that he would come and help them, inſomuch that all the houſe (and indeed all the ſtreet for ſome ſpace) was in an uproar. But we continued in prayer; and before ten, the greater part found reſt to their ſouls.</p>

I was called from ſupper to one who feeling in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch a conviction as ſhe never had known before, had run out of the ſociety in all haſte, <hi>that ſhe might not expoſe herſelf.</hi> But the hand of God followed her ſtill, ſo that after going a few ſteps, ſhe was forced to be carried home, and when ſhe was there, grew worſe and worſe.

               <p>Tueſ. 5. There was great expectation at Bath, of what a noted man was to do to me there: and I was much entreated, "Not to preach; becauſe no one knew what might happen." By this re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many of them ſeemed to be a little ſurpriſed, and were ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-pace into ſeriouſneſs, when their champion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and coming cloſe to me, aſked "By what authority I did theſe things?"

He ſaid, "This is contrary to act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. This is a conventicle." I anſwered, "Sir, the conventicles mentioned in that act (as the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhews) are <hi>ſeditious</hi> meetings. But this is not ſuch. Here is no ſhadow of ſedition. Therefore it is not contrary to that act." He replied, "I ſay it is. And b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Common report is not enough. <hi>Give me leave, Sir, to aſk, is not your name Naſh?</hi> My name is Naſh. <hi>Sir, I dare not judge of you by common report. I think it not enough to judge by.</hi> Here he pauſed a-while, and having recovered himſelf, ſaid,

"You, Mr. Naſh, take care of your body. We take care of our ſouls, and for the food of our ſouls we come here." He replied not a word, but walked away.</p>
               <p>As I returned, the ſtreet was full of people, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to and fro, and ſpeaking great words. But when any of them aſked, "Which is he?" and I replie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I went to them and ſaid, "I believe, ladies, the maid miſtook: you only wanted to look at me." I added, "I do not expect that the rich and great ſhould want either to ſpeak with <hi>me,</hi> or to hear <hi>me;</hi> for I ſpeak the plain truth; a thing <hi>you</hi> hear little of, and do not deſire to hear." A few more words paſt between us, and I retired.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 7. I preached at Prieſt-Down, on <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved?</hi> In the midſt of the prayer after ſermon, two men (hired, as we afterwards underſtood, for that purpoſe) began ſinging a ballad. After a few mild words (for I ſaw ſome that were angry) uſed without effect, we all began ſinging a pſalm, which put them utterly to ſilence. We then poured out our ſouls in prayer for them, and they appeared altogether confounded. O may this be a day much to be remembered by them, for the loving-kindneſs of the Lord!</p>
               <p>Mond. 11. I received a preſſing letter from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (as I had ſeveral others before) to come thither as ſoon as poſſible; "Our brethren in Fetter-lane being in great confuſion, for want of my preſence and advice." I therefore preached in the afternoon on theſe words, <hi>I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not ſhun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely God hath yet a work to do in this place. I have not found ſuch love, no not in England; nor ſo childlike, artleſs, teachable a temper, as he hath given to this people.</p>
               <p>Yet during this whole time I had many thoughts, concerning the unuſual manner of my miniſtering among them. But after frequently laying it before the Lord, and calmly weighing whatever objections I heard againſt it, I could not but adhere to what I had ſome time ſince wrote to a friend, who had freely ſpoken his ſentiments concerning it. An extract of that letter I here ſubjoin: that the matter may be placed in a clear light.</p>

Therefore I have diſclaimed that character on every poſſible occaſion. I told all in our ſhip, all at Savannah, all at Frederica, and that over and over, in expreſs terms, "I am not a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; I only follow after, if haply I may attain it." When they urged my works and ſelf-denial, I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhort, <hi>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and my body to be burned, I am nothing.</hi> For I have not charity. I do not love God with all my heart.

                     <p>If you aſk, "On what principle then I acted?" It was this, <q>A deſire to be a Chriſtian, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that whatever I judge conducive thereto, that I am bound to do; wherever I judge I can beſt anſwer this end, thither it is my duty to go.</q> On this principle I ſet out for America; on this, I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the Moravian church; and on the ſame, am I ready now (God being my helper) to go to Abyſſinia or China, or whitherſoever it ſhall pleaſe God by this conviction to call me.</p>
                     <p>As to your advice, "That I ſhould ſettle in college," I have no buſineſs there, having now no office, and no pupils.

But on ſcriptural principles, I do not think it hard to juſtify whatever I do. God, in ſcripture commands me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my power, to inſtruct the ignorant, reform the wicked, confirm the virtuous. Man forbids me to do this, in another's pariſh; that is, in effect, to do it at all; ſeeing I have now no pariſh of my own,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:029861_0262_0FE2ABC522CB6110"/>nor probably ever ſhall. Whom then ſhall I hear? God or man? <hi>If it be juſt to obey man rather than God, judge you. A diſpenſation of the goſpel is committed to me, and woe is me if I preach not the goſpel.</hi> But where ſhall I preach it upon the principles you mention? Why, not in Europe, Aſia, Africa, or America: not in any of the Chriſtian parts, at leaſt, of the habitable earth. For all theſe are, after a ſort, divided into pariſhes. If it be ſaid, <q>Go back then to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens from whence you came.</q> Nay, but neither could I now (on your principles) preach to them.

This is the work which I know God has called me to. And ſure I am, that his bleſſing attends it.

                     <p>If you aſk, "How can this be?

               <p>Wed. 13. In the morning I came to London, and after receiving the holy communion at Iſlington, I had once more an opportunity of ſeeing my mother, whom I had not ſeen ſince my return from Germany.</p>
               <p>I cannot but mention an odd circumſtance here. I had read her a paper in June laſt year, containing a ſhort account of what had paſſed in my own ſoul, till within a few days of that time. She greatly approved it and ſaid "She heartily bleſſed God, who had brought me to ſo juſt a way of thinking." While I was in Germany, a copy of that paper was ſent (without my knowledge) to one of my relations. He ſent an account of it to my mother; whom I now found under ſtrange fears concerning me, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by "<hi>an account taken from one of my own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> that I had greatly erred from the faith." I
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:029861_0264_0FE2ABCF0BA24580"/>could not conceive, what paper that ſhould be; but on enquiry found, it was the ſame I had read her my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—How hard is it to form a true judgment of any perſon or thing, from the account of a prejudiced re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later! yea, though he be ever ſo honeſt a man: For he who gave this relation, was one of unqueſtionable veracity. And yet by his <hi>ſincere</hi> account of a writing which lay before his eyes, was the truth ſo totally diſguiſed, that my mother knew not the paper ſhe had heard from end to end, nor I that I had my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrote.</p>
               <p>At ſix I warned the women at Fetter-lane (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how they had been lately ſhaken) <hi>not to believe every ſpirit, but to try the ſpirits, whether they were of God.</hi> Our brethren met at eight, when it pleaſed God to remove many miſunderſtandings and offences that had crept in among them: and to reſtore in good meaſure <hi>the ſpirit of love and of a ſound mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thurſ. 14. I went with Mr. Whitefield to Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath, where were, I believe, 12 or 14000 people. He a little ſurpriſed me, by deſiring me to preach in his ſtead; which I did (though nature recoiled) on my favourite ſubject, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was greatly moved with compaſſion for the rich that were there, to whom I made a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Some of them ſeemed to attend, while others drove away their coaches from ſo uncouth a preacher.</p>
               <p>Frid. 15. I had much talk with one who is called a quaker. But he could not receive my ſaying.

In the evening I went to a ſociety at Wapping, weary in body and faint in ſpirit. I intended to ſpeak on Romans iii. 19. but could not tell how to open my mouth: and all the time we were ſinging, my mind was full of ſome place, I knew not where, in the epiſtle to the Hebrews.

I have ſeen many hyſterical and many epileptie fits: but none of them were like theſe, in many reſpects. I immediately prayed, "That God would not ſuffer thoſe who were weak to be offended.

Sat. 16. We met at Fetter-lane, to humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, and own he had juſtly withdrawn his Spirit from us, for our manifold unfaithfulneſs. We acknowledged our having grieved him by our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, <hi>one ſaying, I am of Paul, another, I am of Apollos.</hi> By our leaning again to our own works, and truſting in them, inſtead of Chriſt; by our reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe little beginnings of ſanctification, which it had pleaſed him to work in our ſouls; and above all, by blaſpheming his work among us, imputing it either to nature, to the force of imagination and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits, or even to the deluſion of the devil. In that hour, we found God with us as at the firſt. Some fell proſtrate upon the ground. Others burſt out, as with one conſent, into loud praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. And many openly teſtified, there had been no ſuch day as this ſince January the firſt preceding.</p>
               <p>Sund. 17. I preached at ſeven in Upper Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

We did not diſpute, but pray; and in a ſhort ſpace the ſcales fell off from his eyes. He gladly returned to the church, and was in the evening re-admitted into our ſociety.</p>
               <p>At five I preached on Kennington-common, to about fifteen thouſand people, on thoſe words, <hi>Look unto him, and be ye ſaved, all ye ends of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 18. I left London early in the morning, and the next evening reached Briſtol, and preached (as I had appointed, if God ſhould permit) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is ſcarce credible, what advantage Satan had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during my abſence of only eight days. Diſputes had crept into our little ſociety, ſo that the love of many was already waxed cold.

Our Lord was with us. Our diviſions were healed. Miſunderſtandings vaniſhed away. And all our hearts were ſweetly drawn together, and united as at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Frid. 22. I called on one who <hi>did run well,</hi> till he was hindered by ſome of thoſe called <hi>French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

               <p>In the afternoon I preached at the Fiſh-ponds, but had no life or ſpirit in me; and was much in doubt, whether God would not lay me aſide, and ſend other labourers into his harveſt. I came to the ſociety full of this thought; and began in much weakneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, '<hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God.</hi> I told them, "They were not to judge of the ſpirit, whereby any one ſpoke, either by <hi>appearances,</hi> or by <hi>common report,</hi> or by their own <hi>inward feelings.</hi> No, nor by any dreams, viſions or revelations, ſuppoſed to be made to their ſouls, any
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:029861_0268_0FE2ABDCC76F0F98"/>more than by their tears, or any involuntary effects wrought upon their bodies." I warned them, "all theſe were in themſelves, of a doubtful, diſputable nature: they <hi>might</hi> be from God, and they <hi>might not;</hi> and were therefore not ſimply to be relied on (any more than ſimply to be condemned) but to be tried by a farther rule, to be brought to the only certain teſt, the law and the teſtimony." While I was ſpeaking, one before me dropped down as dead, and preſently a ſecond and a third. Five others ſunk down in half an hour, moſt of whom were in violent agonies. <hi>The pains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> them.</hi> In their trouble we called upon the Lord, and he gave us an anſwer of peace. One indeed continued an hour in ſtrong pain; and one or two more for three days. But the reſt were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted in that hour, and went away rejoicing and praiſing God.</p>
               <p>Sat. 23. I ſpoke ſeverally with thoſe who had been ſo troubled the night before. Some of them, I found, were only convinced of ſin; others had indeed found reſt to their ſouls. This evening ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſeized with ſtrong pangs, But in a ſhort time her ſoul was delivered.</p>
               <p>Sund. 24. As I was riding to Roſe-green, in a ſmooth, plain part of the road, my horſe ſuddenly pitched upon his head, and rolled over and over. I received no other hurt than a little bruiſe on one ſide, which for the preſent I felt not, but preached with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain to 6 or 7000 people on that important di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> In the evening a girl of 13 or 14, and four or five other perſons, ſome of whom had felt the power of God before, were deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſin, and with ſighs and groans which could not be uttered, called upon God for deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="unknown:029861_0269_0FE2ABDE538ACAD8"/>
Mond. 25. About ten in the morning, J—e C—r, as ſhe was ſitting at work, was ſuddenly ſeized with grievous terrors of mind, attended with ſtrong trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Thus ſhe continued all the afternoon; but at the ſociety in the evening God turned her heavineſs into joy. Five or ſix others were alſo out to the heart this day: and ſoon after found him <hi>whoſe hands make whole:</hi> as did one likewiſe, who had been mourning many months, without any to comfort her.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 26. I preached near the houſe we had a few days before began to build for a ſchool, in the middle of Kingſwood, under a little ſycamore-tree, during a violent ſtorm of rain, on thoſe words, <hi>As the rain cometh down from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud:—So ſhall my word be that goeth out of my mouth: it ſhall not return unto me void. But it ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſend it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three perſons terribly felt the wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, at the ſociety this evening. But upon prayer made in their behalf, he was pleaſed ſoon to lift up the light of his countenance upon them.</p>
               <p>Frid. 29. I preached in a part of Kingſwood, where I never had been before. The places in Kingſwood where I now uſually preached were theſe; once a fortnight, a little above Connam, a village on the ſouth ſide of the wood; on Sunday morning, near Hannam-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Satur. 30. At Weaver's-hall, ſeven or eight perſons were conſtrained to roar aloud, while the ſword of the ſpirit was <hi>dividing aſunder their ſouls and ſpirits, and joints and marrow.</hi> But they were all relieved upon
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:029861_0270_0FE2ABDFE403ECC8"/>prayer, and ſang <hi>praiſes unto our God, and unto the Lamb that liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gave a particular account, from time to time, of the manner wherein God here carried on his work, to thoſe whom I believed to deſire the increaſe of his kingdom, with whom I had any opportunity of correſponding. Part of the anſwer, which I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (ſome time after) from one of theſe, I cannot but here ſubjoin.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>I Deſire to bleſs my Lord, for the good and great news your letter bears, about the Lord's turning many ſouls <hi>from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God;</hi> and that ſuch <hi>a great and effectual door is opened</hi> among you, as the <hi>many adverſaries</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhut. O may <hi>He that hath the key of the houſe of David, that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth,</hi> ſet the door of faith more and more open among you, till his houſe be filled and till he gather together the outcaſts of Iſrael. And may that prayer for the adverſaries be heard, <hi>Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name, O Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the outward manner you ſpeak of, wherein moſt of them were affected who were cut to the heart by the ſword of the Spirit, no wonder that this was at firſt ſurpriſing to you, ſince they are indeed ſo very rare, that have been thus pricked and wounded. Yet ſome of the inſtances you give ſeem to be exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the outward manner wherein Paul and the jailor were at firſt affected: as alſo Peter's hearers, Acts ii. The laſt inſtance you gave, of ſome ſtruggling as in the agonies of death, and in ſuch a manner as that four or five ſtrong men can hardly reſtrain a weak wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from hurting herſelf or others: this is to me ſomewhat more inexplicable: if it do not reſemble the child ſpoke of, Mark ix. 26. and Luke ix. 42. of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>while he was yet a coming, the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:029861_0271_0FE2ABE910B29110"/>devil threw him down and tare him.</hi> Or what influence ſudden and ſharp awakenings may have upon the body I pretend not to explain. But I make no queſtion Satan, ſo far as he gets power, may exert himſelf on ſuch occaſions, partly to hinder the good work in the perſons thus touched with the ſharp arrows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and partly to diſparage the work of God, as if it tended to lead people to diſtraction.—However, the merciful iſſue of theſe conflicts in the converſion of the perſons thus affected, is the main thing.</p>
                     <p>When they are brought by the ſaving arm of God to receive Chriſt Jeſus, to have joy and peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and then to walk in him, and give evidence that the work is a ſaving work at length, whether more quickly or gradually accompliſhed, there is great matter of praiſe,—</p>
                     <p>All the outward appearances of people's being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected among us, may be reduced to theſe two ſorts; one is, hearing with a cloſe, ſilent attention, with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and greedineſs, diſcovered by fixed looks, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes, and ſorrowful or joyful countenances: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort is, when they lift up their voice aloud, ſome more depreſſedly, and others more highly; and at times, the whole multitude in a flood of tears, all as it were crying out at once, till their voice be ready to drown the miniſter's, that he can ſcarce be heard for the weeping noiſe that ſurrounds him.—The influence on ſome of theſe, like a land-flood, dries up; we hear of no change wrought. But on others, it appears in the fruits of righteouſneſs, and the tract of a holy converſation.</p>
                     <p>May the Lord ſtrengthen you, to go on in his work! And in praying for the coming of his kingdom with you and us, and I hope you ſhall not be forgotten among us, in our joint applications to the throne of grace.</p>

                  </gap>. I preached to about five thouſand, on the favourite advice of the infidel in Eccleſiaſtes (ſo zealouſly enforced by his brethren now) <hi>Be not righteous overmuch.</hi> At Hannam and at Roſe-green, I explained the latter part of the viith of St. Luke: that verſe eſpecially, <hi>When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A young woman ſunk down at Roſe-green, in a violent agony both of body and mind: as did five or ſix perſons in the evening at the New-room, at whoſe cries many were greatly offended. The ſame offence was given in the morning by one at Weaver's-hall, and by eight or nine others, at Glouceſter-lane in the evening. The firſt that was deeply touched was L— W—; whoſe mother had been not a little diſpleaſed a day or two before, when ſhe was told, how her daughter had <hi>expoſed herſelf</hi> before all the congregation: the mother herſelf was the next who dropped down, and loſt her ſenſes in a moment; but went home with her daughter, full of joy, as did moſt of thoſe that had been in pain.</p>
               <p>Soon after the ſociety, I went to Mrs. T—'s, whoſe neareſt relations were earneſtly diſſuading her, from being <hi>righteous overmuch;</hi> and by the old motive, <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thyſelf?</hi> She anſwered all they advanced with meekneſs and love, and continued ſtedfaſt and immovable. Endure hardſhip ſtill, thou good ſoldier of Chriſt! Perſecuted, but not forſaken: torn with inward, and encompaſſed with outward temptations: but yielding to none. O may patience have its perfect work!</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 3. I preached at Bath to the moſt attentive and ſerious audience I have ever ſeen there. On Wedneſday I preached at Newgate on thoſe words, <hi>Becauſe of the Phariſees, they durſt not confeſs him.—For they loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.</hi> A meſſage was delivered to me when I had
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:029861_0273_0FE2ABEC2B5CE038"/>done, from the ſheriffs, "That I muſt preach there no more."</p>
               <p>Frid. 6. I preſſed a ſerious quaker to tell me, Why he did not come to hear me as formerly? he ſaid, "Becauſe he found we were not <hi>led by the Spirit;</hi> for we fixed times of preaching beforehand; whereas we ought to do nothing unleſs we were <hi>ſenſibly moved thereto</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt." I aſked, "Whether we ought not to do what God in ſcripture commands, when we have opportunity? Whether the providence of God thus concurring with his word, were not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for our doing it, although we were not at that moment <hi>ſenſibly moved thereto</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt?" He anſwered, "It was not a ſufficient reaſon. This was to regard <hi>the letter that killeth.</hi>" God grant, that I may ſo regard it all the days of my life!</p>
               <p>In the afternoon I was with Mr. Whitefield juſt come-from London, with whom I went to Baptiſt-mills, where he preached <hi>concerning the Holy Ghoſt, which all who believe, are to receive;</hi> not without a juſt, though ſevere, cenſure of thoſe, who preach <hi>as if</hi> there were no Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Sat. 7. I had an opportunity to talk with him of thoſe outward ſigns, which had ſo often accompanied the inward work of God. I found his objections were chiefly grounded on groſs miſrepreſentations of matter of fact. But the next day he had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of informing himſelf better. For no ſooner had he begun (in the application of his ſermon) to invite all ſinners, to believe in Chriſt, than four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſunk down cloſe to him, almoſt in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One of them lay without either ſenſe or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A ſecond trembled exceedingly. The third bad ſtrong convulſions all over his body, but made no noiſe, unleſs by groans. The fourth, equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed, called upon God, with ſtrong cries and tears.
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:029861_0274_0FE2ABEDCE31E940"/>From this time I truſt, we ſhall all ſuffer God to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his own work in the way that pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 13. I went to a gentleman who is much troubled with what they call <hi>lowneſs of ſpirits.</hi> Many ſuch have I been with before; but in ſeveral of them, it was no bodily diſtemper. They wanted ſomething, they knew not what, and were therefore heavy, uneaſy, and diſſatisfied with every thing. The plain truth is, they wanted God, they wanted Chriſt, they wanted faith. And God convinced them of their want, in a way their phyſicians no more underſtood than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Accordingly nothing availed till the Great Phyſician came. For in ſpite of all natural means, he who made them for himſelf, would not ſuffer them to reſt, till they reſted in him.</p>
               <p>On Friday in the afternoon I left Briſtol with Mr. Whitefield, in the midſt of heavy rain. But the clouds ſoon diſperſed, ſo that we had a fair, calm evening, and a ſerious congregation at Thornbury.</p>
               <p>In the morning we breakfaſted with a quaker, who had been brought up in the church of England: but being under ſtrong convictions of inward ſin, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeveral perſons for advice, they all judged him to be under a diſorder of body, and gave advice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Some quakers with whom he met about the ſame time, told him, it was the hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul; and adviſed him to ſeek another ſort of relief than thoſe miſerable comforters had recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Wo unto you, ye blind leaders of the blind!</hi> How long will ye pervert the right ways of the Lord? Ye who tell the mourners in Zion, Much religion hath made you mad! Ye who ſend them whom God hath wounded to the devil for cure; to company, idle books or diverſions! Thus ſhall they periſh in their iniquity; but their blood ſhall God require at your hands!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="unknown:029861_0275_0FE2ABF65E7D34D0"/>
We had an attentive congregation at Glouceſter in the evening. In the morning, Mr. Whitefield being gone forward, I preached to about five thouſand there, on <hi>Chriſt our wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> It rained violently at five in the evening; notwithſtanding which two or three thouſand people ſtayed, to whom I expounded that glorious viſion of Ezekiel, of the reſurrection of the dry bones.</p>
               <p>Monday 16. After preaching to two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand on, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> I returned to Briſtol, and preached to about three thouſand, on thoſe words of Job, <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling; there the weary are at reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 17. I rode to Bradford, five miles from Bath, whither I had been long invited to come. I waited on the miniſter, and deſired leave to preach in his church. He ſaid, "It was not uſual to preach on the week-days: but if I could come thither on a Sunday, he ſhould be glad of my aſſiſtance." Thence I went to a gentleman in the town, who had been preſent when I preached at Bath, and with the ſtrongeſt marks of ſincerity and affection, <hi>wiſhed me good l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck in the name of the Lord.</hi> But it was paſt. I found him now quite cold. He began diſputing on ſeveral heads, and at laſt told me plainly, one of our own college had informed him, "They always took me to be a little crack-brained at Oxford."</p>
               <p>However ſome perſons who were not of his mind, having pitched upon a convenient place (called Bear-field or Bury-field) on the top of the hill under which the town lies: I there offered Chriſt to about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand people, for wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption. Thence I returned to Bath, and preached on, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> to a larger audience than ever before. I was wondering the God of this world was ſo ſtill: when at my return from the place of preaching, poor R— d M—l told me,
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:029861_0276_0FE2ABF88D7FAC58"/>
                  <hi>He could not let me preach any more in his ground.</hi> I aſked him, why? He ſaid, "The people hurt his trees, and ſtole things out of his ground. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (added he) <hi>I have already by letting thee be there, merited the diſpleaſure of my neighbours.</hi>" O fear of man! Who is above thee, but they who indeed <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in ſpirit and in truth?</hi> Not even thoſe who have one foot in the grave! Not even thoſe who dwell in rooms of cedar; and who have heaped up gold as the duſt, and ſilver as the ſand of the ſea!</p>
               <p>Sat. 21. I began expounding a ſecond time our Lord's ſermon on the mount. In the morning, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 22, as I was explaining <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> to about three thouſand people, we had a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing all men what manner of ſpirit we were of. For in the middle of the ſermon, the preſs-gang came, and ſeized on one of the hearers (ye learned in the law, what becomes of <hi>magna charta,</hi> and of <hi>Engliſh liberty and property?</hi> Are not theſe mere ſounds, while, on any pretence, there is ſuch a thing as a preſs-gang ſuffered in the land?) all the reſt ſtanding ſtill, and none opening his mouth or lifting up his hand to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>Mond. 23. To guard young converts from fancying, that they had already attained or were already perfect, I preached on thoſe words, <hi>So is the kingdom of God, as when a man caſteth ſeed into the ground—And riſeth day and night, and the ſeed buddeth forth and ſpringeth up he knoweth not how—firſt the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On ſeveral evenings this week, and particularly on Friday, many were deeply convinced; but none were delivered from that painful conviction, <hi>The children came to the birth; but there was not ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> I fear we have grieved the Spirit of the jealous God, by queſtioning his work: and that therefore he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:029861_0277_0FE2ABFA6B310D78"/>from us for a ſeaſon. <hi>But he will return and abundantly pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 30. Two more were in ſtrong pain, both their ſouls and bodies being well-nigh torn aſunder. But though we cried unto God, there was no anſwer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he as yet deliver them at all.</p>
               <p>One of theſe had been remarkably zealous againſt thoſe that cried out and made a noiſe, being ſure that <hi>any of them might help it if they would.</hi> And the ſame opinion ſhe was in ſtill, till the moment ſhe was ſtruck through as with a ſword, and fell trembling to the ground. She then cried aloud, though not articulate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, her words being ſwallowed up. In this pain ſhe continued twelve or fourteen hours, and then her ſoul was ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 31. I preached at Bradford to above two thouſand, many of whom were of the better rank, on <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> They all behaved with decency, and none went away till the ſervice was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. While I was preaching at Bath, on my return, ſome of the audience did not behave ſo well; being, I fear, a little too nearly concerned, when I came to the application of thoſe words, <hi>Not only this our craft is in danger to be ſet at nought: but alſo that the temple of the great goddeſs Diana ſhould be deſpiſed—whom all Aſia and the world worſhippeth.</hi>

But not <hi>in a tumultuous manner,</hi> not <hi>to the diſturbance of the public peace,</hi> or <hi>the prejudice of families.</hi> Neither herein do I break any law which I know; much <hi>leſs ſet at nought all rule and authority.</hi> Nor can I be ſaid to <hi>intrude into the labours</hi> of thoſe, who do not labour at all; but ſuffer thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thoſe for whom Chriſt died, to <hi>periſh for lack of knowledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They periſh for want of knowing, that <hi>we</hi> as well as the Heathens, <hi>are alienated from the life of God;</hi> that <hi>every one of us</hi> by the corruption of our inmoſt nature, <hi>is very far gone from original righteouſneſs;</hi> ſo far, that <hi>every perſon born into the world, deſerveth God's wrath and damnation:</hi> that we have by nature no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er either to help ourſelves, or even to call upon God to help us; all our tempers and works, in our natural ſtate, being only evil continually. So that <hi>our</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, as well as <hi>theirs, muſt infer a great and mighty change.</hi> It muſt infer, not only an <hi>outward change,</hi> from ſtealing, lying and all corrupt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but a thorough <hi>change of heart,</hi> an <hi>inward</hi>

Accordingly, <hi>the old man</hi> implies infinitely more than <hi>outward, evil converſation,</hi> even <hi>an evil heart of unbelief,</hi> corrupted by pride and a thouſand deceitful luſts. Of conſequence, the <hi>new man</hi> muſt imply infinitely more than <hi>outward, good converſation,</hi> even <hi>a good heart, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs:</hi> a heart full of that faith, which working by love, produces all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of converſation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The change from the former of theſe ſtates to the latter, is what I call <hi>The new birth.</hi> But you ſay, I am <hi>not content with this plain and eaſy notion of it, but fill myſelf and others with fantaſtical conceits</hi> about it. Alas, Sir, how can you prove this? And if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove it, what amends can you make, either to God, or to me, or to the world, for publicly aſſerting a groſs falſehood?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Perhaps you ſay, <hi>You can prove this of Mr.</hi> Whitefield. What then? This is nothing to me. I am not accountable for <hi>his</hi> words. The journal you quote I never ſaw till it was in print.

And again, where you ſay, he <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> a perſon <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt,</hi>—to be without any <hi>ſaving knowledge</hi> of him. He <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> no ſuch thing. <hi>To believe in Chriſt</hi> is the very thing he <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> wanting; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that term <hi>believing</hi> to imply, not only an aſſent to the articles of our creed, but alſo <hi>a true truſt and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now this it is certain a man may want, although he can truly ſay, <hi>I am chaſte, I am ſober, I am juſt in my dealings, I help my neighbour and uſe the ordinances

               <p>Sund. 5. Six perſons at the New-room were deeply <hi>convinced of ſin:</hi> three of whom were a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comforted by prayer; but not yet <hi>convinced of righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>Having frequently been invited to Wells, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by Mr. —, who begged me to make his houſe my home, on Thurſday the 9th I went thither, and wrote him word the night before; upon which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went to one of his friends, and deſired a meſſenger might be ſent to meet me and beg me "To turn back, otherwiſe (ſaid he) we ſhall loſe all our trade." But this conſideration did not weigh with him, ſo that he invited me to his own houſe: and at eleven I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ground, on <hi>Chriſt our wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and redemption,</hi> to about 2000 perſons.

               <p>Sat. 11. In the evening two were ſeized with ſtrong pangs, as were four the next evening, and the ſame number at Glouceſter-lane on Monday, one of whom was greatly comforted.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 14. I preached at Bradford to about three thouſand, on, <hi>One thing is needful.</hi> Returning through Bath, I preached to a ſmall congregation ſuddenly gathered together at a little diſtance from the town (not being permitted to be in R— M—'s ground any more) on, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Three at the New-room this evening were cut to the heart. But their wound was not as yet healed.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 15. I endeavoured to guard thoſe who were in their firſt love, from falling into inordinate affection, by explaining thoſe ſtrange words at Baptiſt-mills, <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh.</hi>

               <p>Friday 17.

               <p>Wedn. 22. I was with many that were in heavineſs: two of whom were ſoon filled with peace and joy. In the afternoon I endeavoured to guard the weak againſt what too often occaſions heavineſs, levity of temper or
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:029861_0284_0FE2AC18D5A56990"/>behaviour, from, <hi>I ſaid of laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, What doth it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 27. For two hours I took up my croſs, in arguing with a zealous man, and labouring to convince him, <q>That I was not an enemy to the church of England.</q> He allowed, <q>I taught no other doctrines than thoſe of the church;</q> but could not forgive my teaching them <hi>out of the church-walls.</hi> He allowed too (which none indeed can deny, who has either any regard to truth or ſenſe of ſhame) that <q>by this teaching many ſouls who till that time were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing for lack of knowledge, have been, and are brought from darkneſs to light and from the power of Satan unto God.</q> But he added, <q>No one can tell, what <hi>may be hereafter;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> I ſay, theſe things ought not to be ſuffered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the report now current in Briſtol was, "That I was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> if not a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi>" Some added, <q>That I was born and bred at Rome;</q> which many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially believed. O ye fools, when will ye underſtand, that the preaching <hi>juſtification by faith alone,</hi> the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no meritorious cauſe of juſtification, but the death and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and no conditional or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe, but faith, is overturning popery from the foundation? When will ye underſtand, that the moſt deſtructive of all thoſe errors, which Rome, the mother of abominations hath brought forth (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to which tranſubſtantiation and a hundred more, are trifles light as air) is, <hi>That we are juſtified by works</hi> (or to expreſs the ſame thing a little more decently) by faith <hi>and</hi> works. Now, do I preach <hi>This?</hi> I did for ten years; I was (fundamentally) a papiſt, and knew it not. But I do now teſtify to all (and it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point for aſſerting which I have to this day been called in queſtion) that "no good works can be done before juſtification, none which have not in them the nature of ſin."</p>
               <p>

I have often enquired, who are the authors of this report; and have generally found they were either bigotted diſſenters, or (I ſpeak without fear or favour) miniſters of our own church. I have alſo frequently conſidered, what poſſible ground or motive they could have thus to ſpeak: ſeeing few men in the world have had occaſion ſo clearly and openly to declare their principles, as I have done, both by preaching, print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and converſation, for ſeveral years laſt paſt. And I can no otherwiſe think, than that either they ſpoke thus (to put the moſt favourable conſtruction upon it) from groſs ignorance: they knew not what popery was; they knew not what doctrines thoſe are which the Papiſts teach: or they wilfully ſpoke what they knew to be falſe, probably <hi>thinking</hi> thereby <hi>to do God ſervice.</hi> Now, take this to yourſelves, whoſoever ye are, high or low, diſſenters or churchmen, clergy or laity, who have advanced this ſhameleſs charge, and digeſt it how you can.</p>
               <p>But how have ye not been afraid, if ye believe there is a God, and that he knoweth the ſecrets of your hearts (I ſpeak now to you, preachers, more eſpecially, of whatever denomination) to declare ſo groſs, palpable a lie, in the name of the God of truth? I cite you all before the Judge of all the earth, either publicly to prove your charge; or by publicly retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to make the beſt amends you can, to God, to me, and to the world.</p>
               <p>For the full ſatisfaction of thoſe who have been abuſed by theſe ſhameleſs men, and almoſt brought to believe a lie, I will here add my ſerious judgment concerning the church of Rome, wrote ſome time ſince to a prieſt of that communion.</p>

                     <p>I have neither time nor inclination for controverſy with any; but leaſt of all with the Romaniſts. And that, both becauſe I cannot truſt any of their quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without conſulting every ſentence they quote in the originals: and becauſe the originals themſelves can very hardly be truſted, in any of the points contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between them and us.

                     <p>Yet I can by no means approve the ſcurrility and contempt with which the Romaniſts have often been treated. I dare not rail at or deſpiſe any man: much leſs thoſe who profeſs to believe in the ſame Maſter. But I pity them much; having the ſame aſſurance,
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:029861_0287_0FE2AC26264954A0"/>that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and that no Romaniſt can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſaved, according to the terms of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

               <p>Tueſd. 28. My mouth was opened, and my heart enlarged, ſtrongly to declare to above two thouſand people at Bradford, That <hi>the kingdom of God</hi> (within us) <hi>is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> At Bath I once more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Chriſt to juſtify the ungodly.</hi> In the evening I met my brother, juſt come from London. <hi>The Lord hath</hi> indeed <hi>done great things for us already.

                     </gap> us, but unto thy name be the praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſday 29. I rode with my brother to Wells and preached on, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> In the evening I ſummed up at the New-room, what I had ſaid at many times, from the beginning, of faith, holineſs and good works, as the root, the tree and the fruit, which God had joined, and man ought not to put aſunder.</p>
               <p>Friday, Aug. 31. I left Briſtol, and reached London, about eight on Sunday morning. In the afternoon I heard a ſermon wherein it was aſſerted, that our repentance was not ſincere, but feigned and hypocritical, 1. If we relapſed into ſin, <hi>ſoon after</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting: eſpecially if 2. We did not <hi>avoid all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of ſin, or if 3. We <hi>relapſed frequently;</hi> and moſt of all, if 4. Our hearts were <hi>hardened</hi> thereby. O what a hypocrite was I (if this be ſo) for near twice ten years! But I know it is not ſo. I know every
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:029861_0289_0FE2AC29493C6910"/>one <hi>under the law,</hi> is even as I was. Every one when he begins to ſee his fallen ſtate, and to feel the wrath of God abiding on him, relapſes into the ſin that moſt eaſily beſets him, <hi>ſoon after</hi> repenting of it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he avoids, and at many other times cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade himſelf to <hi>avoid the occaſions</hi> of it. Hence his relapſes are <hi>frequent,</hi> and of conſequence his <hi>heart is hardened</hi> more and more. And yet all this time, he is <hi>ſincerely</hi> ſtriving againſt ſin. He can ſay <hi>unſeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without hypocriſy, the thing which I do, I approve not; the evil which I would not, that I do. To will is</hi> even then <hi>preſent with</hi> him; <hi>but how to perform that which is good, he finds not.</hi> Nor can he, with all his <hi>ſincerity</hi> avoid any one of theſe four marks of <hi>hypocriſy,</hi> till <hi>being juſtified by faith, he hath peace with God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This helpleſs ſtate I took occaſion to deſcribe at Kennington, to eight or ten thouſand people, from thoſe words of the pſalmiſt, <hi>Innumerable troubles are come about me; my ſine have taken ſuch hold upon me, that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. Sept. 3. I talked largely with my mother, who told me, that till a ſhort time ſince, ſhe had ſcarce heard ſuch a thing mentioned, as the having forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins now, or God's Spirit bearing witneſs with our ſpirit: much leſs did ſhe imagine, that this was the common privilege of all true believers. "There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaid ſhe) I never durſt aſk for it myſelf. But two or three weeks ago, while my ſon Hall was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing thoſe words, in delivering the cup to me, <hi>The blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which was given for</hi> thee; the words ſtruck through my heart, and I knew God for Chriſt's ſake had forgiven <hi>me</hi> all <hi>my</hi> ſins."</p>
               <p>I aſked, Whether her father (Dr. Anneſley) had not the ſame faith? And whether ſhe had not heard
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:029861_0290_0FE2AC2AD91F9C30"/>him preach it to others? She anſwered, "He had it himſelf, and declared a little before his death, that for more than forty years, he had no darkneſs, no fear, no doubt at all, of his being <hi>accepted in the Beloved.</hi> But that nevertheleſs, ſhe did not remember to have heard him preach, no, not once, explicitly upon it: whence ſhe ſuppoſed he alſo looked upon it as the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar bleſſing of a <hi>few,</hi> not as promiſed to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God."</p>
               <p>Both at Mr. B—'s at ſix, and at Dowgate-hill at eight, were many more than the houſes could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Several perſons who were then convinced of ſin, came to me the next morning. One came alſo, who had been mourning long, and earneſtly deſired us to pray with her. We had ſcarce begun, when the enemy began to tear her, ſo that ſhe ſcreamed out as in the pangs of death. But his time was ſhort: for within a quarter of an hour, ſhe was full of the peace that paſſeth all underſtanding.</p>
               <p>I afterwards called on Mrs. E—r, with whom was one lately come from Briſtol, in deep anguiſh of ſpirit. We cried to God, and he ſoon declared his ſalvation, ſo that both their mouths were filled with his praiſe.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to a poor woman who had been long in deſpair. I was glad to meet with Mrs. R— there; the perſon mentioned in Mr. Whitefield's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who after three years madneſs (ſo called) was ſo deeply convinced of ſin at Beach-lane, and ſoon after rejoiced in God <hi>her</hi> Saviour.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 6. I was ſent for by one who began to <hi>feel</hi> herſelf a ſinner. But a fine lady unexpectedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, there was ſcarce room for <hi>me</hi> to ſpeak. The fourth perſon in the company was a poor unbred girl; who beginning to tell what God had done for her ſoul, the others looked one at another, as in amaze, but did not open their mouths. I then exhorted them,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:029861_0291_0FE2AC328674A238"/>not to ceaſe from crying to God, till they too could ſay, as ſhe did, "My beloved is mine, and I am his: I am as ſure of it, as that I am alive. For his ſpirit bears witneſs with my ſpirit, that I am a child of God."</p>
               <p>Sund. 9. I declared to about ten thouſand in Moorfields, what they muſt do to be ſaved. My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went with us about five to Kennington, where were ſuppoſed to be twenty thouſand people. I again inſiſted on that foundation of all our hope, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> From Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington I went to a ſociety at Lambeth. The houſe being filled, the reſt ſtood in the garden. The deep attention they ſhewed gave me a good hope, that they will not all be forgetful hearers.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to our ſociety at Fetter-lane, and exhorted them to love one another. The want of love was a general complaint. We laid it open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord. We ſoon found, he had ſent us an anſwer of peace. Evil ſurmiſings vaniſhed away. The flame kindled again as at the firſt, and our hearts were knit together.</p>
               <p>Mond. 10. I accepted a preſſing invitation to go to Plaiſtow. At five in the evening I expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and at eight again. But moſt of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were very quiet and unconcerned. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore I ſpoke ſtronger words. But it is only the voice of the Son of God, which is able to wake the dead.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 12. In the evening at Fetter-lane, I deſcribed the life of faith, and many who had fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied themſelves ſtrong therein, found they were no more than new-born babes. At eight I exhorted our brethren to keep cloſe to the church, and to all the ordinances of God, and to aim only at liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="295" facs="unknown:029861_0292_0FE2AC3433F112C8"/>
Thurſ. 13. A ſerious clergyman deſired to know, in what points we differ from the church of England? I anſwered, "To the beſt of my knowledge, in none: the doctrines we preach, are the doctrines of the church of England: indeed the fundamental doctrines of the church, clearly laid down, both in her prayers, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and homilies."</p>
               <p>He aſked, in what points then do you differ from the other clergy of the church of England? I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "In none from that part of the clergy who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the doctrines of the church; but from that part of the clergy who diſſent from the church (though they own it not) I differ in the points following:</p>
               <p>Firſt, They ſpeak of juſtification, either as the ſame thing with ſanctification, or as ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon it. I believe juſtification to be wholly diſtinct from ſanctification, and neceſſarily antecedent to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They ſpeak of our own holineſs or good works, as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our juſtification; or, that <hi>for the ſake of which, on account of which</hi> we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God. I believe, neither our own holineſs nor good works, are any part of the cauſe of our juſtification; but that the death and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are the whole and ſole cauſe of it; or, that <hi>for the ſake of which, on account of which,</hi> we are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified before God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They ſpeak of good works, as a <hi>condition</hi> of juſtification, neceſſarily previous to it. I believe no good work can be previous to juſtification, nor conſequently a condition of it: but that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (being till that hour ungodly, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of doing any good work) by faith alone, faith without works, faith (though producing all, yet) including no good work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="unknown:029861_0293_0FE2AC35C85D5B80"/>
Fourthly, They ſpeak of <hi>ſanctification</hi> (or holineſs) as if it were an outward thing, as if it conſiſted chiefly, if not wholly, in theſe two points, 1. The doing no harm, 2. The doing good (as it is called) i. e. The uſing the means of grace, and helping our neighbour.</p>
               <p>I believe it to be, an inward thing, namely, <hi>The life of God in the ſoul of man; a participation of the divine nature; the mind that was in Chriſt;</hi> or, <hi>the renewal of our heart, after the image of him that created us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, They ſpeak of the <hi>new birth,</hi> as an <hi>outward</hi> thing, as if it were no more than baptiſm; or, at moſt, a change from <hi>outward wickedneſs</hi> to <hi>outward goodneſs;</hi> from a <hi>vicious</hi> to (what is called) a <hi>virtuous</hi> life. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be an inward thing; a change from inward wickedneſs to inward goodneſs; an entire change of our inmoſt nature from the image of the devil (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are born) to the image of God: a change from the love of the creature to the love of the Creator, from earthly and ſenſual, to heavenly and holy affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: in a word, a change from the <hi>tempers</hi> of the ſpirits of darkneſs, to thoſe of the angels of God in heaven.</p>
               <p>There is therefore a wide, eſſential, fundamental, irreconcileable difference between us: ſo that if they ſpeak the truth as it is in Jeſus, I am found a falſe witneſs before God. But if I teach the way of God in truth, they are blind leaders of the blind.</p>
               <p>Sund. 16. I preached at Moorfields to about ten thouſand, and at Kennington common to I believe near twenty thouſand, on thoſe words of the calmer Jews to St. Paul, <hi>We deſire to hear of thee what thou thinkeſt: for as concerning this ſect, we know that every where it is ſpoken againſt.</hi> At both places I deſcribed the real difference between what is generally called Chriſtianity, and the true <hi>old Chriſtianity,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               </p>
               <p>Mond. 17. I preached again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>are thoſe that mourn.</hi> It pleaſed God to give us in that hour, two living inſtances of that piercing ſenſe both of the guilt and power of ſin, that dread of the wrath of God, and that full conviction of man's inability either to remove the power, or atone for the guilt of ſin (called by the world deſpair) in which properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that poverty of ſpirit and mourning which are the gate of Chriſtian bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 18. A young woman came to us at Iſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in ſuch an agony as I have ſeldom ſeen. Her ſorrow and fear were too big for utterance; ſo that after a few w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ds, her ſtrength as well as her heart failing, ſhe ſunk down to the ground. Only her ſighs and her groans ſhewed ſhe was yet alive. We cried unto God in her behalf. We claimed the promiſes made to the weary and heavy-laden: and he did not caſt out our prayer. She ſaw her Saviour, as it were, crucified before her eyes. She laid hold on him by faith, and her ſpirit revived.</p>
               <p>At Mr. B—'s at ſix, I was enabled earneſtly to call all the weary and heavy-laden: and at Mr. C—'s at eight, when many roared aloud; ſome of whom ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed to be comforted, till they ſhould feel their ſouls at reſt in the blood of the Lamb, and have his love ſhed abroad in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 20. Mrs. C— being in deep heavineſs, had deſired me to meet her this afternoon. She had long earneſtly deſired to receive the holy communion, having an unaccountably ſtrong perſuaſion, "That God would manifeſt himſelf to her therein, and give reſt to her ſoul." But her heavineſs being now greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, Mr. D—e gave her that fatal advice, "Not to communicate <hi>till ſhe had</hi> living faith." This ſtill added to her perplexity. Yet at length ſhe reſolved
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:029861_0295_0FE2AC3F4AE33758"/>to obey God father than man. And <hi>he was made known unto her in breaking of bread.</hi> In that moment ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> her load removed, ſhe knew ſhe was accepted in the beloved; and all the time I was expounding at Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Frid. 21. Another of Dr. Monro's patients came to deſire my advice. I found no reaſon to believe ſhe had been any otherwiſe <hi>mad</hi> than every one is, who is deeply convinced of ſin. And I cannot doubt, but if ſhe will truſt in the living God, he will <hi>give medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to heal her ſickneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sund. 23. I declared to about ten thouſand in Moorfields, with great enlargement of ſpirit, <hi>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> At Kennington I enforced to about twenty thouſand, that great truth, <hi>One thing is needful.</hi> Thence I went to Lambeth and ſhewed (to the amazement, it ſeemed, of many who were preſent) how <hi>he that is born of God doth not commit ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mond. 24. I preached once more at Plaiſtow, and took my leave of the people of that place. In my return, a perſon galloping ſwiftly, rode full againſt me, and overthrew both man and horſe: but without any hurt to either. Glory be to him who <hi>ſaves both man and beaſt!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 25. After dining with one of our brethren who was married this day, I went (as uſual) to the ſociety at St. James's, weary and weak in body. But God ſtrengthened me for his own work; as he did at ſix at Mr. B—'s; and at eight in Wincheſter-yard, where it was believed were preſent eleven or twelve hundred perſons: to whom I declared, if <hi>they had nothing to pay, God</hi> would <hi>frankly forgive them</hi> all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="unknown:029861_0296_0FE2AC40D794F108"/>
Thurſ. 27. I went in the afternoon to a ſociety at Deptford, and thence at ſix came to Turner's-hall; which holds (by computation) two thouſand perſons. The preſs both within and without was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. In the beginning of the expounding, there being a large vault beneath, the main beam which ſupported the floor, broke. The floor immediately ſunk, which occaſioned much noiſe and confuſion among the people. But, two or three days before a man had filled the vault with hogſheads of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. So that the floor, after ſinking a foot or two, reſted upon them, and I went on without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption.</p>
               <p>Frid. 28. I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But upon prayer made for her, ſhe was inſtantly relieved, and reſtored to a found mind.</p>
               <p>Mond. October 1. I rode to Oxford; and found a few who had not yet forſaken the aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together: to whom I explained that <hi>holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 2. I went to many, who once heard the word with joy; but <hi>when the ſun aroſe, the ſeed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered away.</hi> Yet ſome ſtill <hi>deſired</hi> to follow their Lord. But the world ſtood fawning or threatening between them. In the evening I ſhewed them the tender mercies of God, and his readineſs ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. The tears ran down many of their cheeks. O thou lover of ſouls, ſeek and ſave that which is loſt!</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 3. I had a little leiſure to take a view of the ſhattered condition of things here. The poor priſoners both in the caſtle and in the city priſon, had
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:029861_0297_0FE2AC42663C0278"/>now none that cared for their ſouls, none to inſtruct, adviſe, comfort and build them up in the knowledge and love of the Lord Jeſus. None was left to viſit the work-houſes, where alſo we uſed to meet with the moſt moving objects of compaſſion. Our little ſchool, where about twenty poor children, at a time, had been taught for many years, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke up; there being none now, either to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or to attend it. And moſt of thoſe <hi>in the town,</hi> who were once knit together, and ſtrengthened one another's hands in God, were torn aſunder and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad. <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to lay to thy hand!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At eleven, a little company of us met to intreat God, <hi>for the remnant that was left.</hi> He immediately gave us a token for good. One who had been long in the gall of bitterneſs, full of wrath, ſtrife and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, particularly againſt one whom ſhe had once ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly loved, roſe up and ſhewed the change God had wrought in her ſoul, by falling upon her neck, and with many tears kiſſing her. The ſame ſpirit we found reviving in others alſo; ſo that we left them, not without hope, that the ſeed which had been ſown even here, <hi>ſhall take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About ſix in the evening I came to Burford: and at ſeven preached to, it was judged, twelve or fifteen hundred people, on, <hi>Chriſt made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many <hi>approved</hi> of what they had heard, that they might not <hi>reſt in that approbation,</hi> I explained an hour or two after the holineſs of a chriſtian: and in the morning I ſhewed the way to this holineſs, by giving both the falſe and the true anſwer to that important queſtion, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About three in the afternoon, I came to Mr. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Seward's, at Bengeworth, near Eveſham. At
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:029861_0298_0FE2AC4412DEFA78"/>five I expounded in his houſe (part of the xiiith chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſt of Corinthians) and at ſeven in the ſchool-houſe, where I invited all who <hi>had nothing to pay,</hi> to come and accept of free forgiveneſs. In the morning I preached near Mr. Seward's houſe to a ſmall, ſerious congregation, on thoſe words, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening I reached Glouceſter. Sat. 6. At five in the evening I explained to about a thouſand people, the nature, the cauſe, and the condition or inſtrument of juſtification, from theſe words, <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his ſaith is counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sand. 7. A few, I truſt, out of two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, were awakened by the explanation of thoſe words, <hi>God hath not given unto you the ſpirit of bondage again, to fear; but he hath given unto you the ſpirit of adoption, wherely we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> About ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven I preached at Runwick, ſeven miles from Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter. The church was much crouded, though a thouſand or upwards ſtayed in the church-yard. In the afternoon I explained further the ſame words, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> I believe ſome thouſands were then preſent, more than had been in the morning. O what a harveſt is here! When will it pleaſe our Lord, to ſend more labourers into his harveſt?</p>
               <p>Between five and ſix I called on all who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (about three thouſand) at Stanley, on a little green near the town, to accept of Chriſt, as their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> I was ſtrengthened to ſpeak as I never did before, and continued ſpeaking near two hours: the darkneſs of the night, and the little lightning not leſſening the number, but increaſing the ſeriouſneſs of the hearers. I concluded the day by expounding part of our Lord's ſermon on the mount, to a ſmall, ſerious company at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mond. 8. About eight I reached Hampton-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nine or ten miles from Glouceſter. There were, it was computed, five or ſix thouſand perſons. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them all, to come unto God, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay. I could gladly have ſtayed longer with this loving people: but I was now ſtraitened for time. After ſermon I therefore haſtened away, and in the evening came to Briſtol.</p>
               <p>Tueſ. 9. My brother and I rode to Bradford. Finding there had been a general miſrepreſentation of his laſt ſermon, as if he had aſſerted reprobation therein, whereby many were greatly offended; he was conſtrained to explain himſelf on that head, and to ſhew in plain and ſtrong words, that God <hi>willeth all men to be ſaved.</hi> Some were equally offended at this. But whether men will hear or whether they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; we may not <hi>ſhun to declare</hi> unto them, <hi>all the counſel of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At our return in the evening not being permitted to meet at Weaver's hall, we met in a large room on Temple-backs, where (having gone through the ſermon on the mount and the epiſtle of St. John) I began that of St. James, that thoſe who had already learned the true nature of inward holineſs, might be more fully inſtructed in outward holineſs, without which alſo we cannot ſee the Lord.</p>
               <p>Wedneſ. 10. Finding many to be in heavineſs, whom I had left full of peace and joy, I exhorted them at Baptiſt-mills, to <hi>look unto Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith.</hi> We poured out our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before him in the evening, and found that he was again with us of a truth. One came to us ſoon after I was gone home, who was ſtill in grievous darkneſs. But we commended her cauſe to God, and he immediately reſtored the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

Thurſ. 11. We were comforted by the coming in of one who was a notorious drunkard and common ſwearer. But he is waſhed, and old things are paſſed away. <hi>Such power belongeth unto God.</hi> In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lord roſe on many who were wounded, <hi>with healing in his wings:</hi> and others who till then were careleſs and at eaſe, felt the two-edged ſword that cometh out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>One of theſe ſhewed the agony of her ſoul by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud to God for help, to the great offence of many, who eagerly <hi>rebuked her that ſhe ſhould hold her peace.</hi> She continued in great torment all night, finding no reſt either of ſoul or body. But while a few were praying for her in the morning, God deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out of her diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Frid. 12. We had freſh occaſion to obſerve the darkneſs which was fallen on many who lately rejoiced in God. But he did not long hide his face from them. On Wedneſday the ſpirit of many revived: on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening many more found him in whom they had believed, to be <hi>a preſent help in time of trouble.</hi> And never do I remember the power of God to have been more eminently preſent than this morning: when a cloud of witneſſes declared his <hi>breaking the gates of braſs, and ſmiting the bars of iron in ſunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I could not but be under ſome concern, with regard to one or two perſons, who were tormented in an unaccountable manner, and ſeemed to be indeed lunatic as well as <hi>ſore vexed.</hi> But while I was muſing, what would be the iſſue of theſe things, the anſwer I received from the word of God was, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after I was ſent for to one of thoſe, who was ſo ſtrangely torn by the devil, that I almoſt wondered her relations did not ſay, "Much religion hath made thee mad." We prayed God to bruiſe Satan under
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:029861_0301_0FE2AC511B82D4D8"/>her feet. Immediately we had the petition we aſked of him. She cried out vehemently, "He is gone, he is gone!" And was filled with the ſpirit of love and of a found mind. I have ſeen her many times ſince, ſtrong in the Lord. When I aſked abruptly, "What do you deſire now?" She anſwered, "Heaven." I aſked, "What is in your heart?" She replied, "God." I aſked, "But how is your heart when any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes you?" She ſaid, "By the grace of God, I am not provoked at any thing. All the things of this world paſs by me as ſhadows." <hi>Ye have ſeen the and of the Lord.</hi> Is he not very pitiful and of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy?</p>
               <p>We had a refreſhing meeting at one with many of our ſociety; who fail not to obſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At four I preached near the Fiſh-ponds (at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of one who had long laboured under the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it) on the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that is, according to the plain ſcriptural account, <hi>The openly and maliciouſly aſſerting, that the miracles of Chriſt were wrought by the power of the devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sat. 13. I was with one, who being in deep an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſpirit, had been the day before to aſk a clergyman's advice. He told her, "Her head was out of order, and ſhe muſt go and take phyſic." In the evening we called upon God for medicine, to heal thoſe that were <hi>broken in heart.</hi> And five who had long been in the ſhadow of death, <hi>knew they were paſſed from death unto life.</hi>

The ſharp froſt in the morning, Sunday 14, did not prevent about 1500, from being at Hannam, to whom I called, in the words of our gracious Maſter. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> In the evening we claimed and received the promiſe for ſeveral who were <hi>weary and heavy-laden.</hi>

               <p>Mond. 15. Upon a preſſing invitation, ſome time ſince received, I ſet out for Wales. About four in the afternoon, I preached on a little green, at the foot of the Devauden (a high hill, two or three miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Chepſtow) to three or four hundred plain people, on, <hi>Chriſt our wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption.</hi> After ſermon, one who I truſt is an old diſciple of Chriſt, willingly received us into his houſe: whither many following, I ſhewed them their need of a Saviour, from theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit.</hi> In the morning I deſcribed more fully the way to ſalvation. <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> and then taking leave of my friendly hoſt, before two came to Abergavenny.</p>
               <p>I felt in myſelf a ſtrong averſion to preaching here. However I went to Mr. W — (the perſon in whoſe ground Mr. Whitefield preached) to deſire the uſe of it. He ſaid. "With all his heart—if the miniſter was not willing to let me have the uſe of the church;" after whoſe refuſal (for I wrote a line to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately) he invited me to his houſe.

                  </gap>roſt was ſharper than before. However five or ſix hundred people ſtayed, while I explained the nature of that ſalvation which is through faith, yea, faith alone: and the nature of that living faith, through which cometh this ſalvation. About noon I came to Uſk, where I preached to a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor people, on thoſe words, <hi>The Son of man is come, to ſave that which is loſt.</hi> One grey-headed man wept and trembled exceedingly: and another who was there (I have ſince heard) as well as two or three who were at the Devauden, <hi>are gone quite diſtracted:</hi> that is, they mourn and refuſe to be comforted, till they <hi>have redemption through his blood.</hi>

               <p>When I came to Ponty-pool in the afternoon, being unable to procure any more convenient place, I ſtood in the ſtreet, and cried aloud to five or ſix hundred at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive hearers, To <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus,</hi> that they might <hi>be ſaved.</hi> In the evening I ſhewed his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſave all who deſire to come unto God through him.

               </p>
               <p>Thurſd. 18. I endeavoured to cut them off from all falſe ſupports and vain dependencies, by explaining and applying that fundamental truth, <hi>To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we were at the Devauden on Monday, a poor woman who lived ſix miles off, came thither in great heavineſs. She was deeply convinced of ſin, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it; but found no way to eſcape from it. She walked from thence to Abergavenny on Tueſday, and on Wedneſday from Abergavenny to Uſk. Thence in the afternoon ſhe came to Ponty-pool; where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween twelve and one in the morning, after a ſharp conteſt in her ſoul, our Lord got unto himſelf the victory: and the love of God was ſhed abroad in her heart, teſtifying that her ſins were forgiven her. She
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:029861_0304_0FE2AC5E44105C08"/>went on her way rejoicing to Cardiff; whither I came in the afternoon. And about five (the miniſter not being willing I ſhould preach in the church on a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) I preached in the Shire-hall (a large convenient place) on <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Several were there who laboured much to make a diſturbance.

               </p>
               <p>Friday 19. I preached in the morning at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, on <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> To the moſt inſenſible, ill-behaved people I have ever ſeen in Wales. One ancient man, during a great part of the ſermon, curſed and ſwore almoſt inceſſantly: and towards the concluſion took up a great ſtone, which he many times attempted to throw. But that he could not do. —Such the champions! Such the arms againſt field-preaching!</p>
               <p>At four I preached at the Shire-hall of Cardiff again, where many gentry, I found were preſent.</p>
               <p>Such freedom of ſpeech I have ſeldom had, as was given me in explaining thoſe words. <hi>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> At ſix almoſt the whole town (I was informed) came together, to whom I explained the ſix laſt beatitudes, but my heart was ſo enlarged, I knew not how to give over, ſo that we continued three hours. O may the ſeed they have received, have its fruit unto holineſs, and in the end, everlaſting life!</p>
               <p>Sat. 20. I returned to Briſtol. I have ſeen no part of England ſo pleaſant for ſixty or ſeventy miles together, as thoſe parts of Wales I have been in. And moſt of the inhabitants are indeed <hi>ripe for the goſpel.</hi> I mean (if the expreſſion appear ſtrange) they
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:029861_0305_0FE2AC5FD1E1F508"/>are <hi>earneſtly deſirous</hi> of being inſtructed in it: and as <hi>utterly ignorant</hi> of it they are, as any Creek or Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kee Indians. I do not mean they are ignorant of the name of Chriſt. Many of them can ſay both the Lord's prayer and the belief. Nay, and ſome, all the catechiſm: but take them out of the road of what they have learned by ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and they know no more (nine in ten of thoſe with whom I converſed) either of goſpel ſalvation, or of that faith, whereby alone we can be ſaved, than Chicali or Tomo Chachi. Now, what ſpirit is he of, who had rather theſe poor creatures ſhoule periſh for lack of knowledge, than that they ſhould be ſaved, even by the exhortations of Howel Harris, or an <hi>itinerant</hi> preacher?</p>
               <p>Finding a ſlackneſs creeping in among them who had begun to run well, on Sunday 21, both in the morning and afternoon, I enforced thoſe words, <hi>As ye have received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> In the evening I endeavoured to quicken them farther, by deſcribing <hi>pure and undefiled religion:</hi> and the next day, to encourage them in purſuing it, by enforcing thoſe words of our bleſſed Maſter, <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation; but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſ. 23. In riding to Bradford, I read over Mr. Law's book on the new-birth: philoſophical, ſpeculative, precarious; Behmeniſh, void and vain!
<q>O what a fall is there!</q>
At eleven I preached at Bearfield to about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, on the nature of the ſpirit of bondage, and of adoption.</p>
               <p>Returning in the evening, I was exceedingly preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go back to a young woman in Kingſwood. (The fact I nakedly relate, and leave every man to his own judgment of it.) I went. She was nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:029861_0306_0FE2AC615E034DC8"/>or twenty years old, but (it ſeems) could not write or read. I found her on the bed, two or three perſons holding her. It was a terrible ſight. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, horror and deſpair, above all deſcription, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in her pale face. The thouſand diſtortions of her whole body ſhewed, how the dogs of hell were gnawing her heart. The ſhrieks intermixed were ſcarce to be endured. But her ſtony eyes could not weep. She ſcreamed out, as ſoon as words could find their way, "I am damned, damned; loſt for ever. Six days ago you might have helped me. But it is paſt. I am the devil's now. I have given myſelf to him. His I am. Him I muſt ſerve. With him I muſt go to hell. I will be his. I will ſerve him. I will go with him to hell. I cannot be ſaved. I will not be ſaved. I muſt, I will, I will be damned." She then began praying to the devil. We began <q>"Arm of the Lord, awake, awake!"</q> She immediately ſunk down as aſleep; but as ſoon as we left off, broke out again, with inexpreſſible vehemence, "Stony hearts, break! I am a warning to you. Break, break, poor, ſtony hearts! Will you not break? What can be done more for ſtony hearts? I am damned, that you may be ſaved. Now break, now break poor ſtony hearts! You need not be damned, though I muſt." She then fixed her eyes on the corner of the cieling and ſaid, "There he is, ay, there he is, Come, good devil, come. Take me away. You ſaid, you would daſh my brains out. Come, do it quickly. I am your's. I will be your's. Come juſt now. Take me away." We interrupted her by calling again upon God: on which ſhe ſunk down as before: and another young woman began to roar out as loud as ſhe had done. My brother now came in, it being about nine o'clock. We continued
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:029861_0307_0FE2AC69D214B920"/>in prayer till paſt eleven; when God in a moment ſpoke peace into the ſoul, firſt of the firſt torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then of the other. And they both joined in ſinging praiſe to him, who had ſtilled the enemy and the avenger.</p>
               <p>Wed. 24. I preached at Baptiſt-mills on thoſe words of St. Paul, ſpeaking in the perſon of one <hi>under the law</hi> (that is, ſtill <hi>carnal, and ſold under ſin,</hi> though groaning for deliverance) <hi>I know that in me dwelleth no good thing.</hi> A poor woman told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>I does hope as my huſband wont hinder me any more. For I minded he did ſhiver every bone of him, and the tears ran down his cheeks like the rain.</hi> I warned our little ſociety in the evening, To beware of levity, ſlackneſs in good works, and deſpiſing little things; which had cauſed many to fall again into bondage.</p>
               <p>Thurſ. 25. I was ſent for to one in Briſtol, who was taken ill the evening before. (This fact too I will ſimply relate, ſo far as I was an ear, or eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.) She lay on the ground furiouſly gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her teeth, and after a while roared aloud. It was not eaſy for three or four perſons to hold her, eſpecially when the name of Jeſus was named. We prayed; the violence of her ſymptoms ceaſed, though without a complete deliverance.</p>
               <p>In the evening, being ſent for to her again, I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, indeed afraid to go: thinking it would not avail, unleſs ſome who were ſtrong in the faith, were to wreſtle with God for her. I opened my teſtament on thoſe words, <hi>I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth.</hi> I ſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>proved and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. She began ſcreaming before I came into the room; then broke out into a horrid laughter, mixed with blaſphemy, grievous to hear. One who from many circumſtances apprehended a preter-natural agent to be concerned in this, aſking, "How didſt thou dare to enter into a Chriſtian?" Was anſwered, "She is
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:029861_0308_0FE2AC6BC1039138"/>not a Chriſtian. She is mine." Q. "Doſt thou not tremble at the name of Jeſus?" No words followed, but ſhe ſhrunk back and trembled exceedingly. Q. "Art thou not increaſing thy own damnation?" It was anſwered faintly, "Ay, ay:" which was followed by freſh curſing and blaſpheming.</p>
               <p>My brother coming in, ſhe cried out, "Preacher! Field-preacher! I do not love field-preaching." This was repeated two hours together, with ſpitting and all the expreſſions of ſtrong averſion.</p>
               <p>We left her at twelve, but called again about noon, on Friday 27. And now it was that God ſheweth, he heareth prayer. All her pangs ceaſed in a moment. She was filled with peace, and knew that the ſon of wickedneſs was departed from her.</p>
               <p>Saturday 28. I was ſent for to Kingſwood again, to one of thoſe who had been ſo ill before. A violent rain began juſt as I ſet out, ſo that I was thoroughly wet in a few minutes. Juſt at that time the woman (then three miles off) cried out, "Yonder comes Weſley, galloping as faſt as he can." When I was come, I was quite cold and dead, and fitter for ſleep than prayer She burſt out into a horrid laughter and ſaid, "No power, no power; no faith, no faith. She is mine.

               <p>Sund. 28. I preached once more at Bradford at one in the afternoon.

Their cries and groans were too horrid to be borne: till one of them in a tone not to be expreſſed, ſaid, "Where is your faith now? Come, go to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

               <p>We continued in prayer till near one, when S— <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Six or ſeven were deeply convinced of their unfaithfulneſs to God, and two filled again with his love. But poor Mary W— remained as one without hope. Her ſoul refuſed comfort. She could neither pray herſelf, nor bear to hear us. At laſt ſhe cried out, Give me the book and I will ſing. She began giving out line by line (but with ſuch an accent as art could never reach.)</p>

               <p>Here we were obliged to interrupt her; we again betook ourſelves to prayer, and her heart was eaſed, though not ſet at liberty.</p>

                        <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>AS I wrote the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>conſiderations</hi> [in No. 25. of <hi>Country Common-Senſe</hi>] with an eye to Mr. Whitefield, yourſelf and your oppoſers, from a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire to do ſome ſervice to Chriſtianity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>imperfect</hi> notions I had at that time of the real merits of the cauſe: I at the ſame time reſolved, to take any opportunity that ſhould offer for my <hi>better</hi> information.</p>
                     <p>On this principle it was, that I made one of your audience, Oct. 23, at Bradford. And becauſe I thought I could form the beſt judgment of you and your doctrines from your ſermon, I reſolved to hear that firſt: which was the reaſon, that although by accident, I was at the ſame houſe, and walked two miles with you, to the place you preached at, I ſpoke little or nothing to you. I muſt confeſs, Sir, that the diſcourſe you made that day, wherein you preſſed your hearers in the cloſeſt manner, and with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a true miniſter of the goſpel, not to ſtop at <hi>faith</hi> ONLY, but to add to it <hi>all virtues,</hi> and to ſhew forth their <hi>faith,</hi> by every kind of <hi>good works,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of the great wrong done you by a public report, common in people's mouth, that you preach <hi>faith</hi> without <hi>works.</hi> For, that is the only ground of <hi>prejudice</hi> which any true Chriſtian can have: and is the ſenſe in which your adverſaries would take your words, when they cenſure them. For that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> by faith ONLY, is the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his apoſtles, and the doctrine of the church of England. I am aſhamed, that after having lived twenty-nine years, ſince my <hi>baptiſm</hi> into this faith, I ſhould ſpeak of it in the lame, unfaithful, I may ſay, <hi>falſe</hi> manner I have done in the paper above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned! What mere <hi>darkneſs</hi> is man, when truth bideth her face from him!</p>
                     <p>

Man is by nature a <hi>ſinner,</hi> the child of the <hi>devil,</hi> under God's <hi>wrath,</hi> in a flate of <hi>damnation.</hi> The Son of God took pity on this our miſery: he made himſelf <hi>man,</hi> he made himſelf <hi>ſin</hi> for us; that is, he hath borne the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of our ſin, the chaſtiſement of <hi>our</hi> peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed. To receive this boundleſs mercy, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefit, we muſt have faith in our Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and through him in God.—But then, true faith is not a lifeleſs principle, as your adverſaries ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, to underſtand it. They and you mean quite another thing by <hi>ſaith.</hi> They mean, A bare believing, that Jeſus is the Chriſt. You mean a living, growing, purifying principle, which is the root both of inward and outward holineſs; both of <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>good works:</hi> without which no man can have faith, at leaſt no other than a dead faith.</p>
                     <p>This, Sir, you explained in your ſermon at Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Sund. Oct. 28, to near ten thouſand people, who all ſtood to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> you, with awful ſilence and great attention. I have ſince reflected, how much good the clergy might do, if inſtead of <hi>ſhunning,</hi> they would come to hear and converſe with you; and in their churches and pariſhes, would farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force thoſe <hi>catholic doctrines</hi> which you preach: and which I am glad to ſee have ſuch a ſurpriſing <hi>good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> on great numbers of ſouls.</p>
                     <p>I think indeed, too many clergymen are culpable, in that they do not inform themſelves better, of Mr. Whitefield, yourſelf and your doctrines, from your own mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: I am perſuaded, if they did this with a Chriſtian ſpirit, the differences between you would ſoon be at an end. Nay, I think, thoſe whoſe <hi>flocke</hi> reſort ſo much to hear you, ought to do it, out of their <hi>paſtoral duty</hi> to them: that if you preach <hi>good doctrine.</hi> they may edify them, on the impreſſions ſo
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:029861_0313_0FE2AC7B2978A748"/>viſibly made by your ſermons, or if <hi>evil,</hi> they may reclaim them from error.—</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this letter with putting you in mind, in all your ſermons, writings and practice, <hi>nakedly</hi> to follow the <hi>naked</hi> Jeſus: I mean, to preach the <hi>pure doctrine</hi> of the goſpel without reſpect of perſons or things. Many <hi>preachers,</hi> many <hi>reformers,</hi> many <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries,</hi> have fallen by not obſerving this; by not having continually in mind, <hi>Whoever ſhall break the leaſt of theſe commandments, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
