            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is an obſervation I long have made, that the great when they have power, will often make a wrong uſe of it, and that thoſe who are inferior in rank, have very little chance of juſtice when oppoſed to them; as riches furniſh a variety of means both to elude and oppoſe, the effective force of the law. Though every one ought to have his full portion of juſtice, yet I believe no one will doubt, that it is not generally the caſe; the rich can elude juſtice by giving great bail, and feeing lawyers high, who by that and other methods, protract the affair till the action dies away<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by one means or another; there is nothing incomprehenſible in all this—If the ſmall fry get in the leaſt entramelled in the meſhes of the law, they are generally faſtened in the net, and often times puniſhed wrongfully. For as Hudibras obſerves,
<q>
                  <l>For juſtice though it puniſh crimes,</l>
                  <l>Stumbles on the innocent ſometimes.</l>
               </q>
And what a horrid thing it is for an innocent man to ſuffer for another's guilt—the horror of ſuch a thing, none but an innocent man can feel. The great in general only think for themſelves,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035752_0003_100663BE90F942B8"/>
and very ſeldom extend their thoughts to the happineſs and welfare of any but themſelves—wrapt up in their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it would be a kind of degradation for them to deſcend to ſo low a thought. I have often obſerved the death of a great man, (and often a great villain), deplored as a national loſs; while the ingenious mechanic has been laid by on the ſhelf as of no advantage to the nation. But I would aſk, which are the greateſt benefit to a nation, drones or bees? If then the ingenious mechanic is ſuffered by a nation to be neglected, it muſt be a loſs to ſuch a nation, in the effect produced by ſuch neglect—to improve in arts, manufactures, and ſciences, has been eagerly purſued by the moſt Gothic and barbarous nations in the world, and ſhould the enlightened and improving Americans withold their ſupport and encouragement; ſhould it be their wiſh, after their generouſly holding out an aſſylum to foreigners, of ingenuity or otherwiſe, to turn upon them with coldneſs and diſdain; conſider the conſequences of ingenuity contemned, or ability diſdain'd; ſee I ſay, and examine what will be the ultimate conſequences to the nation by ſuch a procedure. <hi>Do</hi> not by ſuſpicious maneuvres, take advantage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <head>THE NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is a ſecret ſatisfaction to me, that the preſs is equally free to the meaneſt individual, as well as to the higheſt; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the preſs is not abuſed: but who depreſs and abuſe that freedom, more than the combinations who often have it in their power to do as they pleaſe. Under every conſideration and in every point of view, taking in my late unfortunate caſe and my mechanical profeſſion; I find there is no protection for me, for ſhould there be any robbery committed by opening locks, &amp;c. I am liable (from the nature of my profeſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I began my mechanical ſtudy at an early age, being only turned of eleven years, and after ſpending nearly fourteen years in London in different manufactories, and having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly ſtudied mathematic'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I however undertook the enterprize, and arrived in Philadelphia on the 25th November 1793, (and if ever there was a mechanical volunteer came into America, I certainly have a fair claim to the title).

Hill, I began buſineſs for myſelf, and after working ſome years with ſucceſs; (having produced twelve or fourteen branches that never had made their appearance here, and brought ſeveral to bear that were lying in a dorment ſtate), I was recommended to the Bank of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>That the conduct of the Bank of Pennſylvania, on the late robbery, cannot in my opinion, be pardoned either on the ſcore of public juſtice or national policy; but as the affair ſtands, the public ſtill entertain their ſuſpicion, and the matter remains unravelled, owing (if my ſuſpicions are well founded and my judgment right, though not competent in law to know) to a certain peculiar incomprehenſibility. As ſeveral glaring reports are in circulation, (which in the body of this work I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explain), and as perſons are generally the laſt to hear what materially concerns themſelves; I ſhall take notice of them, that ſuch ſuſpected characters may have an opportunity of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the rumour; that they may have it in their power to clear their conduct of the heavy ſuſpicion which is levelled againſt them. For my own part, I have a right to ſpeak, becauſe I ſuffered innocently; and as I am informed no legal ſteps can be taken to enforce a recompenſe for falſe and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ious men were ever liable to ſuffer, what appears to me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, malice, and injuſtice. The reader will obſerve, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was tempting and peculiarly titillating to a keen appetite; and by the devouring maw of ſome one ready to ſwallow ſuch a delicious morſel, many an innocent man has ſufferred: for the ſake of a great reward, I preſume in ſome meaſure, was the cauſe of part of my ſufferings; but my innocence has diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſuch, and given chagrin and diſappointment to the bittereſt (if not to ſay the moſt malicious) of my enemies. If the reward could have been obtained, I ſurmiſe whether or not my life might not have been at ſtake, by falſe repreſentations, legally atteſted, and a variety of other attempts combined. The law of this country, ſays, the Bank is juſtifiable in taking up any perſon and putting him in priſon when any accident happens to them: (for ſpeaking of the bank, it muſt be underſtood thoſe immediately in, and connected with it) provided the priſoner can be held to bail. The bank found no difficulty in this, as I could be held to ſuch bail as I could not command; and their power as a body, could form a thouſand different ways to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

my impriſonment; which they virtually (though I think rather viciouſly) effected. This being my caſe, my particular wiſh is to lay before my friends and fellow citizens, a ſtatement of the whole tranſaction; to ſhew them and the world at large, the cruel treatment I have received, and which I conceive is not to be exceeded if equaled, (conſidering the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uſe in which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered) by any civilized nation.</p>
            <p>FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>ABOUT the third of the month of May, 1797, I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making fixtures and preparations for the book vault, which was built on the firſt ſtory of the Bank of Pennſylvania. On the 7th of July following, I finiſhed two iron doors under the direction of one Samuel Robinſon, a carpenter, (belonging or working at aforeſaid Bank, as I ſuppoſe), I obſerved to him at that time, (and he has ſince acknowledged that I told him) the ſtupidity of making iron doors on that conſtruction, and at the ſame time telling him the inſecurity of the locks; and as he was entruſted with the whole charge of the work, it was his duty to inform the Preſident of the Bank of thoſe impediments I laid down to him at that early period. The lock of the inner door is a common iron rim lock, with two tumblers and a braſs bolt. The chief deſign of ſuch locks are for cabbin doors, as the ſalt water has more effect on iron bolts than on thoſe of braſs. The outer door lock is an old room door iron-rim lock, with the latches taken out (the latches are in my poſſeſſion to this day); and as this publication may no doubt reach Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where grand ſecurities are generally underſtood by bankers, merchants, and thoſe ingenious mechanics who manufacture the ſame; I only aſk, What muſt thoſe men think or ſay, to hear of a bank of ſuch magnitude being robbed, for even a compting houſe is a ſtrange thing there? but if rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, How can it be otherwiſe, or ſuſpected otherwiſe; when ſuch vaſt property is only under the ſecurity of a ten or twelve inch room door lock? It is not my buſineſs to deſcribe the plan of a bank lock—Neither is it my place to give a clear definition of any thing I manufacture, (not to ſay but I would do it), but I have been ſeveral times treated in this manner, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, After I have deſcribed the manner that ſuch and ſuch things were to be done, ſome paltry character carried off the plan elſewhere, and got it done in a bungling manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035752_0007_100663C8D0808C60"/>
Second, If you attempt to deſcribe the beſt mode of working, it is but very ſeldom liſtened to, and only anſwered in a low way, he or they only wanted a job for themſelves; and people who poſſeſs thoſe temporary ideas often reflect on the honeſt tradeſman who warns <hi>them</hi> of their <hi>danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the early part of 1798, I waited on Mr. Fox, Preſident of the Bank of Pennſylvania, by the deſire of Mr. Stocker, and as the ſubject of building a new Bank was then in agitation, I carried with me a box of wards; I only ſhewed him that work, but did not explain the utility of it—(let work ſhew itſelf when finiſhed). At this meeting there was Mr. Fox—Smith the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier, and myſelf. A converſation took place, opened by me. The converſation is as nearly as I can rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The robbery of the bank to the northward Mr. Fox and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perfectly agreed from report; that the inhabitants where this Bank is were divided, even private families were ſeparate in opinion. The Preſident and Caſhier were jealous of each other—the Preſident had one party, and the Caſhier had another party. Whether any perſon ever borrowed any thing from this converſation, I may be preſumed to entertain my apprehenſions from late circumſtances. The reader will pleaſe to obſerve, that I was not applied to for this iron door and lock, until ſometime after the robbery of the northern Bank.</p>
            <p>About the 4th or 5th of Auguſt, the Yellow Fever had aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an alarming appearance, and the citizens were removing with precipitation in all directions; I was at this time employed in making ſeveral pieces of work for the temporary removal of the Bank of Pennſylvania, to a large houſe adjoining; which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly occupied as a boarding houſe for young ladies: I was ſtill working under Robinſon the carpenter, who called at my ſhop and left word with my apprentice to ſtop the work, and that he would call and tell me what for. I waited a day or two—Being a little uneaſy. I went to Lodge Alley where the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were ſtill going on and found Robinſon; I aſked him why the work was ſtopped, his anſwer to me was, that he would <hi>put me up to it by and by,</hi> at the ſame time giving me ſtrict charge to take no notice to the bricklayers;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035752_0008_100663CC12208890"/>
however he never <hi>put me up</hi> to any thing, or his meaning for acting in this way. On Thurſday about the 9th or 10th of the ſame month, Robinſon brought two iron doors on a dray, (thoſe were the two doors which I made about a twelve month before) for the book vault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with the old rim locks, keys, &amp;c. the doors were to be altered in the following order, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the door which was on the outſide of the book vault was made the inſide of the caſh vault, and the inſide door of the former, was made the outſide of the latter, which was done by removing the hinges of each door to that fide which the locks were on; which was a complete reverſe of the whole work. New key-holes were cut, &amp;c. On Friday I began to operate on the doors, after doing Mr. Stocker's work. In the afternoon I was viſited by Robinſon the carpenter, who brought a perſon with him, a ſtranger to me. They both took a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular obſervation of the locks, keys, &amp;c. I told Robinſon at this time, that thoſe locks were not fit for a bank in the hearing of this ſtranger. (The reader will pleaſe to keep in direct and point blank view this ſtranger, and there may be a poſſible ſurmiſe of the character of ſome of his connections). During the whole work, Robinſon informed me, that Smith the Caſhier, would not employ me after this was done, owing to the delay. I anſwered it made little difference to me. I gave Robinſon and his companion ſomething to drink, and they both went away towards Second-ſtreet. They had not been gone above ten minutes, when Robinſon's companion (the ſtranger,) came back, and went into my ſhop while I was anſwering a young woman at the door; I took no notice of him, as he appeared to be Robinſon's confidential friend and companion. He did not ſtop above a minute, and came to the door. I ſaid I was in a hurry, and muſt work all night, as the Bank was in ſuch haſte for their work being done. Robinſon's companion anſwered, that he would ſee all Banks damn'd before he would kill himſelf this hot weather. He then took his courſe towards Front-ſtreet—he did not follow Robinſon: whether they met again immediately or not, I cannot tell, but ſuppoſe they did. Next day (being Saturday), both doors, locks, &amp;c. were carried to Carpenter's-Hall, where the buſineſs of the Bank of Pennſylvania was removed to. The front door of the vault was hung, the lock fixed complete, the inſide door was hung; but the lock was not ſcrewed on, owing to the following circumſtances. A large bar of iron which is fixed in the brick-work, and ſerves as a lock-box or ſtaple, the door
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035752_0009_100663CF4D48ECB8"/>
being too broad, was brought back to my ſhop, to have a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice cut out of the front ſtyle, to receive the above bar or lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box. (It is to be obſerved, that the lock belonging to this door remained in the Bank all Saturday, Sunday, and part of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day), when both doors were fixed to the ſatisfaction of the Bank. About this time, another ſmith, (not Smith the Caſhier), was employed in fitting two doors belonging to another vault, which was kept a profound ſecret from me. I now began to look on Robinſon with an eye of jealouſy, and where his drift would run, was ſtill unforeſeen to me. The next work I did for the Bank, was altering ſeveral lamp irons, mounting lamp poſts, &amp;c. but to a certainty, I was not in that Bank after the 12th or 13th of the month, being then entirely done with their work. About this time, the Yellow ſever began to increaſe. I made a ſmall hydraulic engine for Mr. Cramond. About the 20th or 22d of the month, I was walking down Market-ſtreet, with an intention of buying ſome peaches at Market-ſtreet ferry; as I came round the corner and got abreaſt of the river Delaware, I there ſaw Robinſon and his companion (who was with ſaid Robinſon at my ſhop), fitting drinking together: and it is to be obſerved, that Robinſon and myſelf never met without aſking each other to drink but at this time. I never ſaw two men ſo much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alarmed and confuſed in my life, as they were: I ſaw their alarm and noticed it, Robinſon and his companion ſaw the diſcovery I had made on their apparent embarraſſed countenances; but I could not tell what deſign they were about, to give them ſuch an alarm, or what cauſe it could ariſe from. After they got the muſcles of their faces compoſed, Robinſon called me from the water ſide—He put the following queſtions to me. Mr. Lyon what brought you this way? Are you not afraid? the Yellow fever broke out here. I anſwered, What brought you this way? Are you not afraid? Mr. Lyon do you mean to go out of town? I do not know. Do <hi>you</hi> mean to go out of town? He anſwered he did not know. Says Robinſon, Mr. Lyon there is a bar wanted for ſome of the doors of the Bank: he mentioned the door; but I do not recollect which door. His companion anſwered, Damn it, there will be no occaſion for that. I told them, I was ready for them at all times. They were drinking either porter or beer ſangaree, they never aſked me to drink, and I thought I could perceive by their confuſed and apparent embarraſs'd countenances, they would prefer my abſence to my preſence; I left them, and went to a peach beat, and bought ſome
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035752_0010_100663D0D355EBB0"/>
peaches, and carried them to my ſhop. Having nobody there but my apprentice, I ſaid to him Jeamie, I ſaw Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the ſtranger that was with him when we were doing the iron doors, at Market-ſtreet ferry; they ſeemed to me to be in deep ſtudy, I don't think they are after any good.</p>
            <p>The laſt piece of ſmith-work I done, was a guard iron to a glaſs caſe for Mr. Dobſon, it was fixed on Saturday the 25th, before breakfaſt. This day I was reſolved to go out of town, I hired accordingly a horſe and chair, and taking my apprentice with me, went down to Mr. Leiper's eſtate in Cheſter, where it was my intention to reſide, as I had been in that gentleman's employ; if he could accommodate me while the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever laſted I thought it might have been an advantage to both; but he was not there; I therefore returned to Philadelphia the ſame evening. If the fever had not broke out (or a report that it was) at Boſton, it was my full determination to have gone there to work; I heard of a new bank building there, and it was my wiſh to work and be induſtrious as long as I was young and able. For ſome time previous to this, we (my apprentice and myſelf) were obliged to ſleep in the ſhop, as the Yellow fever was next houſe to mine. On Sunday the 26th, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the ſhop, eat dinner at Lebanon, and ſupped with the family of my apprentice. Monday went into Bucks county about 20 miles, to farmer Paul's, where my old landlady and her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſided, (ſhe being ſiſter to Joſeph Paul). The family were making me up a piece of linen for ſhirts; I took leave of the family with a full determination to go to the capes of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. Tuesday 28th of Auguſt, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore part of the day was taken up in procuring a paſſage for the capes, which I found about 3 o'clock P.M. I had ſome linen in the waſh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe tied to time, I gave my apprentice orders to go on board the ſchooner, lying at Arch-ſtreet wharf, commanded by captain Edward Collins, bound to Broadkill creek, near Lewis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own; as my linen would take ſome time in drying. The wind being ſoutherly, the ſchooner took more time than uſual to beat down; I ordered my apprentice to heave out a ſignal at Almond-ſtreet wharf, which was done. I went on board of ſaid ſchooner about 5 o'clock P.M. taking a bottle of rum, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, clothing, &amp;c. The crew and paſſengers conſiſted of the captain with his wife, who had been newly married, a young man before the maſt, a young woman, myſelf and James M'Ginley my apprentice. I took a proper view of all hands, and found them to be truly Delaware ſhallop-hands. Our ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035752_0011_100663D2838F3D58"/>
(alias a wood ſhallop) was very leaky: the captain ſaid he wanted to ſell her, he ſaid he was offered £.50 for her ſails and rigging, but he thought it too little; the main ſail was not without it's decorations, it was completely patched, and was not confined to canvas only; but towards the lower part, were pieces of check ſhirts or aprons. The peak hallyards had three or four knots, and it was with great difficulty ſome times to get the knots through the blocks either way; the foreſail was paſſable; the gibb was a delicate piece of goods, the upper part being made faſt to a woollen ſtocking. Who would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the exalted commander of ſuch a temporary unſeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaky machine as this ſchooner or ſhallop; ſhould, or could have the conſcience to aſſume more dignity, more importance, and more affectation than the commander of a firſt-rate man of war in his Britanic majeſty's navy—but that was the caſe.</p>
            <p>We went down the river next day being Wedneſday 29th, <hi>all well</hi> on board. I never ſaw my boy in higher ſpirits, from the time he came to me. On Thurſday 30th, my apprentice began to complain, and from the nature of his complaint, and what I had heard of concerning the Yellow fever, ſeemed to correſpond. In this forlorn ſituation, I did not know what in the world I ſhould do; having no medicine on board, being no judge of his diſorder, and far from home, where no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical aid could be called to his relief; was to any candid, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon; one of the greateſt trials of mind a man can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo—it was the greateſt I ever met with. We had a high wind, and a heavy ſwell, and was obliged to put into Quahan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y for ſafety. The ſtorm abated towards the evening, and we proceeded on our voyage. Next day, Friday 31ſt, my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice continued very ſick: became quite weak, and loſt the uſe of his limbs; and had it not been that I kept a watchful eye over him, he would have fallen overboard ſeveral times; in this low ſituation, I was obliged to hold him over the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel: and the riſque I ran may eaſily be conceived; as our blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets were frequently put together. On Saturday the firſt of September, we came into Broadkill creek. After we had ſailed up the creek a conſiderable way, the ſchooner, or ſhallop run aground. We went on ſhore about 10 or 11 o'clock A.M. My apprentice ſeemed much better, but like myſelf, quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the nature of his diſorder. All his actions, and behaviour, appeared to me like a man in a ſtate of intoxication. We travelled acroſs a ſalt marſh, and the firſt houſe we came
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035752_0012_100663D41F380508"/>
to, was a Mr. Fiſher's, who gave us ſome cyder to drink, and likewiſe gave us directions to a tavern, which was two miles forward. I ſaid to my apprentice, I will go forward, and do you walk on at your leiſure. I ſaw by this time he was getting worſe again, he could not wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k without ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering; the leaders of his neck were become ſo weak, that his head was like a ſhips maſt, having loſt all her braces; it is impoſſible for any perſon to deſcribe my ſituation; having no medicine with me, and being a ſtranger to the dreadful diſorder he was labouring under; at the ſame time hearing ſo much of talk of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever and ague, I was led to believe that it was that diſorder he was labouring under. I went forward and paſſed through two woods, and arrived at the tavern kept by Cornelius Fleetwood, about ſeven miles from Lewiſtown. Mrs. Fleetwood got dinner ready for us. After waiting a conſiderable time, I began to be uneaſy—I went back the ſame road but could ſee nothing of my apprentice—Then went through both woods where I found him lying aſleep under a tree, having not gone far from the ſpot where I left him at firſt. I raiſed him up, and with vaſt difficulty got him to Fleetwood's tavern. We both ſat down to dinner, and much to my ſurprize, Sir, ſays he, I cannot eat. I prevailed on him to take a diſh of coffee, which he conſented to. He let fall the ſaucer. Mrs. Fleetwood ſtanding by, I made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for him. If even I had been certain that it was the Yellow fever that was his diſorder, my own idea ſuggeſted it would have been improper to have diſcloſed it on his account; as I was well aſſured we ſhould not have long found ſhelter. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner I prepared to walk to Lewiſtown, telling Mrs. Fleetwood to let my boy have whatever he wanted. I then took leave of him, telling him I would be with him next morning, and bring ſome medicine. I proceeded to Lewiſtown, and arrived about five o'clock, P.M. and fell in with an old acquaintance, Captain Learmonth. Eat ſupper with him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupper we took a walk about town; fell in company with Mr. Joſhua Hall, who engaged with me for my boy to go to work for him; I ſlept that night at Mr. Elliot's tavern: next morning being Sunday, the 2d of September, I ſhaved myſelf <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eat breakfaſt with Mr. Elliot's family; I then bought half an ounce of bark for my boy, concluding in my own mind that his diſorder was the fever and ague. I ſet off for Fleetwood's tavern, where I had left my boy, and there being two county roads, I was directed by a black man the wrong road, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035752_0013_100663D8E0C538A0"/>
led to Indian river; met a country gentleman, and from him received information, that I was ſix and a half miles out of the proper road. Being on foot, the day exceſſive hot; and my anxiety of mind in regard to my boy made me like a perſon diſtracted. However by the goodneſs of the country people, I was directed from one farm to the other, and came to Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's tavern, where I found my apprentice in a ſhocking ſituation. I immediately procured two doctors, and when they met in the room they differed in opinion reſpecting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Doctor Wilſon of Lewiſtown, declared it to be the Yellow fever; Doctor Little, (from I know not where) inſiſted it was the nervous fever. I was to receive for the boy the aid of both, therefore it was not proper for me to differ with either, as I was no Doctor myſelf. However Doctor Wilſon's opinion proved to be right. I cannot help remarking the modeſty and care that this gentleman treated me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith, and his ſympathetic feeling for my perilous ſituation. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, September 3d, my boy continued very ill; had him bled, and bathed with hot vinegar, and ſome herbs by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Doctor Little; at the ſame time giving him Doctor Ruſh's po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ders in molaſſes—found that the calomel did not lay on his ſtomach, we found ſugar to anſwer better. I nurſed him night and day till Tueſday morning, 4th September, when about ſix o'clock that morning he died.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot help adding my ſorrowful regret for the loſs of one of the moſt promiſing youths, perhaps in America; he was aged about 19 years, and had been with me about nine months. I took (while with me) all the pains in my power to inſtruct him in my profeſſion; and began to inſtruct him in the knowledge of the uſeful problems of Euclid's Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: he began to ſee into the ſtupidity of the old mode of working which gave him an enthuſiaſtic ſpirit of enquiry; he was honeſt; his principles were good; and he had every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of becoming a uſeful member of ſociety, and an ornament to his country. The attachment of this lad towards me was wonderful from many inſtances; and laſtly, when we were obliged to ſleep in the ſhop; (as I have before obſerved on account of the Yellow fever exiſting next-door to my houſe) he made his bed at my feet, and after a hard days work, groaning under the burthen of heavy labour; he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would feel my feet in the night, and wake me and aſk if I was well: it is wrong to reflect, but the loſs I ſuſtained by the death of this promiſing youth, I am certain I ſhall never retrieve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035752_0014_100663DA648E42D8"/>
I got a coffin made for him, and put him into the coffin my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and had all the difficulty attendent on ſuch a mournful accident on my own ſhoulders, by this time: I had become ſo weak as to be ſcarcely able to follow him to the grave, to ſigh a laſt farewel to his departed ſpirit. After burying him in Squire Hazard's burying ground, I was obliged to ſtay, cloſe in Fleetwood's tavern where I was like a priſoner: all his cuſtomers left him, a ſchool houſe juſt at hand every ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forſook, I can hardly deſcribe the deplorable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which I was placed. In the ſpace of a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having got every thing clean away; the alarm began to wear off, and though I might venture into Lewiſtown, as the people there were afraid I would come too ſoon and bring the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I remained in Fleetwood's till Friday 7th September, when I propoſed to Mr. Fleetwood to go to Lewiſtown, as I was without company: he agreed. I aſked him what I had to pay, he went and conſulted with his wife, and he brought me in debt ſix pounds, I told him I had not ſo much money left, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him a note I told him it was what I could not accept of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I addreſſed Mr. Fleetwood in theſe words, Sir, I have but thirteen dollars and a half, I ſhall want ſome ready caſh in Lewiſtown, and I am far from home; will you accept of my watch as I am a ſtranger to you, and I will pay you the ſix pounds, when you come to Philadelphia, (which has been ſince done) we were both ſatisfied, ſhook hands and parted. I went into Lewiſtown this day, in which place after my arrival I was ſpending my time very agreeable, in fiſhing, repairing guns, cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee mills, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>About the 12th, or 13th, of the month, I was told by one Samuel Edwards, a pilot, that a bank was robbed: he was not certain as to what bank, but believed it to be the bank of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania; I gave myſelf no concern about which bank, I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw an account of the robbery in a newſpaper, I ſtill gave myſelf no concern, but I began to think who could be the moſt likely perſon that had committed this robbery: my ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions were ſtrongly levelled againſt the carpenter and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I ſaw drinking with him at Market-ſtreet ferry.</p>
            <p>On Sunday about the ſixteenth of the month, a Mr. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and his wife came to Lewiſtown, with whom I formerly lodged in Philadelphia; having from that circumſtance a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, or intimacy with each other for a few years before, we converſed about the death of ſeveral acquaintances, and the ſubject of the late robbery of the Bank of Pennſylvania; but he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035752_0015_100663DC5FD6E100"/>
never hinted that there was any ſuſpicions againſt me till next day (Monday), when as I was walking paſt the houſe of Mr. Elliot, Mr. Hunter, called me, and aſked me to take a drink with him: he then repeated the ſtory of the Bank robbery, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, that there were many perſons taken up, mentioning three names; but I did not recognize any of the names he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I then aſked him if there was one of the name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon, taken up, he ſaid he could not tell, he began to tell me a long circuitous ſtory, adding that he was ſorry there were many innocent people ſuſpected: from his manner and mode of converſation I was induced to aſk him if I was ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he told me that I was, I aſked him his reaſon for not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me ſooner, he ſaid he did not like to affront me. I then told him I would go to Philadelphia, which he ſtrongly adviſed me to do. I then called my landlord Captain Learmonth, and conſulted with him, who intirely approved of my reſolution. In which manner I could get a paſſage to Philadelphia, I was entirely at a loſs. I went immediately to a Captain Weſt, who was to ſail next day to Brandywine-creek about 28 miles from Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>I got every thing prepared for the voyage before dinner, and in the afternoon I went out to ſea, on board the Britiſh frigate called the Hind, commanded by Captain Larcom. This fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and an armed brig came round to raiſe the Brack f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oop of war, which had been ſunk ſome time before; I then began to form to myſelf the deſign of making a diving bell and go down into the veſſel, as it appeared to me impoſſible to raiſe her: the day before they broke a 13 inch hawſer, I went below with the armourer and ſpent the afternoon with ſeveral of the officers, till night came on. The pilot-boat had left me, and I was afraid I ſhould have to ſtay on board till next morning: during this time ſome of my acquaintance on ſhore were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious of the commander detaining me, as they ſaid I would be a uſeful man on board: at that time there were two officers on ſhore, my friends had formed to themſelves this idea, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to keep the officers as hoſtages 'till I was reſtored. But to my great ſatisfaction, a pilot-boat belonging to David Hazard, came out to the brig with the two officers, and I returned on ſhore about eight or nine o'clock, I went home and found myſelf very hungry, every thing cleaned away, I went to the houſe of Mr. Elliot with an intention of getting ſomething to eat and drink, I ſpent the evening and ſlept there that night. Next day being Tueſday about the 17th, or 18th, of the month.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035752_0016_100663E09FD185E8"/>
we ſet ſail after dinner from Lewiſtown for Brandywine creek; we arrived on the Thurſday following, 20th inſtant, before ſix o'clock in the morning. I went twice through Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington, (where the Yellow fever was raging) to take the ſtage or get any other carriage to bring me up to Philadelphia. The fever was as fatal in Wilmington, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, as it was in Philadelphia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in croſſing Brandywine bridge, I begged a chew of tobacco from a traveller as a preventative—At this time all intercourſe was ſtopt between the two places. I was very anxious to reach Philadelphia about 9 o'clock A.M. and reſolved to walk it; the day was as warm as any during the ſummer, I took of my coat and carried it over my ſhoulders: on croſſing Brandywine bridge a ſecond time, I met a Mr. M'Kenzie, he aſked me where I was going. I told him and what for; he told me, that the night before, he was in company with a clerk belonging to one of the banks, who informed the company, that they had got hold of a ſhallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who took down the river with him, a ſmith and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice; and that the ſmith had a red pock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> book full of bank notes. My going down the river with him was true; but as to a pocket book I never carried one. I knew the ſhallop man I went down with, to be a poor, ſilly, ignorant creature, and this began to make me afraid there was ſomething very ſerious. I bought a biſcuit and three peaches—at firſt ſtart I travelled to Cheſter, and ſaw no perſon in particular that I knew on the road, until I came to a white-houſe, where there was a number of German paſſengers conſigned to Gurney &amp; Smith, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Philadelphia. I there met a Mr. Curtis, a potter; as ſoon as he ſaw me, he told me what I was going to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia for; but perſuaded me to go back again as they had got the people. Here we had ſomething to drink, and I eat my biſcuit, which was all the food I eat during my journey. As I had got ſo far, I thought I would go and ſhow myſelf to ſome of my acquaintance on the out ſkirts of the town; I met Squire Wharton, I met alſo John Haines, the ſaddler; but did not know that he was a conſtable till next day. Mr. Curtis paſſed me on horſeback, we met at Derby where we had ſomething to drink, and as there was a barber in the houſe I got ſhaved, being about 7 miles from Philadelphia. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Mr. Stocker's country-houſe ſituated in the Iriſh track about two miles from Philadelphia, arrived there about 7 o'clock in the evening, very low, owing to the heat of the day, travelling on foot, and the little ſuſtenance I took on the

road; I was ſo tired I lay down among the graſs before Mr. Stocker's door—he was not at home. I begged for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, but inſtead of receiving any, the domeſtics began to quarrel about it; I aſked for a drink of water, they would not give me any thing. I knew I could get any refreſhment I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Lebanon: but had thought they would have taken care of me for one night at Mr. Stocker's; but I was diſappointed. I got up ſcarcely able to walk and was proceeding down Iriſh track lane, on my way to Lebanon, being dark, here I met two chairs, the firſt I aſked if that was not Mr. Stocker, he anſwered yes. Don't you know me ſaid I? Is that Lyon? yes, ſays I. Who took you? I told him I did not want any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, I came of my own accord; I aſked him what charge there was againſt me. He ſaid there was a charge and would be glad If I could prove my innocence. I told him it gave me but little concern to do <hi>that.</hi> I then aſked him to let me ſtay in his houſe that night, he anſwered no. I aſked him to let me ſleep in his ſtable among his hay, he anſwered no. I then begged him to let me ſleep on his floor, as I was afraid to go into town; owing to the Yellow fever making ſuch terrible ravages he again replied no. We agreed to meet next morning at 9 o'clock, I then proceeded to Lebanon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The city was cloathed with that diſmal melancholly garb that one might naturally expect, from the effect of ſo dreadful a diſorder as reigned at that time.

ſuſpicion for robbing the Bank of Pennſylvania; he ſaid yes, and by the order of Smith, the caſhier of ſaid Bank. Well ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, here I am; what have you to ſay againſt me. He ſaid he could not ſtop me, as he had not the warrants, in his poſſeſſion. He then aſked me where I had been; I told him at Cape Henlopen, about one hundred and fifty miles from Philadelphia; he aſked me if I came that far on purpoſe. I anſwered yes. I then aſked leave to get breakfaſt; he told me he would truſt me to get breakfaſt, as I had been ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to come 150 miles to ſurrender myſelf. He ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded me to go to Germantown, where the Bank was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it was too far for me to walk and I was afraid to go into any of their carriages, becauſe the ſick were frequently in all the common carriages; I held in remembarance my former promiſe to meet Mr. Stocker, at nine o'clock, A. M. I breakfaſted with my friend John Saunders, at Lebanon; but was very faint and low, and my joints were become ſtiff in a great meaſure. I proceeded to the houſe of Mr. Stocker, and arrived there about a quarter paſt nine o'clock; as I entered the gate, he mounted his horſe, and ſaid, Lyon I will be back directly. While he was gone, Squire Wharton, came to the houſe, Mr. Stocker returned in about two hours afterwards, and brought with him Mr. Fox, the Preſident of the Bank, Smith the Caſhier: (and Haines, the high conſtable was ſlily ſent for) at this time I did not know that Haines, the ſaddler had been transformed into a conſtable. Mr. Stocker, being one of the City Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, opened the examination. They took down in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all my travels from the time that I left Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. Mr. Fox, aſked me if I ſaw any ſtrangers taking any particular notice of the locks, I anſwered no. (I did not when the queſtion was aſked, reckon Robinſon the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter a ſtranger, as he and his acquaintance came to my ſhop while the doors were there; nor did I according to the queſtion, conceive the other to be a ſtranger as I had ſeen him with Robinſon). However I ſtill held Robinſon in ſuſpicion, and from the circumſtances of a Mr. Brodie, a carpenter, who was hanged at Edinburgh. On this examination before Mr. Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. I related the ſtory, with the view to ſhow, in what I held Robinſon in ſuſpicion for robbing the Bank; which was thus delivered, as near as I can recollect, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That in part of the year of 1788 and 1789, I was then on my travels in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. About this time Mr. Brodie the carpenter, had been tried and condemned to die for robbing the exciſe office. Mr.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035752_0019_100663E5893E41B8"/>
Brodie's long train of villanies was carried on in the following manner: He employed a vaſt number of journeymen, and built perhaps a ſtreet at a time: be that as it may, every houſe that he finiſhed, he was ſure to have falſe keys made for every door in the houſe, until he had a collection of falſe keys that would have filled a large caſk. He had a ſecret place ſituated without the city, where he kept his falſe keys. The bunch of keys that was made for each houſe, had a tally, and when he wanted to rob any particular houſe, he poſſeſſed himſelf of ſuch a bunch of keys, with ſuch a gentleman's tally. He was a man entruſted very much, and did the government work in his line in that country; and carried on robbery for ſeveral years, till, he was detected robbing the Exciſe office. He made the firſt new invented gallows in the North, and was the firſt that ſwung upon his new invented machine. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Brodie's; connected with others, wrought ſo much on my mind, (and I knew that Robinſon had all the Bank locks in his poſſeſſion), that they appeared to me (whether viſionary or not), like two parallel lines. During my exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, became very faint, and called for ſome water, which was thought an implication of guilt, (here I would wiſh to aſk the beſt informed and moſt experienced of mankind, if an innocent man has not generally more tremor when accuſed, than a guilty perſon; who is for the moſt habituated to an emboldened confidence from nature or from cuſtom). Smith the Caſhier, began to lay down the manner in which the Bank was robbed, and the two locks that were in my poſſeſſion were opened, and that the cellar door was broke open; at this time I did not know the ſituation of the Bank, whether it had a cellar door or not.</p>
            <p>The ſuſpicions entertained againſt me at this time, were as follows, to wit. That I had two iron doors at my ſhop, with the locks. I knew very well my innocence, and as there was another ſmith employed in fixing two other doors; I aſked why not ſuſpect him? They anſwered me he did his work in half the time. I found I was in the hands of thoſe who were not the moſt intelligent of mankind—rich, but probably connected with Gotham. Mr. Stocker addreſſed himſelf to me, after having had a ſecret converſation with Mr. Fox.—"Mr. Lyon, I am very ſorry: but I muſt be under the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable neceſſity of committing you to priſon." I begged of him not to do that: aſſuring him of my innocence, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the entreaties I was maſter of; telling
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035752_0020_100663E85D75A040"/>
him if he ſent me to priſon, he was not only ſending an honeſt man there, but the ſon of an honeſt man. But to my grief and ſorrow, at this moment entreaties were vain, oppoſed to inflexible obduracy. Mr. Stocker told me he had proof againſt me; this appeared ſtrange to me, and where the great error lay, my p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>rating eye could not diſcover. Mr. Stocker ſaid, here is Haines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he conſtable waiting for you. I ſubmitted.—I knew the Yellow fever had made its appearance, and had its effect (I believe) in priſon. This to me was like fronting the lines of an enemy, expoſed without a poſſible means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but there is to ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> not to be avoided.</p>
            <p>I was then ordered into a chair with Haines the conſtable, who drove me to priſon. After he had lodged me in the hands of the head goaler, he went home and ſickened with the Yellow fever, I myſelf never expected to come out alive. I reflected on the hardſhip of my fate, but conſoled myſelf with the idea, that innocence would be ſhielded by providential om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipoten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. When I entered the priſon, there were between twenty or thirty caſes, of that almoſt unſparing diſorder. I was put inſtantly under cloſe confinement. The keeper of the women's wing had charge of me, whoſe heart was not of the dove kind, but rather in kind, more like to a lapſtone. I begged of him to get me ſome refreſhment. He brought me ſome rice ſoup: it was unwholeſome, being made of old rice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and even at the beſt of times, there is not too much nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any of their diſhes; but it was more particularly the caſe in regard to me, conſidering the low ſituation I was in. About this time, I began to be drawn double. I offered the keeper a ſum of money, (part of the little I had) to get me ſomething nouriſhing; adding that I could not eat the ſoup. He anſwered (not very ſmoothly) if I could not, that I might do without. He then took the ſoup away, and I was twenty four hours afterwards without a morſel. About this time, the deaths in the city were very numerous; according to report, they exceeded one hundred per day. The room where I was cloſely confined, was in the north weſt corner, where I had a view into Sixth-ſtreet; here they kept their potatoes, manufactured ſhoes, ſtores, &amp;c. I had about 12 feet by 4 to walk in, the greateſt part of my friends were out of town; and thoſe that were in town, were afraid to come to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as the fever was raging there, and that with a degree of violence, together with the heavy charges exhibited againſt me, were ſufficient preventatives againſt my having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035752_0021_100663EB2BD9D480"/>
of ſeeing any of my friends. I ſent for a worthy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, of the name of William Lace: who viſited me twice. I told him of my ſuſpicions. He begged of me to keep quiet. I told him I could not—and that if they would let me looſe, I thought from what I had ſeen at Market-ſtreet ferry, I could ſift the matter out. Here Mr. Lace took ſick with the Yellow fever; and I was fearful I ſhould never ſee him more. About this time, my old keeper died with the Yellow fever, (and I am apt to think did not leave too much humanity behind him), his name was Lewis, profeſſing to be a quaker. Some acquaintances occaſionally ſpoke to me at the window—I wanted ſomething to eat—the keepers neglected me ſometimes. I had a little money in my pocket; I tried if I could throw a potatoe into the ſtreet, which I did; I called an old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the window, and was about throwing him a dollar to buy me ſome meat; he went off telling me he would call again, but I did not ſee him 'till I was liberated. Mr. John Saunders, of Lebanon, viſited me, who procured me ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment—he called a ſecond time, and returned me my money back, with tears in his eyes, (the moſt impreſſive language to ſhew the fineſt feelings of human nature), imploring me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to keep up my ſpirits under my heavy load, he took leave of me and in a few days after died with the prevailing diſorder. Thus the humane and good are as liable to the diſpenſations of providence, (if not more ſo), than the crafty, mean, and villainous.</p>
            <p>About this time the Bank had ſent down to Lewiſtown, and enquired concerning my travels, and found every thing to be correct, (as related in the firſt part of this work), ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an omiſſion of telling them that I was on board of a Britiſh frigate, which they got an account of there. Mr. Fox, the Preſident of the Bank, ſent a letter to Mr. Peter Helm, the head gaoler, with a twenty dollar note incloſed. The ſubſtance of the letter I underſtood from the gaoler as he opened the iron door where I was confined, was thus: He aſked me if I had read the Governor's reward, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional reward of the Bank. I anſwered, Yes, I have read both. He then aſked me if I knew any thing concerning the robbery, as the letter ſent from Mr. Fox contained a twenty dollar note, to be laid out in neceſſaries for me, and a deſire to know if I knew any thing of the robbery. I anſwered, I knew nothing of the robbery; but that I ſuſpected Robinſon the carpenter, who had all the locks in his poſſeſſion, and as the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035752_0022_100663ECB19C6C98"/>
outer and inner doors muſt have been open, before they could get to the vault doors, even allowing the robbery to have been committed by opening the cellar door. I never had the cellar door lock in my poſſeſſion, nor the outer or inner door lock, and putting me into priſon on ſo ſlight a view of the caſe; was as great a cruelty under the exerciſe of the law, as perhaps ever was committed on the body of any man. About this time, my friend William Lace was getting over the Yellow fever, which circumſtance was a peculiar gratification to me; he had buried one of his children, a regretted loſs no doubt to him—he viſited me after his recovery ſeveral times. Haines, the high conſtable, after ſtaggering through the conſequential force of the prevailing malady, viſited me likewiſe—the head gaolar with him. He aſked me ſeveral queſtions; I told him of my innocent, though hard caſe, I likewiſe told him that I had reaſon to ſuſpect certain perſons. By this time he had learnt I ſuſpected Robinſon, the carpenter, but I gave him no ſatisfaction; I told him I had reaſon to ſuſpect two perſons, and would be glad to get my liberty, as from the ſituation I had ſeen thoſe two perſons whom I ſuſpected, I would ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the matter out. I likewiſe told him of the injuſtice in the Bank, by keeping me under cloſe confinement ſo long; telling him at the ſame time, I thought they had taken the wrong method to find out ſuch a robbery. I then related to him a compariſon, which I had read of the ſuperſtitious cuſtoms of old, which is thus, as near as I can recollect. That in the days of yore, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> a perſon died, it was ſuppoſed by ſome writers that the ſoul does not leave the body immediately, but gradually withdraws as the body cools; during this time, the relatives or friends of the deceaſed, ſets what is called the paſſing bell to ring; and in thoſe days, the people believed the Devil to be the Prince of the air and being fond of muſic, this bell was rung as they ſaid, to divert him aſide, ſo as the ſoul might paſs up to the milky way without infernal obſtruction. Having related to Haines this ancient ſtory, and ſaying at the ſametime, the people who had committed this daring robbery, had whiſpered into the ears of the Bank, that it muſt be this one, or that one, and look that way, or the other way; but don't look <hi>this way:</hi> while they who committed the fact, were ſnugly hiving their booty. He le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t me, and went I ſuppoſe to the directors of the Bank, who I have not the leaſt doubt, had given him every inſtruction in what manner to proceed. But I found ſufficient ſuſpicion to believe this viſitor of artifice,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035752_0023_100663EE53B07378"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be keen for the reward. I was again viſited by him in a few days after, but at firſt ſight I ſaw (as far as I could judge of appearance) the reward was his object. We entered into a long converſation. He told me if I could give him any information, ſo as the bank could get at <hi>ſome</hi> of their money, that I ſhould be entitled to two thouſand dollars. I told him it was out of my power, as I was an innocent man, and knew nothing of the affair; but I ſtill had my ſuſpicions. He then aſked my ſuſpicions. I declined giving him any ſatisfaction; but ſaid if they would let me looſe, I thought I could catch the fellows. He told me that the Directors of the Bank had a meeting, and had given up the whole to Mr. Stocker; and that it was left entirely at his pleaſure to ſet me at liberty if he thought proper. This part of Haines' ſtory appeared reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me, becauſe (as far as I ever underſtood) in the old country, they cannot keep a man in priſon on mere ſuſpicion exceeding the ſpace of forty-eight hours, without the liability of the law, (and that liability conſequential). He then aſked me if I would tell my ſuſpicions to Mr. Stocker. I told him as it was left to Mr. Stocker to liberate me, I would not tell my ſuſpicions 'till I got my liberty, and then I ſhould have a better opportunity of ſifting into my ſuſpicions before I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Shaking me by the hand, he delivered me a meſſage from Mr. Stocker, that I ſhould ſtill think him (Mr. Stocker) my friend. I told him it was impoſſible for me, conſidering every circumſtance, to think him my friend, after the ſevere treatment I had experienced through his means; as he certainly muſt have known or ſuggeſted to himſelf that I was innocent of the charge. I told Haines that there were many innocent men condemned in priſon; he ſaid he believed it to be true, as it is common here (meaning the priſon) to puniſh the innocent for the guily. I told him that ſuch a diſregard to juſtice would, or might certainly have an effect to cauſe a revolution in this country, and drew ſeveral inferential remarks relative to the baſtile of Paris.</p>
            <p>I was frequently viſited by the convicts, who paſſed occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally by my room door, and amongſt thoſe I muſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize a certain John Sheaffer, who had a brother confined on account of the late robbery of the Bank; he aſked me ſeveral queſtions, ſuch as, where I was at the time the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery was committed, &amp;c. and giving him a full account, &amp;c. the reward being great, and he to gain his liberty; laid one of the deepeſt and moſt machinating ſchemes that could be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035752_0024_100663F1AA4077A0"/>
capable of villainy, ever heard of, for the ſake (of what I ſuppoſe) a reward.</p>
            <p>Under this long ſolitary confinement, I wanted books (diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any other amuſement), to paſs away my time; I at length got the Bible and Robert Burn's Scotch poems, which made my library as complete as was in my power to collect. I read until I was tired, and walked till I was weary, every day expecting that my releaſement would come; and although I am, and have been, very much given to profeſſional ſtudy, I could not ſtudy the grand ſcience which I have made ſo much progreſs in, (conſidering my age,) embracing every opportunity to do ſo. If I attempted to paſs away my time in natural muſical harmony, (<hi>i. e.</hi> whiſtling and ſinging), I was ordered to a dungeon. If I ſpoke to any perſon at the window, I was to be ſent to the cells (or a dungeon), this I thought very hard, for to ſuffer in the manner I did, before a trial commenced, (or a cauſe for trial); the uſage I received was worſe than any priſoner, either convicted or thoſe for trial, as we all ſuffered our confinement, with this difference—the convicts had a large yard to walk in, while I was lingering by myſelf, on ſuſpicion only; and at this period no perſon admitted to hear the ſorrowful breathings of truth, which emanating from innocence, might have had a ſympathetic effect. Every hour expecting to hear of the diſcovery of the robbery, I frequently prayed in the moſt fervent manner (when it appeared to me that the robbery was like to be for ever concealed), that the Great Creator might confuſe thoſe who had the money, ſo as the whole might be brought to light—to liberate the innocent, and bring to condign puniſhment the perpetrators of the deed, for the commiſſion of which I was ſuffering. My breaſt was now ſwelled conſiderably, and I was drawn almoſt double, my hair fell from my head as I walked in the room. At this moment I could not help taking a retroſpect of the paſt, reflectively conſidering my former ſituation in life, being in poſſeſſion of a houſe full of furniture, which coſt me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four hundred pounds; having three capital beds, and to ſleep on the hard boards every night, was a ſolemn and ſerious change. After I had ſuffered five weeks or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in this miſerable and forlorn ſituation; Haines the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable came to the priſon with a horſe and chair, and told me Mr. Stocker would be glad to ſee me. I dreſſed myſelf as well as circumſtances would admit, and went before Mr. Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a long beard, which a razor had not touched ſince
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035752_0025_100663F487BE6048"/>
the time I came through Derby. Mr. Stocker ſaid he was glad to ſee me. I told him I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After expoſtulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him for ſome time, Mr. Fox, the Preſident of the Bank came. No ſooner did he enter the room than Mr. Stocker and himſelf, (the Preſident), began to talk about ſome great dinner, (I thought that human miſery might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a little more reſpect), and Mr. Stocker obſerved he was very ſorry that he loſt ſo good a dinner—this dinner was at Germantown.</p>
            <p>Let the reader conſider within himſelf my miſerable ſituation, juſt brought out of a loathſome and unwholſome priſon, and to hear two men unfeelingly trumpeting to each other in common though exulting language, the glorious gormandizing that had taken place on ſuch a day at Germantown. I obſerved, (or thought I obſerved) or ſaw by this time, Mr. Fox was but a young man in every ſenſe of the word, as to his experience in the world. We had a long converſation on the art of lock-making, but I could not extract from them the leaſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by what means or manner the inner hall door of the Bank was opened; this ſeemed to put the whole congregation to a nonplus, with regard to my caſe, this point only ought to have been ſufficient to have cleared me, and I believe in the real opinion of the whole it did—but ſay they, you are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man, and <hi>could do ſuch a thing.</hi> After all my trouble and vexation, I found I had to deal with men who were rather more obſtinate and perſiſting than experienced, and I was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and had ſuffered from that cauſe. I was then aſked for my ſuſpicions. Mr. Stocker got pen, ink and paper, and took down the following words, as near as I can recollect, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That on the Friday afternoon, or the day after the iron doors came to my ſhop, Robinſon the carpenter, came to my ſhop with a ſtranger, they both examined the locks very cloſely; Robinſon gave me ſtrict orders to go on as quick as poſſible, I told him in the hearing of the ſtranger that the locks were not fit for a bank. Robinſon's anſwer was, Damn it, it will make a ſhift. I gave Robinſon and his companion ſomething to drink, and they both went towards Second-ſtreet. In about five or ten minutes after, Robinſon's companion came back and went into the ſhop, while I was anſwering a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the door. Robinſon's companion did not ſtop one
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035752_0026_100663F60E4F8360"/>
minute—as he came out of the ſhop, I ſaid to him, I believe I muſt work all night, the Bank is in ſuch a hurry for their work. Robinſon's companion anſwered, and ſaid, he would ſee the Bank damn'd before he would kill himſelf for them; he then went towards Front-ſtreet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> While I was hanging the doors at the Bank, I ſaw this companion of Robinſon's there; but I could not tell what he was, I had never ſeen him 'till within thoſe two days—Robinſon's companion appeared to me to be a clerk, (I ſuppoſe in the Land-office), as Carpenter's hall had been occupied by the Land-office, prior to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Bank of Pennſylvania—Robinſon's companion ſeemed to me to be well acquainted with the whole of the Banking houſe. I afterwards, about the 20th or 22d of Auguſt, ſaw Robinſon and his companion at Market-ſtreet ferry: juſt as I turn'd round from Market-ſtreet, they were both ſitting at the front window, and I declare, I never ſaw two men ſo alarmed as they were at the ſight of me, they ſtared and looked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed at one another; I ſaw they were alarmed at my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, therefore I did not go near them; but they obſerved I ſaw the confuſion of their countenances. Robinſon called me to the window—they were drinking either porter or beer ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garee, but did not aſk me to drink. Robinſon ſays to me, Mr. Lyon what brought you this way, are you not afraid? the Yellow fever broke out here. I anſwered, what brought you this way, are you not afraid? Mr. Lyon, ſays Robinſon, do you mean to go out of town? I do not know, ſays I—Do you mean to go out of town? he anſwered, he did not know. Says Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Mr. Lyon there is a bar wanting for a door of the Bank, mentioning what door; but I do not recollect what door it was he mentioned. His companion replied, Damn it, there will be no occaſion for that. I anſwered them, I was ready for them at all times; however I ſaw by their countenances they wanted to get rid of my company; I left them, and went to a peach boat and bought ſome peaches; carried them to my ſhop, and gave my apprentice ſome of them. I ſaid to my apprentice, Jeamie I ſaw Robinſon and that ſtranger, at Market-ſtreet ferry, that was in our ſhop while we were doing the iron doors; they ſeemed to be in deep ſtudy, and I do not think they are after any good. Having delivered thoſe ſuſpicions, and Mr. Stocker having taken down the whole in writing; I aſked him if it had any effect, will you give me the reward. Both Mr. Stocker and Mr. Fox, ſaid it was good for nothing. I then demanded my liberty, from what Haines
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035752_0027_100663F814A10D38"/>
had related to me in priſon, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the directors of the Bank had, had a meeting, and left it in the power of Mr. Stocker to do as he thought proper—which information I communicated to Mr. Stocker. Mr. Stocker told me it was no ſuch thing, and that it was out of his power to diſcharge me. I then called Haines, who was out of doors, to relate what he ſaid to me in priſon. He ſeemed not to underſtand me. Says I to Haines, did you not tell me in priſon, that the Directors of the Bank had empowered Mr. Stocker to liberate me, after I had delivered my ſuſpicions? Haines with all the aſſurance properly belonging to the profeſſion he now follows, (and as if he had been long hacknied in the profeſſion), flatly denied the whole. Mr. Fox aſked me why I mentioned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon's name ſo often. I anſwered becauſe I did not know his companion's name. I perceived by this time the partiality of Mr. Fox towards Robinſon; he would not believe that Robinſon ever made uſe of an oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have heard Robinſon ſwear, and have ſeen him get as drunk as any other man, but Mr. Fox would not believe this. Previous to the Yellow fever I had heard a very mean character of Robinſon, in ſeveral reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, which ſtrengthened my ſuſpicion, after I had heard of the robbery of the Bank. I aſked Mr. Stocker in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſhould get out of priſon. He told me it was out of his power to do any thing for me, as he was an Alderman when he committed me, but ſince choſen one of the Aſſembly, of courſe he was obliged to relinquiſh the former. I told him it was cruel in him to ſerve me ſo, and who was his prompter I could not tell; but certainly there was ſome perſon in the Bank who owed me ſome private animoſity; and obſerved likewiſe to him, that there were men in that Bank, who ſet up the empty pretenſions of being gentlemen, that I would not go over the threſhold of a door to do them a ſervice, owing to their meaneſs; and telling him at the ſame time not to caſt any reflections on any other nation, for I plainly ſee, ſaid I, when power falls into the hands of the Americans they were not always more humane than other nations. Said I, would it not have been much better for you to have taken and hung me at once. Mr. Stocker anſwered, Mr. Lyon if we have done wrong, there is the law open for you. Sir, ſaid I, in what manner muſt I act to get out of priſon. He told me I muſt hire a lawyer, (whether I had money or not I ſupppoſe), and be removed by habeas corpus before any of the Judges, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t out on bail. But, Sir, ſays I, the bail you aſked of me
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035752_0028_100663FBECC57CA0"/>
on my firſt examination was 150,000 dollars, which was, and is out of my power to command. But probably the bail, ſaid he, will be lowered. The Yellow fever was now extenſively ſpreading, and ſweeping all before it in the priſon, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me much; but Mr. Stocker told me, that if the affair was found out, and if I was clear, all my loſſes ſhould certainly be made up to me. He told me he had ſent me twenty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for my relief. I thanked him—Mr. Fox entered the room after having had a long private converſation with Haines, the ſuppoſed agent of the Bank of Pennſylvania; ſays he, Mr. Lyon are there any ſuch things as dubbs to be bought at the ironmongers. Dubbs, Sir, ſaid I, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> don't know what you mean. Why (ſays he) keys ready cut, with the wards complete, and fit to open any lock. I told him I did not think there were any ſuch to be bought. Well, ſays Mr. Fox, I ſent you twenty dollars for your relief, in caſe you wanted any thing. I thanked him. I thought Mr. Stocker's twenty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and the twenty dollars from Mr. Fox, which made forty dollars, would keep me pretty comfortable for ſome time. I begged of them to tell the gaoler to uſe me well, as I thought for the laſt fortnight, I had been roughly treated; they both declared it was not their orders. After laying every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance down, that they had no right to ſuſpect me, Mr. Fox aſked me if I knew one Boyd a bricklayer; I told him I did not, but had heard of him. He then aſked me who I thought could do ſuch a job, as making falſe keys; I mentioned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, amongſt the reſt was my brother James. Mr. Stocker told me there would be a meeting of the Directors, and that he would do all in his power to modify them, and (ſays he) if you are found to be an innocent man, all your loſſes ſhall be made good to you again. I told him it was impoſſible for them ever to make my loſs good, for it is eaſy (ſays I), to take away the good name of a man, but not a very eaſy matter to re-eſtabliſh that name, ſo taken away; I have (I obſerved to him) acted as a gentleman ſince I was put in priſon; but I now found my temper could no longer be reſtrained, and told him never more to expect a civil anſwer from me. I was then ordered back to cloſe confinement. I went into the chair along with Haines, who I began to conſider as a ſpeculator on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wretchedneſs. I prevailed on him to drive me into Third-ſtreet, as I wanted to ſpeak to Captain Guy, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to. As Captain Guy was well acquainted with the gaoler, I told him to ſtep forward and ſpeak to the keeper,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035752_0029_100663FD72B89E80"/>
and prevail upon him to uſe better treatment towards me, which he did the next day; the gaoler then aſked my complaint, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> delivered to him, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That I was in want of many neceſſaries, and for a fortnight no perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſee me. The gaoler told me that orders were given, and he could not help it, and that he expected another ruſh from the priſoners. I told him if he apprehended any danger, open the door of my room and I will defend you as far as lies in my power. The city as I rode through had a diſmal, deadly, and dreadful appearance—no vehicle to be ſeen but thoſe ſoul ſtriking carriages, adapted for the conveyance of the dying and the dead. After I was re-conveyed to my old habitation, and there again fixed, I begged as a kindneſs that a friend might be permitted to bring me ſome paper, that I might have the pleaſure of writing to ſome of my friends, and to ſee if any of them would bail me out—which was procured. I wrote a letter firſt to Mr. Stocker, pointing out to him the impropriety of keeping me in priſon, likewiſe laying down the crippled ſituation of the Bank in regard to it's ſecurity againſt robbery, and that as I had warned them of danger almoſt twelve months prior to their laſt misfortune, and they would not liſten to me; it appeared to me there was a veil over their eyes, ſo as to hinder them from ſeeing clearly, and that their locks were on the barn door principle. After cloſing this letter I do not know from what impulſe, (but it might be from a fooliſh one or otherwiſe, but it was a ſudden one), I directed this letter in the following manner, to wit. John C. Stocker, Eſquire, from the Honourable Patrick Lyon, now in Philadelphia priſon. This letter, the contents of which unfolded the unguarded ſtupidity of their ſecurity for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive property, and ſuch a bold direction to one of the State Legiſlators, (who perhaps might think himſelf one of the Lord's annointed), had ſuch a powerful effect, that it raiſed a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a flame throughout the whole Bank, and they all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly declared, (and I give them credit for their candour in this particular), that they would ſtretch every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>don to bring me to puniſhment, (the view of juſtice I preſume was then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the interference of prejudice). There is not a doubt but writing the truth might gall the ſoreneſs of ſome of their half healed wounds, but truth being my miſtreſs. I follow her dictates, and penned what I did; and what I did write I defy any or either of them to prove to the contrary, (I mean in the body of the letter, but leave the ſuperſcription out of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035752_0030_100663FF07C37128"/>
the queſtion, as a mere matter of inanity). I wrote letters to ſeveral of my friends to ſtep forward in my behalf; and one of them I cannot help remarking on—I had formerly put (with entire confidence in him) into his poſſeſſion, all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I poſſeſſed, and had ſuch a particular confidence of his integrity that I did not require a receipt; he ſent me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the following purport, that he would not bail me for a five penny bit, (or what is commonly termed a fip-penny bit). I reflected on mankind, and thought at that trying period of time, the ſin af ingratitude was the ſuperlative crime of nature—but I leave the wretch to his own feelings. At that identical time I had not one friend left in the city but William Lace, who publicly declared that he would abide by me, (as he thought I was wrong'd), to the laſt; he was not afraid of any conſequences, as he was well convinced of my innocence—that man (William Lace), I believe, poſſeſſes the ſoul of an independent and honeſt being, and is worthy of his creator; he frequently viſited me at the riſque of his life, while the Yellow fever was ravaging nearly indiſcriminately in all parts of the city, but more particularly in every quarter of the priſon. Lawyer Roſs viſited me, I ſtated my caſe to him, he imagined as the robbery had been ſo long dormant, it would not be found out; and he obſerved that many men from circumſtances appertaining to the law, were puniſhed though innocent, that I was ſo ſituated as not to hope (for the preſent), any mitigation of courſe. I got ſhaved by this time, and was removed by habeas corpus before Judge Shippen, who was ſitting about three miles from town; my worthy friend Mr. Lace procured two horſes and chairs, and gave a lawyer a fee. I ſet out accompanied with the head gaoler, Mr. Lace, and Mr. Lace's ſon; we came to Judge Shippen's reſidence. I laid down to the lawyer employ'd, the whole circumſtance, and particularly in what manner the outer and inner door could be opened, as thoſe locks were never in my poſſeſſion, and that thoſe doors muſt have been opened, before they could get at the vault door. However after all my trouble in relating every point, which I thought would have ſo operated, as to cauſe my diſcharge—I found myſelf diſappointed.</p>
            <p>We came before the Judge, and after waiting ſome time, Mr. Fox and his attorney, Mr. Rawle, came. The appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. Rawle to me (although he was retained againſt me), I was much pleaſed with, for I dearly love to ſee a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035752_0031_10066400B391C070"/>
good and ingenious workman in any profeſſion; the charge was then opened, and Mr. Fox being ſworn, he went on as near as I can recolect, thus, <abbr>viz</abbr> That the buſineſs of the Bank was removed to Carpenter's-Hall, that two iron doors from the old Bank of the book vault, were ſent to Mr. Lyon's ſhop, to have the hinges, and locks removed, &amp;c. The doors were ſent ſome where about the 9th or 10th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, but to a certainty it was on a Thurſday; ſeveral meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages were ſent to Mr. Lyon, to make as great ſpeed as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with the doors, and that Mr. Lyon was told that the doors were for the caſh vault. That another ſmith was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to hang the doors of the other vault and that the other ſmith did his work in a much ſhorter time; that he (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning myſelf), ſaid on his firſt examination, he did ſome work for Mr. Stocker during the time, that thoſe doors were in his pofeſſion, and he ſaid the Locks that were on thoſe doors were not worth a damn for a Bank; that his delay with the doors appeared ſuſpicious, as the Bank had been robbed. That the inſide door was hung firſt on the Saturday following, that he did nothing on the outſide door till Monday, that he (Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on), was known to work late the Saturday night when he had thoſe doors in his poſſeſſion. That he has endeavoured to ſuſpect a Mr. Robinſon, and another gentleman. Here it is neceſſary to pauſe a little to enquire who this ſaid gentleman was, whom Mr. Fox had ſuch an unlimitted confidence in, and of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity likewiſe; who was this ſaid gentleman but Iſaac Davis, the jaunting companion (ſometimes) of Smith the Caſhier, or information belies ſuch jaunting. The ſame Davis who was courting a relation, (if not a ſiſter), of the wife of the ſaid Smith; it would have been cruel indeed to have ſuſpected ſo amiable, ſo friendly, and ſo good a character, as this Iſaac Davis (alias the gentleman) was. (That is, Robinſon and the GENTLEMAN), as ſoon as they heard they were ſuſpected, came forward and gave a very good and ſatisfactory account of themſelves, and where they were the time the robbery was committed; that he (Lyon), told Mr. Haines the high conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he would not tell his ſuſpicions until he got his liberty; that on his ſecond examination he ſaid the inſide lock, was a good one, that having thoſe locks in his poſſeſſion we were jealous of him making falſe keys, as he is a good workman in that line which jealouſy hindered him from doing our work in future, or having any acquaintance in (or of), the Banks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035752_0032_10066403AB65A268"/>
Mr. Rawle then read the paper, that Mr. Stocker wrote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my ſecond examination, with Robinſon's name, but I did not know the name of the gentleman, who I ſaw drinking with him at Market-ſtreet ferry; but I told Mr. Stocker to ſend for Robinſon, and cloſe examine him; then aſk him who was drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, ſays I, the man who was along with Robinſon at Market-ſtreet ferry, is the perſon I mean, and whom I ſuſpect to have robbed the Bank. He (Mr. Rawle), then read the letter or paper that I wrote to Mr. Stocker, with the curious direction (as aforementioned), and that he was at Lewiſtown the time the robbery was committed, we are ſure of; and the account of his travail throughout we are in poſſeſſion of which is allowed to be true and juſt, but ſtill he is an ingenious man, and what Mr. Smith, the Caſhier, has repreſented to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuſpicious; his proving an alibi is to be ſure in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Judge Shippen then aſked the following queſtions, to wit. Mr. Fox have you ever had a former acquaintance with Mr. Lyon? Mr. Fox anſwered, I had often heard of him; he has made me a ſmoke-jack for the uſe of my houſe, which anſwered very well, and he did the work of the Bank before I was elected Preſident; the firſt job he did for the Bank under my direction, was his opening an iron cheſt, and I had always heard an honeſt charactor of him: he was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Bank by Mr. Stocker, in particular, and many others. Mr. Judge Shippen then obſerved that from what Mr. Fox had related to him, the ſuſpicion appeared well grounded and he could not take upon himſelf the power of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: therefore it would be proper to hold me to bail. My lawyer, then began to enquire after the bail; and for what ſum. The ground work, placed in his hands by me was totally neglected; which (I ſurmiſe) had it been properly handled in a true workman like manner, might have complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly operated for my diſcharge. I ſtood and heard a farce of unfounded (not to ſay ſtupid and groundleſs), ſuſpicions, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſically put together; fit only for the meridian of a tea-table; that (as far as I am able to judge) ſcientific men would have thought a mere bagatelle, and an inſult upon their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. I then aſked Mr. Fox in what manner the inner door was opened; allowing the robbery to have been committed from the cellar door. For the inner door lock was never in my poſſeſſion. Mr. Fox then began to <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> that ſome perſon was concealed in the body of the Bank. I then aſked Mr. Fox who had poſſeſſion of the keys of the vault? he anſwered,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035752_0033_10066406858E9B80"/>
Mr. Smith the Caſhier. I told Mr. Fox that neither of the locks were fit for the ſecurity of a Bank (I ſpoke as far as my profeſſional knowledge led me to ſuggeſt). I told him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that I would not truſt a bag full of King George the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's farthings under the ſecurity of ſuch locks. After ſeveral obſervations on the different methods of Bank work. I told them (that as a profeſſional man), I knew more about ſuch work, than the whole of them combined, and put together. Mr. Rawle replied; from that very cauſe we have got hold of you; as you are from every report (and what does a lawyer know, or plead on, but from report), an ingenious workman. I was then held to a bail of ſix thouſand dollars. Mr. Helm, the head goaler then ſtept forward, and ſaid, <hi>Sheaffer</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the buſineſs to come forward with. I was then ordered back to priſon, in expectation of getting bail. The bail being lowered to ſix thouſand dollars; I thought it would not cauſe me much trouble to raiſe a bail of ſix thouſand dollars. In this predicament, I ſent word to all that I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my friends; but every one of thoſe ſuppoſed friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed the idea of ſerving me: becauſe I was innocent, and unfortunate. Likewiſe public confidence (as far as related to me), being greatly diminiſhed by the injurious (and I think I am warranted to ſay unjuſt) repreſentations of the Bank. The only ſtaunch friend (even in this trying ſituation) was Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Lace. I was replaced in my former comfortable abode: (<abbr>viz.</abbr> cloſe confinement). Conſidering to myſelf, how I was placed, was a double ſeverity of mind, and feeling. I looked and judged of myſelf, as a ſtranger in a free and liberal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I knew nothing of the ſyſtematic plan, (or I might, if impaſſioned call it villainy), that had been repreſented againſt me. The robbery was ſtill immured under the murky veil of darkneſs, impoſſible at that preſent moment to be brought forward to the lucid glare of day. Situated as I was, and not a perſon abſolutely coming to my relief, I thought (and felt), that it was the hardeſt trial any man's mind and conſtitution could undergo. The bail was now reduced from 150,000 dollars to 6,000 dollars, which former ſum was demanded (or exacted) by Mr. Stocker; I now thought it was out of my power to raiſe even, 6,000 dollars; my mind (ſuppoſing I muſt bear the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of fate reſting on my ſhoulders, and a heavy burthen indeed it was), was quiet and eaſy. I here at this time found I had but one friend who was in town, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Mr. William Lace. It may be neceſſary at the peculiar and thoughtful moment
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035752_0034_100664082F78BD90"/>
which then occurred, to ſtate (as it was then a juſt idea) the view of my worldly concerns, to wit. When I left Philadelphia to eſcape the probable fatal effects of the Yellow fever, (not the Bank robbery), I poſſeſſed the following—I had a houſe full of furniture, every thing as complete as a perſon in my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would wiſh, and which coſt me between three and four hundred pounds; my winter wood was laid in; a ſmart young fellow for an apprentice, whoſe loſs I moſt ſincerely regret; I then had and now poſſeſs, (after all my hardſhips and ſufferings) a ſhop full of tools, that I do not believe there is ſuch in America, I am certain there is not ſuch a collection in Philadelphia; I had likewiſe 1400 dollars in the Bank of North America; the firſt depoſit was on the 17th of April, 1797, conſiſting of 860 dollars; the ſecond depoſit, November 3d 1797, of 220 dollars; the third depoſit was on the 14th Auguſt, 1798, of 410 dollars, and the checks I drew on ſaid Bank amounted to 90 dollars, which left a balance in my favour of 1400 dollars. The laſt circumſtance I ſhall here ſum up, (though it may appear whimſical) is my Will and Teſtament, which was drawn up, ſigned and ſealed, (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. North, &amp;c.) on the eighth day of Auguſt, in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-eight, a <hi>copy</hi> of which I ſubjoin: <abbr>viz.</abbr>

            <p>After a valuation of my houſhold furniture, my capital tools, ſtock in trade, and ready caſh, it would have amounted to 6,000 dollars at leaſt; ſo that whoever came forward to be my bail, could be no looſer. It was now drawing on towards the latter end of October, and after a few days return from my examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation before Judge Shippen; Haines the high conſtable, came to the room where I was under cloſe confinement, and aſked me if I would anſwer one queſtion. I replied, I would anſwer him any thing he pleaſed to aſk me. Says he, do you know
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035752_0036_1006640C8E6DD130"/>
one of the name of Majeſs, a pretended Engliſhman? I told him I did not; I aſked him if any perſon of ſuch a name, had any concern in the robbery? he ſaid,—No. He could not give me any reaſon for aſking after ſuch a man; but this was only a counterpart of his former deep, fly, wire-drawing projects. <hi>Sheaffer</hi> the <hi>convict,</hi> came and aſked me if I knew the clerk of the Alderman's Court; I told him I did not,—he anſwered, he (the clerk) knows you very well; perhaps he does, ſaid I. Says Sheaffer, do you know Captain Phelps; I told him I did not; ſays Sheaffer, he is very well acquainted with you; I told him that muſt be impoſſible, for I had never heard of ſuch a name, who could have the leaſt diſtant claim to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or acquaintance. Here at this identical period, I was informed by one of the convicts, that Sheaffer, with ſeveral others, (whether from a bribe, or their habituated principle of villany, I know not), intended ſhearing my life, character, or conſequence in life away—to blaſt my fame, and damn my poor remains of happineſs—but a conſcious feeling of my own innocence, baffled their endeavours, and in not the leaſt touched my ſoul with trouble, as I knew their dark machinations could have but little avail.</p>
            <p>There was a Mr. Murray came to the window of my priſon, to ſpeak with me; I was then (I ſuppoſe from that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance), ordered into a dungeon, but after ſome debate in the grand divan, I was excuſed by the head gaoler, under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive promiſe never more (while a priſoner, ſuppoſe), to ſpeak to any one at the window. At this time, my worthy friend Lace, was walking paſt the window, (but from what cauſe, I know not, was afraid to ſpeak to me), he waved his hand, but I did not underſtand him. I thought ſome perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, had formed and accompliſhed a deſign, and that villainouſly, for the ſake of the reward to ſwear againſt me. He ſhook his head at me, which I underſtood, as a ſignal that I was gone, which brought me to an ejaculation, and to my bended knees.</p>
            <p>About this time, I found myſelf rather ſickly; I begged for a little wine, but I could not get it. I was examined by the head gaoler, who was a good judge (at this time), of the Yellow fever, and he declared me out of danger. The weather now became extremely cold, and the coldneſs of the weather made me ſhiver and tremble. The convicts (generally ſpeaking), had fires, or a fire in their reſpective workſhops. Richard Guy got up one morning, when the froſt ſet in, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035752_0037_1006640F3B875970"/>
ſound himſelf very cold. I wonder, ſaid he, (whether to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or not, is left to the world), if they have allowed poor Lyon any fire, who is confined in a damp room of a priſon. He came to the priſon, and enquired, and found that I was not overheated within the walls of a cold, damp, unwholſome, loathſome, and ſolitary priſon. He reprimanded the conduct of the conductors of the priſon towards me, and as they would not wiſh to be guilty of the ſin to bluſh for ſhame; they conſcien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſly cauſed a fire to be kindled for the advantage, and comfort my ſuffering conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The long confinement I had experienced, and the hard uſage I had received, forced me to a conjecture that there was certainly ſome ſecret enemy ſaying cloſely in wait, for the deprivation of all human faculties, (my life), and the ſooner ſhortened the better; but my heart was good and firm: I knew and felt my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and that was my grand, great, and ſubſtantial ſupport. On the laſt day of the month of October, a diſcovery was made in the priſon, of a conſpiracy againſt me, (and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of the moſt black, dark, and malignant that human nature could, or might have ſuggeſted, cauſed, or formed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That when Sheaffer, (who may be in the eye of the law a very reſpectable character), and a doctor, whether a diſciple of Sangrado or not is out of my power to tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but both were criminals, and they acting (to wit, Sheaffer and the doctor) in conjunction and joined by a certain captain Phelphs, (a trio of infernals fit for Hell.) Thoſe three worthy gentlemen (though accident might make them criminals), had formed the plot as aforementioned for a conſiderable time, until it was diſcovered by ſome of their fellow convicts in priſon. The doctor came forward and confeſſed the whole to Mr. Helm, the head jaoler; after he had laid down to Mr. Helm this piece of villainy openly, he then came to the room where I was under confinement, and then and there told me, that John Sheaffer was the planner of the whole ſcheme, and that he employed a certain captain Phelps to embark in the buſineſs for what purpoſe I know not. Soon after this, Sheaffer came to the room where I was and brought another convict with him (to be a ſecond clauſe and bribed witneſs I ſuppoſe). He then addreſſed me as far as I can recollect, in the following words. Sir, that wicked doctor, I find, has been telling Mr. Helm a parcel of lies; I never had any converſation with Mr. Smith reſpecting you, no farther than I told him you was an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man. Our buſineſs was about ſome forged checks: (the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035752_0038_100664110FFFB018"/>
Caſhier I ſuppoſe) might enter into a collateral converſation in regard to the checks. The doctor had given me a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good idea of proceedings before, and what Sheaffer now told me, ſeem'd to me to have ſuch a correſponding effect on my mind, that I anſwered Sheaffer in this manner, <abbr>viz.</abbr> (It might be improper or impaſſioned, You, and Mr. Smith may both go to hell. You are right my friend ſaid Sheaffer, and marched off. In a few hours after the head gaoler came into my room, and ſaid there are freſh orders. What are they, ſaid I. You muſt go into the eaſt-wing of the priſon; I anſwered, "Thy will be done." There is another priſoner coming here, ſaid he. Pray, Sir, (quoth I), what is his crime? On account, (he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied) of the Bank. Well, Sir, ſays I, I hope you have got the right one, for my ſufferings have been, and are now very great. I was then conducted into the eaſt-wing, where common thieves and vagrants remain for trial; all the different apartments were wet, owing to ſcrubbing the rooms to cleanſe the infection from that part of the priſon, where the Yellow fever with that malignity peculiar to itſelf, had been ravaging and laying waſte every thing before it; I was put into the room No. 12, where I found two more unfortunates encaged for the ſame crime, I was myſelf; we were now allowed ſome wood to make a fire to dry the rooms, &amp;c. and towards night, I ſat down in company with about eight or ten priſoners, in this bleſſed and beautified place for different crimes, and ſome of the company that compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a part of the aggregate, appeared to me the moſt deſperate men I ever ſaw. One in particular entertained, (if an innocent man could think it ſo, the company with a compendious hiſtory of part of his life, and introduced triumpthantly a long train of villanies: in ſhort, I conceived he was the wickedeſt man I ever ſaw, (or ever wiſh to ſee.

obſervation had ſuch a wonderful effect upon my unſought for companion, that it ſoftened the wickedneſs of his heart ſo much, he inſtantaneouſly jumped up, and found me a pillo; ſaying, my friend, this is not a ſit place for you. Next day the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners formed themſelves into different companies, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeleſt part of them, (if any could be properly termed genteel) took poſſeſſion of No. 9, and ſtrongly invited me there; But being a mere uncultivated ſtranger, it was ſome time before I would conſent to be linked with this genteel, or gentleman-like ſociety or company; at laſt I agreed. There were none admitted in this grand company, but thoſe on ſuſpicion of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and great crimes, ſuch as for inſtance, forgery, <hi>robbing Banks,</hi> &amp;c. The priſoners for trial were removed from Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's building. They now introduced another priſoner on ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of robbing the Bank of Pennſylvania; he was admitted into our room. There being on his admiſſion, four of us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined at the ſame time, for the ſame charge; but to confine, deprive men of liberty, deſtroy character, wantonly, with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous variety of et ceteras, on mere paltry, and vague innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endos or ſuſpicions, is a cruelty perhaps not ſanctioned in any other country but this, which ſhould be the grand emporium of liberty: Myſelf confined on ſuſpicion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king falſe keys: Two others found in a tavern, for playing at cards for a dollar per game: And a young lad for having the pleaſing misfortune of being in poſſeſſion of a fifty dollar note, on the Bank of the United States; Smith, the Caſhier, took him before Squire Jennings; but the great, honeſt, and Cheſter county Caſhier, of the Bank of Pennſylvania, did, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the report of the lad; ſhew him (the lad), but little hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.

Having deſcribed four priſoners, the fifth one who was put into the room where I was under cloſe confinement, was put in the priſon for keeping company with the young (lad, who was put in priſon for having the fifty dollar note).

brief (but I believe a juſt deſcription of captain Phelps), who was out of doors acting in conjunction with that amiable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, (known I believe throughout the United States by the name of John Sheaffer) for, and on account of propoſitions laid down to them, to receive an hire for villainy (perhaps heared of villainy or unheard of villainy), that is immaterial at preſent. Phelps was ſpeaking juſtly and fairly, as honeſt a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to be truſted with an oath, as many others, (to ſwear the life and character of an honeſt man away, to have, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or cauſe for the gallows, though that man whoſe life was to ſwear away, was innocent), and was like others, as deep an endy'd ſcoundrel as ever diſgraced walking the ſurface of the Earth; and Sheaffer and company (it is rumoured) were his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, and companions. He (this captain Phelps) would (if poſſible), ſwear away the life of any man, for the ſake of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. (Juſtice being out of the caſe, or it was immaterial to Phelps), for like all the <hi>raſcally</hi> retainers of the law, for the ſake of a reward; he could guelph down both law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience without feeling pain or compunction: and Phelps for doing this was a hireling, (eight dollars the reward) for what? to ſwear wrong, or right for the ſake of the ſee, the wicked gave againſt the innocent. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I was then in, expecting to be ſtarved, or doomed to more miſery, than I had already received; (though an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent object of miſery, cruelly ſituated in regard to myſelf) I expected to be plunged into a ſtate of ſtarvation, through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> means of an invidious individual.</p>
            <p>About this time, one of my old journeymen who had a particular regard for me; wrote a letter, and gave it into the hands of Mr. Lace, the contents of the letter, were feeling, friendly, innocent, but unguarded; the purport was thus, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to keep up a good heart, there was no fear, and ſuch like. Mr. Lace examined the letter, and prudently witheld it, (as the police of Philadelphia, whoſe fondneſs for commiſſion on ſlight ſuſpicion, is but too prevalent, might have transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meaning of this letter, wrote in a ſtyle of ſimplicity and unlettered partiality), as it might have been the cauſe of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; by the bye, every letter muſt be ſent into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unſealed—in a day or two, Mr Lace with the journeyman alluded to, with him, got leave to viſit me. I complained of the ſeverity I ſuſtained, and begged of the journeyman to go and bring me one of my beds from my houſe. I told them of the plot that had been formed, (by the fertilized brains of two
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035752_0041_100664186F5EA1F8"/>
complete villains); to wit, Sheaffer, and the Doctor, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs, and the arch villain termed captain Phelps, a noted ſwindler, and and one of Doll Tearſheets' captains. Mr Lace was ſtruck with horror at the recital, and begged me to have no converſation with any of them, to ſhun and avoid ſpeaking of my profeſſion in any point of view whatever; by this time the twenty dollars that was ſent by Mr. Fox, and Mr. Stocker, (though both had complimented me with the ſending twenty dollars each, and raiſed my expectations to forty dollars) was expended. Mr Lace procured me one of my beds, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I now began to ſee into the internal regulations of the priſon. A priſoner was one afternoon playing a game of drafts, the board and what are called men, had been cut out with a knife; he was ſeized by the collar—I addreſſed the keeper thus, or nearly in the following words, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Pray Sir, where are you going to take this man? To the cells—he replied; for what, ſays I? his anſwer was, for playing at drafts—pray, Sir, quoth I, where is the great crime in that, conſider and feel what are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humanity: conſider this man is naturally a brother, and perhaps innocent of his charge—you don't know whoſe hands, yourſelf may fall into yet—you make dreadful play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of the keys of the cells—conſider Sir, the crime of being the cauſe of ſlow murder.

he was a conſtant viſitor there. It is cuſtomary in every room when the priſoners are locked up at night, to have a bucket; and the rule is, whoever makes uſe of the bucket firſt, muſt carry it down in the morning: it happened one night, that the bucket had been uſed by ſome of the priſoners; but by whom, it was not exactly known; however to end all diſputes, the Bible was got, and every one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n that room ſwore, he did not uſe the bucket that night. This is a ſpecimen of what an ingenious criminator might effect amongſt ſuch a ſet of worthy diſciples, eſpecially if he carried the means of ſeeing with him; and a juſt ſpecimen of what you will find in Philadelphia priſon. But this kind of falſe ſwearing was not confined to the priſon; but others (their) accomplices out of doors, true brothers in iniquity, endeavoured to effect the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I now began to underſtand by the priſoners, the meaning of the term, which I had heard uſed by Mr. Fox, the Preſident of the Bank, <abbr>viz.</abbr> The term <hi>Dubb,</hi> it is a flaſh term uſed for key, and is uſed among thieves. I underſtood from them, that there were (rum dubbs, que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r dubbs, fluted dubbs,) and ſuch a man was a good dubbſman; this (as I learned, from the genteel company, I was unjuſtly confined with), is the genuine explanation of the term or ord dubb, which term I never had heard before it fell from the lips of Mr. Fox the Preſident.

            <p>Captain Phelps' character was very well underſtood by ſeveral of the priſoners, but a more infamous character, (if what I heard was true, and of the truth of which information I have not the leaſt doubt), ever came to my notice: but as the man was dead, it gave me no concern; it may, however, be reduced to a certainty, that he had taken ſeveral falſe oaths at ſo low a rate as ſix dollars. From report, a gentleman inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to me, had viſited this notorious villain ſeveral times; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably with a view to give latitude to his intentions. The next that was hired on this nefarious buſineſs, was one of the name of Miller, a former convict and who was in for another offence: I found by his diſcourſe, he was a ſapper and miner under the orders of General John Sheaffer, and a certain gentleman; but I followed the advice of my worthy friend Lace, to hold little converſation with any of the convicts; nor give an idea to any villain of my workmanſhip. I told Miller I could not do the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035752_0043_1006641BC610CBA0"/>
work I was charged with, and that I did not follow key mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was only a rough ſmith. Miller and the reſt of his gang, gave up the idea of wire drawing any unguarded expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from me. The Robbery ſtill remained undiſcovered, and my treatment hard: no friend was admitted to ſee me, or communicate with me. If I wrote a few lines, they were burnt or deſtroyed. If Mr. Lace wrote to me, it was the ſame. I was obliged when priſoners were diſcharged, to write him by means of their conveyance, to prevent him giving himſelf too much trouble on my account, as he earneſtly felt for my ſituation: one night after all the priſoners were locked up, the head gaolor came to the door where I was confined, and called me by name: I anſwered, Sir. Have you got a brother, ſays he, yes Sir, I replied, where is he? I don't know, here I pauſed, for I did not know but they might have hauled him into priſon as well as myſelf; as the leaſt ſuſpicion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what I had experienced myſelf might warrant ſuch an act. At laſt I anſwered, if you aſk Mr. Ludlam, the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he can tell you; the gaoler told me he was dead at New-York of the Yellow fever, this circumſtance was more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me, than if he had undergone, one weeks puniſhment, ſuch as I had experienced he muſt (from puniſhment like mine), have fallen a victim for Potter's-field, his conſtitution being broke, and his health greatly impaired before. About the 14th of November, Jonathan Smith, the Caſhier, ſent for me out of the eaſt-wing of the priſon. The room when I went below, and where he was waiting for me, had every thing cleared away but a few chairs, hand-cuffs, &amp;c. when I entered the room, the goaler ſhut the door; Smith then began, well, Mr. Lyon, you are here yet. I took a chair to ſit down; but while ſitting down, I ſaid the following words, to this great Caſhier, <hi>Yes, Sir, I am here yet,</hi> and if it had not been for your ſpeculation, I ſhould have been out before this. Why ſo, what ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine? did you not go perſonally and tell thoſe people that were to have been my bail, that you was ſure I had a hand in the buſineſs? yes, ſays he, and <hi>I am ſure of it;</hi> and at the ſametime, kept winking with his ſtarboard eye, with all the appearance of low cunning, the moſt conſumate gentleman could make uſe of: for the purpoſe I imagine, of extracting from my countenance, ſomething or other that he might make uſe of to my injury; at thoſe words I took fire, I told him his inſinuations were falſe, and that through his means and others, I was ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035752_0044_1006641E7854D278"/>
and all they could do now, was to take me out of priſon and crucify me. He got tired by this time of winking with his ſtarbord eye, and then ſet too with his larboard eye, and put that in motion. We, ſaid he, have ſound the keys, and can prove you made them. I defy you and all the ſeed of Adam to prove that I was ever guilty of a mean action. You (ſays he) ſhall be kept in priſon, you ſhall be tried at the bar. I can bear, ſaid I, my confinement and puniſhment with glory, being honoured with feelings ariſing from innocence—we parted. I muſt confeſs my temper was warmed, owing to his long inſinuating winking, which would have more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Billingſgate fiſh-woman, or a Poiſſarde of Paris, than a Caſhier of a State Bank. I was next viſited by a Mr. Samuel Rhoads, (and a gentleman with him) an entire ſtranger to me; here I thought it was requiſite for me to be upon my guard. He then began his ſtory, to wit. Mr. Lyon my ſmoke-jack is out of order, I am ſorry for that, Sir, ſaid I; cannot you, ſaid he, tell what is the matter with it: I ſmiled, and was obliged to bite my under lip to prevent me from laughing, and then told him if I ſaw the jack there was a probability I could tell him what was the matter; but not elſe. What time do you expect to get out? I cannot tell you, Sir, I am willing to ſatisfy the public in any legal form, enquiry, or otherwiſe; but do not expect to get out before next court. Well, ſays he, I muſt wait. The gentleman who was a ſtranger to me, then addreſſed me. Mr. Lyon, what is the charge alledged againſt you? I told him. They certainly cannot keep you here if there is no oath againſt you; have you got any money, becauſe you can make them pay ſweetly for keeping you here. I gave him no ſatisfaction as to that point; but I ſaid, if I am brought to the bar, I am informed there may be a ſomething, have a cloudy appearance, againſt Smith the Caſhier. What, ſays Mr. Rhoads, ſomething appear againſt Smith the Caſhier? Yes, ſays I, it is rumoured abroad I underſtand, that he is ſuppoſed to have been at the bottom of this buſineſs; (indeed, ſays I, I told him ſo myſelf). Says Mr. Rhoads, why don't you apply to George Ludlam, he is your friend; Sir, ſays I, ſince I have been in this place, all my friends, (generally ſpeaking), have left me, and ſome of them to whom I have lent conſiderable ſums of money; but I poſſeſs the ſpirit of independence: I will wait with patience 'till they can keep me no longer—we then parted, they went into an adjoining room, for what purpoſe I know not, but in caſes of this kind, there was room to ſuſpect it was not about

               </gap> the Bank's ſuſpicions againſt Davis). I have had dealings with Mr. Morris frequently; but muſt confeſs, he appeared to me not always to confine himſelf to the principles of truth, but rather to the contrary; and when I find out a liar, (according to the old proverb, a liar is not to be believed though he accidentally ſpeaks truth), I look upon him, as never to be by me believed. I was afterwards brought down from the eaſt-wing of the priſon, in the north-wing, and to my ſurpriſe there ſtood Mr. Morris in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He proceeded in his leſſon in the following manner, Mr. Lyon did you finiſh my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I began to tell him the particulars, and in the courſe of the narration, relating to him, the hard uſage I had endured, he deſired me to ſtop. Well, ſays he, <hi>I</hi> am one of the Directors of the Bank; (are you Sir, I replied), and laſt night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"It appears that one Iſaac Davis, a carpenter, and a noted democrat, in conjunction with a porter belonging to the Bank, who died of the ſever, were the ſole agents in this nefarious buſineſs. Davis had ſet up his carriage and pair, and pretended that an India<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

            <p>"N. B. Citizen Davis had made off."</p>
            <p>The name of Davis I knew not, or which of the porters were concerned with him, I was equally at a loſs to know; at this time, I was even unacquainted with the names of either of the porters of the Bank. However, I made ſtrict enquiry of Mr. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n, the head goaler, who gave me this information, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "That it was one Davis a carpenter, who wrought at the Bank, and one Cunningham a porter belonging to ſaid Bank." The name of Cunningham was not more familiar to my ear than the name of Davis, for I knew neither. I then wrote to my tried friend Lace, to endeavour to get my liberty. He waited on Mr Fox, but got no ſatisfactory anſwer: he wrote to me in priſon that he would bring me my diſcharge in a few ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, which was what I had long been expecting, and on account of ſuch information, gave an additional quickneſs of hearing to me, and an additional expectation likewiſe, being glad to hear, receive, and indulge myſelf, on ſuch information; I was preparing to have the diſmality attending on, and the horreſcent ſcene of a <hi>Priſon.</hi> But reſentment had not yet quitted the malignant breaſt of ſome ſecret enemy, (which I verily believe) I had in that Bank, and who from the ſeveral ideas of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low priſoners, which were regularly entertained by them, caſt a deep ſuſpicion in my mind, upon a particular individual; (and who are better judges of a ſchool-maſter than his ſcholars). My fellow priſoners wrote to Smith the Caſhier, and (from what influence I know not), were by degrees diſcharged under the orders of the Mayor. I do not know what weight, (in the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035752_0047_10066425A3BAA6F8"/>
ſcale of juſtice or influence), might have been thrown in. If I had wrote a whining, canting, hypocritical, and deſpicable let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Bank, like ſome perſons: there might I believe have been ſome repugnance againſt their uniform ſyſtem of cruelty; but truly ſpeaking my mind, I would have ſooner died under the hardſhips an innocent man ſuffered, than I would have diſgraced my firmneſs, as a man, to aſk a paltry boon from a character like Smith, the Caſhier. Independent, native, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty forbade it. For in the firſt place, he came to the priſon and falſely accuſed me; and I had previouſly heard, that this Machiavel was the moſt inveterate enemy I had in the Bank: and in the ſecond place, (if I could judge of the ſyſtem laid down by Lavater), there appeared a down, ſullen, hanging, and revengful look about him, that made me think if I was a Judge upon a criminal caſe, ſuch a priſoner would not not have gained much by the favour of nature; but I believe mankind may miſtake on the principles of phyſiognomy, for many a man, with a fine appearance, has deſerved the gallows, and many a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diamond, has been unjuſtly puniſhed, becauſe he had a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ough outſide. My worthy friend, Mr. Lace, went to Mr. Hallowell the attorney, to know why I was detained in priſon. Mr. Hollowell waited upon Mr. Fox, who received him complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly with one of his tea table obſervations, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham, (the man deceaſed accuſed, and whoſe evidence now can be of no avail before any human judicature); might have dealt with me for falſe keys, as well as any other man. And that they were determined to puniſh me as far as the law would admit of. Here all my friends at this trying criſis bore the aſpect of alarm; bluſhing at, (as they ſuppoſed), ſuch unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable conduct. Then under ſuch a conſideration, my worthy friend Mr. Lace, was adviſed to employ Mr. Dallas, counſellor at law, (who I believe is the honeſt man's friend, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent expounder of the law—and though he may have ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, merit always cauſes them; yet he is I believe the a juſt and worthy lawyer).</p>
            <p>I now got a new pair of ſtockings, and obſerved as I had worn a pair of old ſtockings for eight weeks, the ſervice they had undergone would pay for the new; and I ſent the old ones to Lace to give an emblematical idea of the priſon. I began at this time to prepare for trial, and did not know, but ſome gentlemen might endeavour to have a ſecond edition of their former works in folio, not rough, but neatly bound, and lettered. Under ſuch apparent circumſtances, I ſent for a
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035752_0048_1006642A62BC8C30"/>
quire of paper, and wrote (as far as I was able, conſidering every thing), my travail and defence. After completing the whole, the keeper of the eaſt wing of the priſon came to me, after locking up, and told me that my friend Lace was below, waiting for, or ready to receive my writings, which I delivered to the keeper, but my writings were debarred going beyond the confines of the priſon door. In leſs than ten minutes after this, Mr. Fox ſent up ſtairs for one of the name of Martin, who was in for forging notes on the Bank of Pennſylvania; whatever paſſed between Mr. Fox and Martin, was none of my concern I thought; be that as it may, the ſtratagem I believe was effected, and my writings I ſuppoſe fell into the hands of Mr. Fox, which gave me but very little uneaſineſs. In ſhort, if Mr. Fox had read my writings, he muſt have ſeen by them, that he had no impulſe, feelingly, to act againſt me from motives of his own; but I believe he had a prompter behind the curtain, to teach him the ſcenes of tragedy.</p>
            <p>It was, (by whoſe order I know not), a Mr. Wood, a clerk to, or for the priſon, who ſtopt my writings, and which I think he had no right to do, as it was taking the advantage of an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and innocent priſoner. And believe every priſoner has a right to write to any friend; providing there is no relation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it of conſpiracy of ſuch like. But no, it ſeems (ſays <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to myſelf), there is a policy, to get as many mechanics in the convict yard as poſſible, and be ſure, (ſays this narrow minded policy), get as many old countrymen, (as the term is commonly uſed), as you can; it is not much matter under what pretence.</p>
            <p>The court where my trial was to have been, was in ſuch a ſtate of prolongation, that many worthy and reſpectable men, thought it was cruel, wanton, and malicious in the Bank, (or their agents), to do as they did towards me, as every unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced and unjaundiced eye, could without winking diſcern their ſpleen. It was therefore thought proper that I ſhould be removed by a ſecond habeas corpus, before the Supreme Court. My friend Mr. Lace, by this time had employed Mr. Dallas, (of whoſe ability and integrity I unqueſtionably entertained a high opinion), in favour of me. Though I thought it was as ſtrange, as it is inconſiſtent with reaſon, to employ a lawyer to defend an innocent man: but when I took a view of the train of villainy, which had been carried on againſt me, I clearly perceived it required as much trouble to extricate an innocent man from Philadelphia priſon, as it did a guilty one; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict-yard,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035752_0049_1006642BE7BD62B8"/>
and policy thereof, (as far as I could judge from reflection and obſervation), are enough to make humanity ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as perhaps there may be many an innocent man ſuffering years of ſlavery, therefore it requires every exertion of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to be uſed in his defence; particularly if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mechanic, and what is termed an old countryman likewiſe. A few days previous to my removal before the Supreme Court, my friend Mr. Lace called on me at the priſon, and told every circumſtance in regard to my removal; and that Mr. Ingerſol the Attorney-General, was to plead againſt me. I told Mr. Lace, I thought it was hard I ſhould be ſouſed; but if Mr. Ingerſol is againſt me, I know he will do every thing in his power to hurt me, becauſe he has a private animoſity againſt me, on account of trade. On the 14th of December, 1798. I dreſſed myſelf, and about 10 o'clock, I was ſent for out of the eaſt wing of the priſon, to be conducted before the Supreme Court by one of the Keepers: however I would not go over the priſon door, until my writings were reſtored to me. After ſome deliberation I got my writings, which contained moſt of the former part of this work; I was then conducted before the Supreme Court, accompanied by one of the keepers, and my ſteady and conſtant friend Mr. Lace. After waiting ſome time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> was called up before the three Judges, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Judges M. Kean, Shippen, and Smith. Mr. Fox ſwore nearly to the ſame effect as he did before Judge Shippen, when I was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by habeas corpus the firſt time; and he want over the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions which I delivered before Mr. Stocker, which was about ſix weeks before the robbery was diſcovered; and in thoſe ſuſpicions, as I have related before in this work, concerning Robinſon the carpenter, and his companion; I thought I had good grounds for ſuſpecting them from their confuſed appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the ſight of me, when drinking together at Market-ſtreet ferry; and their nice inſpection of the locks when at my ſhop.</p>

From ſuch an oath as this, it was eaſy to conceive any perſon's drift; in ſhort, a diſappointed gentleman, might not know in what manner to bring his ſwearing to bear, becauſe the reader may obſerve, there is in this oath, the colour of gold, of copper, of ſilver, of lead, and ſeveral mixtures. Here I cannot help making one obſervation, with regard to my phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomonical knowledge, and I do publicly declare, I can read a man's conſcience, and will not be deceived at a leſs propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than as one to ſix. At this time I could read Smith the Caſhier, through and through; and it appeared to me the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible mark of conſcience was perceivably depicted on his brow, though fate may have ordained him for another purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Robinſon ſwore, (the companion and intimate of Iſaac Davis), this Quiz, (for the Bank ſent me to the flaſh ſchool), was in ſuch a condition, that the Judges were obliged, to tell him to hold up his head, and ſpeak out; and many of the ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

As they ſaid he confeſſed I told him of the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the locks more than once, which proves that my knowledge of the crippled ſtate of that Bank was not wrong; but well founded. His oath upſet Mr. Fox's, as he ſwore, the outſide door of the vault was hung firſt.</p>
            <p>John alias Jack Haines ſaddler, and high conſtable and one of the wire-drawers of the Bank of Pennſylvania or their agents—ſwore, that he viſited me twice, and that I told him I knew who committed the robbery; and that I obſerved to him, I would not te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

(Mr. Fox ſwore miſtakenly once, which can be proved); but this evidence wound up the whole; I declare I never heard a man ſwallow the gudgeon before ſo completely (I am much obliged to the Bank for the knowledge of ſome phraſeology I occaſionly make uſe of, as they ſent me to a well educated ſeminary): But the reward I believe was his object, and like a man dreaming that he had a large

quantity of caſh in his fiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and awaking in the morning found it to be a dream, and being a ſhadow inſtead of reality, feels forcibly the diſappointment. I muſt acknowledge, I ſported with him, when I ſuſpected the reward was his object, and he very artfully turned the word <hi>ſuſpect,</hi> into the word <hi>know</hi>—my ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions with regard to Mr. Robinſon, and his companion, was all along kept ſecret until this time; when to my great ſurpriſe the ſtrange gentleman that came to my ſhop, with Robinſon, and whom I had a phyſiognomonical view of at Market-ſtreet fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this ſtrange gentleman and companion to Robinſon, turned out to be Iſaac Davis who robbed the Bank, and in whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion the money was found. This is ſome proof of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, only by looking a man in the face, and it is the deepeſt knowledge I know of. The Attorney-General began; I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this gentleman's conduct before, and I was not the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he went on with my travel from Philadelphia and with a great many inſinuations thereon, much to my diſadvantage, and which were not founded upon fact. Mr. Dallas pleaded feelingly for my long ſuffering, and proving an Alibi, was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have diſcharged me. The Attorney-General then read the depoſition of Samuel Wheeler. This depoſition I have frequently applied for; but could not obtain, which I am well aware of, I ought to have obtained, which was either falſe, or malicious. One obſervation the Attorney-General advanced was a poſitive truth, to wit, that I had expreſſed in priſon, that I was only a common Smith, and never made keys, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed any perſon to come forward and prove that they ever ſaw me make a key of any deſcription: this part I acknowledge to be true, as I was adviſed to do ſo on account of the villainous deſign that was plotting to ſwear away my life; to deny that I was a lock-ſmith, in any point of view. The Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General got this information I ſuppoſe from Smith, the Caſhier: who frequently viſited the thieves in that priſon—whether he carried the means to fee with him, I cannot tell. He then read the paper, which Mr. Stocker wrote on my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond examination, which is ſeveral times related in this work. The reader will ſee, how well my ſuſpicions were grounded; Robinſon was then aſked by one of the Judges if he was well acquainted with Davis: he began to make anſwer (but was ordered again to hold up his head, and ſpeak out), he ſaid he knew him when he was 'prentice, and had been intimate with him ever ſince. The Attorney-General then began (but I muſt not ſay to his credit) to deliberate on the oath of the renowned <hi>Black-ſmith</hi> Samuel Wheeler, which was his chief
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035752_0052_100664320A14FE60"/>
ground work. And the lock of the Supreme Court, had the ſame finiſh, (which Samuel Wheeler ſwore it ſhould not): let any lock-ſmith, or any other black-ſmith, even Smith the Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier, I ſay what muſt they think of a man, who has ſworn either falſly and maliciouſly or from ignorance, that the ſcrews of the cap of ſuch a lock, were always filed off fluſh with the lock-plate. I tell the public (I have no occaſion to tell profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal men) that the cap ſcrews of iron rim-locks are always rounded at the points, and ſcrewed about two threads through the lock-plate, and not filed off fluſh as Samuel Wheeler <hi>ſwore.</hi> There is no large lock filed off fluſh with the lock-plate, or plates except mortice-locks: this is a piece of information ſimple as it appears, that will ſerve to give Samuel Wheeler, a leſſon he did not know any thing of. Here is another ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance of Samuel Wheeler's judgment in Bank-locks, he was ſent to repair a lock as I am informed, by the ſmith who alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the doors for the other vault: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Quaker did not ſwear but affirmed, that I ſaid the locks were good and could not be picked, I never had any converſation with the man about locks of any diſcription in my life; but it appeared to me he was brought forward to ſerve a purpoſe. Robinſon the companion of Iſaac Davis, could not deny but I told him of the deficiency of thoſe locks, more than twelve months prior to the robbery; and I can prove I did publickly, and yet Jontie from motives which I ſhall endeavour hereafter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,

brought this Quaker to ſwallow the gudgeon—lucky in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for me Captain Phelps was dead. However, I could not get John Haines' oath and I aſked (as he had already ſworn, that I ſent for him), if he could tell by whom, he could not, nor <hi>can</hi> tell of any perſon I ſent to him to this day; but he being fond of a lazy life, (if a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las made ſeveral very feeling remarks ſo as to operate forcibly on the minds of all preſent, to effect my diſcharge: but the oath of Smith the Caſhier, with his wax, clay, putty, plaiſter of Paris and the Devil and himſelf knows what, Haines' ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ariſing from mortified diſappointment, and Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's ignorant and miſtaken oath.—The honourable Judge M'Kean held me to a bail of two thouſand dollars. I have no reflection to caſt on any of the honourable Judges of the court, for if falſe evidence is levelled againſt a priſoner, it will no doubt cauſe him to be held to bail, and ſometimes cauſe him to be hanged. Mr. Dallas turned to me, and aſked if I could raiſe bail for the above ſum I anſwered I could not tell, as it appeared to me I was a ſtranger in the land. A Mr. Bryden being in the court came forward as one of my bail, I aſked him how much he could bail me for, he ſaid he would bail me for £.800 this was more than two thouſand dollars; but it was neceſſary to have two, I was permitted to go to my neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, under the care of the keeper of the eaſt wing of the priſon; I went to the houſe of Richard Guy, and aſked him if he would bail me for one thouſand dollars, he anſwered yes, five thouſand if you want it.

               <p>Thus finiſhes this dialogue for the preſent; but as there is another ſimilar, which took place between the ſame parties, after the bill was found IGNORAMUS, I ſhall take notice of it in turn. I then began to enquire into the character of Smith, the Caſhier of the Bank of Pennſylvania, and was told that he was originally bred to country work. I was inclined to believe the report from two cauſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> He had been a bitter enemy againſt me, that inclined me to believe a report however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. The ſecond was from his appearance, manners, and language, correſpondent with thoſe of black-ſmiths, butchers, ſailors, cart-drivers, &amp;c. But a man who has been put into the office of one of the State Banks, to make uſe of ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as he did, and to ſay that he was ſorry an innocent man had got out of priſon, and that they would uſe him worſe and confine him longer; I aſk if all this was conſiſtent, for a man in his then preſent ſituation. Mrs. Smith no doubt ſaw the ſide which her huſband had taken, and was apprehenſive for his ſafety. The circumſtance of binding me down was very eaſily effected, for this was the only truth he ſwore, to wit, my ſaying in priſon that I would be revenged on him. But the ſtratagems which were carried on by the Bank, wind up the whole, which they had carried on under their idea of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The ſtory of Smith being bred to country work, I found to be falſe; as I have it from good authority that he was brought up to be a quill driver from a boy and ſeldom or ever country bumpkins carry pen-knives with them.</p>
               <p>I now had time to lay my hard, though innocent caſe, before Mr. Dallas who told me all he wanted of me was to get ſome perſons to come forward and give me a good character and to bring them forward; I told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> one of the Banks, I anſwered that was true, and the Bank of Pennſylvania is apprehenſive that it is ſome of their money. As I have already given the reader an account of the ſtatement of my Bank book in the former part of this work, it will be needleſs to go over the ſame ground. I told Mr. Dallas I would ſatisfy the world on that point, he ſaid that was all that was wanting; but Mr. Dallas added they may be inquiſitive to know how you made this money, I told him I would bring my books and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtatement of my worldly affairs, &amp;c. Several of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances were very buſy in collecting every information reſpecting the unjuſtifiable conduct of the Bank towards me, I was told that John Corneck who keeps the ſign of the Horſe and Groom in Stawberry-alley, had ſome information to give me. I went to Mr. Corneck and took a friend with me, he informed me that Cunningham, the porter, who ſlept in the Bank (as the term is), one night was obliged to ſleep at his houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he could not get into the Bank to ſleep, owing to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar miſtake, to wit, after Cunningham had locked up the Bank, and Smith and him coming away, (Cunningham going to get his ſupper I ſuppoſe, and then to return to the Bank to ſleep). Smith handed Cunningham a key, which was not the key of the front door; but Cunningham going to the Bank with an intent to ſleep I ſuppoſe, or to make neceſſary arrangements for robbing it, I know not; be that as it may, the key that Cunningham had, would not fit the front door lock, therefore Cunningham was obliged to ſleep at Mr. Corneck's that night: and Mr. Corneck publicly declared that he ſaw Cunningham go to bed, and he ſaw Cunningham tye this key to his neck with his garter, and he ſlept with the key all night. I will leave to the readers to judge what key this muſt have been. Being under bail, it was impoſſible for me to ſettle my mind to my profeſſional buſineſs, and being very ſucceſsful in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every circumſtance, ſo as to make the Bank no doubt in the eyes of many appear inconſiſtent and ridiculous.—I found out where both the watchmen were, belonging to the Bank, and had the opportunity of examining both thoſe honeſt men: (who were implicated by Smith the Caſhier) and in ſhort their commitment was wrote, and the Mayor was heſitating whether to ſend both thoſe poor men to priſon, or not. At preſent the watchmen don't like to ſay much about it.</p>

But how cunningly thoſe geniuſes of poppy and wormwood were acting, is a long myſtery, like the labyrinth of Daedalus, not eaſily found out.

Stocker, I was thrown into an unwholeſome priſon, where the Yellow fever raged with a forcible degree of malignity, there being at the time between twenty and thirty caſes of that ravaging diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order then in priſon; ſeveral of the keepers died that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſerved me with neceſſaries; during which time, being ſix weeks under cloſe confinement, and without a bed; I have been twenty-four hours without a morſel to eat, or a drop of water to drink, beſides the extreme danger I ran in loſing my life, by that terrible, calamitous, and tremendous diſorder, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the Yellow fever; and likewiſe by falſe repreſentations a heavy bail was exacted, which bail, (from my ſituation and ſuch repreſentations, public confidence being diminiſhed in regard to me), was out of my power to command. At length ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three months impriſonment, eight weeks of which I was in one pair of ſtockings; being denied every neceſſary commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with my friends, and held on ſuſpicion without an oath, (or any ground for an oath), againſt me; ſuffering all the inconvenience of a loathſome and unwholſome priſon, then under the ſcourge of the prevailing malignity of 1798), which no tongue can deſcribe, nor man's feelings conceive, unleſs in the then peculiar ſituation—the loſs of my trade by getting into other channels, during my confinement; the vaſt expence and accumulation of debt, during my impriſonment, from ſhop and houſe rent; loſs of my time in my profeſſion; furniture and valuable tools decaying and ruſting; and above all, the deprivation of character, which I ſuffered, (or muſt ſuffer), in the eſtimation of my fellow citizens of the United States; and ſuch depreciation of character no doubt will reach Europe, where my aged parents, (if living), reſide, which on their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether juſt or falſe), may according to the old but war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted ſaying, bring their grey hairs wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To hear the harſh tidings of a ſon being brought to a trial for life and death, muſt ſtrain and break the heart ſtrings of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental affection. Any honeſt man muſt conſider his character as the moſt ineſtimable treaſure in his poſſeſſion, and of which he ought to be a vigilant guardian; but if wreſted from him by means he cannot guard againſt, he has only to lament that

Reſting on my idea of your juſtice, I ſubmit this addreſs, and to ſum up the whole, I wante a recompence for all my real loſſes, my ſufferings, and my depreciation of character, which I humbly conceive to be a juſt, honeſt, and honourable demand; and under every conſideration of my caſe, either generally or collaterally, I muſt think, ought to have weight in your deliberate conſiderations concerning me.

            <p>While writing the above memorial, out come the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Committee of the Legiſlature of Pennſylvania; to whom was referred that part of the Governor's addreſs, which relates to the robbery of the Bank of Pennſylvania, and upon which I ſhall be very conciſe. "That on the night of the 4th of Auguſt laſt, ſome perſon or perſons entered the banking houſe in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035752_0059_10066441328695E8"/>
Lodge-alley, and made an unſucceſsful attempt to force open the doors of the caſh-vault, and to pick the lock of an iron cheſt uſed by the ſecond teller." Let any perſon firſt conſider the ſecurity of a Bank when it is ſo lame and unprovided, as to yield to every attempt of an entry; it goes on conſidering the inſecurity of the building, and the impoſſibility of making ſuch repairs to it as would render it ſafe to truſt the property any longer there. The immediate removal of the Bank to Carpenter's-Hall was propoſed—This building from it's conſtruction, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements which had been made to it in the occupancy of the Bank of the United States, was thought perfectly ſecure. <hi>Remark,</hi> This firſt attempt of the robbery as kept a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecret, and the reader will keep in his memory, that in the firſt part of this work, I being uneaſy, went to Lodge-alley where the preparations were ſtill going on, and found Robinſon; I aſked him the meaning why the work was ſtopped, his anſwer to me was, he would put me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to it by and bye: at the ſame time giving me ſtrict charge to take no notice to the bricklayer; however I ſuppoſe this was his meaning. The Committee goes on; "but previouſly to the removal, which took place on the Saturday following, <hi>a new patent lock</hi> for the outer door was procured."—<hi>Remark,</hi> This patent lock is ſold in London by a Mr. Ives, corner of Shoe-lane, Fleet-ſtreet: this is the moſt inſignificant patent that ever was granted by his majeſty king George the third of Great Britain. The wards of this lock are clumſy and of ſolid braſs, which cauſes the cavities of the key to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely wide and eaſy to be copied. This lock had two tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, which may attract the attention of thoſe who do not know better. It does not ſignify if a lock had a dozen tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, provided you can procure a key the ſame as the original. On the ſame day, (Saturday), in the Banking-houſe, I took up this ſtupid lock, and the inner door lock; and in the preſence of Clement Garretſon, told Robinſon the carpenter, that both theſe locks were not fit for a bank; he anſwered me, that the front one had a double tumbler. It has been whiſpered to me that Iſaac Davis procured this patent lock, and this lock I leave to thoſe mechanics who are acquainted with the art, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-General to explain, (for he ſtopped in the middle of Samuel Wheeler's art). The Committee goes on; "The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were charged to be particularly vigilant," and I am author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035752_0060_100664430BE81498"/>
Neddies belonging to the Bank; that it is a downright falſity. They declare publickly that no ſuch charge was given to them, and that it was kept a ſecret that any attempt was ever made on the Bank. The Committee adds, "That Mr. Anneſly, the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, having occaſion to go to the Bank to complete ſome buſineſs which he had left unfiniſhed the evening before, found the back door of the Banking-houſe open; and looking into the room, he to his great ſurprize, diſcovered the doors of the back vault likewiſe open: he immediately rouſed the port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> who was aſleep up ſtairs—Cunningham immediately came down ſtairs and unlocked the front, as well as the inner door of the houſe, they went into the Banking room and found all the window ſhutters ſecure, the back door unbarred, and the doors of the caſh vault unlocked. Mr. Anneſly went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the reſidence of the Caſhier, and apprized him of what he diſcovered."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark,</hi> Cunningham came down ſtairs and unlocked the front and inner doors—the opening the inner door was what ſtaggered my proſecutor (or perſecutors) on my examination: for this lock muſt be opened before they could come to the vault doors and when I aſked this queſtion there appeared to be a conſcious ſilence amongſt the whole, (or amongſt all hands) it is ſaid the back door was unba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d. The back door it ſeems had no lock at all; but juſt barred like a barn door, inſtead of a banking houſe. The doors of the caſh vault un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked; but how theſe doors were unlocked is ſtill kept a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and when Mr. Anneſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent to the Caſhier I do not know that any particular ſurprize was evinced.</p>
            <p>The Committee—"A meſſage was immediately ſent to the Preſident of the Bank; upon his coming to the city he found the Caſhier, Runner and Porter in the Bank. Upon an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the houſe, it was found the locks had been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by falſe keys, for no injury had been done to the wards of them, nor was there any appearance of force having been uſed."—<hi>Remark,</hi> I ſuppoſe before the Preſident came, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might have got the matter (or matters), in train, an a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for his reception. The Committee goes on, "That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons were arreſted upon ſuſpicion, and amongſt thoſe, is Patrick Lyon the Smith, who was employed in fitting the iron doors of the caſh-vault; and without whoſe privity it is believed this robbery has not been committed."—<hi>Remark,</hi> This Committee compoſed of three members, (their names I ſhall mention hereafter), but they certainly have to the eyes of their
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035752_0061_10066446E931BEF0"/>
fellow citizens generally, been guilty of a great and unwarrant, able overſight, to call it no worſe: and I declare (I think, provided they were acting as enemies againſt this country), if an army of eighty thouſand men, compoſed of ſuch men as this committee conſiſted of, that ten thouſand men ſuch as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would make them tremble in their harneſs. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſeveral of the members. and I am ſure there are <hi>gentlemen</hi> amongſt them, and thoſe gentlemen reprobate in ſtrong terms), this committee for taking hold of an honeſt citizen's name; and inſinuate againſt him to the public, in the manner they have done. If the language they have made uſe of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting me is not of their manufacture, let them publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it; and whether derived from a Fox, a Smith, a Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or from whom. This very caſe I hope will ſerve as a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to all the ſtates in their aſſemblies, never to run headlong into miſchief not aſcertainable: with reſpect to the policy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the affair, it evidently carries with it every feature of diſguiſed fear: and it will hereafter be placed in the hiſtory of extraordinary things, that an individual poſſeſſed of ingenuity in the line of his profeſſion; ſhould be made a martyr of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he poſſeſſes that ingenuity: and I defy the world to prove that even the ingenuity I do poſſeſs, was applied to any bad purpoſe, but always to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The committee ſay, "They had the ſatisfaction to diſcover the perpetrator of this daring robbery, ſo that the whole amount of the property ſtolen, has been recovered, except about three thouſand, two hundred dollars. One Iſaac Davis, <hi>a</hi> carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by trade, had an account open in the Bank, (or in the Bank of Pennſylvania), and the firſt circumſtance which excited the ſuſpicion of the Preſident and Caſhier againſt him, was the depoſit of 16,000 dollars; enquiry was made into his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and character, which was found to be ſuch as to induce the officers to watch his conduct. On Saturday the 17th of November, juſt before the Bank cloſed, he depoſited 3,910 dollars. Their ſuſpicions were then increaſed, and it was thought proper to enquire at the Banks of the United States and North America, whether he had any accounts open with thoſe inſtitutions, and on Monday morning ſuch information was obtained, as left no doubt that he was the robber." <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> This Iſaac Davis was the man, as I have often before obſerved, that I long ſuſpected before I went out of town, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Jonathan Smith, Caſhier of the Bank of Pennſylvania, (well knew, or ought to well know) his character and circumſtances.

               </gap>as diſcovered by my firm reſolution: and my ſuſpicions, were, and have been proved to have been well grounded, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Committee ſays, "he, (Davis), was invited to the houſe of the Caſhier, upon a pretence which excited no apprehenſion of the views of the officers: and their party, by threats of an immediate arreſt, and by promiſe of an interceſſion with the Governor for a pardon, a confeſſion of his guilt was ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d from him."—<hi>Remark,</hi> This is the grandeſt farce of the whole, and well played off; the Committee has not told their ſtory perfectly right at all: what I have underſtood is as follows, he was invited by his acquaintance Smith to his houſe, by way of joke, to do ſome work; (and in which houſe I ſuppoſe he ſpent many a joyous evening): and it was told to me Mr. Fox was one of the actors in this farcical ſcene. Mr. Fox I underſtand, was placed in a dark room, with a piſtol and a cutlaſs, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were ſome others of equal bravery, who ſuppoſed the ſhield of heaven would defend both their courage and their carcaſes, all equally armed. Smith the Caſhier, conducted Davis into the dark room—the curtain roſe, and diſcovered all the warriors. "Davis was then implicated," ſays the Committee, "they then le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him to his own reflections,"—but to diſregard the puniſhment inflicted on innocence, is a new ſpecies of juſtice, at leaſt it is to me.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:035752_0063_1006644A55A077F0"/>
I now come to the Caſhier again; On the 21ſt of November the ſaid Caſhier, incloſed a bond and warrant of attorney to Iſaac Davis, drawn in favour of the Preſident, Directors and Company of the Bank of Pennſylvania, for the ſum of 3,000 dollars, requeſting him to execute the ſame, this was intended to ſecure ſome real eſtate he held in the county of Delaware. <hi>Remark,</hi> The Bank have never reflected on their permitting Davis to eſcape if they had, it muſt have amounted to ſelf condemnation: becauſe it is here ſtated, that the Caſhier of the Bank, was in actual correſpondence with him. If Smith ſent him a bond on the 21th of November, why did not Smith ſend for Davis, and ſecure him, to be tried by the laws of his country. No, Smith thought he might be too near, I ſuppoſe if he was in Philadelphia. The Committee ſay that, "the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery originated with Cunningham, (and pray how ſhould ihis ſagacious and all-wiſe committee know that it did), who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the falſe keys, and that he, Davis, does not know who made them."—<hi>Remark,</hi> The introduction of falſe keys is pretty well laid on, as it ſerved very well to blind the public. If there were falſe keys made, will any man perſuade me Davis did not know who made them. At another ſitting of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature they go on. "Firſt, That the aforeſaid Benjamin Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, contrary to the duties of his office; endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a certain Iſaac Davis from being puniſhed, whom he knew had robbed the Bank of Pennſylvania."—<hi>Remark,</hi> In anſwer to this, what did the Bank let him go for, the Bank in my opinion were far more to blame than Brannan. "Secondly, That on the 21ſt of November laſt, Jonathan Smith, Eſquire, Caſhier of the Bank of Pennſylvania, ſent a bond to Iſaac Davis."—<hi>Remark,</hi> Here Smith (is called an Eſquire), and for what mortal reaſon, or for what deſign, is beſt known to the Legiſlature themſelves. They firſt blame Brannan for preventing Davis from puniſhment, and then tell the public that Smith ſent a bond to him on the 21ſt of November: as I obſerved before, why did not Smith ſend Haines or ſome one of a ſimilar profeſſion, and take Davis priſoner, and not lay all the fault on Brannan. The Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature thus continue, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That the ſaid Benjamin Brannan, called ſeveral times on the Caſhier of the Bank, between the 22ſt of November, and the 24th of the ſaid month; and impreſſed a belief on the mind of the Caſhier, that Iſaac Davis would tell who made the picks and keys, &amp;c.—<hi>Remark,</hi> Does not this appear like an undeniable proof, that Davis muſt have known who made the keys, for Mr. Brannan would not have impreſſed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035752_0064_1006644D36F2E118"/>
the Caſhier, with ſuch an idea; unleſs he had ſome authority ſo to do, or ſtrong reaſons from expreſſions that might fall from Davis to that purport. What relates to Mr. Brannan perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I ſhall paſs over, as I have no buſineſs with it. I ſhall now conclude the long detail of this lethargic committee. The committee are of opinion that the Preſident and Caſhier of the Bank of Pennſylvania, for their care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vigilance and exertions, in detecting the robber, and recovering the money ſtolen from the ſaid Bank, deſerve the higheſt commendation. Ordered to lie on the table—<hi>Remark,</hi> If I am permitted to give my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in place of this wiſeacre committee, that opinion would be as follows, That the Preſident and Caſhier had neither care or vigilance, and in place of deſerving the higheſt commendation, they ought to be Nebuchadnezzared; as they were warned of their inſecurity long before. Having thus finiſhed this long hypocritical ſtory, of either a led-away or uninformed committee: I ſhall proceed to the names of ſaid committee, as extracted from the Journals of the Legiſlature, and from the following Sections, to wit.</p>

            <p>Since I have been out of priſon, I find Mr. Fox has made every enquiry after my ſituation; from ſuch enquiries, if he has been told the truth, I am perfectly eaſy: he aſked Mr. Murray, what liquor I was fond of, Mr. Murray anſwered, the laſt time I called on Mr. Lyon, at his ſhop, he gave me ſome wine and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to drink. I aſked Mr. Lyon's reaſon for drinking wine and water, he anſwered if he drank ſpirits and water, and followed up the work, he was then carrying on with great activity, that he would be in a ſtate of intoxication all day. Mr. Murray told the truth; Mr. Fox, I have heard, likewiſe has enquired what my politics were, and if I was a man fond of talking about ſuch like—I ſhall make a ſpeech for Meſſrs. Preſton, Frailey, and Weaver, when they meet next ſeſſion, which I hope will ſatisfy

Mr. Fox in regard to my politics; and as I have viſited the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Houſe of Commons, I ſhall take the rules, becauſe I don't know how they proceed in the Pennſylvania State Legiſlature. (Here it is,) And there ſhall be a cry of Hear him! Hear him! That the alien law in our opinion, (ſpeaking on the principle of political opinion), is of no effect under its denomination, becauſe we can under any pretence, (gentlemen), criminate any foreigner, (particularly if he be an ingenious man), and throw him into priſon at pleaſure, and particularly if he will not fall down and worſhip the carbuncles that grow upon our noſes. You know, (gentlemen), that it is our peculiar deſire to come as near to the Britiſh ſyſtem as poſſible, for you know, (gentlemen), that the hereditary ſyſtem is the beſt for us; becauſe we will then get leave to keep all our wiſdom to ourſelves, and to our ſons, and our ſons, ſons: thereby deſtroying the idle pretenſions of the ſcientific, the learned, and men of genius and talents, and make them bow down their neck to the goddeſs y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lep'd Ignorance. You know, (gentlemen), the bleſſed effects of keeping Lyons in the tower, for in the year of our Lord, ninety and eight, there were two Lyons confined in our great towers, in the Preſidency of John Adams, Eſquire, (whom God preſerve). You know, (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen), that one Lyon was held in bondage, whether for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth or not we do not know, and the other, the younger, becauſe he is an ingenious man; and neither of them would fall down and worſhip the carbuncles that grow on our noſes. Hear him! Hear him! For it is ſaid that the Younger ſaw the light in one of the great cities in the eaſt, on the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

You know, (gentlemen), that they confined him, but he would not fall down and worſhip the carbuncles that grew on their noſes. For lo! they kept him forty and eight days in cloſe confinement, and all that time without a bed, and ſometimes in a ſtate of ſtarvation; but the Lord viſited him in priſon, and ſtrengthened him, and his beard grew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

deep dungeon, and ſtill he would not fall down and worſhip the carbuncles that grew upon their noſes. There was even an attempt to bring falſe witneſs againſt him, which grieved his heart, and he was thrown into the eaſt wing of the priſon, amongſt the thieves, and he preached to them and kept the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent heart in good order, and without fear: and he was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cells more than thrice, and he went on his way to the cells; but one of the keepers of the tower, who had more humanity than ſome of the others, ſaid, you have done no harm, your proſecutors have no right to puniſh before trial. And his proſecutors were admitted to falſely accuſe him, and told him in theſe words, that he would be confined, tried, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but his heart was true, he never yielded, and publicly declared that he would not fall down and worſhip the carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that grew on their noſes. Hear him! Hear him! He was kept eight eight weeks in one pair of ſtockings, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from almoſt any communication out of the tower, but he had one friend left, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Younger Lyon has likewiſe declared, that he will drink <hi>what</hi> he pleaſes, and <hi>when</hi> he pleaſes; and is clearly of opinion, that it is not the buſineſs of the Scribes and Pharaſees to inſpect into his conduct ſo minutely: he has publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he will ſtill adhere to republican principles, and all thoſe things he will abide by attendent thereon, and act as is becoming a man in the land of liberty, without licentiouſneſs. And be it further known, (gentlemen), that Lyon the Younger was held in bondage during the greateſt part of the plague, and he wrote his narrative in the priſon, but it was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go to his counſel, for fear it might do him ſome good.

            <p>On the 1ſt of February, 1799, I waited on Mr. Fox, the Preſident, and I aſked him if they had taken my memorial into conſideration; he ſaid he had read it, but their reliance was placed on Haines' declaration, and from ſuch declaration they held themſelves in juſtification. I then began to aſk Mr. Fox ſeveral queſtions, but he would not give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

On the ſixth of the ſame month, I was told by a friend of mine, that Young Brannan made uſe of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing expreſſions, or to that purport, to wit. (That Smith the Caſhier, wiſhed Iſaac Davis to get out of the way, as it would prevent Smith the trouble of finding out who made the falſe keys). On the eighth I found out Young Brannan, and took with me Mr. Condie, the above queſtion I put to Young Brannan, but his anſwers were evaſive, and he gave it as his opinion, that if there were any falſe keys made, it muſt have been Davis who made them himſelf; but my friend ſtill perſiſts that theſe (as nearly as he poſſibly can recollect), were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions Young Brannan made uſe of, at the Bull's head, in Strawberry-alley.

            <p>I thought it proper to enquire what operations the doors of the other vault went through, by the other ſmith; I and my friend Lace, went to the other ſmith, and he declared he did not remove more than two of the hinges of the doors, which was half the work that I did; I had four hinges to remove, and becauſe I was longer in doing double the work of another man, (beſides doing Mr. Stocker's work), it ſeems was cauſe enough to ſuſpect me, and hurl me into priſon. The Bank was indebted to me the ſum of £.17:8:9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Witherow drew the bill from my books on the 16th of February, and carried the bill to the Bank, which bill was handed to Mr. Fox—Smith being preſent, came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and returned Mr. Witherow the bill, and ſaid that he would diſcharge the bill, if he, (Mr. Witherow), would deduct the twenty dollars which was ſent to Mr. Lyon while in priſon, to which Mr. Witherow replied, that he was not authoriſed by Mr. Lyon to deduct any thing from the bill; and therefore muſt take the bill back and receive further orders from Mr. Lyon, before he could ſettle it on ſuch conditions. It is to be obſerved that I never ſent for twenty dollars to Mr. Fox or
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035752_0069_1006472541806E10"/>
Mr. Stocker, although they both claimed the merit of the good deed, or ever contracted any debt with them. The twenty dollars which were ſent to me, was intended I verily believe as a man trap to catch unwary innocent, and unguarded feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—Mr. Helm received the twenty dollars, and that he laid it out in neceſſaries for me, I do not deny; but to give a man a preſent of twenty dollars, when he was ſuffering through the negligence of thoſe who thruſt him there, and then want to ſtop it out of his bill; ſeems to me one of thoſe low, debaſed, mean, and unworthy actions, that would more become the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of the Jewiſh race, than the philanthropic and poliſhed breaſts of gentlemen compoſing the body of a commercial and national inſtitution.</p>
            <p>I waited about three weeks, thinking that when the ſtorm awakened in the breaſts of ſome of that body againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I aſked advice from ſeveral profeſſional gentlemen, and I was adviſed from the above ſtatement to ſue the Bank of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania before the Alderman's Court. I applied to Squire Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings for the purpoſe, but he would not grant me a ſummons; but ſaid he would write a letter to Mr. Fox, to this I had no objection but it ſtruck me inſtantly, thus, that if a poor man is indebted, he is ſummoned and brought in triumph (to uſe a vulgar though common phraſe) up to the bull-ring; however Mr. Fox, did not like to diſpute this ground, he ſent the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Squire Jennings and I gave a receipt for the ſame to prevent any farther expoſition of the Bank. I ſtill had an idea that I could have brought an action of damages for falſe impriſonment, and waited on ſeveral gentlemen of the law, and which coſt me a conſiderable ſum; but I could find none that would enſure me any ſucceſs, from the following obſervations of theirs. Firſt I was held to bail and if I brought an action againſt the Bank of Pennſylvania it muſt be tried at the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court, and it would come on before the very Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which held me to bail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that would be a countermand of their judgment if they even countenanced my action. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, The trial muſt come before the ſame Court and it is moſt probable the Jury which would be impannelled would be men intereſted in the Bank of Pennſylvania: under thoſe two heads they could not give me any encouragement to bring
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035752_0070_100664589FE69870"/>

I have applied to the late mayor's brother Mr. Baker, for all the papers reſpecting the robbery of the Bank, or a copy of them which were in the poſſeſſion of the late Hillary Baker: but his brother tells me Mr. Fox holds them, and I have been ſince told by the watchmen that the above papers are in the hands of Billy Sansom, I ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e glad to know what buſineſs Mr. Fox, or Billy Sanſom, has to retain papers which ought abſolutely to be in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the mayor for inſpection: I ſhould have been glad to have had copies of them, at leaſt Samuel Wheeler's, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which was either ignorant, falſe, or <hi>malicious,</hi> according to my conception. The Bank of Pennſylvania was very much diſappointed, and the vaſt expence that they were at with me, I ſuppoſe made them more inveterate againſt me. They rode after John Boyd, a Brick-layer, near forty miles into Weſt-Cheſter, to be an evidence againſt me, and when they got John Boyd he did not know me. I am ſure I did not know him at that time, but we have ſince became acquainted and he has related to me the whole of that part of the farce. I now return to Haines, the conſtable or catchpole, or what you will. I am ſorry for neglecting ſo amiable a character ſo long—when he got his orders to go to the Capes after me, he was told by ſeveral of my Friends, that I was gone to Cape Henlopen; but in place of going there, he went into the Jerſey, and down to Cape May. I have the ſtory from captain John Carſin's mother, who was about that time a neighbour of mine, and a better woman is not in the circle of my acquaintance. Haines fell in with this old lady at Cape May, but unfortunately for him, ſhe was well acquainted with me and my family concerns; and would not allow Haines to advance any falſe repreſentations againſt me: It was not only the erroneous accuſation of the Bank of Pennſylvania againſt me; but Haines muſt have viſited Rebecca Barker, or ſome of her companions; ſhe being under the denomination of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law. I only lay ſuch caſes down, to find what rational man can place confidence in ſuch reptiles—ſuch women are a diſgrace to the modeſt ſex, and ſerves as another inſtance of my belief, that there are not too great a number of men can boaſt of a good mother-in-law. Haines, when at Cape May was told that I went into a tavern, and called for ſomething to
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035752_0071_1006645A23FC6AE8"/>
drink; and looked over the newſpaper; and as ſoon as I had read the paper, drank off the liquor in a hurry, and went into a cedar ſwamp, and ſet fire to it in two different places. God knows I never was at Cape May in my life. Haines and the high-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of Cape May, (a pair of worthies), cut down from ſome of the large trees, two clubs, and like the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>in brother giants, Gog and Magog, iſſued forth on a wild gooſe chace into the cedar ſwamp; but the aſſes could find no Lyon. For Saul was ſent after his father's aſſes, but could not find them, and then was declared wiſe enough to be a king; but if aſſes can't find a Lyon what is their wiſdom entitled to. Haines did not go to look for a brother, he went out to look for a Lyon, the king of the beaſts, and he could not find him; and the king of the beaſts thinks it a very great hardſhip, that he ſhould be hunted after, by one of the meaneſt, loweſt, and moſt debaſed of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>I have related the nature of the Philadelphia priſon in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of this work; the advocates of which, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſuch treatment is exerciſed on the priſoners, in any part of the priſon; but theſe people that will not believe that the Philadelphia priſon is as bad as any other priſon, that is to be read of, my only wiſh is, that they may have a fair and ſpeedy trial of it: it is impoſſible ſay theſe unbelieving advocates, that any man can be twenty-four hours without a morſel. When it can be proved, that a priſoner ſome time back, was ſtarved and disfigured by the rats; and I ſuppoſe thoſe advocates can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that a keeper cannot at pleaſure take the unfortunate women out of the weſt-wing, and keep them in the cells—for what purpoſe I ſuppoſe may be eaſily gueſſed at. A man taken to the cells for God knows what, ſometimes at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his proſecutor, or perſecutor, I cannot ſay which, for they are ſynonimous; and kept ſeveral months on half a pound of bread, and a quart of water every 24 hours, until he is ſo weak that he has been known to knaw the plaiſter from the walls, and could not ſtand to evacuate his urine. After ſuch a reduction, the unfortunate and ſometimes innocent victim, is conducted to the ſick room and breathes his laſt: and if it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what he or they died of, it anſwered (ſometimes) of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damation of the bowels, or a conſumption, or any thing but the real thing. I ſay no priſoner has a right to be put to the cells by the orders of the proſecutor, or proſecutors, to extort any thing from him, or to ſatisfy their ſavage barbarity: why rail at the rack or the inquiſition, if ſimilar methods are purſued, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort

                  <p>I RECEIVED information from you, with your ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and do ſympathize with your long ſuffering and loſs of character. My heart was deeply wounded when I heard of your impriſonment, becauſe I was ſenſible of your innocence: therefore I can ſafely ſay, you had no hand in robbing the Bank of Pennſylvania, though perhaps I am not to be relied on at preſent; but I declare your innocence with a heart full of ſorrow, for my departure from the great moral principle, hence I undoubtedly realize the neceſſity of a ſtrict adherence to virtue—Virtue and induſtry are completely competent, to ſatisfy the mind with ſolid happineſs. This I have realized by fatal experience, I will in future purſue the plain paths of my former diligence.</p>

               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> When the Bank was robbed, from what I can learn; Smith, Davis, and Robinſon, were all in triangled ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations. Davis at Brannan's table, would frequently ſay at dinner, I wiſh they could catch the thieves: Smith at Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown, and Robinſon in the ſtate of New-Jerſey; but they all ſung the ſame tune, to be ſure Lyon muſt be the man, and if this one will take him, or that one will take him, there will be three thouſand dollars for you. Then ſome got guns, and ſome got piſtols, and ſome got ſwords, and ſome got clubs, (and off to the ſwamps). Such a continued race of warriors never exiſted before, only in the chimerical brain of the famed Knight of La Mancha, when he attacked the flocks of ſheep, and had his teeth knocked out by the ſhepherds.</p>

The opinion of many in regard to Davis, runs in this kind of language, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That Davis was a great rogue but bigger fool; a rogue firſt for robbing the Bank, and a fool for not being more careful in preſerving the caſh when he was in poſſeſſion. But the Bank, or the public at large, will accept of my opinion, (it is this): Firſt, I ſay that if Davis took the money, he was wrong, for no man has a right to take that which does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him. Second, If Davis ever ſuffered himſelf to be made a tool for other people's private purpoſes, he certainly muſt be granted a fool without redemption, in my poor hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion: becauſe this affair is not yet developed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ld, or in what manner this Bank was robbed, and which ſtill remains a myſtery. I ſay it appears to me, as if ſome people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be pleaſed the whole ſhould be buried in oblivion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the funereal farewel of a whiſper.</p>
            <p>It has been reported that the Bank offered me different ſums of money, and that I had made a certain demand: I declare to the public, the Bank never came forward, nor did I ever make any demand. If they are cloſely interrogated, it is anſwered by a fetch or come off, ſuch as, there are ſtill ſome doubts, &amp;c. about it. Some relate one ſtory, and another a different one, as nearly anſwers the purpoſe for which it is ſpoken. Where is then ſuch an inſtance? Can the Hiſtories of different nations furniſh you with ſuch <hi>a refined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of cruelty,</hi> and ſuch poliſhed combination of man, ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves gentlemen, and reſiding in a free Chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (I mean to ſelect thoſe for my obſervation only, as were the cauſe of my ſufferings) as thoſe I unfortunately had to deal with, but ſuch an inſtance of cruelty is not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, if forgiven on this ſide of the grave, whatever may be the conſequences on the other. If the equilibrium is deſtroyed between man and man, the aggreſſor ſhould give to the injured the Balance due in his favour, and give back to the injured every atom of his due; but no, ſay theſe gentlemen, we publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we will puniſh him, and bring him down, never more to behold the glorious luminary of Heaven: and cloſe his eyes in terre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tial darkneſs. I only aſk if it would not have been more humane, of thoſe gentlemen, to have come to the priſon, and have taken me by the hand and humanely as London merchants certainly would have done—pride, ignorance, or indolence, or all, may have carried them farther than they expected. And their keeping me in priſon nearly three weeks, after the money
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035752_0074_10066462006EE2B8"/>
was found, ſerved only to blind the public, into their meaſures at that time; but at preſent I have the pleaſure to inform thoſe gentlemen, and the committee for whom I have ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, (on account of their deciſion ſo well frought with Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic wiſdom), that it has been my chief ſtudy to fulfil the ſtation which I believe nature intended me for, in, and on all my tranſactions in life. A diſintereſtedneſs which has been often an injury to me, but which I have invariably purſued in ſpight of the falſe ſhew, glare, glitter, and ſplendour of the world: an open plaineſs, and honeſt bluntneſs of ſpeech, which as my feelings dictated: were involuntarily ſpoken. Theſe are pleaſant, ſoothing reflections to me, they quiet the corroding irkſomeneſs of care, and give a delicious compoſure at night to the wearied body. And when thoſe gentlemen, who are ſo great in the world's eye, leave this world and the bell tolls their funereal knell, honours they cannot rationally boaſt of, and all their grand ſpeculations die with them: while on the other hand, my works will be durable and ornamental, and probably my works and my principles, may not ſo ſoon be forgotten, as thoſe of the gentlemen above alluded to.</p>
            <p>I do not know a better country or part of a country in the world than Pennſylvania for people to die in, and get a good poſthumous name: for if he who dies, has practiſed ſwindling, uſury, and every other vice, within the pale of the law; he is ſure to be a good patriot, an indulgent huſband, a kind father, with a variety of other innumerable virtues. If a woman, hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in all the meretricious arts and failings of her ſex: ſhe is every thing that is leſs than a ſaint, and praiſed with more vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues than ever belonged to a mortal of either ſex: but news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper praiſe, for the dead, ought to be valued at the price of old rags, being juſt as cheap, and of equal worth.</p>
            <p>To ſum up the whole, if any inaccuracies have crept into this work: I hope I ſhall be forgiven, as I am more accuſtomed to mechanics than to authorſhip: but I hope I have as nearly as poſſible, kept the undeviating path of truth, and while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains my miſtreſs, I have not the leaſt doubt, but this will meet with the approbation of my fellow Citizens,</p>
