            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>T<hi>HE writers upon the new ſcheme of ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, do generally mix, in the compoſition of their diſcourſes, a large proportion of falſe metaphyſics, by which, common readers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered and loſt, as in a fog; and twiſt in, truth and falſehood together, in ſuch a manner, that many of their readers don't know how to ſeparate them; and though ſomething ſeems to them to be wrong, yet they can hardly tell what it is, and ſo are in danger of being drawn, and many are actually drawn in, to embrace the errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe errors, in their conſequences, have a moſt pernicious, practical influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sundry gentlemen of good judgment, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral taſte, converſing on this ſubject, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a deſire to have ſuch a kind of diſcourſe publiſhed as the following, which in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, would tend to convince men, endowed with common ſenſe, more effectually than laboured,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011286_0003_0F869D3905AF0848"/>
metaphyſical reaſonings, in imitation of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the advocates for the errors of the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The author of the following diſcourſe has no other view in it than to aſſiſt thoſe who need ſuch aſſiſtance to ſee, in an eaſy and ſtriking light, the falſehood and evil tendency of the new ſyſtem, that they may be guarded againſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſnare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He has no deſign or wiſh to bring any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the Gentlemen who have appeared in defence of theſe doctrines, but is benevolent to them; and would gladly have foreborn the mention of any Gentleman's name, if he could conſiſtently. But he is ſenſible that benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to individuals is of right, ſubordinate to public benevolence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe good Gentlemen are certainly men of good abilities. 'Tis a benevolent wiſh that they may be directed to employ them in the cauſe of truth only, and in particular, in detecting and confuting the unhappy miſtakes they have been intangled in.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>Perſons—do not, by the exerciſe of their own wills, or by any endeavours, do any thing towards their being born again; nor do they co-operate, in the <hi>leaſt degree</hi> with the efficient cauſe. So far from this, that <hi>all</hi> their inclinations, and every act of will and exertion of theirs, is in <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to it. All the exerciſes and volitions of the—unregenerate heart are certainly the exerciſes of ſin.<note n="g" place="bottom">Hopkins's ſermon, on John 1 13 p. 26.</note> What do they mean, who flatter ſinners that they may ſincerely and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily—ſeek a new heart, as the condition of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it? are not all the exerciſes of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, rebellious heart, impenitent, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes? And does not the old heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly hate and oppoſe a new heart?

things offered in the goſpel, and ſo be far from <hi>truly deſiring</hi> and <hi>aſking</hi> for them. And this is certainly the caſe of every unregenerate perſon, whatever concern and exerciſes he may have about his ſoul.<note n="k" place="bottom">ibid. p. 80, 81.</note> The unregenerate do oppoſe and reject the grace of regeneration with their <hi>whole heart.</hi>—The unregenerate heart hates and oppoſes a new heart, juſt as much as it does—Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel; and therefore is no more willing to receive the former than the latter, but rejects it with <hi>perfect abhorrence.</hi> Therefore there is nothing which the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate may be ſuppoſed to do, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a new heart, which is not itſelf an act of oppoſition, or conſiſtent with the moſt perfect oppoſition to that, which he is ſuppoſed to be ſeeking.<note n="l" place="bottom">ibid. p. 93.</note>—The man who is the ſubject of this change (regeneration) is indeed active, antecedent to it: but—all the exertions and exerciſes of his heart are—in <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to the ſpirit of GOD. Before this change—all the exerciſes of the heart are acts of rebellion, in oppoſition to GOD, his ſpirit and law.—Man is therefore ſo far from being active in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this change, or having any hand in it, by voluntarily falling in with, or <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to the divine operation, or co-operating with the ſpirit of GOD, that the <hi>whole ſtrength</hi> of his heart <hi>oppoſes</hi> it, until it is effected and actually takes place.—This change is wro't by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD <hi>immediately,</hi> that is, it is not effected
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011286_0008_0F869D3D88273050"/>
by any <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>means whatever.</hi> The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit of GOD in this caſe, is—as much without any means, as that by which Adam's mind was at firſt formed. In that, there was no medium, no means made uſe of, in creating the mind, formed and diſpoſed to right action. GOD ſaid, 'let it be,' and it was. The Almighty firſt produced it immediately, without any co-operating means: ſo it is in this caſe; there is no conceivable medium by which this change is wro't, any more than there is in creation out of nothing. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners own tho'ts, exerciſes and endeavours cannot be a means of this change; for they are all in <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>I would particularly obſerve here, That <hi>light</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> or the <hi>word of God</hi> is not, in <hi>any degree,</hi> the <hi>means by which</hi> this change is effected. It is not wrought by <hi>light.</hi> This change, moſt certainly, is not effected by light, becauſe,—by this, the way is prepared for the light to have acceſs to the mind, ſo as to become the <hi>means of any effect.</hi> This operation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD, by which a new heart is given, is neceſſary in order to the illumination of the mind—as it is the opening of the eyes of the blind.</p>
               <p>Unregenerate men—may ſee every thing in matters of religion, but the <hi>moral beauty</hi> and <hi>excellence</hi> of divine things. In this their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wholly conſiſts;—and this blindneſs has its foundation altogether in ſin, or the total
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011286_0009_0F869D3E39135018"/>
depravity of the heart: by which, the heart is wholly without any degree of right or good taſte, in the exerciſe of which <hi>alone,</hi> this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellence is <hi>diſcerned</hi> and reliſhed, and is <hi>perfectly under the power</hi> of a diſpoſition and taſte which has a <hi>perfect averſion</hi> to this.—The mind that is wholly without any right taſte or diſpoſition</p>

               <note n="q" place="bottom">ibid. p. 17.</note> If this propoſition is doubted of, it may be proved, upon the fundamental principle laid down by him in this diſcourſe,<note n="r" place="bottom">ibid. p. 5.</note> in this manner, The law againſt which he ſins is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted by an <hi>infinite</hi> authority, and therefore, although he is but a finite being, and but as a little child, and his contempt of this authority is but in a finite and low degree, yea the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that can be, even the leaſt ſin; yet it is an infinite evil. For the infiniteneſs of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority makes the leaſt poſſible diſreſpect to it infinitely criminal: But on the other hand, his virtue is but in an imperfect degree, and expreſſes only a limited meaſure of true reſpect to the authority of the law-giver; therefore, altho' the authority which he ſhews a honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dutiful regard to is infinite, yet his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is finite.

            <p>I might add many other quotations from theſe writers, and others, tending further to illuſtrate this ſcheme of ſentiments; in particular from Dr. Bellamy. He ſays, <q>The holy beauty of God's real, moral character, is what they (natural men) never had the leaſt idea of.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Bellamy's eſſay on the glory of the goſpel, p. 212.</note> And from Mr. Smalley's diſcourſe on John 6. 44. The grand deſign of which, as I apprehend, is to defend this ſcheme againſt a moſt formidable objection, by proving that though it be true that natural men are under a moſt abſolute impoſſibility of being brought to repentance and ſaving faith, till they are firſt renewed or regenerated; yet the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the thing is not pleadable as an excuſe for their unbelief, &amp;c. becauſe it proceeds only from the total corruption of their hearts; and their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable enmity to GOD and his goſpel, which they can't poſſibly after or abate by any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the uſe of means, and ſo is wickedneſs itſelf, and a <hi>moral</hi> impotence, not a natural. How well this ingenious gentleman has ſucceeded in his deſign, they that read his diſcourſe muſt judge for themſelves.—I think it may eaſily be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, upon the ſureſt principles of reaſon, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011286_0015_0F869D44AE63BF68"/>
the ſinners impotence, as his caſe is deſcribed, by theſe writers, is not moral, but natural or phyſical, that this gentleman has admitted very wrong ideas of moral impotence; and that by correcting them, and rightly ſtating the notion of moral impotence, as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from natural, his building will appear to be founded upon looſe ſand. But it is not my preſent deſign to enter into a diſcuſſion of this ſubject.</p>
            <p>I need not add any more quotations upon this ſcheme. Thoſe already given are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give a clear idea of it. I now proceed to the propoſed application of the doctrines, in an addreſs and exhortation to the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ſuch as the doctrines will warrant and ſupport; and will be careful not to ſay any thing inconſiſtent with them, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent it might be with the goſpel of God: For I am not now to apply the doctrines of divine revelation to the conſciences and hearts of men, but apocriphal doctrines to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by which means they may eaſily perceive them to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Poor, unhappy men; I ſpeak now to the unregenerate, if you have admitted the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines above narrated as divine truths, I pity you; you are miſerably entangled: But you muſt admit their conſequences: for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine conſequences of doctrines are as true as the doctrines themſelves.

If the doctrines above mentioned are true, you are indeed in a moſt dreadful condition, and may well be filled with horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—It is indeed true, upon this ſcheme, that if you truly repent, and believe and love the goſpel of God, you ſhall be received to ſavor. Shall I then exhort you hereto? I could conſiſtently do it, upon the goſpel plan, but upon this ſcheme I cannot, unleſs you are firſt regenerated; for, antecedent thereto, 'tis abſolutely impoſſible that you ſhould ſee the moral beauty and glory of the law and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo as to be drawn to faith and repentance by means thereof; nay you can't but hate them and reject them with perfect abhorrence, Such is the character of your nature, as you receive it by natural generation. And it is wholly out of your power to alter it for the better. This can be effected only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, miraculous, power of the ſpirit of God without means. Your inability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, unleſs you are firſt regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, is therefore truly natural, and abſolute, and unconquerable by any power, even by that of the ſpirit of God. To command and exhort you to believe and repent before you are regenerated and have a new heart given you, is therefore juſt the ſame as to require and exhort a man born deaf to reliſh the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of good muſic before his ears are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a man born blind to ſee and admire
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011286_0017_0F869D45C130B000"/>
the beauty and glory of the viſible creation, before his eyes are opened, or he has given him a faculty of ſeeing this beauty. Such a command and exhortation to the naturally and incurably deaf and blind, under a ſhew of compaſſionate good will, and accompanied with threatenings of the moſt terrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if they obey not, would juſtly be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all men, a moſt inſolent and cruel inſult upon their miſery, accompanied with the baſeſt hypocriſy.—So you ſee I am reſtrained, by this ſcheme of doctrines, that I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently, and without great abſurdity, expect or exhort you to believe and repent, unleſs you are firſt regenerated.</p>
            <p>Shall I then exhort you to become new born, and get a new heart and a good taſte, that you may become able to ſee and reliſh the moral beauty and excellence of the law and goſpel of God, and ſo believe and repent? Alas! you are under a natural, and unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inability to this. The ſpirit of God muſt firſt implant in your hearts a new ſpiritual taſte, by an immediate, creating act of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power. To exhort you in this manner, antecedent to the exertion of this creating act of divine power, would be equally abſurd as to exhort a child unbegotten, not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the womb, to come forth, and be born, and behold the glorious light of this world; or to have exhorted blind Bartimeus
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011286_0018_0F869D46790BB2E0"/>
to behold the face of the Saviour before he had opened his eyes.</p>
            <p>Poor, unhappy ſouls, what advice ſhall I give you then? Shall I exhort you to attend diligently and earneſtly the inſtituted means of grace and regeneration, in hope that God will, in this way of your ſeeking him, cauſe his ſpirit to breath new life into your ſouls? Shall I exhort you to ſubmit to his influence, and ſtruggle, and ſtrive under it, for the new birth? I could readily give you ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, upon the goſpel ſcheme; but upon this, how am I entangled, and perplexed, and diſtreſſed for you! <q>Man is ſo far from vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily falling in with, or ſubmitting to the divine operation, or co-operating with the ſpirit of God, in this work, that the whole ſtrength of his heart oppoſes, until it is effected and actually takes place.—This change is not effected by light, or by any medium or means whatever. So far from this, that the more any one is enlightened and convinced, and ſtrives, antecedent to this change, the more does he hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the ſaving truth.</q> In ſo falſe a light does it neceſſarily appear to the unrenewed mind. How then can your wicked endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and ſtrivings for, or rather againſt the new birth help you? Or how can they be a means to this end, unleſs the ſpirit of God loves to be reſiſted, and is <hi>pleaſed in being

grieved?</hi> In all you do, or can do, you only row backwards, and wax worſe and worſe.—You will ſay, this is totally diſcouraging.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Hopkins ſays, though you do grow much worſe in the uſe of means, yet there is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> incouragement to continue in the earneſt uſe of them. For without this you can't obtain that meaſure of doctrinal knowledge, without which God does not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily regenerate men. He gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, viz. That if God ſhould regenerate ſinners before they have attained a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſpeculative knowledge, the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have no food to feed upon, but muſt lie dormant in the heart and wholly unactive. See his diſcourſe on the promiſes, p. 129—133, and ſermon on John 1. 13. p. 54—59. He ſays in particular, p. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But every thing of this kind is given in to the mind after the new creature is formed.—You will tell me, this is but poor encouragement, and does not at all relieve your minds from the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you was thrown into before; and that you can't underſtand it, that you ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to go through a painful courſe of means, which make you more wicked, in providing food for the new creature, when you don't know that he will ever be born,

and do know that he will never reliſh your proviſions, but will have better food provided for him when he is born.—I anſwer, it is ſuch incouragement as the doctrine before you can give: and Mr. Hopkins ſays it is <hi>enough,</hi> tho' there is no kind of connection between the means and the end.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Shall I then adviſe you, as the very laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, to pray for the gift of a new heart, by which you may pray for all other goſpel bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings? I would do ſo, if I was applying the doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt. But theſe new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines ſhut your mouths, and mine too. For, according to them, you can't deſire a new heart till you have it, but <q>do perfectly hate and oppoſe a new heart, and <hi>reject</hi> it with <hi>perfect abhorrence.</hi> With what ſincerity and heartineſs then can you aſk for a new heart?</q>—That melancholy groan which I hear among you, pierces my heart with pitying grief for you:—But I have one thing to tell you for your conſolation; though your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition is very unhappy, yet if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to due concern for your ſouls, you may pray to God, in his name, to be merciful to you as miſerable ſinners, and give you a <hi>new heart.</hi> For under the influence of his common and preparatory grace, you may be enabled to deſire and pray for ſpecial; and he
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011286_0024_0F869D4FA394CB90"/>
will not be offended with you therefor, altho' your deſire does not ſpring from the higheſt and beſt principles. And it is certainly ſome relief to diſtreſſed ſouls to be allowed to pour out their griefs before the Father of mercies.—But if you are ſo weak as to believe the words of men rather than thoſe of God, no wonder if you are involved in inextricable perplexities, and tormented by them.</p>
            <p>Such as believe the ſcheme of doctrines above related, ſhould form their prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, otherwiſe they will lie againſt their own belief: and if they do ſo form them, their prayers will be an abomination to God, and all religious beings.</p>
            <p>It they would pray according to their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative belief, they ſhould uſe ſome ſuch form as the following. <q>Upon a requeſt made by a certain gentleman to one in the new ſcheme, (both of Connecticut) that he would ſend him a form of prayer for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner to make, conſiſtent with his ſentiments, the following form was ſent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O Lord Almighty, great and terrible, I am a poor miſerable ſinner, rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I am loſt and undone, without help. Have no love to thee, nor deſire to be holy, nor accept of mercy as offered. And though I hate holineſs, and even heaven it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet I dread hell more. O ſave me,&amp;c.&amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:011286_0025_0F869D50423D5188"/>
This I received from the requeſting gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, with liberty to make this uſe of it; whoſe veracity may be abſolutely depended on.—Enquire not concerning names ſince they are ſecreted, and the publick has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in knowing them.</p>
            <p>I ſubjoin another form, which takes into view more of theſe doctrines, fitted to the caſe of the moſt awakened and concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O Lord I am a moſt vile, miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, turned <hi>devil,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="bottom">Whittaker's ſermons.</note> as all mankind are, and was ſo from my birth. I have indeed gained much more doctrinal knowledge of thy revealed truths than any careleſs ſinner can attain to, and am deeply convinced of my undone ſtate, and terribly afraid of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into hell, and have taken a great deal of pains to eſcape, but all to no purpoſe: I grow worſe and worſe, and can't help it.—I ſee too that ſalvation is freely offered to me in Jeſus Chriſt, on condition I am truly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept it, and come to him for it. But I perceive it is a holy ſalvation, and that Jeſus Chriſt is a holy ſavior, and propoſes to ſave me from ſin, as well as from hell, and engage me in a holy life, and has prepared a holy and virtuous happineſs for his followers. Now I don't, I can't deſire ſuch a ſalvation, and am not at all thankful for the offer of it:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011286_0026_0F869D518E8792F0"/>
and though I dread the proſpect of final miſery, yet, upon the whole, I refuſe the offer, and really hate ſuch a ſalvation, and reject it, with all the holy and good things contained in it, <hi>with my whole heart.</hi> I have a natural, inwrought, unconquerable enmity to thy moral perfections. I can ſee no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellence in moral truth and virtue, but theſe are the objects of my <hi>natural, utter</hi> and <hi>unconquerable</hi> averſion, and muſt be ſo eternally, unleſs it pleaſes thee to give me a new heart, and true moral taſte and reliſh, by the exertion of miraculous power. O, how miſerable am I!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O Lord have mercy on me, and give me a new heart.—But, O <hi>dreadful!</hi> I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this requeſt: I do but lie in making it. I don't truly deſire a new heart, but hate it, and <hi>reject it with perfect abhorrence.</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">Hopkins, as quoted above</note> So my miniſter tells me. I could pray to be ſaved from miſery, and allowed to live for ever happy in ſin. But this, I know, will not, and ought not to be granted. So I find I can't pray at all, though I attempted it, any more than a devil. So dreadfully do theſe doctrines, which my miniſter teaches me to believe, ſhut up the way againſt me. O, how am I perplexed, diſtracted, and <hi>rent ſore,</hi> like one poſſeſſed by an unclean devil! How
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011286_0027_0F869D51E0487EF0"/>
can I live ſo, how can I die! Curſed be the day of my birth. Amen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to conclude the whole, I hope my readers have attended to all that has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, with calm impartiality. If they have, I preſume they are fully convinced that the above ſcheme of doctrines is abominably wrong, and that they are ſtrongly guarded againſt the infection of theſe fatal errors. If ſo I have obtained my end in this ſervice to the intereſt of truth; and they will join with me in giving humble thanks to the great and gracious father of lights, who has given us <q>the more ſure word of prophecy; to which we ſhall do well to give <hi>earneſt</hi> heed as to a light ſhining in a <hi>dark place,</hi> till the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe in our hearts.</q>—May we all be prepared to welcome the morning light of that glorious day.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>
