            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Have a good End in view, and pursue it.</opener>
            <p>EVERY Friend of American Freedom, rejoices to find a true and honest Spirit of Liberty Prevailing in all Ranks and Degrees in this City: It must even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prove our Safety; and a united Effort ought to be made for the Relief of a Sister Colony, now suffering in the general Cause. Deputies must be sent on our Part, and for God's Sake let us not dispute about the Mode of Election, but who shall most accelerate an Accommodation between the Parties. The Resolves are not material; whether we approve of the one Set or the other, is of no Consequence. Measures ought immediately to be adopted to procure Delegates to represent us at the Congress; they ought to be such as the Majority of the Citizens confide in; and, in order to ascertain this beyond any Doubt, I propose two Methods, either of which in my Opinion is unexceptionable.</p>
            <p>First. That two or more Persons of repute (who are of different Sentiments as to the Candidates that have been proposed) be appointed in each Ward of this City, to take the Sense of the Inhabitants; that the Names of the seven Candidates be mentioned to them, and that they be desired to nominate any five of the seven they approve of, for Delegates: But in Case any Citizen does not choose to be confined to the seven nominated, he is to be at Liberty to name any five as Delegates, out of the City and County at large.</p>
            <p>Second. On a Supposition that the above may be objected to, I propose that a Poll be opened in each Ward of this City, under the joint Direction and Inspection of the Committees of Correspondence and Mechanics, to take the Votes of the Citizens for five Delegates: The Poll to be conducted in the same Manner as for Election of Magistrates.</p>
            <p>The Resolves adopted by the Committee of Correspondence, <hi>as now amended,</hi> will be approved of by many; so will the Resolves of the other Committee: In disputing which are best, and which ought to be adopted, we may lose Sight of our grand Object,—the Resolves agreed on at the Congress, must be binding, to render them effectual, therefore let us wait patiently for the Result of a joint Deliberation; but should a Number of Citizens be tenacious to have the Sense of the City taken which of the Resolves they choose to adopt, it may be done in the same Manner, and at the same Time that Delegates are appointed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by Subscription or Polling.</p>
            <p>My good Citizens, I advise you not to be led a stray by any designed Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; consider your All is at Stake. Be assured I have nothing so much in View as a Reconciliation of Parties, which is really essential, in order to procure a proper Delegation, and convince the Enemies of America we are not to be cajoled either by their fair Promises or Threats, but will ever resist all internal Taxes that they may attempt to load us with.</p>
