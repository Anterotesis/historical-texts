            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le of what he had to ſay</hi> was on the three following Heads: Firſt, <hi>A Number of Lottery-Tickets Mr.</hi> Fletcher <hi>had ow'd him for:</hi> Secondly, <hi>A Wager Mr.</hi> Fletcher <hi>had laid with Mr.</hi> Gray <hi>about a Barrel of Pork:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>A Note put into his Hands, to be deliver'd up on the Settlement of ſome Diſputes between Mr.</hi> Fletcher <hi>and Mr.</hi> Hall.</p>
               <p>On the firſt Head he ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> had wrong'd him out of ſome Tickets he ow'd him for, at leaſt had detain'd the Payment of them ſo long, that he had loſt <hi>ſome Ounces, Pennyweights, and Grains of Silver</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">By this Calculation, Mr. <hi>Vaſſall</hi> is certainly a good Arithmatician.</note>, <hi>in the Depreciation of the Currency,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:007001_0020_102AE11ACAEA47F0"/>that is, that when the ſaid <hi>Fletcher</hi> firſt ow'd him for the Tickets he could with the Currency then fluctuating, purchaſe <hi>ſo many Ounces, Pennyweights and Grains of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more than he could when the ſaid</hi> Fletcher <hi>paid him;</hi>—and not only ſuſtained <hi>this Loſs,</hi> but by his not receiving the Tickets in the Time of it, he was induced to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Number of Tickets in the Lottery then to be drawn, <hi>and met with ſuch bad Luck,</hi> that he ſuſtain'd ſtill <hi>a further Loſs therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the ſecond Head he ſaid, <hi>in order to prove Mr.</hi> Fletcher <hi>a Man of bad Character, That he was inform'd that he once laid a Wager with Mr.</hi> Harriſon Gray, <hi>of a Beaver Hat, that he the ſaid</hi> Fletcher <hi>had got a Barrel of better Pork than Mr.</hi> Gray <hi>had, and in order to win the Wager, the ſaid</hi> Fletcher <hi>order'd his Cooper in packing the Pork, to put the beſt Peices on the Top of the Barrel, which ſaid</hi> Vaſſall <hi>ſaid, he look'd upon to be a bad Thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the third and <hi>laſt Head</hi> he ſaid, That he had formerly two Notes of Hand put into his keeping, ſign'd by Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and others on the one Part, and by <hi>Andrew Hall</hi> on the other, which Note of ſaid <hi>Hall</hi>'s was aſſign'd over to Mr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who then appear'd in the Room of Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon, &amp;c.</hi> The Conditions of which Notes were, that in Caſe the ſaid <hi>Hall</hi> ſhould finally recover of the ſaid <hi>Fletcher</hi> £. 8000 old Tenor, upon the Ballance of all Actions then depending in the Law between them, he was to deliver the Notes to Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> otherwiſe to Mr. <hi>Fletcher;</hi> that upon the Iſſue of theſe Diſputes <hi>he took uncommon Pains</hi> in adviſing with a Number of his Friends reſpecting this Matter; but as there had been formerly a Diſpute between Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> and him about ſome Tickets he did not care to determine the Affair, without ſome other Perſons being join'd with him in it,—which was accordingly done, <hi>and finally they all agreed that the ſaid</hi> Hall <hi>ought to have the ſaid Notes,</hi> and thereupon he deliver'd them to ſaid <hi>Hall;</hi> yet the ſaid <hi>Fletcher</hi> had treated him very ill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Pains he had taken in it.</p>
               <p>After Mr. <hi>Vaſſall</hi> had finiſh'd as above, <hi>which is the Subſtance of all he ſaid,</hi>—Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> deſir'd leave to anſwer him, and to clear himſelf from thoſe Aſperſions which Mr. <hi>Vaſſall</hi> had ſo unjuſtly charg'd upon him: Accordingly he began with what Mr. <hi>Vaſſall</hi> had charg'd him with, in cheating ſome Perſons he had taken Money of on the Bottom of a Ship that was loſt: Secondly, With Reſpect to the Ship his Brother ſail'd in: And then by anſwering all Mr. <hi>Vaſſall</hi> had ſaid in Vindication of himſelf.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, it appear'd that Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> was on his Journey to <hi>New-York</hi> (where the ſaid Ship was bound for a Freight he had contracted for, on Account of the Government) at the very Time ſhe was caſt aſhore on a Reef of Rocks in <hi>Nantaſket,</hi> by an uncommon Storm, and that by her being ſo caſt-away he loſt ſeveral Thouſands of Pounds, not having made any Inſurance upon her; and as to the Money he had taken upon the Bottom of ſaid Ship, upon a Diſpute ariſing between him and the Perſons he had the Money of, reſpecting their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Right to a Share of what was ſaved out of ſaid Ship, he produced the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Agreement between him and thoſe Perſons; and notwithſtanding he had ſign'd a Bond to each of them (wrote by themſelves) whereby they were wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded from any Salvage whatever, yet he generouſly conſented to deſtroy thoſe Bonds, and leave it upon the Footing of Equity, to three principal Merchants in the Town,—whoſe Award he alſo produced — both which are as followeth.</p>
