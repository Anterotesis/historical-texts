            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the universal Spirit of Life and Truth, and of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Peace, doth the tender Affection and pure Love of my heart flow forth unto you all, who are true Lovers of the Power and Holiness of the same, wherein alone it is that we bear the Image of him whose Name is <hi>HOLINESS,</hi> and his Nature and Being is <hi>PURITY,</hi> so that in that only we do draw and may draw near unto him, and have fellowship with him, and enjoy his Presence, who is our God, our Life and Salvation; and therefore in the unity of that whereby we have been quicken'd, and through which we live unto him that hath quicken'd us, do I exhort and beseech you all to mind, with reverence, his secret and sweet Visitations by his holy Power upon your Spirits, in your hearts, that you feeling that to apear there, and so through the brightness of its appearing, to destroy him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all Power, &amp;c. and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveableness of Unrighteousness in them that perish, and not only to appear to destroy him and his Works, but also to abide with you, and dwell in you, and to make you his Dwelling-place, and then you being watchful, shall not watch in vain, because the Lord then will be your Keeper, and then, as one said of old, <hi>He keeping the City, the Watch-man watcheth not in vain.</hi> Thus you may see it fulfilled in your own Hearts unto your own Souls. And so, have
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000401_0002_0FA5A9956ECC5CA8"/>
comfort and Confidence with holy <hi>David,</hi> and with him live above the fear of Evil (though you might walk through the shadow of Death, as he said) because of the Lords being with you.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Friends,</hi> see that you be all mindful of him in his appearing by his Power and Spirit of Grace in your hearts; and let him have room there, and not be straitned, or thronged up, or oppressed; for he delights to dwell alone there, and have the whole heart to himself, and at his own disposing, that he may fill it with that which he takes pleasure in, and in which only he may be glorified and honoured; and therefore doth he require the Heart, saying, <hi>My Son, give me thy heart;</hi> And Christ doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that we <hi>should love him with all our Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. So, as I said, let him have room in your hearts, and take heed that with this World, the Spirit of it, Nature of it, and love to the things therein, your hearts be not filled, and so taken up, that there be no room for him, whose coming is with such Glory and Fullness, that he fills all that are rightly poor &amp; empty, with that Fullness, Richness and Glory, that there can be no want to them that have him for their Portion and Inheritance, and so keep single in their hearts before him; but where the heart is filled with delight in, or desires after other things, out of the Covenant of God (which is out of his favour) there the Lord will not have delight to dwell, there is not room; nay, he will not have delight to appear there, because it will be his grief, and an oppression unto him; was it not so of old, when he took up his complaint against both <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> as you may see <hi>Amos</hi> 2. how the Lord pleads with them and threatens them what he would bring upon them for their Sins that he reckons up against them; and withal, to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their Crimes (as he might justly do) he also reckons up &amp; tells them what he had done for them, how <hi>he had destroy'd the</hi> Amorite <hi>for their sakes, brought them out of the Land of</hi> AEgypt, <hi>lead them in the Wilderness, given them the Land of the</hi> Amorits <hi>to posses, raised of their Sons to be Prophets, and their Young men to be</hi> Nazarites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but saith he unto them, <hi>Ye gave my</hi> Nazarits <hi>Wine to drink, and commanded my Prophets, saying, Prophecy not: Behold, I am pressed under you as a Cart is pressed that is full of Sheaves,</hi> saith he. Hence it may be understood, that when he hath been at work, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000401_0003_0FA5A99639D4AC18"/>
hath done good by his glorious Power, who worketh wonderfully for them (and now in them also) that believe in his Power; If there be a going from him, and a letting in of another thing into the Heart, where he should rule and have his dwelling in man, and so with man, it becomes a grief, and an oppression unto him, and so a provocation unto him, that he will not always bear it, nor spare man, though he is long-suffering, as may be seen very fully in that Prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi> and more at large through the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were written for our learning, that we might be warned, and thereby be stirred up unto diligence, care &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, which may tend to our Preservation.</p>
            <p>And now, considering those things that were of old, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving how that in our Age the Lord hath made known his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goodness unto us, even that which doth far exceed the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges of the outward <hi>Israel;</hi> for that which he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us withal, is a Possession and enjoyment of a degree of his own Life (who is the Creator) by which he created all things, which is more than the enjoyment of the Creature, the loss of which was the great Penalty laid upon <hi>Adam,</hi> if he broke the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which he having lost, is again restored unto us through Christ Jesus the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, which we having received, do thereby live unto God, and therein serve him.</p>
            <p>And so, <hi>dear Friends,</hi> the thing that is chiefly in my mind unto you, in the reach of the heavenly Bowels, is to intreat and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you all to be tender in your hearts, and careful over your spirits, that you may not let in nor joyn with any thing that will bring grief or oppression upon your Life, or lead you into the Transgression of the Law thereof: Mind the Exhortation of the Apostle, <hi>Grieve not the Spirit by which you are sealed,</hi> &amp;c. And so, as you are careful, watchful and wise to take heed unto the holy Conduct, and blessed Leadings and Direction of this Spirit, and the Law thereof, your Souls will dwell in Peace, and your Feet will tread in a safe Path, even the <hi>Path of Peace,</hi> and your steps will not slide, but you will witness what <hi>David</hi> said of old to be true, <hi>The Righteous shall inherit the Land and dwell therein forever; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Mouth of the Righteous speaketh Wisdom, and his Tongue talk of Judgment, the Law of his God is in his heart, none of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000401_0004_0FA5A9972AA655C0"/>
his steps shall slide.</hi> So here you may see what it is that keeps from sliding, the Law of God, which is in the heart, this preserved <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> his Paths.</p>
            <p>Oh my <hi>dear Friends!</hi> you may be happy, yea, we may all be happy, if we be as careful as we ought, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by this Rule: Oh the sweetness, peace and glory, that he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the hearts of all his People with, that take heed unto his Law! the Spirit is not grieved, the Life of the Soul is not oppressed; the Soul, Life or Spirit of man is at ease, and so in the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, and so in that state where it can sing unto the Lord and praise him.</p>
            <p>And therefore, all of you mind your dwelling and inward Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and spiritual freedom from all the Corruptions of the world and of the flesh, both inwardly in your selves, and all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from without, that you may reign in the Dominion of the Seed Christ Jesus forever, and so with him be co-heirs of that heavenly Inheritance and Possession which he hath purchased for you.</p>
            <p>And so, in the unity of that Life which reigns over all, do I very dearly salute you all who love the Truth, and in that do I desire that the God of Life may bear up your spirits by his Power over and a-top of all that would defile or oppress, that you may be preserved to remain the Sons and Daughters of God without Rebuke, in and among this crooked and perverse Generation, amongst whom do you shine as Lights, to the Glory of him who hath called you out of Darkness into his marvellous Light, who over all is worthy of Glory, Honour and Dominion, World without end.</p>
