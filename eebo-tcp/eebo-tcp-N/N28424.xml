            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>PARTICIPATING in the general grief, occaſioned by the death of our illuſtrious countrymen GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, our village by a unanimous reſolution of its citizens, appointed Friday the 27th inſt. to be ſet apart as a day of ſpecial mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accompanied with ſolemn exerciſes of devotion: conceiving that the ſacred duties of religion, would not only be the higheſt tribute of reſpect to the memory of the late beloved Father of his country, but alſo, the moſt ſuitable expreſſion of humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to this afflictive diſpenſation of an over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in whoſe hands are the iſſues of life and death, in whoſe ſovereign will is ſuſpended the ſate of men and empires, and whoſe gracious interpoſitions have been ſo manifeſtly diſplayed in the events of American hiſtory,</p>
            <p>IN recording the ceremonies obſerved on this melancholy and never-to-be-forgotten occaſion, we do not preſume that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt evidences of our unfeigned ſorrow, can poſſibly ſhed any luſtre on a name, which far tranſcends all human praiſe. The plain and ſimple recital of our village rites will teſtify, that tho'
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:037875_0004_100F5EE5A28EEC80"/>
among the leaſt, we were not laſt, to diſplay within our humble ſphere, emotions of ſympathy, in uniſon with our brethren of the United States. Following the dictates of pure and genuine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the memory of the man, who under God, was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our country's independence, every claſs of citizens combined in one common effuſion and liberal indulgence of the fineſt feelings of the human heart.</p>
            <p>PURSUING the plan previouſly adopted by the Committee of Arrangements, the Proceſſion formed at the Academy, with the Military in front, under the command of Major Beach, and moved at 12 o'clock in the following order:
<list>
                  <item>1. Muſic, playing a dead march with muffled drums.</item>
                  <item>2. Captain Hay's Company of Light Infantry.</item>
                  <item>3. Captain Van Arſdale's Company of Federal Blues, with their ſtandard dreſſed in mourning.</item>
                  <item>4. Captain Parkhurſt's Company of Artillery.</item>
                  <item>5. Captain Johnſon's Company of Cavalry, diſmounted.</item>
                  <item>6. Field Officers, and Officers of Militia.</item>
                  <item>7. The Rev. Clergy of the town with ſcarſs, and the Clergy of the vicinage.</item>
                  <item>8. The members of St. John's Lodge.</item>
                  <item>9. The Magiſtrates.</item>
                  <item>10. Captain (Colonel) Hay's Company of Silver Greys.</item>
                  <item>11. Preceptors and Scholars.</item>
                  <item>12. Citizens.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>ALTOGETHER compoſing perhaps as numerous a Proceſſion as have ever been aſſembled in this town.</p>
            <p>THE Military marched with reverſed arms, and on arriving at the Church door, opened their ranks, the whole facing inwards, and reſting on their arms, formed an avenue through which the remainder of the Proceſſion paſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:037875_0005_100F5EE8B3C54BC0"/>THE ceremonies of the Church were introduced by the Rev. Doctor Ogden in a well adapted prayer. The Rev. Doctor Macwhorter delivered the enſuing Diſcourſe. A crouded audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence liſtened with profound attention, and a multitude of eyes were ſuffuſed with the precious cryſtal of melting ſenſibility.</p>
            <p>As the moſt appropriate mark of reſpect to the <hi>Firſt of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi> the Addreſs of the late Preſident, on his declining a re-elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was read by Alexander C. Macwhorter, Eſq. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant advice contained in this laſt legacy, could never come more home to the boſoms of Americans than at this ſolemn moment— It was the voice of WASHINGTON, ſpeaking from the tomb.</p>
            <p>DIVINE Service being concluded, the troops formed in front of the Church, and the Proceſſion paſſing through in inverted order, they marched with ſhouldered arms and unmuffled drums to the Academy, where the whole was diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould do injuſtice to the ſubject, were we to conclude without a remark on the decorum and orderly conduct obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every deſcription of perſons on this mournful occaſion.</p>
            <p>NOT a ſingle incident occurred but what will bear a pleaſing retroſpect; and in our village annals, this day may be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to poſterity unſullied with a ſtain.</p>
            <p>WERE we to diſcriminate any individual circumſtance as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving more particular notice than the reſt, we ſhould ſelect the fraternity of Free Maſons, whoſe ſhare in the Proceſſion attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every eye, and gave a ſolemn dignity to the whole. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems and badges of the order were all veiled in the deepeſt mourning; and a monumental Obeliſk<note n="*" place="bottom">The Obeliſk (ſince repoſited on the Altar of St. John's Lodge in this town) is three feet in height: conſiſting of a baſe and pyramid of accurate proportion, repreſenting black marble.

The remaining three ſides contain the three great characteriſtics of chriſtianity, Faith, Hope, and Charity, alſo in white bas-relief.

            <head>A FUNERAL SERMON, DELIVERED IN NEWARK, DEC. 27, 1799. BY ALEXANDER MACWHORTER, D. D.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR FRIENDS
AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THROUGHOUT a miniſterial life of more than forty-one years, I never ſtood in the ſacred deſk with ſo much reluctance, as on the preſent occaſion.—The object, you wiſh to be eulogized, and to be portrayed in all the colours and dark ſhades of weeping ſorrow, is far beyond my feeble pencil, and trembling hand.—It ſeemed to me impoſſible, either to evade, or decently excuſe my ſelf from a compliance with the honorable and ſolicitous requeſt of my reſpected Townſmen.—But, it is now too late to offer unavailing apology.</p>
            <p>THE text I have ſelected as the theme for our mournful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, you find recorded in</p>
            <p>DEUT. XXXIV. 5. So Moſes the Servant of the Lord died.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON the great!—WASHINGTON the admired!— WASHINGTON the beloved!—is no more.—Doleful the ſound! —Painful the thought!—How extenſive is the ſtroke!—How deep the wound!—A nation groans—clothes herſelf in ſable weeds—and pours forth the bittereſt lamentations—Sorrow fills
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:037875_0008_100F5EEFE2E3CB10"/>
the heart, and a melancholy ſadneſs broods on every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>BUT, while we pay the juſt tribute of mourning, in honor of the deceaſed, and ſhed the tear of ſympathetic woe, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member as men and chriſtians, that the Lord God Almighty lives;—He ſits at the head of the univerſe;—directs all events throughout his extenſive dominions in infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—<q>A ſparrow falls not to the ground without the notice of our heavenly Father, and the hairs of our heads are all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT cannot be expected that the character of this eminent man can be portrayed at this time.—The genius of the poet, and the energetic eloquence of the orator would fail in the great attempt: how far then muſt my feeble powers ſhrink from daring ſuch an undertaking.—Poets and orators will no doubt exert all their learned abilities upon this ſubject; but, it is the ſimple retail of the hiſtoric page, which alone will be able to do juſtice to a life ſo extraordinary.</p>

the bleſſings of his beneficent hand?—What Job, in ancient times, the greateſt man in all the Eaſt, declared, with reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may with ſtriking propriety be applied to him. He <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him.</q> He <q>cauſed the widow's heart to ſing for joy.</q> Yea, he "was a father to the poor."

               <note n="*" place="bottom">GEN. WASHINGTON was an uniform profeſſor of the chriſtian religion. He ſteadily diſcountenanced vice; abhored the principles of infidelity, and the practices of immorality. He was a conſtant and devout attendant upon divine worſhip.

He firmly believed in the exiſtence of God and his ſuperintending providence. This appears in almoſt all his ſpeeches and proclamations. He was educated in the Epiſcopal Church, and always continued a member thereof, and was an ornament to the ſame.

            <p>ONE thing very remarkable in him, and was often obſerved by

his friends; how it was poſſible for a man, whoſe mind was full of cares, perplexities, embarraſſments, and great concerns, to attend at all times, with the graces of the politeſt eaſe, to the various <hi>minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi> of what is ſtiled <hi>good breeding,</hi> or the accompliſhed gentleman.<note n="*" place="bottom">All ranks of men even to children were objects of his peculiar po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, A modeſt and placid ſerenity ever ſurrounded him. Of what multitudes of little ones did he take a tender and condeſcending notice? And ladies of every claſs univerſally acknowledged with pride his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful attention. He was a perſon of ſuch finiſhed politeneſs, that by-ſtanders would ſuppoſe, he had nothing elſe to attend to, but the etiquette of genteel ceremony. He was hardly ever known, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to abſence of mind.</note>
            </p>
            <p>HIS capacious mind was not only formed for the grand arts of war, policy, and legiſlation, but it comprehended the common arts of life to an exceeding high degree. He was one of the moſt ſkillful and ſucceſsful huſbandmen in his country. He not only cultivated, and improved his own farm in the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and beautiful manner, but he greatly improved the farms of his neighbours in various parts around him by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and by his inſtruction. So that in this line, he might be ſtiled, <hi>a compleat farmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES this, he had a poliſhed taſte for many of the fine arts, and for the graces of certain branches of polite literature. He exceeded the moſt of men in epiſtolary writing. The volumes of his letters, which have been publiſhed will remain a ſtanding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his exalted accompliſhments in this reſpect. The world has been ſtunned for ages with encomiums upon the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Cicero and Pliny, as models of perfection in this ſpecies of learning; but, let them be compared with the former, I muſt be ſtrangely miſtaken, if their glory will not extremely ſuffer, and probably be totally overſhadowed by the experiment.<note n="†" place="bottom">Conſider the vaſt difference of the education and employments of Cicero and Pliny from Waſhington. The former were educated in all the learning of Greece and Rome. Compoſition was their buſineſs from their youth. They wrote in all the quietude of retirement; but the letters of the latter had no advantages either from a common liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al education or common ſtudy. They were written upon the ſpur of the monument, and generally in the hurry, tumult and confuſion of war; and many of them, I may ſay, amidſt the beating of drums and din of arms. Yet the native productions of his pen, flowing from his ſuperior genius, and as if it were from an inſpired poliſh of literature, in my pinion, far exceed them, and will be much better models for the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of youth.</note>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037875_0011_100F5EF653F13980"/>HE wrote with amazing facility and readineſs; communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ideas with the greateſt preciſion, perſpecuity and energy. Oftentimes during the late war, he had to direct and correct in various inſtances the proceedings of Congreſs. By the ſtretch of his ſagacity and ſuperiority of knowledge he frequently flaſhed conviction upon the minds of that great houſe, eminent for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, ſo as to induce them to adopt his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and alter or relinquiſh their own. His labors in writing in that perilous period were immenſe; and were there not the moſt incontrovertible evidences thereof, would ſeem to exceed all credibility. His military orders, his letters to Congreſs, &amp;c. compoſe more than thirty volumes in folio, which are preſerved in the national archives.</p>
            <p>LET us now contemplate this great man in his military char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. With juſtice it may be ſaid, "He was a man of war from his youth." When he was very young, he girded on the ſword, and entered the martial field for the defence and protection of his country. In the beginning of what is called, <hi>The laſt French War,</hi> the French and Indians made incurſions into the frontiers of Virginia. Young Waſhington, with a few militia companies of about three hundred men, immediately flew into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to repel the invading aggreſſors. The enemy were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037875_0012_100F5EF80C147010"/>
far beyond his expectation. The advanced and reconnoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering parties had ſkirmiſhed. He determined, if poſſible, to check the enemy's progreſs. For this purpoſe he threw up a haſty and trifling fortification, in a place in that country called a <hi>glade</hi> or <hi>ſavannah,</hi> which is a ſpace of flat ground deſtitute of trees, and generally of ſhrubbery. This wiſe manoeuvre was to oblige the enemy to leave their coverts and their trees, and make the attack in the open plain. The enemy, conſcious of their vaſt ſuperiority, conſiſting of nine hundred French, beſides Indians, ſure of conqueſt, ruſhed furiouſly to the aſſault. They were firmly received, and the action became ſevere and dreadful. More than half of Waſhington's corps was ſlain by his ſide, and more than twice that number of the enemy fell. The final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this bloody ſcene was, that the French commander, finding with what brave and deſperate men he had to deal, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him an honorable capitulation, which Waſhington accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and nobly marched off with the honors of war.—Although he loſt the field, yet he gained what was equal to a victory, by arreſting the progreſs of the enemy, and covering the frontier ſettlements. His conduct, his bravery, and his military genius diſplayed at that time, acquired for him great renown, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the attention of the public mind towards him. This was the beginning of that aſtoniſhing martial fame, to which in proceſs of time he arrived.<note n="*" place="bottom">The event to which I have alluded took place in the year <hi>1754,</hi> but it will be ſaid I ought to have introduced him to public view pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to this. I well know, that juſt after he paſt his age of <hi>21,</hi> in the year <hi>1753,</hi> he was honored with a commiſſion by Mr. Dinwiddie, then governor of Virginia, to M. St. Piere, the commander of a French Fort erected on the Ohio, <q>to demand the reaſon of his hoſtile proceedings, and to require him to withdraw his forces.</q>—How he travelled thro' a trackleſs wilderneſs of hundreds of miles with only a ſingle companion with their proviſions on their back, and how he was treated by the haughty Frenchman, and ſent back with ignominy and contempt, every one may ſee in the hiſtories of thoſe times.</note>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037875_0013_100F5EFA5922E020"/>THE campaign of the following year, according to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, when Gen. Braddock, a veteran Engliſh officer, with a reſpectable European army under his command, accompanied with ſtrong colonial additions, marched for the purpoſe of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying Fort Du Queſne, (now Fort Pitt) and driving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from that quarter; exterminating them from our territory, and giving deliverance to an extenſive frontier of our country.</p>
            <p>AT this period our riſing hero was only a common aid in the general's family. This mighty European, utterly ignorant of the wiles and proweſs of the foe, plunged precipitately forward, leaving part of his army far in his rear, ſoon fell into an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade. He himſelf was killed, and his forces routed by an enemy perhaps, he never ſaw. At this awful criſis, young Waſhington burſt forth, flew to the head of the colonial troops, which the general had contemptuouſly put in the rear, arouſed them from their panic, rallied them, and underſtanding the Indian mode of warfare, impeded, checked and baffled the progreſs of the enemy, covered to admiration the retreat of an army of Britons, ſaved a multitude of lives from the <hi>ſcalping knife,</hi> and obtained for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immortal laurels. He received the thanks, the plaudits, and bleſſings of his country.

And our youthful hero retired with dignity, and wreathed with laurels, to the ſilent walks of private life.</p>
            <p>SOON after theſe important events, the Britiſh government ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced doctrines and enacted laws, which ſtruck death into our chartered rights, our colonial privileges, and juſt and long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed liberties.</p>
            <p>THE firſt inſtance of alarm was the ever memorable <hi>Stamp Act.</hi> This enkindled a flame of righteous, and univerſal oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in America againſt the parent country. Waſhington ſoon appeared among other high characters, as a diſtinguiſhed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to theſe unconſtitutional meaſures.—After a ſhort ſtruggle, by the firm, united and determinate fortitude of the colonies, the offenſive act was repealed.—Then the ſtorm ceaſed and calmneſs and tranquility were reſtored. But this repeal was accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a horrid declaration, <q>That they had a right to bind (or tax) the colonies in all caſes, whatſoever.</q> Which doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, if put in practice, muſt have proved the extinguiſher of every ſpark of liberty in this country. It was the fixed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Britons to reduce it to practice in ſome form or other. Hence preſently came forward the fatal revenue acts.

In this mighty conteſt, before the ſhedding of blood, we find our belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Waſhington making a leading and conſpicuous figure, in committees, conventions and congreſſes. At laſt in the madneſs of their rage, they plunged the ſword into our bowels, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have our lives, or property, or both. Then our country was compelled to raiſe armies in their own defence, and to repel force by force. Immediately the eyes of congreſs were fixed on Waſhington, and he was duly appointed <hi>commander</hi> in chief.</p>
            <p>AS Moſes with timidity and reluctance obeyed the divine decree when he was ordered by heaven to go and put himſelf at the head of the choſen tribes, and deliver them from the fangs of a cruel tyrant, from bondage and ſlavery, lead them to liberty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to the promiſed land: ſo General Waſhington, when the high appointment was announced to him by the voice of Providence and the voice of his country, for the deliverance of theſe American tribes, with what ſtruggles in his breaſt, with what fear and heſitation did he ſubmit to the ſolemn undertaking? —When Moſes once aſſumed the charge, he never murmured under all his burdens, toils and adverſe trials, till he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed all that God intended by him: ſo, our American Moſes, when once he had undertook the arduous taſk, we never find him murmuring or threatening to reſign, even in the worſt of times, or in the darkeſt and moſt perplexing ſeaſons of adverſity. He ſtedfaſtly perſevered to the laſt, till he completely finiſhed all the work requeſted of him by his country; till he had fully eſtabliſhed for them their glorious INDEPENDENCE, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious LIBERTIES.</p>
            <p>MOSES accompliſhed the emancipation of more than two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people, and led them to exalted freedom and the glorieſ

of independence. Our hero accompliſhed the emancipation of more than three millions of people and perfectly introduced them to the higheſt liberties, civil and ſacred, and endowed them with privileges and advantages altogether incalculable.</p>
            <p>WE do not read that Moſes received any pecuniary reward from his people for all his ſervices; ſo, our great leader and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer would accept no compenſation for all his mighty labors.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:037875_0020_100F5F0BB2A80868"/>THIS country ſoon felt to the centre, that the federal compact, which aided us through the war, was abſolutely incapable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing happineſs to us in times of tranquility. State was taking the advantage of State, and all things were rapidly hurrying to diſcord and ruin. In this dreadful conjuncture of affairs, it was happily propoſed that a convention ſhould be called, to alter and amend that compact, or frame a new conſtitution. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of our wiſe men aſſembled; among whom Waſhington appears, compelled again by the ſuffrages of his State to forſake his delightful retirement, and to enter upon a new ſcene for the trial of his mental abilities; to conſider of all governments in the world, which was the beſt; and to form a civil conſtitution for theſe United States moſt promotive of their happineſs.</p>
            <p>HE is the man immediately exalted to the chair of this grand convention. This council was called upon the moſt extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs, and bleſſed with the moſt extraordinary ſucceſs, while all America ſtood, in awful ſuſpenſe, liſtening and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their deciſſions. Such a civil body upon ſuch great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns had never aſſembled in our world from the creation of man, and perhaps, all circumſtances taken into conſideration, there never will be ſuch another.—Here Waſhington, amidſt his great compeers, acquired honor and applauſe in a new line; for his profound wiſdom, his extenſive and various knowledge, his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſt ideas, his conſummate prudence, and his immenſe powers of accommodation.</p>
            <p>THE new conſtitution was framed, publiſhed, and adopted.—

BUT, who muſt be the perſonage, that would hazard himſelf, his reputation, and his all, to put this ſtrange, this novel, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried political machine into operation?—Waſhington is the man called upon by the univerſal and unanimous voice of the nation, to riſk all his hard and well earned fame, and make the critical and dangerous experiment.</p>
            <p>FOR the good of his country, which he always had at heart above all ſublunary things, with ſtruggles and perplexing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in his own mind, and with ſhedding many tears, he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abandons perſonal eaſe and domeſtic felicity, and bravely ventures to accept the helm of government, and aſcend that <hi>thorny</hi> ſeat, the Preſidential Chair.</p>
            <p>HERE his great abilities, beyond the hope of his conſtituents, enabled him to acquit himſelf as uſual, to the acquiſition of new fame, and more accumulated honor; and to the ſhedding down peace, proſperity, riches, glory and innumerable bleſſings upon his beloved country. He ſerved in this exalted ſtation, he labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſerved, like a ſecond ſeaſon of war, another eight long years, till he ſaw the government eſtabliſhed, and promiſing a permanent duration; then he breathed for reſt, like the weary labourer for the evening ſhade. He fervently requeſted his dear country not to elect him again to the dignity of the Preſidency, but to ſuffer him to retire to his delightful ſolitude, as he found the declenſion of life approaching, and his ſetting ſun faſt haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to the horizon.—His deſire was honorably, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly gratified.<note n="*" place="bottom">A perſon of eminence in England, obſerved to an American gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in office there, on the report that Preſident Waſhington intended to decline ſtanding as a candidate at the next election; "That ſuch a thing was impoſſible; he could not give up ſuch honors."

            <p>BUT, to what have I been perſuading your attention?— To the deeds—to the life of a mortal or immortal man?— Alas! mortality is inſcribed upon all things in this nether world. And man, however great, eminent, diſtinguiſhed, or uſeful, muſt depart hence and be here no more. This is the laſt trait in every human character, <hi>he died.</hi> "So Moſes, the ſervant of the Lord died." Moſes, that favorite of heaven, the greateſt general, legiſlator and ſtateſman, the moſt uſeful friend to, and the father of his nation, died.—So, Waſhington, the famed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, the mighty ſoldier, the illuſtrious magiſtrate, the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this American nation, the father, under God, of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, liberties, privileges, flouriſhing commerce and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, is—how can I utter the word?—<hi>dead.</hi>— "How are the mighty fallen?—How are the mighty fallen?"—His great ſoul has burſt the bands of mortality, diſencumbered itſelf of this clay tabernacle, and winged its way into the world of ſpirits; and every American cries—"My father, my father, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof!"—<q>The Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth

not the perſon of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands, and in a <hi>moment they ſhall die.</hi>
               </q>—Greatneſs, honor, and dignity cannot ſhield from death. The conqueror is conquered. And robes of ſtate muſt give way to the ſhroud.—Admit here two lines of vaſt ideas from Dr. Young:
<q>
                  <l>Death,—great proprietor of all! 'tis thine</l>
                  <l>To tread out empires, and to quench the ſtars.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE king of terrors cannot glut his inſatiable maw with ſuch another victim. Here we may take up the lamentation and ſay, <q>All fleſh is as graſs, and all the glory of man as the flower of graſs; the graſs withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away.</q>—"Lord, what is man?"—What is the life even of ſuperior men?—<q>It is a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth.</q>—Let us be ſilent—the righteous God hath done it.</p>
            <p>THE death of this exalted perſonage ought to lead us to devout reflections, and to a wiſe and chriſtian improvement thereof; that we, that our whole nation may be conſoled under our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows—not faint in the day of rebuke, but have our faith, our hope, our confidence ſtrengthened in God, even in the living God.</p>
            <p>THE firſt improvement we ought to make of this mournful providence is, to learn and practiſe the great duties of ſubmiſſion and reſignation. Hath God, the juſt governor of the world, done it?—How ſhould our mourning ſouls reply, <q>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good?</q> Submiſſion and reſignation in unavoidable adverſity are not only indiſpenſable duties, but in the cultivation of them, there is much conſolation. They apply balm to the wounded ſpirit, and ſhed abroad on the ſoul a ſacred calmneſs, peace and tranquility. When in extreme
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037875_0024_100F5F1860133268"/>
troubles, the heart can devoutly put up that petition taught us by our divine maſter, ſaying "Thy will be done." This happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quells the tumults of our thoughts, detaches our affections from the tranſitory objects of the world, and elevates our minds to things celeſtial and unchangeable. <q>Let the potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth, but woe unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker.</q> We are extremely prone from the frailty of our nature, to murmur, repine, revolt againſt heaven, and indulge hard, unreaſonable and unbecoming thoughts of a wiſe ſuperintending providence. Theſe things exhibit the ſelfiſhneſs and pride of our hearts, and that we would wiſh the Almighty under our controul, and that we were exalted above the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of dependent creatures. We ſhould inſtantly expel them from our minds, and with the high prieſt of God in ancient times, be ſilent under the chaſtening of heaven; "Aaron held his peace." Or imbibe the ſpirit of mourning Job, and ſay, <q>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</q> Chriſtian reſignation excludes deſpondercy.—That God who raiſed up a Waſhington, and furniſhed him with all thoſe important and brilliant qualifications; rendered him ſuch a bleſſing to mankind, and made him the father and ſaviour of his country, can and will raiſe up another, whenever he ſhall deem it expedient for the good of the world, and ſimilar circumſtances require it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond improvement, we and our land ſhould make of this calamitous event, which has cauſed us to conſecrate this day to mourning and ſorrow is, to render gratitude to the Supreme Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Univerſe, that he enriched this country with his inval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable life ſo long. We ſhould offer upon this ſolemnity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent and merciful heaven, ſouls full, running over, and preſſed down, of grateful ſentiments. I too well know it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to human nature, the longer we have poſſeſſed a precious bleſſing, and the more our hearts are attached to it, when the unhappy hour of its removal comes, the more we are prone to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037875_0025_100F5F1A65ED6578"/>
murmur and complain. Even bleſſings, which in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we cared but little for, when taken away, our feelings are apt to riſe in reſentment. Theſe things, with a thouſand others exhibit to view the exceeding great depth, ſubtle and tortuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the moral corruption in the children of men. Alas! let a favorite object depart, and be everlaſtingly ſeparated from us, how is gratitude, chriſtian gratitude, for its long continuance, thrown into a very diſtant back ground.—You may think it ſtrange I ſhould preach gratitude upon this melancholy day; but were I preaching to his neareſt connections, to the wife of his boſom overwhelmed in ſorrow, and to all his tender domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, pouring out their weeping ſouls around his hearſe, I would preach to them, as a part of their duty, gratitude and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving as a principal ſource, from whence flow the refreſhing ſtreams of ſuccor and conſolation. Sure I am, if ever any people on earth had cauſes of gratitude, <hi>they</hi> ſtand at the head of the column of obligations. They have enjoyed a diſtinguiſhed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for many years; they are enveloped in bleſſings now, and they have the afflicted hearts of a great nation condoling with them, and all the floods of tears flowing down the face of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia, are flowing to their honor.</p>
            <p>HIS exit has taken place at the moſt proper time and in the fitteſt manner. The God of all the earth is always doing that which is right.</p>
            <p>WHAT if he had died at ſome forlorn period of our war with Britain?—Speaking after the manner of men, we would now have been groaning and wreathing under the mortifying yoke, which his life as the principal inſtrument under heaven has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

ſword againſt ſtate.—And nothing ſuſpended or prevented the direful event, but deliberations upon a new conſtitution, and the ſeaſonable adoption of the ſame. Had Waſhington been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved at this critical, doubtful and all-important time, let every rational mind conjecture the train of incalculable evils, which would have ſtarted into tremendous exiſtence.</p>
            <p>HE died at the very moment that was proper, and in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that was infinitely fit, by a few hours ſickneſs, <note n="*" place="bottom">Allow here an abſtract of his laſt illneſs, as publiſhed by his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Dr. Craik and Dr. Dick. <q>Sometime in the night of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (December <hi>13</hi>th.)

            <p>THE period for a new election of a Citizen, to adminiſter the executive government of the United States being not far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts muſt be employed in deſignating the perſon, who is to be cloathed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpecially as it may conduce to a more diſtinct expreſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſolution I have formed, to decline being conſidered among the number of thoſe, out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
            <p>I BEG you at the ſame time to do me the juſtice to be aſſured, that this reſolution has not been taken, without a ſtrict regard to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037875_0030_100F5F2B1F23C570"/>
all the conſiderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender of ſervice which ſilence in my ſituation will imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intereſt; no deficiency of grateful reſpect for your paſt kindneſs; but am ſupported by a fall conviction that the ſtep is compatible with both.</p>
            <p>THE acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been an uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your deſire. I conſtantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, conſiſtently with motives, which I was not at liberty to diſregard, to return to that retirement from which I had beeen reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my inclination to do this, previous to the laſt elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had even led to the preparation of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of perſons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
            <p>I REJOICE, that the ſtate of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the purſuit of inclination incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the ſentiment of duty or propriety: and am perſuaded whatever partiality may be retained for my ſervices, that in the preſent circumſtances of our country, you will not diſapprove of my determination to retire.</p>
            <p>THE impreſſions with which I firſt undertook the arduous truſt, were explained on the proper occaſion. In the diſcharge of this truſt, I will only ſay, that I have with good intentions contributed towards the organization and adminiſtration of the government, the beſt exertions of which a very fallible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was capable. Not unconſcious, in the out-ſet, of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority

of any qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps ſtill more in the eyes of others, has ſtrengthened the motives to diffidence of myſelf: and every day the encreaſing weight of years admoniſhes me more and more, that the ſhade of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as neceſſary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumſtances have given peculiar value to my ſervices, they were temporary, I have the conſolation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political ſcene, patriotiſm does not forbid it.</p>
            <p>IN looking forward to the moment which is intended to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; ſtill more for the ſtedfaſt confidence with which it has ſupported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifeſting my inviolable attachment, by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices faithful and perſevering, though in uſefulneſs, unequal to my zeal. If benefits have reſulted to our country from theſe ſervices, let it always be remembered to your praiſe, and as an inſtructive example in our annals, that under circumſtances in which the paſſions, agitated in every direction, were liable to miſlead amidſt appearances ſometimes dubious—viciſſitudes of fortune often diſcouraging—in ſituations in which not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want of ſucceſs has countenanced the ſpirit of criticiſm—the conſtancy of your ſupport was the eſſential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans by which they were effected—Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly penetrated with this idea, I ſhall carry it with me to my grave, as a ſtrong incitement to unceaſing wiſhes, that heaven may continue to you the choiceſt tokens of its benificence: that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual—that the free conſtitution, which is the work of your hands, may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly maintained—that its adminiſtration in every department may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue—that in fine, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the people of theſe ſtates, under the auſpices of liberty,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037875_0032_100F5F2EF587CFC8"/>
may be made complete, by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a uſe of this bleſſing, as will acquire to them the glory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending it to the applauſe, the affection and the adoption of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>HERE, perhaps, I ought to ſtop. But a ſolicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of danger, natural to that ſolicitude, urge me on an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion like the preſent, to offer to your ſolemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, ſome ſentiments, which are the reſult of much reflection, of no inconſiderable obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. Theſe will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only ſee in them the diſintereſted warnings of a parting friend, who can poſſibly have no perſonal motive to bias his counſel. Nor can I forget, as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, your indulgent reception of my ſentiments on a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and not diſſimilar occaſion.</p>
            <p>INTERWOVEN as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is neceſſary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</p>
            <p>THE unity of Government, which conſtitutes you one people, is alſo now dear to you. It is juſtly ſo; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the ſupport of your tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility at home; your peace abroad; of your ſafety, of your proſperity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from different cauſes and from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortreſs againſt which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be moſt conſtantly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively (though often covertly and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037875_0033_100F5F314DB41E20"/>
value of your national Union, to your collective and individual happineſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable attachment to it; accuſtoming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the palladium of your political ſafety and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing whatever may ſuggeſt even a ſuſpicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link together the various parts.</p>
            <p>FOR this you have every inducement of ſympathy and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Citizens by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of patriotiſm, more than any appellation derived from local diſcriminations. With ſlight ſhades of difference, you have the ſame religion, manners, hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its and political principles. You have in a common cauſe fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts of common dangers, ſufferings and ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe conſiderations, however powerfully they addreſs themſelves to your ſenſibility, are greatly outweighed by thoſe which apply more immediately to your intereſt. Here every portion of our country finds the moſt commanding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the Union of the whole.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>North,</hi> in an unreſtrained intercourſe with the <hi>South,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional reſources of maritime and commercial enterprize and precious materials of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing induſtry. The <hi>South</hi> in the ſame intercourſe, benefitting by the agency of the <hi>North,</hi> ſees its agriculture grow and its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037875_0034_100F5F33A482F450"/>
expand. Turning partly into its own channels the ſeamen of the <hi>North,</hi> it finds its particular navigation invigorated—and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouriſh and increaſe the general maſs of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime ſtrength, to which itſelf is unequally adapted. The <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in like intercourſe with the <hi>Weſt,</hi> already finds, and in the progreſſive improvement of interior communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, by land and water, will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures at home. The <hi>Weſt</hi> derives from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſupplies requiſite to its growth and comfort—and what is perhaps of ſtill greater cenſequence, it muſt of neceſſity owe the ſecure enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of indiſpenſable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime ſtrength of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ſide of the Union, directed by an indiſſoluble community of intereſt as <hi>one nation.</hi> Any other tenure by which the <hi>Weſt</hi> can hold this eſſential advantage, whether derived from its own ſeparate ſtrength, or from an apoſtate and unnatural connection with any foreign power muſt be intrinſically precarious.</p>
            <p>WHILE then every part of our country thus feels an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and particular intereſt in Union, all the parties combined cannot fail to find in the united maſs of means and efforts, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrength, greater reſource, proportionably greater ſecurity from external danger, a leſs frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of ineſtimable value they muſt derive from Union an exemption from thoſe broils and wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves which ſo frequently afflict neighboring countries, not tied together by the ſame government; which their own ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhips alone would be ſufficient to produce, but which oppoſite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues, would ſtimulate and embitter. Hence likewiſe they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſhments, which under any form of government are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hoſtile to Republican Liberty: In this
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037875_0035_100F5F352C621B38"/>
ſenſe it is, that your Union ought to be conſidered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preſervation of the other.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations ſpeak a perſuaſive language to every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary object of patriotic deſire. Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace ſo large a ſphere? Let experience ſolve it. To liſten to mere ſpeculation in ſuch a eaſe were criminal. We are authoriſed to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the reſpective ſubdiviſions, will afford a happy iſſue to the experiment. 'Tis well worth a fair and full experiment.— With ſuch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experience ſhall not have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted its impractibility, there will always be reaſon to diſtruſt the patriotiſm of thoſe, who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.</p>
            <p>IN contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our Union, it occurs as a matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould have been furniſhed for characteriſing parties by <hi>Geographica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will it not be their wiſdom to rely for the preſervation of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to thoſe adviſers, if ſuch there are, who would ſever them from their Brethren, and connect them with aliens?</p>
            <p>TO the efficay and permanency of your union, a government for the whole is indiſpenſable—No alliances, however ſtrict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parts can be an adequate ſubſtitute; they muſt inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in all times have experienced. Senſible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your firſt eſſay, by the adoption of a conſtitution of government better calculated than your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluinced and unawed, adopted upon full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in the diſtribution of its powers, uniting ſecurity with ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and containing within itſelf a proviſion for its own amendment, has a juſt claim to your confidence and your ſupport. Reſpect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquieſcence in its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true Liberty. The baſis of our political ſyſtems is the right of the people to make and to alter their Conſtitutions of Government—But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:037875_0037_100F5F3A9DEA3018"/>ALL obſtructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and aſſociations, under whatever plauſible character, with the real deſign to direct, controul, counteract, or awe the regular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and action of the conſtituted authorities, are deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They ſerve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary force, to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a ſmall, but artful and enterpriſing minority of the community; and according to the alternate triumphs of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of conſiſtent and wholeſome plans, digeſted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon councils, and modified by mutual intereſts.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER combinations or aſſociations of the above deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may now and then anſwer popular ends, they are likely in the courſe of time and things to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, will be enabled to ſubvert the power of the people, and to uſurp for themſelves the reins of government; deſtroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjuſt dominion.</p>
            <p>TOWARDS the preſervation of your government, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency of your preſent happy ſtate, it is requiſite not only that you ſpeedily diſcountenance irregular oppoſitions to its acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged authority, but alſo that you reſiſt with care the ſpirit of innovation upon its principles however ſpecious the pretexts.— One method of aſſault may be to effect in the forms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution alterations which will impair the energy of the ſyſtem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at leaſt as neceſſary to fix the true character of governments, as of other human inſtitutions—that experience is the ſureſt ſtandard, by which to teſt the real tendency of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037875_0038_100F5F3CEB0AAD40"/>
conſtitution of a country—that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypotheſis and opinion, expoſes to perpetual change, from the endleſs variety of hypotheſis and opinion; and remember, eſpecially that for the efficient management of your common intereſts, in a country ſo extenſive as ours, a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of as much vigor as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecurity of liberty, is indiſpenſable. Liberty itſelf will find in ſuch a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with powers properly diſtributed and adjuſted, its ſureſt guardian. It is indeed, little elſe than a name, where the government is too feeble to withſtand the enterpriſes of faction, to confine each member of the ſociety within the limits preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the laws, and to maintain all in the ſecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of perſon and property.</p>
            <p>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties, in the ſtate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical diſcriminations. Let me now take a more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive view, and warn you in the moſt ſolemn manner againſt the baneful effects of the ſpirit of party, generally.</p>
            <p>THIS ſpirit, unfortunately, is inſeperable from our nature, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its root in the ſtrongeſt paſſions of the human mind. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts under different ſhapes in all governments, more or leſs ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, controuled, or repreſſed; but in thoſe of the popular form, it is ſeen in its greateſt rankneſs, and is truly their worſt enemy.</p>
            <p>THE alternate domination of one faction over another, ſharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit of revenge, natural to party diſſenſion, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the moſt horrid enormities, is itſelf a frightful deſpotiſm.—But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent deſpotiſm.—The diſorders and miſeries, which reſult, gradually incline the minds of men to ſeek ſecurity and repoſe in the abſolute power of an individual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſooner or later the chief of ſome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037875_0039_100F5F3E6F2B12C0"/>
to the purpoſes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Liberty.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheleſs ought not to be out of ſight) the common and continual miſchiefs of the ſpirit of party are ſufficient to make it the intereſt and duty of a wiſe People to diſcourage and reſtrain it.</p>
            <p>IT ſerves always to diſtract the Public Councils and enfeeble the Public Adminiſtration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealouſies and falſe alarms; kindles the animoſity of one part againſt another, foments occaſionally riot and inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acceſs to the government itſelf through the channels of party paſſions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are ſubjected to the policy and will of another.</p>
            <p>THERE is an opinion that parties in free countries are uſeful checks upon the adminiſtration of the Government, and ſerve to keep alive the ſpirit of Liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in Governments of a Monarchial caſt, Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm may look with indulgence, if not with favor upon the ſpirit of party. But in thoſe of the popular character, in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe. And there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion to mitigate and aſſuage it. A fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilence to prevent its burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a flame, leſt, inſtead of warming it ſhould conſume.</p>
            <p>IT is important likewiſe, that the habits of thinking in a free country, ſhould inſpire caution, in thoſe intruſted with its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, to confine themſelves within their reſpective conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037875_0040_100F5F40C63A21A8"/>
ſpheres, avoiding in the exerciſe of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The ſpirit of encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tends to conſolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real deſpotiſm. A juſt eſtimate of that love of power, and Proneneſs to abuſe it, which predominates in the human heart, is ſufficient to ſatisfy us of the truth of this poſition. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reciprocal checks in the exerciſe of political power; by dividing and diſtributing it into different depoſitaries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting each the Guardian of the Public Weal againſt invaſions by the others has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern: ſome of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preſerve them muſt be as neceſſary as to inſtitute them. If in the opinion of the People, the diſtribution or modification of the conſtitutional powers, be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the conſtitution deſignates.—But let there be no change by uſurpation; for tho' this in one inſtance, may be the inſtrument of good, it is the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary weapon by which free governments are deſtroyed.—The precedent muſt always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or tranſient benefit which the uſe can at any time yield.</p>
            <p>OF all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, Religion and Morality are indiſpenſable ſupports.—In vain would that man claim the tribute of Patriotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of Men and Citizens.—The mere Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them.—A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obligation deſert the oaths, which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in Courts of Juſtice? And let us with caution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037875_0041_100F5F431A7456C0"/>
religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of religious principles.</p>
            <p>'TIS ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or leſs force to every ſpecies of free government. Who that is a ſincere friend to it can look with indifference upon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſhake the foundation of the fabric?</p>
            <p>PROMOTE then, as an object of primary importance, inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowledge.—In proportion as the ſtructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be enlightened.</p>
            <p>As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecurity, cheriſh public credit. One method of preſerving it is to uſe it as ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as poſſible; avoiding occaſions of expence by cultivating peace, but remembering alſo that timely diſburſements to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for danger, frequently prevent much greater diſburſements to repel it; avoiding likewiſe the accumulation of debt, not only by ſhunning occaſions of expence, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to diſcharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occaſioned, not ungenerouſly throwing upon poſterity the burthen which we ourſelves ought to bear.—The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repreſentatives, but it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate.—To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there muſt be Revenue; that to have Revenue there muſt be Taxes; that no taxes can be deviſed which are not more or leſs incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and unpleaſant; that the intrinſic embarraſſment inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always

a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deciſive motive for a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did conſtruction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſence in the meaſures for obtaining Revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</p>
            <p>OBSERVE good faith and juſtice towards all Nations, cultivate peace and harmony with all; Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be that good policy does no equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no diſtant period a great Nation, to give to mankind the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted juſtice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the courſe of time and things the fruits of ſuch a plan would rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repay any temporary advantages which might be loſt by a ſteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a Nation with its Virtue? The experiment, at leaſt, is recommended by every ſentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas? is it rendered impoſſible by its vices?</p>
            <p>IN the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing is more eſſential than that permanent, inveterate, antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate attachments for others ſhould be excluded: and that in place of them juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The nation, which indulges towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its intereſt. Antipathy in one nation againſt another, diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur.</p>
            <p>HENCE frequent colluſions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts. The Nation, prompted by ill will and reſentment,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037875_0043_100F5F47E21DBFD8"/>
ſometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the beſt calculations of policy. The government ſometimes participates in the national propenſity, and adopts through paſſion what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would reject; at other times, it makes the animoſity of the nation ſubſervient to projects of hoſtility inſtigated by pride, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and other ſiniſter and pernicious motives. The peace often, ſometimes, perhaps, the liberty of Nations has been the victim.</p>
            <p>SO likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illuſion of an imaginary common intereſt in caſes where no real common intereſts exiſts, and infuſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation, in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or juſtification. It leads alſo to conceſſions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Nation making the conceſſions: by unneceſſarily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, ill will, and a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are witheld:—And it gives to ambitious, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or deluded citizens (who devote themſelves to the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite Nation) facility to betray, or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, without odium, ſometimes even with popularity; gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the appearances of a virtuous ſenſe of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the baſe or fooliſh compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.</p>
            <p>AS avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, ſuch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domeſtic factions, to practice the arts of ſeduction, to miſlead public opinion, to influence or awe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Councils I Such an attachment of a ſmall or weak, towards
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037875_0044_100F5F4A2FEDA740"/>
a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the ſatel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite of the latter.—Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealouſy of a free people ought to be <hi>conſtantly</hi> awake; ſince hiſtory and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience prove that foreign influence is one of the moſt baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealouſy to be uſeful muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the inſtrument of the very influence to be avoided, inſtead of a defence againſt it. Exceſſive partiality for one foreign nation, and exceſſive diſlike of another, cauſe thoſe whom they actuate to ſee danger only on one ſide, and ſerve to veil and even ſecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may reſiſt the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become ſuſpected and odious; while its tools and dupes uſurp the applauſe and confidence of the people, to ſurrender their intereſts.</p>
            <p>THE great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little <hi>political</hi> connection as poſſible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us ſtop.</p>
            <p>EUROPE has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence ſhe muſt be engaged in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent controverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it muſt be unwiſe in us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate ourſelves by artificial ties, in the ordinary viciſſitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and colliſions of her friendſhips, or enmities.</p>
            <p>OUR detached and diſtant ſituation invites and enables us to purſue a different co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rſe. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take ſuch an attitude as will cauſe the neutrality, we may at any time

reſolve upon, to be ſcrupulouſly reſpected; when belligerent nations, under the impoſſibility of making acquiſitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may chooſe peace or war, as our intereſt, guided by juſtice, ſhall counſel.</p>
            <p>WHY forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſituation? Why quit our own to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of European ambition, rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, intereſt, humour or caprice?</p>
            <p>'TIS our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be underſtood as capable of patroniſing infidelity to exiſting engagements. I hold the maxim no leſs applicable to public than to private affairs, that honeſty is always the beſt policy. I repeat it, therefore, let thoſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be obſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But in my opinion, it is unneceſſary and would be unwiſe to extend them.</p>
            <p>TAKING care always to keep ourſelves, by ſuitable eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on a reſpectable defenſive poſture, we may ſafely truſt to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.</p>
            <p>HARMONY, liberal intercourſe with all nations, are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by policy, humanity, and intereſt. But even our commercial policy ſhould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither ſeeking nor granting excluſive favours or preferences; conſulting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe of things; diffuſing and diverſifying by gentle mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the ſtreams of commerce, but forcing nothing; eſtabliſhing, with powers ſo diſpoſed, in order to give trade a ſtable courſe, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to ſupport them; conventional rules of intercourſe, the beſt that

There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. 'Tis an illuſion which experience muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard.</p>
            <p>IN offering to you, my countrymen, theſe counſels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſſion I could wiſh—that they will controul the uſual current of the paſſions, or prevent our nation from running the courſe which has hitherto marke the deſtiny of nations: But if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial benefit, ſome occaſional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſchiefs of foreign intrigues, to guard againſt the impoſtures of pretended patriotiſm; this hope will be a full recompence for the ſolicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</p>
            <p>HOW far in the diſcharge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic records and other evidences of my conduct muſt witneſs to you and to the world. To myſelf, the aſſurance of my own conſcience is, that I have at leaſt believed myſelf to be guided by them.</p>
            <p>IN relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the 22d of April 1793, is the index to my plan—
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037875_0047_100F5F513A44E2A8"/>
Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has continually governed me; uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
            <p>AFTER deliberate examination with the aid of the beſt lights I could obtain, I was well ſatisfied that our country, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intereſt, to take a neutral poſition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as ſhould depend upon me, to maintain it, with moderation, perſeverance and firmneſs.</p>
            <p>THE conſiderations which reſpect the right to hold this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, it is not neceſſary on this occaſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that according to my underſtanding of the matter, that right, ſo far from being denied by any of the Belligerent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>
            <p>THE duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing more, from the obligation which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</p>
            <p>THE inducements of intereſt for obſerving that conduct will beſt be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to ſettle and mature its yet recent inſtitutions, and to progreſs without interruption, to that degree of ſtrength and conſiſtency, which is neceſſary to give it, humanly ſpeaking, the command of its own fortunes.</p>
            <p>THOUGH in reviewing the incidents of my adminiſtration, I am unconſcious of intentional error: I am nevertheleſs too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037875_0048_100F5F551CDF01A8"/>
many errors. Whatever they may be I fervently beſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as myſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt.</p>
            <p>RELYING on its kindneſs in this as in other things, and actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that fervent love towards it, which is ſo natural to a man who views in it the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral generations; I anticipate with pleaſing expectation that retreat, in which I promiſe myſelf to realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midſt of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government—the ever favourite object of my heart, and the happy reward, and truſt, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</p>
