            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>Deuteronomy XVII.18, 19.</bibl>
                  <p>And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhall be with him, and be ſhall Read therein all the Days of his Life: that he may Learn to Fear the Lord his God, to keep all the Words of this Law, and all theſe Statutes, to do them.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN God chose Iſrael to be His peculiar People before all the Nations of the Earth, He gave them Laws, Statutes, &amp; Ordinances of ſeveral ſorts : He gave them not only the Moral Law written on the <hi>Tables of Stone,</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; which was a Rule to direct them in the performance of thoſe Duties which the Light of Nature had more imperfectly inculcated upon them : but He gave them alſo the Ceremonial Law, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſundry Rites and Ceremonies, to be uſed in their Religious Worſhip; moſt of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001769_0003_0FB825872A3C1E58"/>
which had a Typical reference unto the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to come, &amp; the Righteouſneſs that He was to bring in, and ſo ceaſed with the coming of the Meſſiah. And moreover, beſides theſe, God gave them alſo their Judicial or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth Law, which conſiſted in ſundry Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Political Orders; directing how the Civil Affairs of their Common Wealth, as they were a Civil State, ſhould be managed. Our Text and Context is a Branch of their Civil Law, and is God's Statute to Iſrael, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how their King, their Chief Civil Ruler, ſhould bear &amp; behave himſelf in that high &amp; dignify'd Station, and how he ſhould Qualify himſelf for that Poſt in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's People, ſo as to attain the right Ends of Civil Government, and be God's Miniſter, for good to His People.</p>
            <p>In the words of the Text we may obſerve two things more generally;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God declares what the Chief Civil Ruler of His People ſhall do, or what he ought to do.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) He renders a Reaſon why he ſhall thus do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to what God requires the King the Chief Civil Magiſtrate to do; its in theſe words, <hi>When he ſitteth on the Throne of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Prieſts, the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001769_0004_0FB82588EA691DE0"/>
Levites; And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall Read therein all the Days of his Life.</hi> And here by a parity of Reaſon, this Command ſeems to be binding to all Inferiour Magiſtrates, tho' none but the Chief is expreſſed; for their Office is of the ſame kind, tho' their Power may be leſs in degree: And then the reaſon rendred to Enforce the Command, ſhews it to be as needful for all Inferiour Civil Rulers, to comply with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as the Chief, for they have all need to fear the Lord their God, and to keep all His Statutes, to do them; and particularly that of Executing Judgment among His People, ſo as to be God's Miniſter for good to them; the great End of the Office of Civil Rulers, whether of higher or lower Degree. And in this Command of God, reſpecting Civil Rulers, there are two Branches.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the King, the Chief Ruler <hi>ſhould Write out a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites.</hi> Here we may do well to obſerve, that this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law, out of which the Ruler was to take a Copy, was not only the Moral &amp; Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, but alſo the Civil or Judicial Law, which was to be the Rule of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and according to which he was to Execute Juſtice &amp; Judgment in Iſrael. This is plain, if we conſider that the Civil Law,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001769_0005_0FB8258A5C2AF7D0"/>
as well as the Ceremonial, was laid up before the Prieſts, in the ſides of the Ark of the Covenant, there to be kept from one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another; as its written, Deut. 31.24, 25, 26. <hi>And it came to paſs when Moſes had made an end of writing all the Words of this Law in a Book, until they were finiſhed; that Moſes Commanded the Levites that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, ſaying, Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the ſides of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a Witneſs againſt thee.</hi> And this was more than the Moral Law, for that was repoſited in the Ark, and not in the ſides; as may be ſeen at large, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.2, &amp; 5.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The ſecond Branch of the Command unto the Civil Ruler is, <hi>That he ſhould keep this Copy he had taken by him, and ſhould Read therein all the Days of his Life.</hi> The meaning ſeems to be, that he ſhould often Read and Study this Law; and thereby get the Letter of this Law well fixed in his Memory, and his Underſtanding well inlightned as to the meaning and true intent of the Law; (both which frequent Reading and Study hath a tendency to promote.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>More generally</hi>; In the Words we may take notice of the Reaſon rendred, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Command, and that is this; <hi>That he may learn to Fear the Lord his God, and to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001769_0006_0FB8258BBB7F8588"/>
keep all the Words of this Law, and all theſe Statutes, to do them.</hi> The general Nature of the Reaſon ſeems to be this; That he might by his own Practiſe, according to the Moral and Ceremonial Law, and by exerciſing his Power over the People, according to the Limitation of the Civil Law, ſhew himſelf to be one that fears God, and will be God's Miniſter for good to His People; (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.) One that will take care that the Laws of God, and the good and wholeſome Laws of the Common Wealth are kept: Which is the great End of the Office of all Civil Rulers, whether Supreme or Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; for they are all to be God's Miniſters for good, ſuch as bear not the Sword in vain, Revengers to Execute Wrath on them that do Evil.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE from the Words, on which I may inſiſt is this;</p>
            <p>That the frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures, and the Civil Law of the Common Wealth, is a thing very Needful and Profitable, for Civil Rulers in order to a right Execution of their Reſpective Civil Offices.</p>
            <p>For Illuſtration of the Doctrine, it may be needful to State and Anſwer one Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001769_0007_0FB8258D3B6E2450"/>Queſt. <hi>Wherein conſiſteth the right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office</hi>?</p>
            <p>Precedent to the Reply unto this Enquiry, it may be premiſed, That Civil Rulers, in the Diſcourſe under management, are to be taken in a limited ſenſe; only as they are veſted with Executive Power of Government and not Legiſlative; not as they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with Legiſlative Power in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This we may take notice of in the whole of the following Diſcourſe. This being premiſed, I anſwer the Queſtion ſtated, (1.) More generally. (2.) More particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>More gen.</hi> The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office lyeth, in their well Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of a People ſubject to their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according to Juſt and Good Laws, ſo as to be God's Miniſters for good to them. It is not meerly in Ruling a People, but in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them by good and wholeſome Laws, keeping within the due limits of their Power in Government. All Civil Rulers have their Power of Government limited, and that by the Boundaries of ſome Laws, that are the Laws of that Kingdom, State or Common Wealth, over which any particular Ruler or Rulers are ſet to Govern. All juſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be Monarchie or Popular, or
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001769_0008_0FB825901C301C38"/>
a Mixture of both, or of any other differing Form; is originally founded in either Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or Conqueſt (where the War is juſt on the Conquerors part:) Now when &amp; where its founded originally in Compact or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, between the parties Ruling and Ruled, there muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed ſome Rules agreed upon which the Ruler is bound to take notice of, in his exerting Power of Government over the Ruled; for as none can make a juſt Claim to any Natural Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Right to Rule over others, (Family Rulers only excepted) ſo Mankind never did nor will, Submit themſelves voluntarily to the Government of others their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Men; but upon ſome Agreement of what Rules, the Ruler or Rulers ſhould obſerve in Government; which Rules are the Laws of that Kingdom or State ſo Covenanting to be under Government; and in ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment founded thus Originally in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact; the right Execution of the Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Office lyeth in the impartial &amp; upright Adminiſtration of Juſtice among ſuch a People, according to theſe Rules. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; When and where the Government of any Civil State, is originally founded in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, (which may be a Juſt Government, where the War is Juſt on the Conquerors part) yet there God hath not Left ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nqueror
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001769_0009_0FB82591A04DBEB0"/>
at his liberty, what Laws to impoſe upon his Conquered Subjects, but hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to inſtitute good Laws for the Rule of his Government, for he is bound to be God's Miniſter for good to the People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. A revenger to execute Wrath upon them that do evil, and not on them that do good; and ſo his Laws muſt be correſpondent to the Laws of God, and ſo good. Neither hath God left it at ſuch Conquerors liberty, when he hath inſtituted good Laws, whether he will keep to them, as the Rule of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Executive Power in Government, or no: but he is as much bound to Govern by ſuch good Laws as to make them; <hi>for he that Ruleth over men, muſt be Juſt, Ruling in the fear of the Lord.</hi> This the Rock of Iſrael hath ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3.</p>
            <p>But more <hi>Particularly</hi> to Reſolve the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry before us, we Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The right Execution of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Office, partly conſiſteth in preſerving promoting, &amp; maintaining <hi>Peace</hi> among the People over whom they are ſet to Rule; and to do this by executing good and wholeſom laws made for that end. One great end of the Civil Rulers Office is Peace; that Peace might be kept was one end for which God appointed and approveth of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Peace is a very valuable and choice
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001769_0010_0FB82593280A07D0"/>
outward Mercy; and therefore the Spirit of God, in the Hundred &amp; Thirty Third <hi>Pſalm,</hi> compares it to the Odoriſerous Anointing Oil, <hi>that ran down upon Aarons Head &amp; Beard, even to the skirts of his Garments.</hi> Now mens Luſts Interrupt the ſtream of this Choice Bleſſing; as <hi>James</hi> faith, Jam. 4.1. <hi>Whence come Wars and Fightings, but from your Luſts</hi>? And thus every Kingdom &amp; Country would be in an Uprore, and ruſh quickly into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Ruine, if there was not ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the Land to keep the Peace. And therefore God hath appointed ſuch an Office among men; and men themſelves have ſeen it needful every where, to ſet up ſome Forms of Civil Government for this End. Paralel here unto are we commanded, in I Tim. 2.1, 2. <hi>To Pray for Kings, and all in Places of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; that under them we may lead quiet and Peaceable Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office, partly conſiſteth, in their obliging men ſubject to their Authority, to <hi>Worſhip God</hi> according to Divine lnſtitution, ſo far as they are enabled to do it, by virtue of any Civil Law of the Common Wealth over which they Rule The Civil Magiſtrate is rightly ſtyled, <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque Tabula</hi>; The Keeper of both Tables. Its as much within his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to ſee that Men under his Authority,

The Civil Rulers are as much bound in Duty as Officers in the Civil State, to Juſtify the Righteous in Judgment, as to Condemn the Wicked. Both were incumbent on the Judges in Iſrael, by one and the ſame Command; as Deut. 25.1. <hi>If there be a Controverſie between men, and they come to Judgment, that the Judges may Judge them, then they ſhall Juſtify the Righteous, and Condemn the Wicked.</hi>

The Civil Ruler doth rightly execute his Office in ſuch Caſes, when he acteth without fear of offending any but God; and without indulgent affection on the ſcore of Conſaguinity or Affinity; after the Example of that Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs at Mount-<hi>Sinai,</hi> when Iſrael was fallen to Idolatry; of whom it is recorded, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9.

The right Execution of the Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Office in part, conſiſteth in their making a right and juſt Deciſion of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> in matters of <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> depending between Perſons that are ſubject to their Authority, &amp; that according to the rules of the Law One End of Civil Government, is, That Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of a Civil Nature might be well iſſued, and that men might not be Judges in their own Caſes, &amp; endeavour to right themſelves, <hi>Vi &amp; Armis</hi>; when they think they are wronged, which would be deſtructive to any State: And therefore God hath inſtituted the Civil Magiſtrates Office among men, and ſet up Rulers, that they might Judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment between a Man &amp; his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and iſſue the Quarrel by a righteous Sentance, binding to both Parties. This was God's Command by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Seventy Elders, that they ſhould Judge Righteouſly in Controverſies of this nature; as we ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16. <hi>And I charged your Judges at that time, ſaying Hear the Cauſes between your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Judge Righteously between every man and his Brother, &amp; the Stranger that is with him.</hi> And in this kind of Executing Civil Power the Judges ſhould not reſpect Perſons, but Cauſes only: The <hi>Rich</hi> Should not be favoured in Judgment, becauſe he is <hi>Rich</hi>; nor the <hi>Poor</hi> carry his Cauſe to his mind becauſe he is <hi>Poor,</hi>

            <p>This Enquiry being Reſolved in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the thing that is next to be attended, is the Proving of the Doctrine in both the Branches of it.</p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>That the frequent Reading &amp; Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the Scripture, is a thing Needful and Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Civil Rulers, &amp;c.</hi> This will appear if we Conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By frequent Reading and Studying the Scripture, Civil Rulers will be likely to be men of Religion &amp; good Conſcience: And Religion is very ſerviceable to the regular managing the affairs of Civil Government. It was told <hi>Timothy,</hi> in 2 Tim. 3 15. <hi>That the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, was able to make him wiſe to Salvation.</hi> Now, if Rulers become wiſe to Salvation, thro' the knowledge of the Scriptures, gain'd by reading &amp; ſtudy; they will be Wiſe alſo in ordering the Affairs of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001769_0015_0FB8259E82727700"/>
Civil Government under their care; or will order them the more Wiſely. If Rulers are men really Godly, have &amp; maintain the true Fear of God before their eyes; they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to execute their reſpective Offices well, ſo as to attain the right ends of Civil Government: As <hi>Nehemith</hi> ſaid of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hanani,</hi> Neh. 7.2 That he gave him Charge over <hi>Jeruſalem, Because he was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, and one that feared God above many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures, Civil Rulers may learn how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their Civil Power aright, for the glory of God &amp; the good of the People. It is ſet down in the Scriptures, what is the Nature &amp; End of the Civil Magiſtrates Office: As in Rom. 13.3, 4. <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, &amp; thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: For he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain: For he is the Miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</hi> So in Lev. 19.15. <hi>Ye ſhall do no Unrighteouſneſs on Judgment; thou ſhall not reſpect the perſon of the Poor, nor honour the perſon of the Mighty: but in Righteouſneſs ſhalt thou Judge thy Neighbour.</hi> So in a Chron. 19.6, 7 <hi>And ſaid to the Judges, take heed what ye do: for ye Judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001769_0016_0FB825A115E3BE98"/>
with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed &amp; do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of Perſons, nor taking of Gifts.</hi> Thus when Civil Rulers, learn their Duty as Rulers out of the Scriptures, they are the more likely to well execute their reſpective Offices; and thus Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures, is a thing very needful, &amp; profitable for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The frequent Reading and Study of the Scriptures keepeth freſh in the Memory of Rulers, the Examples of ſundry Good Rulers in old time, whoſe Examples of right Ruling, are recorded in the Scriptures for Imitation. And as Examples, are more prevalent than Precepts, in ſome things; ſo they are not without their uſefulneſs in the affairs of Civil Government. The Record of the Examples of thoſe good Rulers of old, and the Bleſſings that followed them as a Reward of their Faithfulneſs in Government, hath a great tendency to influence the minds of preſent Rulers, to a vigorous diſcharge of their Duty, as ſuch; that they may be the recipient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſame Bleſſings. And thus Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Studying the Scriptures is a thing needful &amp; profitable for all Rulers, Supreme or Subordinate. The Scripture Examples of good Rulers are thoſe, of <hi>David, Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah</hi>; and other Godly Kings, who Ruled
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001769_0017_0FB825A249081688"/>
well; and God ſhow'red down many Bleſſings upon them. Its peculiarly obſervable in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi>'s caſe, in 2 Chron. 17.5, 6. <hi>That he had Riches &amp; Honour in abundance.</hi> And this ſeems to be ſent from God, as a reward for his good Service in Government: For it's ſaid in the foregoing words; <hi>That he ſought the Lord God of his Fathers, &amp; walked in His Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore the Lord eſtabliſhed him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all Judah brought him Preſents; and he had Riches and Honour in abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The frequent Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures, impreſſeth on the minds of Rulers thoſe accounts of Evil Rulers, in old time, recorded in the Scriptures, &amp; the Judgments of God that fell upon them, for their Sins and Errors in Government; which hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to diſſwade preſent Rulers, whether Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior or Inferior, from the like evil practiſes in Government, left being found in the like Sins, the like Judgments ſhould alight upon them also: For thoſe things written in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, were for our admonition &amp; cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as ſome of them for our imitation. And thus the Reading &amp; Studying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is needful &amp; profitable for Rulers. In the Scriptures there is Recorded the wicked Reigns of <hi>Jereboam, Ahab, Ahaz,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zedekiah</hi>; and other Ungodly Kings &amp; Rulers, on whom the wrath of God fell in the terrible effects of it in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001769_0018_0FB825A3A0343F58"/>
Judgments, brought on them and their Houſes; for their wickedneſs in Government. Very Remarkable is <hi>Ahab</hi>'s caſe; who by a wicked act in Government had diſſeiſed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Naboth</hi> of his Vineyard, &amp; his Life alſo: but God meets him by his Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>; as in I <hi>King.</hi> 21.19. Upon the ſame ſpot of ground he had ſo unrighteouſly gotten, with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Threatning, which came exactly to paſs; <hi>in the place where the Dogs licked the blood Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, there ſhall they lick thy blood, even thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Scriptures containeth a Body of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Statutes, which altho' they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God as the Civil Law of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only; yet many of them are of a general Nature, and are founded in natural Equity; and ſo are as ſuitable for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, States &amp; Kingdoms, as for God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old; conformable unto which, ſundry Chriſtian Nations, (and ours in particular) have fram'd many of their Civil Laws. So that upon this account the frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures brings the Civil Ruler to a better underſtanding of the Civil Law, the Rule of right exerting Power of Government; and ſo is Needful and Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all Civil Rulers.</p>
            <p>Moſt of our own Laws, called <hi>Capital Laws,</hi> are exactly the ſame, with the Law given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in thoſe caſes; and ſundry other of our
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001769_0019_0FB825A5EB6D8DC0"/>
Laws are conformable to, and framed out of the Reaſon of thoſe Laws recorded in the Scripture; and ſo the Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures is very Needful and Profitable for our Rulers, in order to know and underſtand the Rule by which they are to Govern us; without the knowledge of which, they can never rightly Execute Judgment for God and for the Good of His People.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>That the frequent Reading and Studying the Civil Law of the Land, is a thing very Needful &amp; Profitable for Civil Rulers.</hi> This will appear if we Conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Knowledge and right Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, cometh by Reading &amp; Study. <hi>Homo fit Doctus non vi ſed ſepe Legendo</hi>: And the Knowledge of the Law is ſo needful a thing for Civil Rulers to have; that they can not rightly execute their Civil Office without it: They cannot do Juſtice &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without it (except it be by accident, as a blind man may chance to hit the mark) for the Law being the Rule they are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in Judgment, (and that they are Sworn to attend) how can they do Juſtice, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Rule, unleſs they know it? In all affairs whatſoever, its needful that men know the Rule by which they are to act, otherwiſe its as likely their actions will be irregular as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001769_0020_0FB825A75F179458"/>
regular. One reaſon why there is a Wo, pronounced upon that Land, whoſe King is a Child, (as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10 16.) is becauſe being a Child in Knowledge, he can't underſtand the Law the rule of his Government, and ſo can't rightly ſway his ruling Rod; for want of which, the Kingdom will be in a ſad caſe; and in danger of utter Ruine: Likewiſe when the Rulers of any People are Children in the Knowledge of the Law; that Land is in danger of Ruine: For however good the Law is, which is the great Bulwark to ſecure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Life, Liberty and Property to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſince its but a dead Letter, if the Ruler or Rulers don't underſtand it, the Common Wealth is in a ſad caſe; the beſt Subjects in all their beſt Enjoyments, ſtand upon a very fickle, uncertain and dangerous Foundation: <hi>The malicious Tranſgreſſor riſeth up, and no man is ſure of his Life; as Job</hi> 24.22. And the wicked treſpaſs or riſeth up, and no man is ſure of his Inheritance; tho' there be the beſt Laws in the world to defend it; becauſe he that is to Execute the law is a meer <hi>Child in Knowledge,</hi> and doth not know that righteous Rule by which Controversies are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Knowledge of the Civil Law which cometh by Reading &amp; Study, is a thing very needful &amp; profitable for Civil Rulers, in that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001769_0021_0FB825AC71E49D10"/>
hereby they are enabled to weigh with a juſt Balance, thoſe Pleadings of the Law that are frequently offered to their Conſideration, when they are ſetting on the Seats or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo as to reject Error tho' in never ſo fine a Dreſs; and to receive Arguments of Truth, and be ſwayed thereby, tho' not ſet off with ſo much flowriſh of Words. If men that are Rulers and Judges don't know the Law, they are eaſily impoſed upon, by more knowing Advocates, that ſometimes have a bad Cauſe to manage; and ſo in the iſſue the matter is brought to that fatal Cataſtrophe, that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Complaineth of, in Iſa. 59.14. <hi>Judgment is turned away backward, Juſtice ſtandeth afar off, Truſh is fallen in the Streets, and Equity can not enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Knowledge of the Law of the Land which comes by Reading and Study, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable for Civil Rulers; in that this good Knowledge gives them good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Fortitude of Mind; or at leaſt hath a tendency ſo to do, without which its a very difficult task for the Civil Magiſtrate to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Office aright. If Rulers are afraid on the Seats of Judgment, there is but a little or no Likelihood of their bearing the Sword of Juſtice, ſo as to make others Fear; ſo as to be a Terror to Evil doers: And if Rulers have but little knowledge in the Law the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001769_0022_0FB825AD65399A20"/>
Rule by which they are to Govern, and be Perſons of ſo much common Senſe as to know they know but little, it hath a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make them afraid, when in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Civil Power, ſo every threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Word from a bold &amp; ſawcy Delinquent, which a wiſe Judge wou'd Curb and Puniſh, is ſuch a Lion in the way, to the ignorant Ruler, that it brings him to <hi>a ne plus Ultra</hi>; he dare proceed no further: And ſo the daring Criminal Offender paſſeth with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Reading and Studying of the Law, is a thing needful and profitable for Civil Rulers, in that God hath ſeen meet to Enjoyn it on the Chief Ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even the King upon the Throne; and for ſuch Reaſons as make it as needful for all Inferiour Rulers. That which God doth Command Rulers to do, as Needful, none may ſay is Needleſs: Now God expreſly Commandeth, as in our Text; <hi>That the King when he ſitteth on the Throne of his Kingdom, ſhould write him a Copy of the Law in a Book; and it ſhould be with him, &amp; he ſhould Read therein all the Days of his Life; that he might learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all theſe Statutes, to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Reading and, Studying the Civil Law of the Land, by which Knowledge is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is a thing very needful and profitable
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001769_0023_0FB825AF39EA5EC8"/>
for Rulers; in order to keep up their Credit &amp; Reputation among the People over whom they are to Rule; without which they can't be very Serviceable as Rulers, in their Places. When the People have a contemptible low Thought of the Ruler, and eſteem him as a man of little or no Knowledge in the Law, the Rule of Government; they but little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him, or his Civil Commands, how Juſt ſo ever they are, and but a little do they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Puniſhments that the Law layeth upon Tranſgreſſors, how great ſo ever they are; ſince they Eſteem him that is to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law a meer Child in Knowledge, whom they think they can eaſily delude or affright; And ſo the great End of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is in a manner Loſt, and the Ruler very Unſerviceable in his Place.</p>
            <p>Having endeavoured to Illuſtrate &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Doctrine in both the Branches of it. I would make ſome ſuitable Improvement; and that in ſeveral Uſes.</p>
            <p>USE, I. Of INFERENCE or IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRUCTION, in a few Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn, <hi>That the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Office well Executed, is that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires or calls for great Labour &amp; Pains.</hi> Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we may ſee is inconſiſtent with the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001769_0024_0FB825B06F2B5140"/>
right diſcharge of Duty in a Civil Ruler. Frequent Reading &amp; Studying, the Scriptures and the Civil Law of the Common Wealth which the Doctrine ſheweth, is ſo needful for the Civil Ruler, is Laborious. <hi>Solomon</hi> well obſerves, in Eccl. 12.12. <hi>That much Study is a wearineſs to the Fleſh.</hi> He that will Qualify himſelf for a good Ruler, muſt take Pains. He that thinks a man may be Qualified for the Office of a Civil Ruler without Reading and Study, which takes up Time, and coſts Labour &amp; Pains is much miſtaken. Rulers are to bear the weight of Government upon their Shoulders; the ſmaller Veſſels the leſſer Subjects, are to have their dependance upon them, to preſerve them from thoſe injurious Oppreſſions and other Miſchiefs that they are liable unto: In this ſenſe they are to be as Nails faſtened in a ſure place, on which they hang the ſmaller Veſſels. As was ſaid of <hi>Eliakim,</hi> a Chief Ruler in <hi>Judah,</hi> in Iſa. 22.22, &amp; 24. <hi>I will faſten him as a Nail in a ſure Place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they ſhall hang upon him all the Veſſels of ſmaller quantity.</hi> Now what Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port can the Civil Ruler afford to the ſmaller Veſſels the leſſer Subjects, that have their dependnnce upon him, for Security &amp; Safety, many ways, unleſs he be a man of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? And how can Knowledge be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without Reading &amp; Study? <hi>Nemo ſapiens
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001769_0025_0FB825B205669950"/>
naſcitur.</hi> And Reading &amp; Study is Laborious. So upon the whole we ſee that the Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Office well Executed is Laborious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we infer, <hi>That men who are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in Reading and Studying the Scriptures, and know but little of the Mind of God contained in the scriptures; are not fit for Civil Rulers.</hi> Hence we may learn, that all Perſons of Atheiſtical Principles, are unfit for Rulers; and ſo are all Perſons groſly Ignorant of the Scriptures: alſo all Irreligious Perſons, who ſhew by their Practical Ungodlineſs, that they are Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Law of God that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth &amp; Converteth the Soul, Enlightens the Mind, and maketh Wiſe the Simple. If Rulers don't fear God, (which is gain'd in great part by the frequent uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) what may be expected from them, but that as often as they can do it, and paſs with impunity, (which they have great advantage for, conſidering the Sphere of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation which they are placed in) <hi>they will Sell the Righteous for Silver, and the Poor for a Pair of Shoes</hi>? Which the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> complaineth of, (in <hi>Amos.</hi> 2.6.) as the ſad Cuſtom of thoſe Evil Times. <hi>Abraham</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no Juſtice would be done him in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi>'s Court, but rather that he ſhould be Slain, tho' an innocent Man; not becauſe of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001769_0026_0FB825B389C6AB98"/>
the want of Civil Government in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for that there was, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> was Chief Ruler at that time; but the reaſon of his fears and ſad expectation, aroſe from an apprehenſion he had that there was not the fear of God in that Place; as we may ſee in Gen. 20.11. <hi>Becauſe I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hence we may be further inſtructed, <hi>That it is not every good Man, who doth really fear God; that is fit for a Civil Ruler</hi>: For ſome ſuch have little or no Knowledge of the Law of the Common Wealth, which Rulers are Bound, nay Sworn to attend in Government; and ſo not fit, And many times the caſe is ſo with ſome good Men, that they can't qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify and fit themſelves for good Rulers, tho' men of natural good Abilities; for the caſe is ſo circumſtanced with them, that they can't find Time to gain Knowledge in the law, the Rule of Civil Government; which Knowledge comes by Reading and Study: For their Secular occaſions, needful to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in order to Support themſelves and their Families in this World, ingroſſeth all their Time; except ſo much as is requiſite for Natural Comforts, and Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſo if power of Government ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001769_0027_0FB825B4E134C738"/>
be devolved on them, <hi>they cannot be Strong Rods for Scepters to bear Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence we learn, <hi>That Rulers ſhould ſpend Time and deep Tho't upon the Scriptures and the Civil Law of the Land; in or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> indeed the latter is not like to be without the former. One Reaſon why God Commanded the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as in our Text; <hi>To write him a Copy of the Book of the Law, and to keep it by him, and to Read therein all the Days of his Life</hi>; was, That he might have ſo well digeſted the whole Body of the Political Statutes contained therein, in his thoughts; that when he came to apply it to Particular Perſons and Caſes, he might not be at a loſs, but might make a ready wiſe &amp; Juſt Deciſion of all Controverſies, according to this Rule. If Judges come upon the Seats of Judgment unprepared as to any precedent Study of the Law; one of theſe Miſchiefs ordinarily will enſue, Either Juſtice muſt be delayed, until the Judges have took time to Study the Law referring to ſuch. Cauſes, as
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001769_0028_0FB825B6A0C55BC8"/>
are depending before them; which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Subject, many ways: or elſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be given ignorantly, which is as like to be wrong, as right; and this will bring all Legal Deciſions to a meer Chance, which will make the righteous Subjects whom the Laws ſhould Secure and Protect, as unſafe in all their beſt Enjoyments, as if the Dice were caſt for them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence we learn, <hi>That the Civil Ruler ſhould be a man of a good Eſtate, that he may be able to afford Time to be ſpent in Reading &amp; Study, in order furniſh him with Knowledge in State Affairs, that he might ſerve the Publick the better.</hi> There are ſome Men that would make good Rulers, if that of Eſtate were not wanting: but for want of this, they are not only apt to be of mean and mercinary Spirits, but are alſo unable to ſpend that Time which is needful in Reading and Study, thereby to Treaſure up Knowledge; and ſo they are upon this Conſideration uncapable of being good Rulers. And when any Government finds it needful to place Perſons in exalted Stations of Truſt and Civil Power, who are of mean Eſtates; there ſhould be ſome way found to ſupply that detect, by afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſuch Supplies out of the. Publick Treaſury, as may make it a thing ſeaſable for
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001769_0029_0FB825BCA73621B8"/>
them, to ſpend a convenient part of their Time, in Reading and Study that they may ſerve the Publick the better. And upon this Conſideration of its being needful for Rulers to ſpend part of their Time (and ſo diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage their own Eſtates) in Reading and Studying the Law, that they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Publick Intereſt; <hi>and be God's Miniſters for good to His People</hi>: I ſay upon this Conſideration, it becomes a very juſt, Righteous and Reaſonable thing, for the Ruled to Pay Tribute to Rulers: Rom. 13.6, 7 <hi>For this cauſe pay you Tribute also; for they are God's Miniſters attending constinually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their Dues: Tribute to whom Tribute is Due,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>USE, II. Of EXHORTATION, unto ſeveral Ranks and Orderſ of Perſons here Preſent,</p>
            <p n="1">1. With all due Regards and utmoſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, &amp; Sabmiſſion, I would ſuggeſt, a few word of Exhortation to our <hi>Honourable and Worſhipful RULERS; that now are or this Day may be fixed in the moſt Exalted Station of Civil Dominion in this Colony</hi>; as well as to all Subordinate Rulers, that have or may have a ſhare in the Executive Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:001769_0030_0FB825BF218C39F0"/>Honourable, &amp; Worſhipful, &amp; worthy Gentlemen;</p>
            <p>The Exhortation that may be offered to you and each of you, as reſulting from the Text and Doctrine under our management; may be Propoſed in theſe following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Be pleaſed to take Time, in ſeriouſly Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Studying the Scriptures, the Law of God that Convinceth and Converteth the Soul, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth the Mind, and maketh Wiſe the Simple.</hi> It is not to be imagined, that this Duty hath been grofly neglected by our Honourable &amp; Religious Rulers, and it is not under that apprehenſion, that the Counſel is now given: but as it lieth fairly in my way, at this time, having been ſhewing how needful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it is for Rulers to frequently Read and Study the Scriptures. And here ſuffer me a few words. With all ſubmiſſion, let it be ſpoken to our Honourable Rulers; The greater Care, Time and Diligence is taken, by your ſelves in Reading and Studying the Word of God, the more likely it will be, that you will become Wiſe to Salvation; and the more capable you will be of doing GOD and the Government, good Service as Ruler; for in the Scriptures you learn the Art of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment; and there you have all manner of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001769_0031_0FB825C0E3144920"/>
Encouragement to the right Diſcharge of thoſe Duties that are incumbent on you as Rulers: and that as a chief, &amp; notable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive, that GOD will be with you; if you Zealouſly and Religiouſly attend your Duty as Rulers: As in 2 Chron 19.6. <hi>Ye Judge not for Man, but for God, who is with you in the Judgment.</hi> In the Scriptures you find the End of Civil Government, and what are the moſt proper Methods to be taken by Rulers, in order to attain this End; which may be a Motive to good Rulers to Converſe much with the Scriptures, that they may be what God hath appointed them to be, His Miniſters for good to His People.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Be pleaſed to be frequently Reading &amp; Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the Civil Law of the Land.</hi> Let a Copy of this Law, the Rule limiting your Power in Government, and teaching you how to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; be with you, and Read therein all the Days of the Life of your Civil Power; that you may keep all the Statutes thereof, and do them; and may be the better able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all of us, Subject to your Authority, to keep thoſe good and wholeſome Laws like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I need not ſuggeſt it, to Perſons of your Reaſon and Experience, that the Study of the Law is a large Field, in which many a Painful Step muſt be taken; and much Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation uſed, before we diſcover the utmoſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001769_0032_0FB825C264567D80"/>
Boundaries of it: yet the Delight that is in it, to ingenious Minds, in your Stations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Scire multum eſt Jucundiſſimum</hi>) Knowledge is moſt Pleaſant: and the Profit that reſolteth there from, unto your Selves, and to the whole Government under your Command, I hope will be an encouraging Motive thereunto; tho' the work may ſeem tedious and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire length of Time, depth of Tho't, and great Pains. I hope none will object, That our Civil Law is ſo plain and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that there needeth not much Time to be ſpent in the Reading and Study of it. For tho' the more the matter is look'd into, the more Knowledge will be gain'd, yet the more ſhall we find it to be, <hi>Durum opus eſt Difficile</hi>; an hard &amp; difficult Task. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eaſy a thing to underſtand the right ſpirit and meaning of the Law, ſo as to be able to make a right Application of it, to all the various Perſons and Cauſes, that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges on the Seats of Judicature, as ſome men vainly imagine. If any ſuch Objection, as above ſtated ſhou'd be made, it may be Replied; That the Political Statutes which God gave to His <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, were as plain &amp; eaſie to be underſtood, as any of the Laws of Nations of a later Date; and yet God did expreſly Command that the King upon the Throne, the Chief of Executive
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001769_0033_0FB825C3EE2CDCA0"/>
Rulers, and the Fountain of Executive Power, <hi>ſhould write him a Copy of this Law in a Book; and ſhould Read therein all the Days of his Life.</hi> Neither the Dignity of his Office, nor the Weight of his other Buſineſs ſhould excuſe him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Be humbly Exhorted to diſtribute Justice and Judgment among our ſeveral Tribes, and in all our Gates, according to this Rule, the Law.</hi> Let the Law Study'd &amp; Underſtood by you, and each of you, be the Rule and Meaſure of all your proceedings in Government: To this Rule you are limited by the Solemn Oath of God upon you; and by your virtual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the People, by whoſe Suffrages, you are deſigned to thoſe Places of Power and Truſt, that you are, or may be in. Let neither fear of Offending ſome, nor hope of Pleaſing others; nor any other thing cauſe you to deviate from this Rule the Law, in any of your Civil Adminiſtrations. Let this be your peculiar Motto and Maxim of State, <hi>Fiat J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>It will not ſurely be ungrateful, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your ſerious Conſideration, that Scripture; Deut. 1.16, 17. <hi>And I Charged your Judges at that time, ſaying, Hear the Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Brethren, and Judge Righteouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every Man &amp; his Brother, &amp; the Stranger

that is with him. Ye ſhall not reſpect Perſons in Judgment, but you ſhall Hear the ſmall as well as the great; you ſhall not be afraid of the Face of Man; for the Judgment is God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>Be pleaſed to ſhew a diſtinguiſhing Zeal for God &amp; His Cauſe, in bearing the Sword of Juſtice ſo, as it may be terrible to Evil Doers.</hi> In this you will do a great Service for God, and for His People alſo, even in ſeverely Puniſhing according to the Law, thoſe Wicked Men, who greatly Provoke God, by their high handed iniquities, and not only bring Wrath upon themſelves; but are one principal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retorious Cauſe of thoſe heavy Judgments, that from time to time, fall upon our Land. We read, Joſh. 22.20. <hi>That one man Sinned, even Achan the Son of Zeri, and Wrath fell upon the whole Congregation of Iſrael; and that man periſhed not alone in his Iniquity.</hi> Thoſe that thus Offend God, and bring Wrath upon His People, ſhould be Puniſhed by the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate according to the Merit of their Offences; and for this reaſon the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is Armed with the Sword, that he might cut off from the Common wealth thoſe Wicked Men, whoſe Crimes merit it; and who are (as gangren'd Members, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body) infectious and deſtructive to the whole Body Politick. <hi>Enſe reciderdum ut ne pars ſincera trahatur immedicabile Vulnus.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001769_0035_0FB825C8FA3BCA88"/>
The incurable Limb muſt be cut off, left the whole Body be Ruined. Be pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Juſt puniſhments the Law hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, upon Criminal Offenders of every Kind, ſo, as you may be God's Miniſters in this reſpect for good, Revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do evil; <hi>that all Iſrael may Hear and Fear, and do no more ſo Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suffer me a few words by way of Motive here, in two Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] For Rulers to bear a ſevere Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against Sin, &amp; Sinners; is the ready way to bring on themſelves and their Families a peculiar Bleſſing from God. See that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Numb. 25.12, 13. <hi>Wherefore, behold I give him my Covenant of Peace. And he ſhall have it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe he was Zealous for his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">[2.] For Rulers thus to do, is the way to turn away God's Wrath from a Sinful People, &amp; to lengthen out their Tranquility: Numb. 25, 11. <hi>Phineas the Son of Eleazer, the Son of Aaron the Prieſt, hath turned away my Wrath, while he was Zealous for my ſake among them.</hi> And ſo ſaith God by His Prophet of old; Jer. 5, 1. <hi>Run ye to and fro through the Streets of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and ſearch in the broad Ways thereof, if ye can find a Man, to ſtand up &amp; execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſeek the Truth, and I will Pardon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001769_0036_0FB825CBEA199E50"/>2. In the Second Place by way of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would make my humble Addreſs, unto my <hi>Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the MINISTRY</hi>: And tho' it belongs not to us, to execute Judgment for God according to the Statutes of the Land, (as it belonged not to King <hi>Uzziah</hi> to burn Incenſe, but to the Prieſts the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi>;) and ſo not ſo needful for us to Read &amp; Study the Civil Law: Yet as Miniſters of CHRIST, and Stewards of the Myſteries of GOD, and Rulers in His Houſe; it is very Needful and Profitable for us, to Read and Study the Scriptures, in the which the Law of CHRIST is contained. That ought to be the Rule of all our Sacred Adminiſtrations: <hi>Chriſt was not leſs Faithful in all his Houſe, than Moſes was in his.</hi> And HE is the great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, as well as the King of His Church. And in the Scriptures His Laws are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to which we must Conform as ſtrictly in our Miniſtry and Government, as the Civil Ruler muſt Conform to the Civil Law, as the Rule of the Lawful Exerciſe of his Power. Let us therefore Painfully Study this Law of Chriſt in all the Parts of it; and make it the Rule of our Practiſe, in the performance of all the Duties of our Sacred Calling. To CHRIST our Great Lord and King, we muſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001769_0037_0FB825CF314CE538"/>
ere long be Accountable; and the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry then will be, Whether we have Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all things, in the Houſe and Worſhip of God <hi>according to the Pattern given in the Mount.</hi> Therefore let us <hi>take a Copy of this Law,</hi> in the Book of the Scriptures; <hi>and let it be with us, and let us Read therein all the Days of our Lives; that we may learn to fear the Lord our God, and to keep all His Commandments and his Statutes, to do them.</hi> In our Miniſtry and Government, let us bear a due Teſtimony againſt Sin, and Sinners; as did <hi>Phincas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazer,</hi> that God may <hi>Bleſs us, and Eſtabliſh with us the Covenant of an Everlaſting Prieſthood, becauſe we have been Zealous for His ſake among His People.</hi> That bold and daring Tranſgreſſors, where the Sword of Civil Power doth not reach, or not ſufficiently correct and amend, may be reached and ſlain by the Sword of the Word: That it may be, as was ſaid, in 1 King. 19.17. <hi>Him that eſcapeth the Sword of Jehu, ſhall Eliſha Slay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third Branch of Exhortation may be directed to all ſuch, who according to the Conſtitution of our Government, are <hi>Electors of Rulers</hi>; either as they are <hi>Freemen of this Corporation,</hi> or as they are <hi>Members of that Repreſentative Body of our Colony,</hi> to whom the Power of Electing Inferiour Rulers doth
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001769_0038_0FB825D0B4B52DE8"/>
belong. The Advice to you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> is this; <hi>Take care to Chooſe ſuch for Rulers whether Superiour or Subordinate, as are men of Religion, and Knowledge in the Laws.</hi> Such as Conſcientiouſly Read and Study the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Laws of the Land, that they may do God and His People good Service as Rulers; and be God's Miniſters for good. Don't chooſe either Vicious Perſons or Babes in Knowledge, to manage our State Affairs; ſuch are not fit to have the Charge over our <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> or if they have it can they manage that Charge and Truſt, as becomes good Rulers. And don't chooſe Men to Rule over us, meerly becauſe they are your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, and will ſuit you in ſome of your particular Deſigns &amp; private Intereſts: Neither with-hold your Suffrages from any that are Men of Religion and Knowledge of the Laws, becauſe they are not of your Faction, and will not ſuit with your private Humour and particular Intereſts. If you do guide your Choice by private Favour, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or Faction, without regard to Publick Good; you will Violate the Solemn Oath of God upon you, and bring your ſelves under great Guilt; and can not anſwer it before God in the Great Day of Account. You ought herein to act in the fear of God, and diſcarding all reſpect to your Private Intereſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001769_0039_0FB825D220F852A8"/>
and all Prejudice; aiming at God's Glory, and the Good of His People in general; and as God declares to the Rulers what they muſt do in order to Rule well; viz <hi>Write them a Copy of this Book of the Law, and Read therein,</hi> &amp;c. So thoſe you observe moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this Duty which God requires of Rulers; they are the Perſons for whom you ſhould give your Suffrages when ever you are called to it.</p>
            <p>To you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who are the <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Body of our Colony,</hi> I would ſay one word in ſpecial; That altho' there may want ſome further good Laws to be made, for the Puniſhing of Sin, Immorality and Prophaneneſs, that are too much abounding in our Land (and if that be the Caſe, its your buſineſs to Exerciſe your Legiſlative Power for that end) yet it may be a matter more highly requiſite in order to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to put good Laws already made, in due Execution: And your buſineſs herein, is to put into Place of Power, ſuch Inferiour Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers throughout our ſeveral Tribes, as in their reſpective Stations, will put good Laws in due Execution. Such as know the Law, and ſo are ſuch as crafty and bold Criminals, or their Advocates and Abetters can not, battle; and ſuch as have learned the Fear of God out of the Scriptures, and are men of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001769_0040_0FB825D45FEF2008"/>
ſuch Religious and Conſcience, that they will be Zealous for God among His People, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sword of Juſtice not in Vain; but ſo as to be God's Miniſters for good, revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do evil.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I would by way of Exhortation offer a few words, unto all thoſe that are the <hi>Ruled,</hi> Subject to the Authority of Civil Rulers: And the Exhortation to you is, <hi>Take care to Keep the Laws of God, and the good and wholeſome Laws of the Common Wealth.</hi> It is as much our Duty to keep the Laws, as its the Duty of our Religious Rulers to inflict the Puniſhments of the Law upon us in caſe we are the breakers of it.</p>
            <p>And here more Particularly be Exhorted to diſcharge Four Points of Duty, reſpecting our Carriage towards our Rulers, which the Laws of God as well as the Laws of the Government make our eſpecial Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To Honour and Regard them as our Civil Fathers; not Vilifying or Reproaching of them in any of our words or actions; as in Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render therefore to all their Duet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due.</hi> So in Exod. 22.18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods, nor curſe the Ruler of thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) To Freely and Readily Pay them Tribute for their Serving us as Rulers, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001769_0041_0FB825D8363A7240"/>
being God's Miniſters to us for good: Rom. 13.6, 7. <hi>For this cauſe pay you Tribute alſo: for they are God's Miniſters, attending continually on this very thing. Render therefore tribute to whom Tribute is Due.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To Pray for them to the <hi>Eternal Lord Heaven and Earth,</hi> whoſe Vicegerents they are; that they may be acting in their ſphere of Exaltation for God's Glory, &amp; our good. To this we are Commanded, 1 Tim. 2.2 <hi>Pray for King's, &amp; all in Place of Authority, that under them we may lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4) To Submit to them as they are God's Miniſters to Rule over us, and have received their Power from GOD; and are called <hi>Gods</hi> from the dignity of their Office: which Submiſſion we muſt render unto them as a Duty which God requires of us, ſo long as they keep within the limits of their Power in Ruling over us. And this we muſt do not only for fear of their Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake: For the Rule is, Rom 13.5. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be Subject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi> And God ſaith, in the Second Verſe of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God: and ſhall receive to himſelf Damnation.</hi>
