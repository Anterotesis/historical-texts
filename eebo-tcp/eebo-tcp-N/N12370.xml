            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am much concerned, leſt an unfavourable conſtruction ſhould be put upon any word that may fall from me in the courſe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as reflecting upon the reſpectable members of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I wiſh, Sir, to be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015612_0004_0F99DA4974E95D48"/>underſtood as bearing the gentlemen of that Church, a very high reſpect. None that now exiſt have been the authors of that which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of: With the generoſity of ſentiment, that now prevails; with the ſame enlightened minds, I am perſuaded they never would have been the authors.</p>
            <p>I diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it is true, but, I truſt, it is upon the moſt liberal grounds: When I oppoſe its eſtabliſhment, I do not mean to oppoſe the Church itſelf. I would equally oppoſe the eſtabliſhment of any other, though I admired its conſtitution ever ſo much. I firmly believe that this Petition ariſes from an unextinguiſhable love to the free and equal rights of mankind, and not from a diſlike to one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Chriſtians, more than another. And Sir! while a love to Freedom and Equality is the grand ſentiment that inſpires all ranks of men, in this great conteſt; while you ſeel an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable Spirit of Freedom, animating you to all theſe meaſures; how can you find in your heart to blame thoſe who riſque their all, and ſtand with you in the foremoſt rank of zeal and danger, if they ſhould only deſire to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves and children, the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that you enjoy? You muſt pardon them, it, ſenſible of the injuries that have been done them in times paſt, while we mutually groaned under a foreign yoke, and anxious for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Freedom and Happineſs of their poſterity,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015612_0005_0F99DA4A302368F8"/>they ſhould improve the important moment of forming a conſtitution for this moſt righteous purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And, now Sir! I beg leave to offer a few of thoſe reaſons which induce me to oppoſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhment of any one denomination of Chriſtians in this State, under our new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. My firſt, and moſt capital reaſon, againſt all religious eſtabliſhments is, that <hi>they are an infringement of Religious Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religious eſtabliſhments, as far as they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, do interfere with the rights of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience: In effect, they amount to nothing leſs, than the legiſlature's taking the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men into their own hands, and taxing them at diſcretion.</p>
            <p>We contend, that no legiſlature under Heaven, has a right to interfere with the judgment and conſcience of men, in religious matters, if their opinions and practices do not injure the State. The rights of conſcience, are now too generally underſtood, to make it needful to take much pains to convince mankind, that they appertain to an higher tribunal, and that the objects of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man legiſlation, are quite of a different nature. The State may give countenance to religion, by defending and protecting all denominations of Chriſtians, who are inoffenſive and uſeful. The
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015612_0006_0F99DA4B00026160"/>State may enact good laws for the puniſhment of vice. and the encouragent of virtue. The State may do any thing for the ſupport of religion, without partiality to particular ſocieties, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon the rights of private judgment. But when the legiſlative authority of the state, ſets itſelf up as a judge in church controverſies, and proceeds by law, to declare <hi>this</hi> ſyſtem of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons right, and <hi>that</hi> wrong; when it proceeds to lay hardſhips upon the profeſſors of the one, while it laviſhes its bounties on the other, and that while both are equally uſeful and inoffenſive — I ſay, in this, it not only miſtakes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects of legiſlation, but is chargeable with manifeſt injuſtice. No legiſlature upon earth, has a right to do ſuch a thing: Nay, we contend, that ſuch a right cannot poſſibly be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them. I can communicate to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, a power to diſpoſe of part of my property, for the ſecurity of the remaining part: I may give him a right to reſign a part of my perſonal liberty to the obligation of good laws, as a means of preſerving the reſt,—but, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, —I ſay it is out of my power, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to any man on earth, a right to diſpoſe of my conſcience, and to lay down for me what I ſhall believe and practice in religious matters. Our judgment and practice in religious matters, is not like our purſe; we cannot reſign them to any man of ſet of men on earth; and therefore, no man or ſet of men on earth, either has or can have, a right to bind us in religious matters. The rights of conſcience are unnalienable, and therefore,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015612_0007_0F99DA4C1B45A4C8"/>all laws to bind it, are, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null and void. Every attempt of this kind is tyrany, let it be made by whatever body of men, and in whatever age: — Of all tyrany, religious tyrany is the worſt, and men of true ſentiment, will ſcorn ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, where they cannot enjoy Religious Liberty.</p>
            <p>And, now Sir! permit me to take a ſhort view of religious eſtabliſhments, and ſee, whether they do not more or leſs, bear hard upon the rights of private judgment, and partake, in greater or ſmaller degrees, of this worſt of tyrany.</p>
            <p>On all hands it will be acknowledged, that thoſe eſtabliſhments are of this nature, which lay heavy penalties upon thoſe who refuſe to conform to them. Can you form an idea of more horrid cruelty exercired upon the rights of conſcience, than that which impoſes fines, impriſonment and death, upon thoſe who preſume to differ from the eſtabliſhed religion? You, Sir! look back with horror upon the hiſtory of ſuch ſavage cruelty, — the more crued, as it has ever been exerciſed under the colour of law.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame nature, though differing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the degree of their cruelty, are thoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhments, which incapacitate good ſubjects; who differ from the ſpeculative opinions of the State. Judgment and conſcience, in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is, or <hi>ought to be,</hi> as independent of our will, as our height or colour: They are formed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015612_0008_0F99DA4CA312B2E0"/>by the circumſtances of the time in which we live, by the manner of our education, by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our mind, and the degree of evidence. Would not that prince be eſteemed a cruel tyrant, who ſhould ordain, that every man of ſix feet high, and of a ſandy complexion, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the rights of citizens? An aſſembly of two hundred ſenators, who could ordain, that good citizens ſhould be deprived, on account of their inoffenſive opinions, would be two hundred times as cruel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next kind of eſtabliſhment that we meet with, is, that which now obtains in this State. I ſhall ſpeak cautiouſly of it, but I ſhall take the liberty to ſpeak freely, and ſhall only mention facts.</p>
            <p>Its chief characteriſticks are, that it makes a legal diſtinction between people of different deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, equally inoffenſive; it taxes all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations for the ſupport of the religion of one; it only tolerates thoſe that diffent from it, while it deprives them of ſundry privileges which the people of the eſtabliſhment enjoy.</p>
            <p>I ſay it makes a legal and odious diſtinction between ſubjects equally good. The law knows and acknowledges the ſociety of the one, as a Chriſtian Church; the law knows not the other Churches. The law knows the Clergy of the one, as miniſters of the goſpel; The law knows
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015612_0009_0F99DA4F315322E0"/>not the Clergy of the other Churches, nor will it give them a licence to marry their own people. Under this reputedly free government, licences for marriage are even now refuſed by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to any but the eſtabliſhed clergy. The law makes proviſion for the ſupport of one Church,—it makes no proviſion for the others. The law builds ſuperb Churches for the one,— it leaves the others to build their own Churches. the law, by incorporating the one Church, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it to hold eſtates, and to ſue for rights; the law does not enable the others to hold any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious property, not even the piſtances which are beſtowed by the hand of charity for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. No diffenting Church can hold or ſue for their own property at common law. They are obliged therefore to depoſit it in the Hands of Truſtees, to be held by them as their own private property, and to lie at their mercy. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this is, that too often their funds for the ſupport of religious worſhip, get into bad hands, and become either alienated from their proper uſe, or muſt be recovered at the expence of a ſuit in chancery.</p>
            <p>Theſe are important diſtinctions indeed, but theſe are not all. The law veſts the officers of the Church of England with power to tax not only her own people, but all other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the bounds of each reſpective pariſh, for the ſupport of the poor: an enormous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! which ought to be veſted in no one denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015612_0010_0F99DA4F6B6C2E30"/>more than another. Greater diſtinctions ſtill! where there are pariſhes the law throws the whole management of elections, that moſt ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable of all the rights of freemen, into the hands of Church officers excluſively.</p>
            <p>And why all this inequality? Why does the law thus favour one, and bear hard upon every other denomination of Chriſtians? The reaſon is only to be found in the ſpirit of the times when this unequal eſtabliſhment was framed, and in the Machiavelian policy of the Britiſh government; which ought not any longer to take place in this country.</p>
            <p>But that which ſhews much of the injuſtice and oppreſſion of the preſent eſtabliſhment, is the tax which it makes all other denominations pay to the ſupport of the religion of one. It puts its hand into the pocket of nine denominations, all equally pretending to the merit of good ſubjects and citizens, to beſtow upon one and ſupport its dignity.</p>
            <p>Sir! is this conſiſtent with our firſt notions of juſtice and equality? And here, it matters not whether the religious tax is equally levied upon the people at large, or whether it is paid by a general duty. The treaſury is the equal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all denominations in the State, and if it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015612_0011_0F99DA54B9D6A018"/>comes out of the treaſury, it comes in effect out of their pocket.<note n="*" place="bottom">The only difference is, that in the one caſe the impoſition would be ſo open, that the moſt ignorant would know and feel it; in the other it is more ſly and concealed from the vulgar eye. We admire the policy of this meaſure more than its juſtice. But it ought to be known, that by low, the moment the treaſury ceaſes to pay the clergy, the inhabitants are to be aſſeſſed for their ſupport.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſums advanced by the treaſury, for the ſupport of the Church of England, within the ſpace of the laſt ten years preceding the 31ſt of December 1775, amount to 164, 027 <abbr>

                  </abbr> given from the treaſury to the Church of St. Michael, in Charies-Town, before the end of 1758 of which 3500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> is expreſsly for the ſteeple. The whole of the tranſient duties, and an heavy duty on all rum and brandy, was given to St. Philip's for ſeveral years.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if you ſuppoſe that Diſſenters have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made more than one half of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015612_0012_0F99DA571DEA89F0"/>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">This has uſually been allowed to be the ſtate of the caſe; at preſent I believe it is on all hands agreed, that they are a great majority.</note> — the ſum that has been actually taken out of their pockets for the ſupport of a Church with which they did not worſhip, muſt amount to more than 82013 <abbr>

            </p>
            <p>But if the diſſenters do make a great majority of the inhabitants, the argument is ſtill ſtronger, and the impropriety of obliging the purſe of the <hi>major</hi> to ſuit itſelf to the conſciences of the <hi>minor,</hi> can't fail to weigh with every candid mind. The inequality of the religious burden, is the more evident, when you conſider, that the number of the eſtabliſhed Churches in this State is only twenty and many of them very ſmall, whereas the number of formed differenting congregations, the generality of which are much larger than thoſe of the eſtabliſhment, is at leaſt ſeventy-nine, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from a ſchedule now in my hand.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Quakers and ſundry others of which I had not then heard, were not put into that liſt; I think there are ninety.</note> Still more unequal it appears, when you take into
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015612_0013_0F99DA5854DF3748"/>computation the large ſums which diſſenters do actually pay over and above their ſhare of expence to the Church of England, for the ſupport of their own worſhip. From the beſt intelligence that I can obtain, they have made proviſion for the ſupport of their own worſhip, and would actually pay the ſum of 40,000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> annually, could they be furniſhed with Clergy. But the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of goſpel miniſters reduces the ſum very conſiderably.</p>
            <p>Sir! you may ſay, that the doors of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Church are open equally to all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and that all may equally enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. I have heard of ſuch an argument.</p>
            <p>But beſides that it is notorious, that what the public has paid for, in ſome inſtances has been converted into private property, and become the real eſtate of individuals,<note n="*" place="bottom">The pews in St. Philip's and St. Michael's Churches are now private property, and ſell from twelve hundred to nineteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Pounds; what they ſell for in St. George's I have not heard.</note> it would here be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely natural to ask, how a rational Diſſenter can enjoy the benefit of the eſtabliſhment? The only anſwer that I can give to ſuch a queſtion is a very ſhort one, <hi>He muſt do it at the expence of his own private judgment and conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But Diſſenters are tolerated; there is a free toleration: Does any man impoſe upon them?
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015612_0014_0F99DA586D3F5408"/>who prevents their worſhipping as they pleaſe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer. In this reſpect they ſtand upon the ſame footing with the Jews. No body moleſts them. But would it, Sir, content our brethren of the Church of England, to be <hi>barely tolerated?</hi> that is, <hi>not puniſhed</hi> for preſuming to think for themſelves. Is a bare toleration ſufficient for the majority of a free State? of a free State that expects to gain its liberties by the ſword? Would not a <hi>bare toleration</hi> be viewed by our brethren with infinite diſdain; Is this equality? Sure the juſtice of this houſe, now unfettered by Britiſh violence, will not permit the continuance of ſuch a monument of inequality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are ſome who entertain an idea of keeping up the Eſtabliſhment, meerly as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religious ſuperiority, without taxing other denominations. But they ſeem to forget, that every reaſon for which they deſire the ſuperiority by eſtabliſhment, operates as an abridgment of Religious liberty. For when a man preſumes to follow his own judgment in religious matters, and refuſes to <hi>conform,</hi> he muſt at leaſt ſubmit to this inferiority, or rather bear the reproach of the law, as not being on a level with thoſe that are Chriſtians in its eſteem. Still there remains injuſtice, and a foundation for diſſatisfaction. For Sir! let it be remembered, that there are many Diſſenters in this State, who care but little for
<pb n="15"
                   facs="unknown:015612_0015_0F99DA592E287F70"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>money that it coſts them to ſupport the Church of England. They value much more their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, their <hi>unalienable</hi> rights, than the expence. Sir! you very well know, that it was not the <hi>Three Pence on the Pound of Tea,</hi> that rouſed all the virtue of America. It is our birth-right that we prize. It is a full and undiminiſhed freedom in the exerciſe of our own judgment, in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, that we value and eſteem.</p>
            <p>And for a <hi>meer empty name,</hi> without profit,—for a meer title of pre-eminency without emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—is it worth while to have a bone of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs contention in the State, and to maintain theſe odious diſtinctions?</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is propoſal Mr. Speaker, to eſtabliſh all denominations by law; and to pay them all equally.</p>
            <p>This, Sir! may operate as a ſcheme of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in practice it muſt appear equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and impoſſible. Abſurd, as the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all religions would in effect be no eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment at all. It would deſtroy the very end of an eſtabliſhment, by reducing things juſt to the ſame ſtate they would be in without it, with this diſadvantage, that large bodies of men who could not obtain Church officers, might be oppreſſed, by being obliged to pay for that which they received no benefit from. But it would be found impracticable, as people of different ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015612_0016_0F99DA5A19DF2758"/>live intermingled, and there could be no poſſible diſtinction of pariſhes, ſo as to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date different denominations. But if the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment muſt from time to time conform itſelf to the prevailing party in each pariſh or diſtrict, there would not only be the ſame ground for complaint that there now is, but it would prove the means of everlaſting ſtrife. And indeed I am afraid that the expence would be found upon tryal inſupportable. Sir! it is impracticable in this State to eſtabliſh all denominations, and it is only thrown out to amuſe us. But to admit the eſtabliſhment of a few diſſenting Churches, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all others, as a means to make them acquieſce! It is too big with injuſtice to procure the conſent of an honeſt man. Let us all have equal privileges or nothing. EQUALITY OR NOTHING! ought to be our motto.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, every plan of eſtabliſhment,<note n="*" place="bottom">The author had a reference in this poſition, and in all others of this nature, to an eſtabliſhment of Pariſhes, with legal boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, and thoſe ſupported out of the public treaſury. He has the pleaſure to find, that a general eſtabliſhment, or rather incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of all denominations is now thought of, and likely to be adopted, which while it makes all parties happy, is not liable to the above objections. The plan he refers to, leaves only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation of the Church of England ſtanding, and opens the door to the equal incorporation of all denominations.—while not one Sect of Chriſtians in preference to all others, but Chriſtianity itſelf is the eſtabliſhed religion of the State.</note> muſt operate as a plan of injuſtice and oppreſſion; and therefore Sir! I am utterly againſt all eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this State. Leave each Church to be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015612_0017_0F99DA5AA8E08DC8"/>ſupported by its own members, and let its real merit be all its pre-eminence Thus while you give proper ſcope for a laudable emulation, you take away all complaint of injuſtice, and build your State upon the ſolid foundations of equity and righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>If theſe arguments have failed to weigh at other times, they ought now to have amazing weight. While you are contending for the rights of mankind with one of the greateſt powers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, will you leave your own Conſtitution marked with injuſtice and oppreſſion, and that in the moſt important of all reſpects that ever mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals contended for? What are all the Liberties for which we dare to grapple with Great-Britain, when compared with our religious Liberties? Can you imagine, that the numerous Diſſenters who venture their all in ſupport of American Freedom, would be fond of ſhedding their blood in this cauſe if they did not with confidence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they ſhould have juſtice done them, and that they ſhould ſtand upon the ſame footing with their brethren? Can you imagine that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of juſtice would not damp their ardour, if not utterly diſarm them? Do they ask any more than what they have an abſolute and indefeaſible right to enjoy? Sir! theſe are rights which they cannot poſſibly relinquiſh. Their claim is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in eternal juſtice, and this ſtands confeſſed by their moſt violent oppoſers. They muſt pay an equal ſhare of that tax which independency will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015612_0018_0F99DA62A024DDD8"/>coſt you—they muſt ſpill a greater ſhare of blood, and therefore they cannot, I ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſent to the ſmalleſt inferiority in privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges either civil or religious.</p>
            <p>But Sir! in the preſent caſe, the claims of good policy join thoſe of common and confeſſed juſtice. Religious eſtabliſhments diſcourage the opulence and cramp the growth of a free State. Every fetter, whether religious or civil, deters people from ſettling in a new country. Take off every unneceſſary yoke, and people of all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and profeſſions will flock in<note n="§" place="bottom">We are told that North-Carolina and Maryland have taken down their eſtabliſhments; that Virginia as yet refuſes to do it. It this State acts upon a liberal plan, we may expect that the rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

If a ſpirit of toleration raiſed the United Provinces to ſuch a pitch of glory and grandeur, by inviting people from every quarter of Europe; if an entire equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity has made Pennſylvania the Emporeum of America, to the immortal honour of its wiſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator; what good effects may not be expected from the ſame ſpirit of laws in this State. That State in America which adopts the freeſt and moſt liberal plan will be the moſt oppulent and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and will well deſerve it. Sir! as a narrowneſs in theſe matters is the diſgrace of the human mind, ſo is it the diſgrace of any ſyſtem of laws whatever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:015612_0019_0F99DA63E0A187E8"/>
I could wiſh to draw the attention of the Houſe to another important motive,—that is, the future peace and happineſs of this State. Grant this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and the foundation of religious diſcord is eternally removed. It is inequality that excites jealouſy and diſſatisfaction. Make your laws partial towards people of any one ſet of opinions, ſuppoſe it only in philoſophy, and you entail immortal ſtriſe and debate upon your children. If all your people are equally free and happy, it will be no matter who is <hi>in</hi> or who is <hi>out,</hi> i. e. in reſpect to denomination.</p>
            <p>Where the people have a full voice in legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the caſe is vaſtly different from what it has been in times paſt, while royal violence ſtood ready to ſupport the claims of injuſtice. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Church of England, ſhould methinks be as much concerned to obtain the prayer of this petition as any others. The courſe of things is very uncertain. None know where numbers and intereſt may carry matters in future time. Some have unjuſtly<note n="§" place="bottom">Of nine denominations, all equally jealous, can eight be found ſufficiently tame to join in ſetting the ninth into the ſaddle, to ride them and the Church of England with them?

It was partly that accuſation that gave birth to the petition before you. But if the gentlemen of the Church of England do really apprehend danger of ſuch a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015612_0020_0F99DA6485AA8408"/>mortiſying iſſue in proceſs of time, ſure they of all men ought to be moſt anxious ſo to ſix the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the Conſtitution, as forever to prevent it: I mean by making it a foundation article, that there never ſhall be any ſuch eſtabliſhment. This is the only ſecurity of the Church of England, as well as of other Churches. That Church has long had the advantage; ſhe has reaped uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled, the emoluments of the State; ſhe has ſubſiſted on the abridgment of the equal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of others; ſhe has fluoriſhed by aid of their property. <hi>Let the time paſt ſuffice.</hi> With the new Conſtitution, let the day of juſtice dawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every rank and order of men in this State. I et us bury what is paſt forever. We even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the eſtate which ſhe has for a century paſt been drawing more or leſs from the purſes of all denominations; an eſtate of no leſs value than three hundred and eighty thouſand pounds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in her quiet poſſeſſion, and be fixed there. Let her only for the future ceaſe to demand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence. Let her freely content that others enjoy the ſame privileges, in every reſpect with herſelf. This is all we ask, we ſeek no reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After the vaſt ſums partially expended by the State upon one denomination, all the others ask not a farthing to be returned them. Let her be contented with her ſuperb churches, her ſpacious burying-grounds, her coſtly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, her humerous glebes, and other church eſtates, obtained in a great degree from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie purſe, while not a farthing has been granted to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015612_0021_0F99DA6529DCDBA0"/>other Churches; and let her not now inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch glaring partiality any longer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker! I know I tranſgreſs the uſual bounds. Although I know it is my right,—yet I can hardly keep from asking pardon of the Houſe for being tedious. But it is impoſſible to do juſtice to this great cauſe by confining my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a narrow compaſs. I am obliged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one capital objection before I ſit down,— and reſerve to myſelf the right of anſwering the arguments which are uſed in favour of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the eſtabliſhment, in caſe I find it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>The objection I mean is that with reſpect to the <hi>Time.</hi> You hear it from all quarters by thoſe who ſpeak in favour of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>It is perfectly juſt, that an equality of privileges ſhould take place. None can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the juſtice of the petition. If you had only delayed it to a proper time, we ſhould have become advocates for it ourſelves. But we have too much now upon our hands. Wait until matters are better ſettled, and you are ſure of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I believe the gentlemen that I have heard ſpeak in this manner, are ſincere as to their own inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but I muſt be excuſed from believing, that the zealous friends of an eſtabliſhment ſo partial, will be of the ſame mind with them. I think if
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015612_0022_0F99DA664075E798"/>the time is left to them, it will prove as it did in the caſe of the man, the time of whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was left to himſelf: It ſo happened, that all the perſuaſions of the executioner could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make him believe that the time preſent was proper. I remember from the hiſtory of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, when the Papiſts were like to prove too ſtrong for the favourers of the Acceſſion,—the Diſſenters thought it a proper time to inſiſt on ſome alterations in the penal laws, which, though leveled againſt Papiſts, were ſo artfully managed, as to take in all Diſſenters with them. The only way found to content them, was, by ſolemnly promiſing to give them relief, as ſoon as ever the affairs of the nation would permit it. They were prayed and entreated to be ſilent at that time: "it would be dangerous to make any alterations—the Papiſts would take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, and endanger the acceſſion." <hi>They</hi> ſimply yielded to the prayers of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But, a full proof, that to <hi>poſtpone</hi> where the rights of juſtice demand, is to <hi>betray</hi> them; a full proof of the danger of deferring to another time, what ought to be done now—I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask any man, who knows the hiſtory of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince that time, whether thoſe promiſes have ever been fulfilled? Are they placed upon the equal footing that was promiſed? Not that there were not found ſome who faithfully endeavoured to fulfill their promiſes,—but the majority thought it proper to ride on in the ſame manner, after they found themſelves well fixed in the ſaddle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015612_0023_0F99DA682E751100"/>
But Sir! ſuppoſe the petitioners had no ſuch inſtance to warn them; ſuppoſe the event was not ſo perfectly natural and to be expected. Yet let me ask any gentleman, who thinks that <hi>this is not a proper time,</hi> a few queſtions.</p>
            <p>Is it not a fact, that we are now reviewing the Conſtitution; that <hi>what</hi> was deſigned only as a <hi>protempore</hi> affair may become ſo perfected as to be fit to ſtand? Is it not an agreed point, that it is dangerous to have the Conſtitution placed upon the ſame footing with any common law, ſubject to be canvaſſed every ſeſſions? If then, there is ever a time in which it is proper to apply for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of any grievance which may be ſuppoſed to lye in the preſent frame of the State, when ſhould that be, but when the Conſtitution is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed and fixed? Is there, can there be another time ſo natural? Or ſhould a thing in which the Liberties of the people are ſo eſſentially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not enter into the Conſtitution, but be left to the precarious fate of any common law? Shall it be left to be promoted or cruſhed at hazard? Should not the Conſtitution take care of the religious as well as civil Liberties of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Or do you think the former of leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than the latter?</p>
            <p>When theſe queſtions are properly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I then beg leave to ask; if this matter is not now attended to, will not the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land be eſtabliſhed by law under the New
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015612_0024_0F99DA68443A17A0"/>Conſtitution, and become the conſtitutional Church? If ſo, and none will deny it, as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; then will not all theſe oppreſſions which have been groaned under heretofore, be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in this free State? And is this a matter of ſmall moment to the major part of the people? And muſt they ſit ſtill out of meer compliment? Muſt they compliment away their Freedom in this Manner, and not only ſuffer, but even lend their aid, by putting their own hands to it, with the ſanction of the people at large? It is ſtrange that gentlemen can expect it. How can we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our neglect to our conſtituents, who expect that we ſhall make them free? How can we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to our poſterity, who even now ought to riſe in our imagination, and demand of us to leave them free? This is the natural time, and this is the only time. Things ought to be done in their proper ſeaſon. And gentlemen may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what they pleaſe,—if they are averſe to grant juſtice in the preſent ſeaſon of it, — if they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do it <hi>now,</hi> they will be more ſo <hi>by and by.</hi> One thing I am ſure of, they will have leſs motives to engage them to do it <hi>by and by.</hi> He that is diſpoſed to do juſtice, is willing to do it without delay. The old law maxim is good, <hi>to delay juſtice is to deny it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir! at this time, all ranks of people more ſenſibly feel the claims of juſtice, than they will hereafter. They now feel the rod of oppreſſion: And nothing like ſuffering to bring us to our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015612_0025_0F99DA68E9D76530"/>ſenſes. They are now ſtruggling againſt arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power. They can now realize the hardſhip. Let theſe times paſs, and eaſe will naturally lull them into an inattention, to the rights of mankind.</p>
            <p>That this is a proper time the example of other States confirms. Pennſylvania, New Jerſey, Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware have led the way; Virginia, and North-Carolina are now meditating the ſame important ſtep. Maryland has done it already.</p>
            <p>That this is the proper time is plain, as the people are now waiting to ſee what they have to expect, for what it is they are to waſte their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and their blood? They are ready to do it cheerfully, if they may with certainty expect to be made and kept as happy as their brethren. They aſk no favours, they aſk only the common rights of mankind.</p>
            <p>By ſome it is ſaid to be dangerous to grant this requeſt at the preſent time. They own it is juſt. —It ought to be. No member, ſay they, in the houſe will deny it; but the time is dangerous.</p>
            <p>But Sir! are we indeed reduced to that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is dangerous to do common juſtice? Every man allows it to be juſt: Well then, who is to be feared? Are you afraid of thoſe who confeſs the juſtice of the preſent application? Acknowledging it to be juſt and right, will they be apt to revolt againſt their own ſentiments? Will the danger ariſe from the diſſenting denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015612_0026_0F99DA6DF06B3F98"/>No; it anſwers the prayer of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. Will the danger ariſe from the Church of England? I can't think it. It is too harſh an imputation upon the gentlemen of that Church. They will not endanger the State on account of that which they know and univerſally allow to be juſt. I cannot, I will not admit the ſuppoſition. Sir! I have the pleaſure of knowing too many of them to think ſo. Many of them have ſigned the petition. Many more have declared their ſentiments in the moſt liberal terms. There is too much Catholiciſm and love to Liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. They don't deſire any longer to oppreſs their brethren. They profeſs a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſdain of the thing. They have property ſufficient to maintain their own Clergy liberally; and if the State did not take it off their hands, I believe they would do it more liberally than it is now done.</p>
            <p>If the Diffenters did not apply now,—it might by and by be retorted upon them, and that with great juſtice:— <q>You have had an hand in framing the Conſtitution, as well as we. The Church of England is the conſtitutional Church, by your own act and deed. Why did you not make your oppoſition in proper time? Why ſo much out of ſeaſon? Why en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſubvert what your own hands have reared?</q> Sir! we ſhould be dumb; or, what is as bad, we ſhould juſtly lye under the charge
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015612_0027_0F99DA6F67A429B0"/>of ſome ſpecies of ſedition. Sir! we mean to act a rational and conſtitutional part.</p>
            <p>And now Sir! it only remains to be ſeen, whether this legiſlative body, now, by God's goodneſs, free from the chains of foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, will rectify the errors of leſs happy times: whether they will riſe in the annals of this important age, by ſhewing a temper ſuperior to all illiberality and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Will you Sir! comply with the demands of common juſtice? or are you willing to liſten longer to the cry of oppreſſion? Will you make all your people equally free and happy? Do you deſire to put an effectual end to all religious broils and contentions forever? Will you ſtrengthen your own hands in defence of your bleeding country? Do you wiſh to enrich it by an influx of healthy inhabitants from every quarter of the world? Would you ſecure yourſelf from the fetters of any one denomination, with which the uncertainty of time may inundate this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Will you give to every denomination the beſt ſecurity of future religious freedom and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that the nature of the caſe admits?</p>
            <p>Grant them the prayer of the Petition: Grant it in ſubſtance, if not in the very expreſſions. Let it be a foundation article in your Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <q>That there ſhall be no eſtabliſhment of one religious denomination of Chriſtians in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015612_0028_0F99DA6FA9D9C690"/>to another. That none ſhall be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay to the ſupport of a worſhip in which they do not freely join.</q> Yield to the mighty current of American freedom and glory, and let our State be inferiour to none on this wide continent, in the liberality of its laws, and in the happineſs of its people.</p>
