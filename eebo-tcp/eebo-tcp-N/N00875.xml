         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reverend Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE long Knowledge I have had of your Wiſdom, Temper and Moderation (for which I can truly ſay, without the leaſt Umbrage of Flattery, you deſerve to be highly valued) hath given me Encouragement to Communicate to you, my free and impartial Thoughts, concerning the Controverſie, between ſome of our <hi>Brethren</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> on the other. Tho' I am a great Admirer of Solitude and Retirement, being ſeldom ſeen in the Crowds of the Talkative and Unthinking Multitude, but ſequeſtring my ſelf, as much as I can poſſibly, from publick Noiſe, that I might have the more Opportunity to Introvert my Mind, and Wait upon, and adore my Creator; for when my Mind is <hi>Silent</hi> and <hi>Retired,</hi> and my own Imaginations and Reaſonings are ſhut out; then I can hear his <hi>Still</hi> and <hi>Small Voice,</hi> and have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſible Perception of his Divine Preſence with my Soul: Yet I am not ſuch an abſolute <hi>Recluſe,</hi> as to Cloyſter my ſelf wholly up from the Things of this World; for I admit of Viſits from particular Friends, read Books at ſeaſonable Intervals, and hold Epiſtolary Correſpondence with Your ſelf, and a few more <hi>Select Perſons,</hi> who know the worth of <hi>Privacy,</hi> by the <hi>Benefit</hi> they Enjoy in it. So that tho' I am no Actor in the publick Theatre of the Times, yet I never have been, nor am an ignorant and unconcerned Spectator of thoſe Tranſactions, that have happened in our Day.</p>
            <p>And of all Occurences; the <hi>Diſſentions about Religion,</hi> and thoſe often attended with violent He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And 'tis a ſad, but a true Obſervation, that they who have the worſt Cauſe, and weakeſt Arguments, are very apt to give Hard Names, and to Revile and Slander their Opponents; that ſince they cannot Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

You know whoſe Practice this has been in their former Quarrels, with other <hi>Diſſenters</hi>; and now, in a more particular manner, with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> eſpecially ſince Mr. <hi>Bugg</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> came amongſt us; Perſons who were not ſo much <hi>Deſerters,</hi> as <hi>Caſhired</hi> Men, for their Immoralities; for they did not <hi>Come,</hi> but were <hi>Thruſt out</hi> from amongſt the <hi>Quakers</hi>; at which taking deep Reſentment, and cheriſhing that bad Humour in themſelves, which cauſed their <hi>Expulſion,</hi> their whole Maſs ſeems to be ſo corrupted, that their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is become Implacable againſt that <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is natural for Malignant Humours to ſpread, eſpecially over thoſe Parts which were before Infected; ſo theſe Men, coming full amongſt us, of Envy, Hatred and Malice, have infuſed their Wenom, into ſome of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> who had formerly been Tainted, and thoſe, having received the Infection themſelves, how Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do they endeavour to ſpread it among others.</p>
            <p>I am heartily ſorry to ſee it; but what Pains do they take? Yea what Artifices do they uſe, to poſſeſs not only private Perſons with Prejudice, but alſo to ſtir up Perſecution in the Government againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as tho' they were not fit to live amongſt us?

The common Charge is, <hi>That they are Guilty of Blaſphemy againſt God, Chriſt, and the Holy Scriptures</hi>; thus our <hi>Norfolk</hi>-Brethren: Yea, of <hi>Blaſphemy and Hereſie</hi>; ſo Mr. <hi>Keith.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Anſwered thoſe Charges again and again, and Cleared themſelves in the Face of God and the World, as appears by their Printed Books and Papers.

            <p>You may remember, Sir, what you gave me in your laſt, as your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the Cauſe of our <hi>Brethrens</hi> Out cry againſt the Quakers, rather than other <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> viz. <hi>Their Oppoſition to Tithes,</hi> which the other generally pay? and your ſenſe was, That if the <hi>Quakers</hi> would comply in that One Thing, the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001055_0004_0FAEF371B99F8A88"/>The <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſaid ſo much againſt our old Plea, of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and made it out ſo fully, and plainly by <hi>Scripture,</hi> that none but ſome <hi>Zealous Novices,</hi> or <hi>Super annuated bigots,</hi> will now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to uſe it; and therefore the <hi>Wiſe</hi> among us have quitted that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and do inſiſt only upon a <hi>Right</hi> iſſuing from <hi>meer</hi> Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>I have diligently looked into the Controverſie, that is between our <hi>Brethren</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> not with a Partial or Captious, but with a Single and Indifferent Eye; and I do not find, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are either Guilty of thoſe Real Errors that are laid to their Charge; or, that thoſe which our <hi>Brethren</hi> ſuppoſe to be Errors, in them, are Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at all; but are rather Glorious Goſpel Truths. I will give ſome Inſtances in both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> are charged, with <hi>Denying the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>; which were a great Error indeed, were they Guilty of it: but they ſufficiently Acquit themſelves of this, by confeſſing expreſly to his <hi>Manhood; That he was Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>Suffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was Crucified, Dead and Baried, Roſe again the third Day, and Aſcended into Heaven:</hi> So that this Charge is very untruly brought againſt them. G. <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> p. 358.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> They are charged, with <hi>Denying the Reſurrection of the Body:</hi> But this alſo is another falſe Imputation; for they believe the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> according to Scripture, the one, <hi>from Sin</hi>; the other, <hi>from Death and the Grave, W. Penn</hi>'s <hi>Key,</hi> &amp;c. Perverſion 15. Yea, <hi>That the Dead ſhall be Raiſed with the</hi> SAME BODIES, <hi>as far as a Natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and Incorruptible, Terreſtrial, and Celeſtial, can be the</hi> SAME, Truths Principles <hi>by</hi> J. Crook, <hi>printed</hi> Anno 1663.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> They are charged, with <hi>Denying the Trinity:</hi> But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is manifeſt by their Writings; for they believe in the <hi>Holy Three,</hi> or <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Father, Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. And that theſe <hi>Three</hi> are truly and properly <hi>One,</hi> of <hi>One Nature,</hi> as well as <hi>Will. W. Penn</hi>'s <hi>Key,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Another Charge againſt them is, that, <hi>They Deny the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>; than which, nothing can be Falſer: For they have always Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as <hi>J. Wyeth</hi> declares, to the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 <hi>That all Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Ibid. p. 150.

See alſo, <hi>The Defence of the People called Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. p. 15. The like may be ſaid of ſeveral other Things, which are real Errors, where ever they are met with, as well as thoſe before mentioned; but they are untruly charged upon the <hi>Quakers</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our <hi>Brethren</hi> ſuppoſe that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are in an Error about the LIGHT WITHIN; and thereupon have beſtowed upon it many Opprobrious, not to ſay, Blaſphemous Names; as, <hi>Ignis hotuus, A Diabolical Light,</hi> &amp;c.
