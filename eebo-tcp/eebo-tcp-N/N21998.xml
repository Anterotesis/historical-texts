            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>RELIGION, conſiſting in the knowledge and worſhip of God, is the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of man, from the other inhabitants of the earth. The bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal creation bear a reſemblance to him in a ſpecies of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, adapted to their condition. But no traces of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are to be found among them. They neither know God, or worſhip him. In this ſpecific difference of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; man is dignified, and raiſed above the beaſts that periſh, and aſſimulated to the angels of heaven, and was made originally but little lower than they. And with them, it is the purpoſe of the divine goodneſs, he ſhall finally and forever aſſociate in the ſublimer knowledge and ſervices of the celeſtial world.</p>
            <p>BY the fatal apoſtacy, the glorious crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs fell from our head; and man naturally likes not to retain God in his knowledge. In conſequence of the merciful purpoſe of God in our redemption, the rich and various means, which the wiſdom and goodneſs of God hath appointed for our reſtoration to duty and happineſs, excite the devouteſt admiration, gratitude and obedience of every ſerious mind. Among theſe may be reckoned as none of the leaſt, that natural ſenſe of right and wrong, of good and evil in conduct, in many branches of duty, which the mind inſtantaneouſly perceives, and alſo that
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028999_0003_0FDD6026B1D8E510"/>eſſential and immutable difference between them, which we arrive at the more perfect knowledge of, by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the rational faculties.</p>
            <p>BUT an authority ſuperior to our inſtinctive percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rational inveſtigation, is neceſſary to command ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, our obedience. This ſuperior authority is no other than the <hi>WILL OF GOD.</hi> This is the alone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſufficient foundation of all moral obligation, duty and obedience.</p>
            <p>OUR moral ſenſe or natural conſcience, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the nature of duty, of right and wrong, and of virtue and vice, are liable to be perverted by various prejudices, paſſions and appetites. And this hath ever been the caſe, where the divine will has not been expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed.</p>
            <p>WITH faculties unhappily controled by a depraved nature, the wiſeſt men of pagan antiquity, greatly erred in their ſyſtems of ethics. While they profeſſedly ſought to know God and duty, they wandered further from him.</p>
            <p>THEIR precepts and example gave currency to many vices, which they falſely named virtues; and many of the virtues of the unadulterated religion of nature, and of the evangelic ſyſtem, they proudly rejected. Ambition and revenge, were accounted commendable virtues. To the divine virtues of forgiveneſs of injuries, meekneſs, and humility, they were ſtrangers. Fraud and diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty were held in repute among the Spartans and Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and robbery among the Arabians. The enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Romans and Grecians practiſed obſcene and cruel rites, in honor of their Gods. Their choiceſt amuſements were the ſavage ſpectacle of men combating with wild beaſts, and devoured by them; and gladiators falling by mutual ſlaughter, in their theatres. Nations expoſed
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028999_0004_0FDD6027C925D7B8"/>their aged and helpleſs, and their deformed infants, to be devoured by beaſts of prey.</p>
            <p>THEIR ideas of the acceptable worſhip of God, were as abſurd and impure, as their morality was defective and pernicious. If we look back to the manners of the age in which the moral law was revealed, we ſhall ſee the nations, lying in ſtill more deplorable darkneſs and vice.</p>
            <p>SUCH being the melancholy condition of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Deity was ſeen in the republication of the great ſyſtem of natural religion, for the inſtruction of all generations.</p>
            <p>THE following diſcourſes were delivered, in the courſe of ſeveral months, to the beloved people of the author's paſtoral charge. In their publication, he truſts, that he is not prompted by the vain opinion of merit in the execution of them, but by a ſincere deſire, that they may afford ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual edification to ſome of his fellow chriſtians, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers after truth and ſalvation, benefit the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſerve the common cauſe of virtue and religion. Let us love God's law and keep it, for bleſſed are all they who do his commandments.</p>

            <head>SERMON I. GOD the ſupreme Lawgiver of the Univerſe, and his covenant relation to his Church.</head>

                     <hi>EXODUS XX, 1 and 2.</hi>

                  <p>And God ſpake all theſe words ſaying; I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ASOLEMNITY, expreſſive of the authority and condeſcenſion of the ſupreme Lawgiver, introduces the weighty precepts of his holy law. A law of univerſal and perpetual obligation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed for the benefit and practice of all nations and generations.</p>
            <p>WHILE our thoughts are invited to this divine ſyſtem of duty, let our devouteſt meditations hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly invoke the father of lights, in the language of the pious prophet of former ages, "O Lord, open thou our eyes, that we may behold wonderous things out of thy Law."</p>
            <p>THE words of the text have an immediate refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſpecial providence of God, diſplayed in
<pb facs="unknown:028999_0006_0FDDCFA3BA144940"/>the miraculous redemption of the people of Iſrael, from their bondage in Egypt. This was figurative of our redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, from the more dreadful bondage of ſin, and all our ſpiritual foes, and admittance to the promiſed, purchaſed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in the heavenly world.</p>
            <p>FROM the death of Joſeph, to the delivery of the Law at Sinai, was about one hundred and ſixty yeas. In which ſpace of time, the deſcendents of Jacob had marvellouſly increaſed. They had long endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the moſt grievous oppreſſions from the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; but God was mindful of his covenant with their pious anceſtor Abraham, and raiſed up, from the midſt of them, a deliverer. Within a few weeks after their paſſage thro' the Red Sea, they arrived at Mount Sinai, called alſo Horeb, where God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with awful ſolemn majeſty, the moral law.</p>
            <p>THE knowledge of the one true God, and of the moral law given to man at his creation, by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt paſſions and vices of men, were greatly obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in danger of being nearly extinguiſhed. They had in all parts of the earth, greatly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ways, and perverted original revelations to the Patriarchs, handed down by oral tradition. It was neceſſary that the knowledge of the true God and his laws, ſhould be again revived. And God choſe the nation of Iſrael as the repoſitory of that knowledge, becauſe from them was to ariſe, the promiſed Saviour, who was to enlighten Jews and Gentiles, and in whom all nations ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>A SYSTEM of eccleſiaſtic and civil laws were given, at the ſame time. They were wiſely calculated to preſerve the Hebrews from the idolatrous practices,
<pb facs="unknown:028999_0007_0FDDCFA8A5A30280"/>and the licentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tation of the promiſed Saviour, and to preſerve their national church and commonwealth, until that important period.</p>
            <p>THE moral law, becauſe of its ſuperior excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and univerſal obligation, was firſt revealed, and uſhered in with a ſolemnity and grandeur, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any thing which the world had ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
            <p>GOD called Moſes up into the mount and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to prepare the people for the awful ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. "And on the third day, in the morning, there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loud; ſo that all the people in the camp, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And Mount Sinai <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as altogether in a ſmoke, becauſe the Lord deſcended up on it in a fire, and the ſmoke aſcended as the ſmoke of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."</p>
            <p>STRUCK with the profoundeſt awe, at the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory which attended a deſcending God, the people retired from the foot of the mount; and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Moſes who had often familiarly converſed with God, could ſcarce ſuſtain the ſight.</p>
            <p>THUS God prepared the minds of men to receive his holy laws.</p>
            <p>THE ſolemn declaration of Jehovah, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces the precepts of the moral law, contains ſeveral moſt important truths, to ſome of which, with humble dependence on the divine aſſiſtance, we will now attend. As,</p>

               <item>1. GOD is the ſupreme Legiſlator of the Univerſe.</item>
               <item>2. THAT his church, or profeſſing worſhippers are introduced into a ſpecial covenant relation to God, and laid under inviolable obligations of obedience, to his whole revealed will.</item>
               <item>3. THAT he is the almighty and merciful Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of men.</item>
            </list>
            <p>THRO' theſe diviſions of this ſubject, I ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, illuſtrate the nature and obligations of the moral law in general, as compriſed in the ten commandments.</p>
            <p>WHEN God proclaims himſelf, "I am the Lord," he expreſſes his abſolute and ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and right to command the obedience of his rational creatures, to his revealed will. He is the Jehovah, the <hi>I am,</hi> who is from all everlaſting, without beginning or ending, inhabiting eternity. From whom all creatures and things have derived their exiſtance, He who made all things is alone equal to the great work of univerſal government. As his knowledge is infinite he is perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the capacities and wants of his creatures, and can preſcribe to them rules and laws exactly ſuited to their powers, capacities and condition. And his infinite goodneſs will forever incline him to do according to this dictate of his wiſdom. Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</p>
            <p>ALL creatures depend on God for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and for all thoſe favorable circumſtances, which make exiſtence deſirable. And in his wiſdom and goodneſs alone muſt we confide for all the good things which we hope for in future life, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028999_0009_0FDDCFAB5C0C09D8"/>the endleſs periods of our immortal exiſtence. Since then we are thus dependent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>SINCE the unhappy apoſtacy mankind are diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to keep the holy laws of God. By nature and practice we are alas, the ſervants of ſin. Our guilt and miſery ariſes from our co-operation with evil ſpirits in the cauſe of an unnatural rebellion againſt the pure laws of our creator. We like not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God in our knowledge. To bring us back to our loyalty and love, God has been pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce dreadful puniſhments on the breakers of his law, and glorious rewards to the obedient. His laws operate on our hopes and fears, to deter us from ſin as the greateſt miſery, and to perſuade us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as our chief happineſs.</p>
            <p>AWFUL ſanctions, the terrors of joſtice, ſurround the holy laws delivered at Sinai.

            <p>BEFORE the law, the will of God had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from time to time, uſually by the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels. But at Mount Sinai, the Deity himſelf appeared in a viſible glory. When the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal law of piety and righteouſneſs,—a law eſtabliſhed on immutable principles, the moral law, which St. Paul deſines, holy, juſt and good, was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to a whole nation, and by them tranſmitted to all generations of men; the Deity did not commit this buſineſs to the agency of the greateſt angel in heaven, but himſelf ſpeaks and writes the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the law on two plates of ſtone. Significant emblem of the heart hardned by ſin; and of the neceſlity of heavenly grace, to inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>THE laws were depoſited in the Ark, which was divinely appointed to be a type of Chriſt; and this ſignified, that he only could perfectly keep the law; who ſaid, "I delight to do thy will, O God, yea thy law is within my heart." They were wrote on ſtone to teach us their perpetual obligation. They were divided into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> tables. The firſt reſpects the duties which we owe to God, and contains four precepts. The other table contains ſix, and they relate to the duties which we owe to our fellow men, and the government and regulation of our thoughts, appetites and paſſions.</p>
            <p>WE have no account of any written law until the time of Moſes. The firſt laws of God to man, committed to writing was the moral law, and wrote by God himſelf. They were preſerved thro' many generations, in the ſacred Ark.</p>
            <p>THAT it was God, and not an Angel, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the moral law, appears from his claiming thoſe attributes which belong to God only. "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity and ſin; and who will by no means clear the guilty." It is probable it was God the ſon, even he by whom all things were made, both in heaven and on earth, whether viſible or inviſible; and to whom, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſſure us, all government and judgment are committed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:028999_0012_0FDDCFB266248AA8"/>
THE apoſtle ſays the law was received by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of angels. By which, is to be uncerſtood, that a hoſt of angels, the celeſtial retinue of God, attended him at the delivery of the law. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably by their agency, the mountain was covered with awful thunders and lightnings; and the ſame glorious hoſts will attend Chriſt to judgment, and be the executors of the ſentences, which will be paſſed upon men and angels.</p>
            <p>GOD is the fountain of juſtice and righteouſneſs and every perfection. The moral law is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript of theſe, and demands of us, an imitation of the moral perfections of God; that we ſhould be holy, and juſt and good, becauſe God is. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conformity to him, we are unqualified for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him or the enjoyment of his ſpecial favor. The tenor of this law is, <hi>"He who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all things written therein, ſhall live."</hi> He ſhall enjoy the love and friendſhip of God, and poſſeſs an immortal life. And the penalty annexed to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is, <hi>"The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die; For cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed is every one who continueth not in all things written in this law to do them."</hi> He ſhall fall under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God, and ſuffer the execution of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal death. For a ſingle wilful tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an offence againſt the whole law, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme lawgiver, and contains the principle of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to every particular precept.</p>
            <p>THE law is ſpiritual, and demands the perfect homage of the ſoul, as well as external obedience, God is a ſpirit, and they who worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. Our obedience to all the holy precepts of God's law, thoſe which reſpect our fellow men as well as our Maker, muſt flow from a good principle; a principle of love and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028999_0013_0FDDCFB67811B6C8"/>loyalty to God. Without this qualification, all obedience is eſſentially defective. His command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are exceeding broad. They extend to the heart. They demand purity, truth and the ſincerity of love there. Man looketh on the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s;earcheth the heart. The law eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſiſts in love. It was a law in the heart of man in innocency and during that ſhort period, he perfectly kept it. He loved God with all his heart, and loved the creatures which God had made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees of worth and lovelineſs, which he ſaw in them. In doing this, he acted up to the dictates of right reaſon, which is but another name for the moral law. But by the fatal apoſtacy man loſt both the ability and the inclination to obey the law perfectly. By one man ſin entered into the world, and human nature is depraved. The law, ſays the apoſtle, is ſpiritual, but we are carnal. We are all gone out of the way. There is none who does good in the fight of the law, no not one. It hath concluded all under ſin and condemnation.</p>
            <p>THE law demands a perſonal and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from every man. Jeſus Chriſt perfectly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the law in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oom of the diſobedient, yet men are not thereby excuſed from the obligations of a perſonal and perfect obedience. The obedience however, of the beſt of men is deficient. For there is not a juſt man upon earth, who liveth and ſinneth not. But the ſincere, tho' imperfect obedience of believers is accepted, on account of the perfect obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, to every one who believeth. He magnified the law and made it honorable, and God is reconcilable to men, thro' his bleſſed mediation. We come</p>

II. To ſpeak of the ſpecial covenant relation to God, into which believers are introduced, and their obligations of obedience. God was pleaſed to admit into a covenant relation his profeſſing worſhippers, or the members of his church on earth, and ſtiles himſelf their God, ſaying I am <hi>thy</hi> God. Individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual perſons or people have in all ages been admitted into this covenant relation. This grace was ſhewn to Adam—to Abel—to Noah, and to Abraham, and to the deſcendants of Jacob. The whole nation of the Hebrews were admitted at Sinai. The tenor of this covenant of grace is, "I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people." The covenant of grace has been one and the ſame from the beginning. All the faithful from Adam to Abraham were admitted to the privileges of it. He was their God and they his people in a ſenſe that did not apply to others. And the covenant of grace into which righteous men were admitted in early ages, is the ſame as that into which believers are now admitted. The principle differences were mere circumſtantials, and the chief of theſe were, that they believed in a Saviour to come, and we believe in him already come. The goſpel, ſays St. Paul, was preached to Abraham. He ſaw Chriſt's day, by faith, and rejoiced in the Saviour. Believers are called the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, becauſe they are juſtified by the ſame faith, by which that Patriarch was ſaved, and entitled to the ſame ſpiritual bleſſings of pardon, ſanctification, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in grace and immortal glory.</p>
            <p>THE Moſt High admitted the whole nation of Iſrael, to the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſigns, ſeals and privileges of the covenant of grace, altho' none but the righteous or regenerate were entitled to the ſpecial ſaving bleſſings of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ovenant. They were received into covenant at Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028999_0015_0FDDCFB9938ED9E8"/>God called himſelf their God, and them his people; and they promiſed allegiance to him. He received them upon the ground of their profeſſion, as their public judge, altho' as the ſearcher of hearts, he knew that multitudes of them were inſincere, and inwardly the ſervants of ſin, as afterwards appeared by their murmurs and rebellions. The moſt high has herein given example to his miniſters and churches in all ages, that in the admiſſion of perſons into the church, and to the enjoyment of ſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, they are to proceed upon the ground of public credible evidence. When the church was under the immediate care of Jehovah, we find that perſons were admitted upon a profeſſion of faith and allegiance, who were hypocritical and in the bonds of iniquity, as impious Korah and his aſſociates. And when the church was about to be formed upon the plan of the goſpel, Jeſus Chriſt, who knew what was in man, received an hypocritical Judas, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſervant of ſin and Satan, among the number of his immediate diſciples.</p>
            <p>THE church on earth is compoſed of profeſſing believers. The ſeperation between the true and falſe, will be made at the end of the world. The harveſt, ſays our Lord is the end of the world; when falſe profeſſors, like the tares will be caſt out, and the true, like the golden wheat, be gathered into the granery of eternal life. It is the earneſt deſire and labor of the faithful, perfectly to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. But they experience their inability by reaſon of the power of ſin. This is their greateſt burden in this houſe of their pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and feeling its malignant influence, they ardently long for deliverence, ſaying with St. Paul, "O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!" Faith looks to Chriſt,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028999_0016_0FDDCFBB07924F08"/>the captain of our ſalvation for aid, ſaying, "thanks be to God who giveth us the victory thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt."</p>

            <p n="3">III. To ſhew that God is the Almighty and merciful Redeemer of men. The redemption of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael from the ſlavery of Egypt, their ſufferings and preſervation thro' the Red Sea and the wilderneſs, and their happy ſettlement in the land of promiſe, were divinely deſigned as ſhadows or types of good things to come, and a ſure earneſt to the ancient church, of a more glorious redemption by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THE watchful providence of God over the Jewiſh commonwealth, is particularly recorded, by divine direction, becauſe it contained the only church of God on earth. It was marvellouſly preſerved, as was the ark of Noah, floating on the waters of the deluge. They both imboſomed this precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. God has ſet up a holy kingdom in this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028999_0018_0FDDCFBD030B24F0"/>province of his dominions, and wonderfully guards it from the oppoſing powers of this world, and all the powers of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>IT was a great deliverance which God wrought for his ancient church, when in ſpite of Egypt and all her horned gods, he conducted from the houſe of bondage, that vaſt body of defenceleſs people encumbered with the ſpoils of their oppreſſors; and led them thro' the wilderneſs like a flock, by the hand of Moſes and Aaron.</p>
            <p>THEY experienced a like wonderful redemption from captivity in Babylon; and God often appeared on their ſide, when nations were ready to ſwallow them up. They were the ſpecial charge of heaven, until the promiſed and long expected Meſſiah and Saviour of Jews and Gentiles came, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed that glorious redemption, which now glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the chriſtian people and nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>THE redemption of Iſrael from Egypt was ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually typical of our redemption from the ſervitude of ſin and Satan, and all our woes. The bleſſed Mediator redeems us from ſpiritual Egypt, the kingdom of darkneſs, and will conduct the faithful thro' the Red Seas of ſufferings, and the darkneſs and temptations of this world, to the heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. That it was deſigned as a lively figure of this, may be infered from frequent alluſions in the ſcriptures and from the declaration of the divine ſpirit, by the father of the harbinger of Jeſus. "Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people, as he ſpake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been ſince the world began, that we ſhould be ſaved from our enemies;—to perform the mercy promiſed to our
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028999_0019_0FDDCFC289C8CA90"/>fathers; and to remember his holy covenant; the oath which he ſware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life."</p>
            <p>THE great deſign of our redemption from ſin and condemnation is, that we ſhould ſerve God in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs, and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This great redemption compriſes ſundry invaluable bleſſings, the moſt important of which were ſhadowed forth by the redemption of Iſrael. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. JESUS Chriſt redeems his people from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin and the tyranny of ſpiritual foes. The ſacred oracles give us a melancholy deſcription of man's moral ſtate, and the deep depravity of our nature; and our own experience confirms it. Man has riſen up in rebellion againſt his Creator; by nature the ſervant of ſin and confederate with evil ſpirits, in oppoſing the holy laws and government of God. The ſame hatred of holineſs and of God which exiſts in fallen angels is in man, tho' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in a leſs degree. Therefore our Lord tells the Jews that they were the children of the devil, for wicked men do the works of that evil ſpirit. And are we by nature better than they? The ſame evil propenſities and luſts and oppoſition to the pure laws of God, reign naturally in all hearts. God reſtrains the wrath and wickedneſs of ſome, and changes by effectual grace, the hearts of others and they become his willing and obedient ſervants. The dreadful depravity of our nature, is a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling doctrine. And upon the plan of the goſpel it is neceſſary that we be deeply ſenſible of it, in order
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028999_0020_0FDDCFC40F428268"/>to repentance and ſalvation. Without this, we ſhall not be diſpoſed to fly to Chriſt for refuge from the curſes of the broken law, and the wrath to come. All who ſo do, the Almighty and merciful Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er delivers from the reign of ſin and the power of evil ſpirits. They are tranſlated from the kingdom of darkneſs, into the kingdom of God's dear ſon, and ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs. In them, the captain of our ſalvation deſtroys the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him who has the power of death. They are no longer his willing ſubjects; they are freed from this ſpiritual Pharaoh and all his hoſts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his ſervice forever. And he that is born of God cannot ſin, as once he did, with deliberate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, for he is made free in Chriſt. Satan rages to looſe his prey, but rages in vain, for Chriſt is their Almighty Redeemer. "You, ſays St. Paul to the Epheſians, hath he quickened who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom alſo we all had our converſation in times paſt, in the lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as others. But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt."</p>
            <p n="2">2. JESUS Chriſt redeems his people from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and curſe of the law. He was a ſin offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us and bore the curſe due to man's diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The moral law demanding finleſs obedience pronounces a curſe on him that tranſgreſſes "curſed is every one that continueth not in all thing written in the law to do them." All men have tranſgreſſed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028999_0021_0FDDCFC585E2C660"/>and fallen under the dreadful ſentence. But the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace provides a remedy, when the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works could find none. For help is laid on one mighty to ſave, who died the accurſed death of the croſs; and there is now no condemnation to them, who are in Chriſt Jeſus. By him the law is ſatisfied and ſalvation is given; and God can now be juſt and the juſtifier of the ungodly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HE redeems them from the burthenſome and coſtly rituals of the moſaic diſpenſation. This was a yoke of bondage, placed upon the church in its minority; but the yoke of Chriſt is eaſy and his burden is light. The bloody rites, the coſtly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the bodily ſervices have given place to a milder diſpoſation, ſimple, rational, pure and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The true worſhippers now worſhip the father in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
            <p>THE eſtabliſhment of goſpel churches and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances had been foretold. "From the riſing of the ſun, ſays Malachi, even unto the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and in every place incenſe, the incenſe of public prayer and praiſe, ſhall be offered to my name, and a pure offering, for my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles." In the ſimplicity of the goſpel and the beauties of holineſs, God is now worſhiped in the churches which are according to the pure and perfect plan eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, and his inſpired apoſtles.</p>
            <p>AND to carry on the work of the ſanctification and perſeverance of his church and people, all needful aſſiſtances are given by their Redeemer. Some of theſe, and which we are to receive as a precious legacy from him, are the chriſtian ſabbath
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028999_0022_0FDDCFCCAFFD1C48"/>—the evangelic miniſtry and ordinances—various providences, and the light and conſolations of the divine ſpirit. By theſe the holy kingdon of Jeſus is maintained, and will be perpetuated and enlarged until the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. HE redeems his people from the ſervile fear of death, and from future miſery, and will introduce them to a glorious and immortal inheritance.</p>
            <p>TO the impenitent ſinner, whom the holy law condemns, the proſpect of death, the judgment and eternity is covered with dreadful terrors, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but faith in a living Redeemer can remove the awful gloom, and inſpire the mind with fortitude and peace on its entrance on eternal ſcenes. The righteous have hope in death, for Chriſt redeems them from the wrath to come and hath aſſured them that they ſhall live and reign with him forever.</p>
            <p>THUS the redemption of Iſrael from Egypt, and their eſtabliſhment in the promiſed land, was to the ancient church, ſignificant of a more glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to be accompliſhed in due time by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>SOME REFLECTIONS, ariſing from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject will conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As the moral law contained in the decalogue, is the law of our nature, or right reaſon, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love to God and mankind, it is of univerſal obligation, and a law to us as well as to the ancient Jews. Our Lord has incorporated it with the goſpel, and taught us our obligations to keep it. He came not to deſtroy the law. He has compriſed the ten commandments of the law in love to God and men.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028999_0023_0FDDCFCDDA8FD1E8"/>The firſt commandment or table of the law is, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, might and mind. And the ſecond commandment or table of the law is, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. This is the ſum of the commandments, and what the light of nature teaches, and is a law inſcribed upon the heart. And thoſe who have not the written law, feel its force; as appears by the reaſoning of St. Paul, Romans ſecond chapter, where he aſſerts that the reaſonings and works of the Gentiles, ſhew the law to be written upon their hearts. In the goſpel of Matthew, our Lord, in his expoſition of the precepts of the moral law, reſcues it from the corrupt and falſe gloſſes of Jewiſh interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and eſtabliſhes it upon its original principles of benevolence and juſtice. For the Jews had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many precepts and practices ſubverſive of the law, under the pretence of their obtaining juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the works of the law.</p>
            <p>THE ſincere chriſtian who ſtrives to keep this holy law, yet finds that in many things he offends, and in all things comes ſhort of that perfect obedience which it demands. He depends not therefore on his own works, for by the deeds of the law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified. The meretorious ground of his dependance is the alone ſpotleſs and univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him, who is the end of the law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to every one that believeth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. LET our obedience to God's commandments be ſuch as he will approve. That it may be ſo, it muſt be according to his word. The whole duty which God requires of us, we are conſcientiouſly to do. Let us do what we do from a right principle, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſupreme love to God, for this is the firſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028999_0024_0FDDCFCF47F4F4F0"/>requirement of the law. The Lord ſearcheth the heart, to give to every one according to his works. The works of the heart, the principle or diſpoſition which prompts our actions and doings, renders our works good or evil in the view of the Deity. O may our hearts be right with God; and let them not be far from him, while we draw nigh to him, in profeſſion.</p>
            <p>OUR obedience, ſirs, to be acceptable muſt be univerſal. Let us not then preſume to pick and chuſe among God's commandments, as did the Phariſees, only ſuch as ſuit our intereſts or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We have reaſon to ſuſpect that religious zeal which confines itſelf to the duties of one table of the law, to the neglect of the other. Let us not vainly imagine, on the one hand, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> zealous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of external duty to God in religious worſhip, will atone for the omiſſion of the duties which we owe to men; nor on the other hand, that punctual juſtice honeſty and charity to men, will excuſe for the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the duties of piety and devotion to God. The ſame authority commands our obedience to both tables of the law. Neither let us deceive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the imagination, that our external obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all the precepts of both tables of the law, will be accepted, while we indulge the luſt of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is idolatry, or the love of ourſelves, or our own intereſt and happineſs as the ruling motive of our obedience. Let the love of God, be ever the animating principle, and then ſhall we not be aſhamed when we have reſpect to all God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p>LET none imagine that becauſe Chriſt has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed the law for our ſalvation, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are excuſed from the obligations of a perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028999_0025_0FDDCFD5F647E3A8"/>and perfect obedience. "Does faith make void the law?" So far from this it eſtabliſhes our perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obedience to it. For Chriſt haſt taught us by his obedience, that the law is holy, juſt and good, and worthy to be obeyed. Let us adore that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and grace which has provided a divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who has rendered that perfect obedience to the law which we were unable to do, and opened a way for mercy to flow to offenders.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A conſideration of the majeſty and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, who has revealed to us his holy law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and taught us all that he requireth of us, ought powerfully to conſtrain us to obedience. It is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah the univerſal king who made all worlds, and ruleth them in infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, who commands our obedience, who mercifully preſcribes to us thoſe laws, by which our hearts and lives are to be regulated. When therefore he ſays by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word, to each ſoul of us, "ye ſhall keep my commandments and do them;" let our hearts in filial obedience and lowly dependance reply, "Thy commandments, O Lord, will we keep." Let us fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
            <p>THE law which we are entering upon the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of, is moſt excellent and divine. It is the great law of reaſon, and exactly ſuited to our nature condition and connections, as the creatures of God, as his offending ſubjects, as accountable and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. It alſo conſiders us in a ſtate of ſociety, and gives general rules of univerſal behaviour, in all poſſible circumſtances. It is ſpiritual as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and extends to the thoughts and emotions of the heart. Its precepts are conciſe and plain, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and copious, wraping together in epitome our
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028999_0026_0FDDCFD783EF2038"/>whole duty. Let us, ſirs, inſcribe them upon our hearts and practiſe them in our lives.</p>
            <p>WE learn the privileges of thoſe who ſtand in a covenant relation to God, and whoſe God is the Lord. The privileges of the church of God on earth are much every way, chiefly becauſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them are committed the oracles of God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law and the bleſſed goſpel—the chriſtian ſabbath and ordinances; the convincing, reforming and ſanctifying influences of the divine ſpirit, and the hope of eternal life.</p>
            <p>THE great deſign of the perfect holy law, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for goſpel bleſſings. By the law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin. It acquaints us with our guilt and danger, our helpleſs and hopeleſs condition. It hath concluded us all under ſin and condemnation. It teaches us the dreadful terrors which will attend the execution of its ſentence. It proclaims its cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in thunder, lightning and flaming ruin upon the tranſgreſſors, that all hope of life, from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works may be cut off, and the ſinner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to eſcape for protection to the covenant of grace, the all perfect and finiſhed righteouſneſs of the bleſſed Redeemer. "The law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion," or to teach us that we are verily guilty before God, and that thro' the weakneſs of the fleſh, we cannot ſatisfy or perfectly keep it, and thus ſerve as a ſchool-maſter to lead us to Chriſt. This good office it performs, in the hands of the divine ſpirit, ſhewing us that it is a holy and perfect law, and that we cannot keep it, that it is a good law, and muſt be kept, that it is a juſt law and muſt be ſatisfied. The knowledge of the law is neceſſary to all men, for their ſalvation. To the unbelieving, the impenitent, and the bold
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028999_0027_0FDDCFDE89D2D8C8"/>tranſgreſſor, it proclaims in dreadful accents, the wrath of God, due to ſin. It is the means ſanctified in the hand of the divine ſpirit to convince of ſin, of righteouſneſs and the judgement to come. And the righteous man is by it inſtructed in all duty to God and men.</p>

            <p>THIS comprehenſive ſentence, is the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or commandment of the law of nature and revelation; and teaches us that Jehovah is the one only God, whom all rational beings are ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to love, worſhip and obey. The moral obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this law are equally binding on individual perſons of all nations and generations, on account of the infinite excellency and perfection of the Deity, and becauſe he is the alone creator and upholder of all things, and on his abſolute goodneſs we are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally dependant for all the good and happineſs which we need or hope for throughout the endleſs periods of our exiſtance.</p>
            <p>IT is obſervable that almoſt all the duties which mankind owe to God and to one another, are in the decalogue forcibly expreſſed by negative precepts. They forbid every ſpecies and every degree of evil of thought and behaviour. And when one virtue or duty is commanded all the virtues and duties of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028999_0029_0FDDCFE6EAC55B28"/>the ſame kind are included; and when one vice or ſin is forbidden, all vices and fins of the ſame ſpecies are included in the prohibition, and the oppoſite virtues commanded.</p>
            <p>THE text forbids our having any other as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our homage, love and obedience, but God alone. "Tho' there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things and we in him." The principal deſign of this firſt precept of the law is to teach us the object of religious worſhip. In the illuſtration of this important article, under the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the text, by the divine aſſiſtance, I ſhall lay before you very briefly,
<list>
                  <item>1. SOME of the proofs and evidences which the light of nature and revelation give of the exiſtance of one God.</item>
                  <item>2. THAT religious worſhip is due to God alone.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>THE exiſtance of God is the foundation and firſt principle of religion and therefore the firſt precept of this divine law proclaims his exiſtance. He is "the God not of the Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles," and the God of univerſal nature; who made the heavens and the earth, and all their hoſts; eternal, ſelfexiſting, uncreated, underived; infinite in all perfection, moſt powerful, wiſe and good; moſt holy, immutable, juſt and true, omniſcient, every where preſent, and infinitely happy; the alone almighty preſerver and governor of all things; whoſe providence is intimately converſant in all events, directing, permitting and overruling all
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028999_0030_0FDDCFE80EDACBA0"/>things for his own glory and the happineſs of the univerſe. Hence alſo we are taught that God is a ſpirit uncompounded, and who filleth all places; the conſtant witneſs of our thoughts and conduct; and the ſupreme and righteous judge, who diſtributes rewards and puniſhments among his creatures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their reſpective moral characters; and that to love, worſhip and pleaſe God, is man's only duty; that his favor is our ſupreme happineſs, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure the greateſt evil which creatures can ſuffer. This is the God whoſe exiſtence is here declared, and whom we are commanded to have as our God; and to eſteem, love and obey as the greateſt, wiſeſt and beſt of beings.</p>
            <p>THE exiſtence of God is a natural principle and a dictate of the common ſenſe of mankind. It is one of thoſe luminous truths with which the rational mind is naturally and neceſſarily impreſſed. The certainty of this truth, that there is a God, we arrive at the knowledge of, by an impreſſion of natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or an intuitive perception, as well as by a chain of reaſoning. The untutored ſavage, feels a more lively impreſſion of the exiſtence of God, the creator and ruler of all things, than the philoſopher ſo called, who labors to diveſt himſelf of this natural principle. So dear and evident is this great truth, that we do not find throughout divine revelation, any arguments expreſsly deduced to prove the exiſtence of God, altho' there are many declarations of the unity of God, in oppoſition to the polytheiſm of the pagan nations. No miracle was ever wrought to convince an atheiſt; for he whoſe heart can reject the natural impreſſion of this truth, is prepared to reject all kinds of evidence, and is given over to the judgment of a reprobate mind. It is our duty and felicity to have our minds ever impreſſed with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028999_0031_0FDDCFEDD35ED108"/>and ſolemn ſenſe of the exiſtence and perfections of God. The knowledge of God is the life of the ſoul. "This is life eternal to know thee, the only true God." It is the fountain of divine ſcience. And altho' "by ſearching we cannot find out God, or the almighty to perfection," yet it is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to ſtrive to know ſo much as we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of the character, the ways and the laws of the ever bleſſed God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE unity of God, or that there is but one God, is a doctrine taught by the law of nature, and abundantly confirmed by revelation. One being infinite in all perfection is ſufficient for the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things. The ſuppoſition of more Gods than one, is inconſiſtent with infinite perfection of either; for the infinite power and perfection of one, would limit and circumſcribe the power and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other. The creator of the univerſe muſt be perfect in all the attributes of Deity, infinite and unbounded in eternity, immenſity and power, and uncontroled in his ſovereign will. But this could not be the caſe, were there more Gods than one.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE works of creation prove the exiſtence of one God. As the univerſe could not give itſelf exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it muſt be the work of an almighty firſt cauſe, the fountain of intelligence, ſelf-exiſting, eternal, infinitely powerful, wife and good. The wiſdom and deſign which appear in the works of creation and of providence, ſo far as we are able to diſcover, ſhew that they are the work of an intelligent being. This appears in the fitneſs of things to the ends and purpoſes for which they are made. We diſcover the traces of admirable wiſdom in the regular and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive revolutions of the heavenly bodies—in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and grateful viciſſitudes of the ſeaſons of the year, and of day and night;—in the uniform or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028999_0032_0FDDCFEEB5AE10C0"/>and harmony of the laws of nature, and the due proportion which creatures and things bear to each other, and to the places and conditions aſſigned them. They teach us that the world and all things therein are the production of the power, the ſkill, and the goodneſs of a being, perfect in knowledge and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>To communicate happineſs to creatures appears to be one chief end of the Deity in the creation. "His tender mercies are on all his works," de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the united acknowledgement, gratitude and love of all intelligences. This unity of deſign proves the Univerſe to be the production of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely benevolent and perfect being.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE firſt idea which ſtrikes the mind in the contemplation of creation is that of <hi>power,</hi> great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all conception. St. Paul mentions this as the firſt evidence in creation of the exiſtence of God.— Creation thro' all her works, proclaims this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. It is ſeen and underſtood by the things which are made, even his <hi>eternal power.</hi> Should a rational being ariſe at once into life, perfect in all his faculties, and look up and around him, upon the works of God; ſhould he ſee the ſun, that vaſt body of light and heat, riſing in the eaſt, travelling thro' the ſky, and when ſunk in the weſt, ſee the moon ſucceeding, with paler rays;—ſhould he raiſe his eyes to the ſhining ſtars, contemplate their number, their order and amazing diſtance; illuminating probably other inhabited ſyſtems; his mind would be filled with awful admiration at the amazing grandeur of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſcene. How auguſt is this Univerſe! How great the power which created it!</p>
            <p>THE greateſt exertions of human power appear little and deſpicable, placed in contraſt with the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028999_0033_0FDDCFF06AB205F0"/>proofs which this earth itſelf gives of the power of God. The largeſt cities and moſt magnificent buildings, reared by the united labor of miriads, are diminiſhed in the view of the lofty mountains, raiſing their heads to the clouds—the majeſtic rivers, running thro' continents—or the vaſt oceans which roll around the globe. He whoſe ſingle ſtrength cannot raiſe a maſſy ſtone from the earth, muſt be amazed at the power of God, who formed the mountains and ſpread abroad the plains, and ſcooped the baſons of the ſeas; who placed the ſun and planets in their ſtations, and moves their inconceivable magnitudes in their regular orbits.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE works of creation proclaim the wiſdom of God. Wiſdom ever proceeds in her works with ſome good deſign, and uſes the beſt means for its accompliſhment. To diſplay the glorious perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Deity, and to communicate happineſs to the intelligent univerſe, appear to be two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal purpoſes of God in creation. The heavens and the earth proclaim his glorious perfections, and God is good unto all. Our limited capacities can form but very imperfect conceptions of the wiſdom of the Deity. We are loſt in admiration at the multitude of his operations; and we ſee but a ſmall part of the plans of the divine mind: But we ſee enough to ſatisfy us, that a wiſdom unſearchable and infinite, planned the univerſe, and preſides over all, demanding our devouteſt adoration and praiſe. As the wiſdom of an intelligent mind appears in the works of creation, we hence infer that they came not by chance. For chance is nothing, and can produce nothing. The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful formation of the great as well as minute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and things which compoſe the univerſe, and the ample proviſion made for their conſervation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028999_0034_0FDDCFF7D3C31500"/>the infinite and unbounded wiſdom of their great original. When we diſcover wiſdom or ſkill in the contrivance of any work, we conclude that the maker thereof was wiſe. We refer the praiſe of wiſdom to him and not to the workmanſhip. In this ſenſe muſt men be underſtood, when they ſay that nature is wiſe, or good; that is, that the author of nature is ſo. As a finiſhed and well proportioned houſe, proves the ſkill of him who made it, ſo does the world proclaim the divine ſkill of the Creator. What unſearchable wonders of wiſdom appear in the organization of all animals, from the elephant down to the ſmalleſt inſect! How wonderful are their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and qualities adapted to their reſpective condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! From the full ſtore houſe of his bounty, all animals on the earth, in the air and ſea, are abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly fed. "The eyes of all, O Lord, wait upon thee, and thou ſatisfieſt their wants! O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wiſdom haſt thou made them all!"</p>
            <p n="5">V. THE works of creation and providence proclaim the goodneſs of God. Without good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there can be no wiſdom. But theſe two at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes ſweetly unite and gloriouſly harmonize in all the works and ways of God. The ſuitable and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proviſion made for the exiſtence and comfort of all animals, which inhabit the regions of the air— the element of water,—or which live on the dry land, teach us, that as all creatures are derived from God, on his rich bounty they alſo depend, for their conſtant preſervation. The earth is a well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated habitation for man and beaſt. The ſea is a ſtore houſe of proviſion for its finny tenants. And from thence the clouds receive the vapors, which wafted over the earth diſtil in dews and rains to refreſh the dry ground and make it fruitful, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028999_0035_0FDDCFF7D743B428"/>to feed the numerous ſprings and rivers, which water the earth and ſupport and comfort its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
            <p>How expreſſive of the goodneſs and the wiſdom of God, is the creation of the element of <hi>air;</hi> and happily adapted to the life and conveniency of man and all living things; thro' which its winged ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants the fowls, fly ſpeedily from danger, or ſeek their food; and how well fitted to their element, are the form, and lightneſs of their bodies.</p>
            <p>THE air and water are adapted to promote a friendly intercourſe among all the inhabitants of the earth; and to waft the productions of different climes, for the mutual comfort of mankind. The element of air is moſt neceſſary for reſpiration, and without it, all living creatures would ceaſe their exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And thro' this medium we receive the rays of light and founds.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſun</hi> is a glorious evidence of the munificence of the Deity. As the repreſentative of the goodneſs of the Creator, it diffuſes life and warmth and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, among all the works of God on earth. By the appointment of its Creator. "He cometh out of his chambers in the eaſt, and rejoiceth as a ſtrong man to run a race." His conſtant preſence would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power our ſenſes with light and heat, and therefore he withdraws gradually every day, and leaves us to the calm ſilence of the night, that our natures may have opportunity to reſt from the labours and fatigues of the day, and recruit their exhauſted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. That we may not be oppreſſed with total darkneſs in his abſence, the mild moon and twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtars, ſhed upon us their cheering light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:028999_0036_0FDDCFFD9D151180"/>
THE earth is a maſs of lifeleſs matter. It cannot will or move, and could not give itſelf exiſtence. But <hi>man</hi> is himſelf, a world of wonders in miniature, proclaiming the author divine. "We are fearfully and wonderfully made." What wonders of divine ſkill appear in the organization of every member of the human body! It is not my deſign, were I capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, to diſcant anatomically on the various ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable properties of this animated machine; or to point out the nice arrangement, ſymmetry, mutual depences and connection of all its organs, limbs and members. I ſhall notice only a few particulars, to excite our devout gratitude and praiſe to God, who made us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>erect form</hi> which is given to man, ſtrikes us with pleaſing admiration, and ſhews the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to man, over the beaſts of the earth, who are prone to the ground. The <hi>feet,</hi> the ſupporters of the body, are curiouſly wrought as with elaſtic ſprings, to help forward its motion, and ſupport in their ſockets its weight. The <hi>head</hi> raiſed aloft, and by its poſition and defence moſt out of danger, contains the curious organs of ſenſation, and the brain the ſeat of intelligence, ſtrongly guarded by a helmet of bone. The <hi>eyes</hi> are endowed with a power to look up on the heavens, and contemplate the works of God. Strange that this liquid ball, which contains but a few drops of water, ſhould be able to take in a world of objects, and meaſure their diſtances and magnitudes. The <hi>ear</hi> receives and diſtinguiſhes ſounds, and the <hi>tongue</hi> utters ſpeech, the true images of the thoughts and emotions of the mind. Whence have theſe little organs theſe ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing powers? It is God who gives the eye to ſee, the ear to hear, the tongue to ſpeak. The <hi>knees</hi> bend forward to teach man to proſtrate himſelf in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028999_0037_0FDDCFFF5949A9D0"/>humble adoration; the <hi>arms</hi> endowed with a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion, to riſe with the thoughts in devout ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to the creator, and well adapted to all the various purpoſes of life and motion. Tho' our limbs and ſenſes are obedient to the will, and ſeem to move and act by a ſimple volition; yet there is a life within us which acts without our volition, and independent on us; that is, the conſtant motion of the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>bowels,</hi> and the ſurprizing circulation of the <hi>blood,</hi> thro' all the ſmalleſt veins. What power, but the power of God, keeps alive, and in motion within us, this maſs of fluid and fleſhly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? It lives and moves by his conſtant agency. Taken out of the body, it is in a moment dead, and motionleſs as a ſtone. "In God we live and move and breathe." Let our bodies with all their powers be conſecrated to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. STILL more ſurprizing wonders ſtrike us, in the contemplation of the rational <hi>ſoul,</hi> myſteriouſly united to, and operating with the body. We find an exiſtence within us, hidden from our ſight and ſenſes, endowed with the power of thought, reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and judgement, which can recal paſt times and tranſactions, and ſend forward its thoughts to ages to come; poſſeſſed of a capacity to know the will of God,—with a conſciouſneſs of the deſert of moral conduct; that feels inward approbation and peace, at good and right conduct, and ſelf condemnation and blame on doing ill; that has a conſciouſneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, and obligations to pleaſe him; that hopes for his favour as the greateſt happineſs, and dreads his diſpleaſure, as the greateſt calamity. From whence do we derive thoſe two natures, ſo differently conſtituted, and yet ſo nearly connected, and mutually operating, with all the wonderous and enexplicable powers of each, but from him who is
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028999_0038_0FDDD00535301AA8"/>emphatically the "former of our bodies and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our ſpirits?" I am conſcious of my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, but I know that neither myſelf, nor any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could give it, and thence infer that God exiſts, from whom I derived my being, and by whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant agency I am preſerved.</p>
            <p>THE majeſtic oak ſpringing from the tender acorn —each ſpire of graſs, and drop of water—the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt inſect, and the light atom, which floats in the beams of the ſun, and each creature and thing in the univerſe, as to their eſſence and properties, contain myſteries, which baffle the ſtudious inveſtigation of the brighteſt genius. Creation thro' all her works proclaims a God.</p>
            <p>WE infer the exiſtence of God from his works. To trace effects to their cauſe, in the language of logicians, is reaſoning <hi>a poſteriori.</hi> And altho' other more abſtract modes of reaſoning might be uſed to illuſtrate this great truth, yet this method is choſen becauſe moſt obvious and intelligible, and ſufficient to afford compleat ſatisfaction to every mind. And this method infinite wiſdom has choſen for univerſal inſtruction. The heavens and the earth, and every creature is, as an open volume, in which the being and perfections of God are ſeen and underſtood. All things are full of him. The evidences of the exiſtence and perfections of God, from the works of creation and providence, are calculated to fill our minds with devout affections, with admiration, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, filial fear and love, rather than to gratify our curious ſpeculation. Yet muſt we ſtrive to obtain the excellent knowledge of God, that we may ſerve him acceptably. To us who are favored with the ſuperior light of revelation, it may ſeem ſtrange that mankind in all ages, ſhould have gone into
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028999_0039_0FDDD006D71B3110"/>the belief and worſhip of more Gods than one, ſince the doctrine of one almighty Creator, is ſo clearly demonſtrated, by the works of creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. An inſpired apoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le gives a ſolution to this, and acquaints us, that the guilt of polytheiſm origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the depravity of the human heart. That its vicious propenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es and luſts over powered the dictates of reaſon. That mankind loved not the character of the true God, as diſcovered in his works, and therefore formed to themſelves imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gods, ſuited to their own depraved inclinations. "They were without excuſe, becauſe that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened. They changed the glory of the incorruptable God, into an image, and the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the creature, more than the Creator, who is bleſſed forever."</p>
            <p>IT ſhould alſo be obſerved, that altho' many Gods were worſhipped before the coming of Chriſt, yet ſome of the wiſe men among the nations, who ſtudied more attentively the works of God, believed in the unity of the Deity. Plato among the Greeks profeſſed this, and his diſciple Socrates, was put to death for teaching the doctrine of one God. But the faith of Philoſophers was weak, becauſe they had not the poſitive declarations of revelation: and however well they thought and wrote, yet generally went into the abominable idolatries of their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>SOME have alſo thought that a miſapprehenſion of ſome paſſages in the book of Geneſes, might orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate in early ages, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>otion of a plurality of Gods. In the firſt ſentence in the bible, there is an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028999_0040_0FDDD00834BB4098"/>of divine perſonalities, in ſocial union in Deity.</p>
            <p>"In the beginning, Elohim (gods in the plural number) created the heaven and the earth." But the verb <hi>created</hi> being in the ſingular, ſhews that the divine perſonalities are, tho' incomprehenſible by us, united in one God. The ſame thing is obſervable in the account of the creation of man; "Let <hi>us</hi> make man, in <hi>our</hi> image, after <hi>our</hi> likeneſs." And on the tranſgreſſion; "Behold the man is become as one of <hi>us.</hi>" And alſo at the building of Babal; "Let <hi>us</hi> go down, and there confound their language." If this mode of ſpeech, is not to be underſtood agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the cuſtom of eaſtern monarchs, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed the plural for the ſingular number; we have then in the beginning of the ſacred volume, a faint intimation of the doctrine of the trinity; a doctrine more fully aſſerted and explained in the new teſtament. Divine revelation abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the inference drawn from the uniform and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect works of creation and providence, that there is but one God. "The Gods of the heathen, are vanity and a lie. There is none that can deliver out of my hand; I have made the earth and created man upon it; I, even my hands have ſtretched out the heavens; I am the Lord who maketh all things; beſides me there is no God. Who," in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime ſtyle of inſpiration, "ſtretched out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as a curtain, who laid the beams of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the waters, and maketh the clouds his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iot; who laid the foundations of the earth that it ſhould not be removed forever; who covereth it with the deep as with a garment; who cauſes the graſs to grow for the cattle, and herb for the ſervice of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man

            <p>THUS have we taken into conſideration, ſome of the moſt obvious and ſatisfactory evidences of the exiſtence and perfections of God. I ſhall conclude this important diviſion of the ſubject, with one or two</p>
            <div type="reflections">
               <head>REFLECTIONS.</head>
               <p n="1">I. IF, ſirs, any thing in the works and ways of God, in creation or providence, ſhould at any time appear to our limited underſtanding, inconſiſtent with perfect wiſdom and goodneſs, let us reject the thought; becauſe it originates in our blindneſs, and total incapacity to comprehend the works and plans of infinite perfection, rectitude and goodneſs. Let us not impiouſly arraign the proceedings of infinite wiſdom at the bar of human reaſon and folly; but with filial confidence and joy, in the darkeſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, let us reſort to that univerſal truth, taught in the volumes of nature and revelation, <hi>That the Creator and Judge of all worlds does right.</hi> For all that God has done, or will do, is infinitely wiſeſt and beſt. And tho' clouds and darkneſs may be round about him, unerring judgement and goodneſs, are the ſtability of his works and government.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE ways by which God is pleaſed to reveal to us the knowledge of himſelf, are divinely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028999_0042_0FDDD00F181924C8"/>and various. Let them be the profitable and pleaſing ſubjects of our conſtant and prayerful ſtudy and meditation. The heavens declare his glorious greatneſs, and the earth is full of his goodneſs. But in the revelation of his holy law and goſpel, "we read his name in fairer lines." Let us ſee God in all his works, and may our minds be filled with a pleaſing and awful ſenſe of his preſence: whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſurrounds us and pervades our eſſence. Let us ſtrive to obtain a knowledge of the nature and perfections, the works of laws, of the ever bleſſed God; for the knowledge of him, conſtitutes the happineſs and joy of angels, and all holy intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let us ſeek the favour and protection of this almighty being, in whoſe favour is our life. The majeſty of God, as diſplayed in his works, have a tendency to impreſs our minds with a ſuitable hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe of our littleneſs, and unworthy of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. "When I look up to the heavens and conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them as the work of thy hands, Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him;" that thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteſts him every morning, and trieſt him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! But the contemplation of the frame of the univerſe, and all the wonders of creation, cannot give the ſoul a ſaving knowledge of the bleſſed Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. It is the office of the divine ſpirit to remove our darkneſs, and ſo reveal to us the father, in the attractions of his love and mercy, in the Saviour, as to give us a title to the inheritance of eternal life. And to every penitent enquirer after God, this ſaving knowledge and grace are given. "O Thou great and ever bleſſed Jehovah, who at the beginning didſt command the light to ſhine out of darkneſs; who in thy ſovereign power and goodneſs didſt ſay, let there be light, and there was light, ſhine into our benighted hearts, and give us to diſcover thy amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and awful glories, as they are revealed in the

            </epigraph>
            <p>I AM now,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To invite your attention to this great truth and duty,—<hi>That God is the alone object of our religious worſhip.</hi> The command, that we ſhall <hi>have</hi> no other God before Jehovah, is very expreſſive, and implies that we muſt <hi>have</hi> a God; and that our God muſt be the only living and true God; and that no creature or thing ſhould be prefered or eſteemed equally, or worthy to be compared to him, as the chiefeſt object of our knowledge, of our ſupreme love, homage and obedience.</p>
            <p>THIS precept is placed the firſt of God's laws to man, to teach us the object to whom our thoughts are firſt to be directed, to whom our powers are to be forever conſecrated, and whoſe will is our only ſufficient rule of duty and felicity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD is the ſupreme object of our religious homage and worſhip, becauſe he is the only true God. To us there is but one God, the father of all. "The Gods of the heathen are vanity and a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028999_0045_0FDDD01814885130"/>lie; the work of men's hands, and of their vain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations. As God alone poſſeſſes all poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, infinite in power, wiſdom and goodneſs; the firſt, the greateſt and beſt, and only ſource of all being, perfection and happineſs, he is alone worthy of the profoundeſt homage, worſhip and love of his creatures. Whatever of goodneſs, uſefulneſs or happineſs are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound among the works of creation, are derived from God, the ſource of all good. We form ſome imperfect idea of God, by combining in our imagination, all thoſe excellencies and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we diſcover among creatures, and attribute them to him, and conceive of them as exiſting in him in the higheſt poſſible degree, of which our thoughts are capable. But alas, how poor and imperfect are our beſt thoughts of God! They fall infinitely below the heighth of his exalted nature and character; for the being and perfections of God are incomprehenſible by finite minds. It is high we cannot attain unto it. "God is in heaven and we are on earth." As heaven is high above the earth, ſo are his nature and attributes and ways far above our thoughts. It is but a ſmall portion of his character, which we can know. The wonders of his being, eternal, ſelf-exiſting, underived, and his adorable attributes, works and government, will forever afford to holy beings, a ſtill enlarging and extending field of knowledge, admiration and praiſe, thro' all eternal ages. As religious worſhip implies the intire conſecration of ourſelves to the being whom we worſhip; that our beſt hopes and truſt and love, our life and time and ſervices be wholly and forever dedicated to him, we hence infer that none but God alone is the proper object of theſe; ſince he alone is the ſource of all being and perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD is the object of our religious worſhip, becauſe we are entirely dependent on him. We
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028999_0046_0FDDD0181A64CE30"/>are his abſolute property, by right of creation, and conſtant preſervation. No ſervant is ſo dependent on his maſter, or child on its parent for bread, as every creature is dependent on God, the univerſal proprietor. It was his goodneſs which gave us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. His infinite happineſs could receive no acceſſion from creatures. As we are dependent on God for the exiſtence which we poſſeſs, and for all the rich and various proviſion made for our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral comfort, on his unmerited bounty and mercy, we depend for all our hopes of future and immortal life and happineſs, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. By whoſe bleſſed mediation, our exiſtence was redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſentence of death, and a new ſtate of trial allowed us, that by repentance before God, and a living principle of faith in the almighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, producing the holy fruits of obedience, we may obtain, thro' the mercy of God, the inheritance of immortal life. Thus our ſupreme love, homage and obedience to God are demanded, by the right of creation, preſervation and redemption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD demands our excluſive worſhip, becauſe he will not ſuffer a rival in our hearts. We muſt have none before, or beſides him. He will not allow us to give that honor and homage to another. His firſt law to man demands our whole heart. "Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;" with all our powers, our bodies and our ſpirits, which are his. "Take heed to yourſelves that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aſide, and ſerve other Gods and worſhip them." They vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this holy commandment, who love life, or the world and the goods and enjoyments thereof, more than God. We come,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſpeak of the nature and guilt of Idolatry. As mankind are naturally inclined to depart from
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028999_0047_0FDDD01A444093C8"/>the knowledge and worſhip of God, he is pleaſed to caution and guard us againſt this ſin, by prohibiting in this firſt precept our having any other, as the object of our ſupreme love and obedience; or paying thoſe divine honors to any other, which are due to him. Idolatry is loving and ſerving any creature more than God. This ſin may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a threefold view. As,
<list>
                  <item>I. WHEN ſome other object beſides God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, as God.</item>
                  <item>II. WHEN an image or ſymbol is worſhipped, as a repreſentative of God.</item>
                  <item>III. WHEN our love and dependence are placed upon creatures, to the neglect of God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe is the groſſeſt kind of idolatry. And it is this kind of idolatry which almoſt univerſally prevailed in early ages. The Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians appear to be the firſt who gave the lead to this kind of worſhip; and ſet up temples, and erected images in them; paid divine honors to many falſe and imaginary gods. From them it ſpread into Egypt, and other parts of the world. The ſenſual taſte of men choſe gods whom they could ſee, and firſt began to pay divine worſhip to thoſe creatures and things, which were moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. Hence originated the worſhip of the ſun, moon and planets; and this idolatry was common in almoſt all the eaſt, eſpecially the worſhip of the ſun. For this is the moſt glorious repreſentative of the power and goodneſs of the Creator, of all his works, and the moſt neceſſary and beneficial to mankind. The worſhip of this glorious luminary, was the moſt excuſable kind of idolatry, (if any excuſe may be admitted in the caſe) of all the idolatrous rites of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028999_0048_0FDDD01BB5D451B8"/>heathen, ſince it is the brighteſt emblem of the Deity, among things created.

               </note> But it is no more then one of the works of God, and men are moſt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſible, in giving thoſe divine honors to a creature, which the light of nature taught them were due, only to the Creator.</p>
            <p>THE Iſraelites, in the reign of impious and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kings, fell into the idolatrous practices of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nations. They erected magnificent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and conſecrated groves and horſes and chariots, to the ſun and moon, to the planets, and all the hoſts of heaven. A malicious and cruel deity Moloch, was worſhipped, by offering living children in ſacrifice. The falſe gods of the nations, the ſcriptures condemn, by the name of <hi>abominations.</hi> Thus we read of Aſtaroth, the abominations of the Zidonians,—Chemoſh, the abomination of the Moabites,—Milcom of the Ammonites,—Dagon of the Philiſtines,—Baal, the abomination of the Syrians.</p>
            <p>IDOL gods were exceedingly multiplied. Every nation had its principal god, and each province, town and family, its ſubordinate, tutelary deity. And in the days of Moſes, the earth was overrun with this ſtupid and profane abomination. And the effect of idolatry, was the prevalence of all manner of vice. Forſaking the knowledge and worſhip of the true God, there was nothing to reſtrain the paſſions and luſts of the human heart. Forming gods to their own depraved taſte, they imagined that they muſt be pleaſed with ſuch licentious ways, as were pleaſing to themſelves. Filthy rites were performed, in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028999_0049_0FDDD0211C1DA5A8"/>honor of their laſcivious gods and goddeſſes. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were proſtituted in their temples; and the God of intemperence and of luſt, worſhipped in a manner ſuited to their characters, and all manner of beaſtly vices prevailed. The condemnation of the ſin of idolatry, is therefore placed at the beginning of the moral law, as the greateſt ſin of which mankind can be guilty. Idolatry prevailed not only among the moſt ignorant, but the moſt learned nations. The Egyptions were celebrated for political wiſdom and human ſcience, yet were moſt addicted to this groſs and impious ſuperſtition, and exceeded all nations in the number and meanneſs of their gods. They worſhipped a living calf, in magnificent temples, as their chief god; and paid divine honors to cats and crocodiles, and other vile animals, and even to the vegetables which grew in their gardens, and devoured the gods whom they adored. O ſacred folly, and blind impiety! Left to the guidance of depraved paſſions and propenſities, how fruitful is the heart of man, in evaſions to looſe the knowledge and reject the worſhip of the one only high and holy God, the former of all things!</p>
            <p n="2">II. ANOTHER ſpecies of idolatry is, worſhipping God by images, ſymbols, or viſible repreſentations. God is a ſpirit; he is not comprehended by our ſenſes. Altho' the works of creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the word of God, proclaim his being and perfections, yet we ſee not God with our bodily ſight. But men have invented images, figures and pictures to repreſent the inviſible Jehovah, and worſhipped them. The difference between this kind of idolatry and that juſt mentioned is, that this profeſſes to worſhip the true God in the image, the other worſhips an image, to the excluſion of the true God. One is the worſhip of ſome creature inſtead
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028999_0050_0FDDD02275F5B0B0"/>of God, the other is the worſhip of God in or with a creature. This branch of Pagan idolatry has been revived and practiced, many ages, in the church of Rome, There they pay divine honors to the bread and wine in the euchariſts, abſurdly imagining that thoſe elements are converted into the real body and blood of Chriſt. They worſhip the ſuppoſed wood of the croſs and numerous relicks; the images of angels, ſaints, apoſtles and the virgin Mary. Tho' they alledge that they worſhip not the images, but the holy beings repreſented by them, yet this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, according to their own juſtification of it, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly and ſeverely prohibited, both in the firſt and ſecond precepts of the law. But as this branch of idolatry will with greater propriety come into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration under the next precept, I ſhall not anticipate it, but conclude this diviſion of the ſubject, with ſhewing the folly, guilt and miſery, of the idolatry here condemned.</p>
            <p>To us it may well appear ſtrange, that mankind ſhould ſo groſsly miſtake the object of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and looſe the knowledge of God, and pay thoſe divine honors to creatures, which are to God.— They were ſincere in their worſhip; they confided in the power of idol gods to help them, in times of trouble. How fervent were the worſhippers of Baal, in the days of Elijah! But ſince God has given to mankind in all ages ſuch clear evidences of his being and perfections, can we wonder at the manifeſtations of his wrath againſt idolaters, that he ſhould, and in righteous judgment, withdraw from them, his reſtraining and ſaving grace; and give them up to reprobation, and to work all kinds of wickedneſs with greedineſs, and thus ripen themſelves for an aggravated condemnation. Such idolaters ſhut their eyes againſt the light, chooſing darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:028999_0051_0FDDD02490600C10"/>
As idolatry is the firſt and greateſt ſin of which mankind can be guilty; God has inflicted on groſs idolaters, the ſevereſt ſpiritual judgments; as St. Paul obſerves was the caſe with the pagan world. "Who, becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and changed the glory of the incorruptable God, into an image made like to corruptable man, and to birds, and four footed beaſts and creeping things; wherefore God alſo gave them up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, thro' the luſts of their own hearts, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor their own bodies between themſelves, who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the creature, more than the creator, who is bleſſed forever. For this cauſe God gave them up to the vile affections;—and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind; being filled with all unrighteouſneſs,—hateful, and hating one another."</p>
            <p>WE come laſtly, to ſpeak of a ſpecies of idolatry different from thoſe now mentioned; an idolatry alas, but too common at the preſent day, and of which we are all no doubt, in a greater or leſs degree chargable; it is a <hi>ſpiritual idolatry,</hi> in which the mind and affections are placed on the world, and the things of the world, as the chief good and happineſs of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>THIS is a ſecret kind of idolatry, oft times ſo hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as not to be diſcerned by ourſelves, and much leſs by others. An evil that mixes itſelf with our daily labors,—with our relative and ſocial duties, with our religious profeſſions, and devotional exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. For if God is not conſtantly and forever the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028999_0052_0FDDD02AD34F8EC8"/>chief object of our love, our deſire, our truſt, our hope and our happineſs; our hearts are not right, and we are chargable with the ſin of loving and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves, or the creature, more than we ought, and are guilty of ſpiritual idolatry. God as the firſt and greateſt being, demands our ſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me love and obedience; if then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſtrive to pleaſe, or fear to offend, any creature though the moſt powerful, created being, more than to pleaſe God, his holy law condemns us therein, for he is higher than the higheſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our higheſt regard. No creature or thing ought to command our higheſt and moſt profound obedience, love and fear. Theſe ſhould ever have God for their object. "Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul, but fear him who is able to deſtroy, both body and ſoul in hell."</p>
            <p>GOD is the ſovereign Creator and proprietor of us and all things, and we cannot be under equal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to any other, and therefore, ſhould fear, ſerve and obey him, firſt and before all others.</p>
            <p>WE are conſtantly in the preſence of Jehovah, our ſovereign Creator and merciful redeemer, and ought ever to bear on our minds, a ſolemn ſenſe of his preſence, and of our obligations, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and if we love, eſteem, or reverence any creature, more than God at any time, we offend, and are chargable with idolatry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are alſo guilty of idolatry, when we love ourſelves ſupremely; when <hi>ſelf</hi> is the object that we ſeek principly to ſerve and pleaſe. God was the ſupreme object of man's love and complacency, at
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028999_0053_0FDDD02D1AAE3EF8"/>the creation, but at the fall, the deity was dethoned from the human heart, and the idol ſelf, was ſet up as the chief object of love and complacency; ſo that now in his fallen ſtate, man is a "lover of himſelf, more than a lover of God." Divine grace dethrones this idol, and reſtores the ſoul to God. How great and offenſive muſt this ſin be in the ſight of God, that the creature ſhould prefer himſelf to God, and ſerve and pleaſe himſelf, tho' a worthleſs, offending, helpleſs creature rather than God, the bleſſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?</p>
            <p>THIS ſelfiſh diſpoſition in the ſinner, would incline him, to bring the whole Univerſe to his will and pleaſure, ſince his own intereſt and happineſs is the chief object of his wiſhes and deſires; yea, he would make the deity ſubſervient to his will and pleaſure, had he power, and dethrone the ſovereign of the Univerſe. Dreadful thought! yet muſt this be indeed the ſtate of the ſinner, who loves himſelf more than God. What impious idolatry then are all they chargable with, in whoſe heart true love to God, is not found?</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is idolatry to love the world more than God. To purſue after the wealth, the honors and pleaſures thereof, as the chief good and happineſs, is vile idolatry. It is placing this periſhable world and the goods of it in the place of God. It is making proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof, and ſerving mammon the God of this world, with the beſt affections. The apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns covetouſneſs as idolatry. The lover of this world's goods, placing his affections ſupremely upon them, and purſuing them as his higheſt happineſs, in the ſight of God, is no doubt as guilty of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as the pagan, who worſhips the ſun or the moon,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028999_0054_0FDDD02E77C8F1E0"/>yea, the pagan is leſs criminal, becauſe the object is more worthy.</p>
            <p>How many then are guilty of the ſin of idolatry, and of having other gods, beſides the only true Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah? All thoſe who are depending on any thing ſhort of Chriſt for ſalvation, or a ſincere repentance, and forſaking of their ſins, and a humble and cordial reliance on the righteouſneſs of their ſaviour, are ſetting up a ſaviour of their own, in oppoſition to God, and ſo are chargable with the ſin of idolatry. All thoſe who reject the revelation of the divine will, teaching men the way of duty and happineſs, and profeſs to take their ſcanty reaſon, and their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the law of nature as their guide to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſet up their own will in oppoſition to the will of God revealed in the goſpel of his ſon, and are guilty of idolatry. In a word, all thoſe who love not God ſupremely, and delight to honor, ſerve and obey him, fall under the condemnation of this firſt great law of our rational nature.</p>
            <p>SOME REFLECTIONS on this ſubject will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are taught that God alone is the ſupreme object of our religious worſhip, love and obedience. Let us ſtrive to know, worſhip, and ſerve no other God. He is the infinite Jehovah, who has given us life and being, in whoſe hands are all our ways; who has given us his ſon, "the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon," to enlighten and ſanctify us, and to redeem us from all our woes, and raiſe us to immortal felicity.</p>
            <p>WHAT obligations are we under for ſuch infinite kindneſs, ſhewn even to the evil, and unthankful?
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028999_0055_0FDDD02FF538CD38"/>If infinite excellence,—if almighty power,—if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded goodneſs, and ſpotleſs purity and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are worthy our ſupreme love and obedience, then do we owe them to God. If we derive our being from God,—if his conſtant and merciful providence continually ſupplies our wants,—if when we had fallen, and become liable to ſuffer the pains of endleſs puniſhment, his mercy interpoſed, and laid help on one mighty to ſave; if it is the will of God that none of us ſhould periſh, but that we all might inherit eternal life; and rich proviſion is now made for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">II. WE hence infer our obligations to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thro' whom there is acceſs to God, even the father. By his bleſſed mediation, he hath brought about reconciliation; thro' whom with humble boldneſs, and filial confidence, we may approach the throne of grace, and implore grace to help us, in every time of need. Divine honors belong to the ſon; and it is no idolatry to worſhip him, for he is one with the father, whom the holy angels worſhip, and who received divine worſhip from men, even when he condeſcended to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſon of man.</p>
            <p>WHEN none of the ſons of the mighty, none of thoſe morning ſtars, the holy angels, the ſons of God by adoption, were equal to the arduous work of man's redemption, it pleaſed the uncreated and eternal ſon of the father, to veil his glories in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028999_0056_0FDDD035B28E3320"/>humanity, and become a ſufferer, "and a man of ſorrows, that he might, by taſting death for us, deliver us from death, and from him that hath the power of death, that in the devil, and bring us nigh to God even the father, of whom are all things, and we in him."</p>
            <p n="3">III. LET us then labor to ſecure an intereſt in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> we may be ſaved from the wrath to come, and "ſerve God acceptably, with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly fear, for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> come to God acceptably. Our worſhip and obedience to God will not find acceptance, but only in the name and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his ſon. "There is no other name given among men, whereby we can be ſaved."</p>
            <p>IN our unrenewed and unholy ſtate by nature, we cannot worſhip God acceptably. A new heart muſt be given us, and a new ſpirit put within us, would we have God for our God, and acceptably ſerve him.</p>
            <p>As neceſſary to this, the goſpel of the bleſſed Saviour exhorts us to repentance for ſin, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, which conſiſts in the heart: turning from all idols, to the love, the worſhip, and ſervice of God. Grace makes a great change in the mind, breaking it off from a ſinful conformity to this world, and transforming us into a reſemblance of Chriſt, enlightning us into the knowledge of God, and inclining us to keep his laws with all our heart.</p>
            <p>THAT worſhip, ſirs, that God demands of us is ſpiritual, it is the worſhip, love and obedience of the ſoul. The Lord ſearcheth the heart, he demands truth and ſincerity there. "The ſacrifice of the Lord are a broken ſpirit," a heart humble,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028999_0057_0FDDD036B8AC2208"/>holy, teachable and heavenly. Without this, the external obedience that we pay in outward forms of worſhip, are of no avail. "For bodily exerciſe profiteth little, but godlineſs is profitable unto all things," having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Let us not "draw nigh to him in profeſſion, while our hearts are far from him."</p>
            <p>LET us oft repair to the throne of grace, for the true worſhipper of God, and obſerver of his law, will be much in prayer, conſcious of his own blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpiritual things, he will come to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light, that the eyes of his underſtanding being enlightened, "he may know and approve, what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of the Lord. And if any man lack wiſdom, let him, aſk of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not."</p>
            <p n="4">IV. WE learn the unhappy and dangerous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who are ignorant of God; "who live without God in the world." We read of the wicked, that "God is not in all their thoughts," or in any of them. Their condition in the future world will be miſerable beyond conception; for the ſupreme Judge of the world will condemn thoſe "who know not God, to everlaſting deſtruction, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord." There can be no ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but thro' Jeſus Chriſt his ſon. "For this is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent." They whoſe minds are conformed to the law of God, and to the goſpel of his ſon, who renounce ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts, living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world, will thro' the grace and mercy of God in Chriſt, be admitted to eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:028999_0058_0FDDD0384E6C6DB8"/>
LASTLY, let us all in truth and ſincerity, and with all our hearts, honor, worſhip and ſerve the only true God, who has graciouſly revealed to us in the goſpel by his ſon, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e clearly the knowledge of his character, and our whole duty than was revealed in ancient times. Let us continually meditate on his being and perfections, and "in the multitude of our thoughts, may the comforts of God, delight our ſouls." Let us worſhip him by our lips and our lives, by ſecret and public devotion, prayer and praiſe; and by conſecrating our ſouls and their immortal powers, our life, our time, our ſtudies, purſuits and talents, to his ſervice and glory,—whom to ſerve and worſhip, in truth and ſincerity, is our chief and higheſt duty; in whoſe favor is immortal life. He hath commanded us to have no other god; let our hearts reply, this God is <hi>our</hi> God, and him only will we love and ſerve, now and evermore.</p>

            <p>IT is obſervable in the pages of inſpiration, as was ſuggeſted in a preceding diſcourſe, that when a ſin or vice is forbidden, the oppoſite virtue or duty is commanded, tho' it may not be expreſsly mentioned. That this is the caſe with the precepts of this divine law, is manifeſt by the reaſon of things, the tenor of revelation, and by the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition given of them, by our infallible teacher, who came to fulfil the law, as recorded by the evangeliſt Matthew. Thus the prohibition of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028999_0060_0FDDD04075179550"/>falſe gods in the firſt precept, as forcibly obliges us to know, worſhip (love and obey the true God, as it condemns our truſting in, or worſhipping falſe gods; and in the ſecond, the prohibition of worſhipping God by images, requires that we worſhip him agreeably to his holy and ſpiritual nature. This precept bears a near reſemblance to the firſt. The difference is, that the firſt teaches us that God is the alone rightful <hi>object</hi> of our worſhip, and that this glory he will not allow us to give to any other; and the ſecond teaches us, the <hi>manner</hi> in which we are to worſhip and ſerve him. God forbids us to worſhip him by images, figures, ſtatutes, pictures, or any viſible reſemblance of the works of nature or art; for nothing can be made or formed, worthily to repreſent the infinite and immenſe Jehovah, the eternal and inviſible ſpirit. We are hence to infer that God is to be worſhipped by our ſpirits, as well as externally. For the law demanding our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is ſpiritual, extending to the exerciſes of the heart, demanding truth and ſincerity there. "God is a ſpirit, and the true worſhippers, worſhip the father in ſpirit and in truth." It is proper for us to notice the wiſdom of the ſupreme lawgiver, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>angement of the precepts. The moſt ſolemn and important are firſt delivered. The greateſt ſin of which mankind can be guilty, is firſt forbidden; the ſin of having a falſe god, in whom to place our truſt; and the firſt and greateſt duty and felicity of rational creatures required, which is our having the true God for our God, our portion and happineſs. The next greateſt duty is to worſhip and ſerve the true God acceptably; and the next greateſt ſin, is dividing our worſhip, love and obedience between God and creatures, or worſhipping him in or by images. And the ſin forbidden and duties required in the ſecond precept, are greater than thoſe of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028999_0061_0FDDD0420768F518"/>third, and thoſe of the third, than thoſe of the fourth. A ſimilar gradation of relative duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our fellow men <hi>is obſervable</hi> in the ſecond table of this divine law.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE reaſon given why God ſhall not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by images, is that no image can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him. Images are material, local and periſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and God is a ſpirit, eternal, omnipreſent, and incorruptable. Our thoughts are loſt in the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his immenſity. To form an image of God, is to degrade the glory and dignity of his nature and perfections; and is contrary to his expreſs will. All images or figures of the deity, formed either by our imaginations or by the hands of men fall infinitely ſhort of the divine original, and tend to diveſt the mind of thoſe pure and ſublime concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028999_0062_0FDDD0474E0D3E88"/>which we ought ever to have of God, as a being uncompounded, inviſible, omnipreſent.— They are impious attempts to bring down the Deity to the level of our comprehenſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER reaſon of the prohibition is, the danger of our giving thoſe divine honors to the image, rather than to God. And this hath been the caſe. Images were probably firſt invented, that the minds of men might by them be more ſolemnly affected with a ſenſe of the preſence of God. And aſſociating in their idea, the ſpecial preſence of God in the image, they imperceptably fell into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the image itſelf, as God, or the ſenſible repreſentative of ſome of his attributes.</p>
            <p>THE heathen have fixed upon various objects or images, becauſe of ſome ſuppoſed likeneſs in them, to him whom they profeſſed to worſhip. Uſing theſe to excite their devotion they have by an eaſy tranſition gone on to worſhip the image with God, and finally to terminate their worſhip on the ſenſeleſs object. Thus pagans in former times, and papiſts at the preſent day, bow down to images and figures of the Deity. The Grecians and Romans worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſupreme being, in the image and name of Jupiter, and alſo various ſubordinate deities, as repreſentatives of the providences and perfections of God, or as appointed to preſide over the affairs and the employments of men, in different parts of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>WE have a remarkable inſtance of this ſenſeleſs worſhip of images, even among the learned Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, in the days of the apoſtles. Demetrius, a zealous idolater, accuſed the apoſtle, "ſaying, this Paul hath perſuaded and turned away much people,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028999_0063_0FDDD048B78A1BF0"/>ſaying that they be no gods which are made with hands,—ſo that the great goddeſs Diana is in danger of being deſpiſed, whom all Aſia, and the world worſhippeth. And they cried out, for the ſpace of two hours, great is Diana of the Epheſians,—what man is there that knoweth not, how that the city of the Epheſians, is a worſhipper of the great goddeſs Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?"</p>
            <p>OUR Celtie and Saxon anceſtors were idolatrous worſhippers of images. They worſhipped the idol <hi>Woden,</hi> the imaginary God of battles, on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, (from whom the day derives its name.) And the idol Thor, the god of thunder, on Thurſday. And they worſhipped God by images, or deities of their own imagination, for a conſiderable time after Chriſt came; and were among the laſt of the pagan nations, within the bounds of the ancient Roman empire, who renounced the worſhip of idols, and embraced the chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>IT is a remarkable fact, confirmed by authentic hiſtorians, that by the preaching of the apoſtles, the idolatrous oracles of the heathen nations, in Europe and Aſia, from whence, evil ſpirits, by the mouths of falſe prophets had iſſued orders and predictions, were ſilenced and ſtruck dumb; and their temples, ſoon after were forſaken, or converted into churches of Chriſt. This was a wonderful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of the power of Chriſt, over the powers of darkneſs, and the accompliſhment of one deſign of his divine miſſion, who came to deſtroy the works and the viſible worſhip of the devil. A ſpecimen of this power he had given to his diſciples before his aſcenſion, when they returned to Chriſt, from
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028999_0064_0FDDD04E86F22320"/>the miſſion on which he had ſent them to preach, rejoicing at the ſucceſs, "ſaying Lord, even the devils are ſubject to us, thro' thy name."</p>
            <p>THE worſhip of inviſible beings by images, however covered with the pretence of honoring God by them, was in reality, the grand inſtrument by which Satan maintained a viſible kingdom on earth, ruling in the children of diſobedience. But the light of the goſpel ſhone into his dark retreats, and his kingdom fell, as with lightning from heaven. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral ages had elapſed, the folly and wickedneſs of pagan idolatry was revived in the church of Rome. There they canonize and worſhip dead men, and ſome who had been infamous for vice, or had no other merit, but that of being benefactors to the Romiſh ſuperſtition. They worſhip the image of the virgin Mary, the apoſtles and angels, paying divine honors to them, as protectors and mediators. Thus by degrading the bleſſed and only mediator, and by ſetting up idols and themſelves above God; and by the traffic of indulgences in all manner of ſins, they have evinced themſelves, to be indeed the "mother of abominations, and the antichriſt, whom God will deſtroy, with the brightneſs of his appearing."</p>
            <p>DEVIATIONS from the pure and ſpiritual law of divine worſhip to the one only true God, are ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto thee, any likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above;</hi> either the ſun, moon, planets or ſtars, or of birds,—the idol gods of the Chaldeans and eaſtern nations. <hi>Or in the earth beneath;</hi> as dead men, four-footed beaſts, ſerpents and the like,—the idol Gods of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. <hi>Or in the waters under the earth;</hi> as croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles and fiſhes; the latter was worſhipped by the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028999_0065_0FDDD04F76862140"/>Canaanites, and the former by the Egyptians. By this particular prohibition, it pleaſed God to guard the ancient church, from the idolatrous ways of ſurrounding nations. Images are not forbidden, except ſuch as were deſigned as repreſentations of ſpiritual things and objects of religious worſhip; as appears by the command to make a brazen ſerpent, and the figures of Cherubims, and the brazen bulls at the temple built by Solomon. Chriſtians are not forbidden to make decent images, ſtatutes or pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of perſons or things. But any picture or image intended to repreſent the incomprehenſible Jehovah, is at all times prohibited, as impious. As a reaſon to enforce the obſervance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Moſes reminds the people of Iſrael, that they ſaw no manner of ſimilitude of God at Sinai, and that they only heard a voice, from the midſt of the awful and glorious ſcene, that covered the mount.</p>
            <p>THE prophet Elijah, by a ſolemn irony, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules the worſhip of Baal, and their god. The prophet Iſaiah in the ſame ſtrain, ſeverely cenſures the folly of idol-worſhip. "The ſmith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and faſhioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the ſtrength of his arms;—the carpenter ſtretcheth out his rule, he marketh it with a line, and compaſs, and maketh it after the figure of a man. He planteth an aſh and the rain doth nouriſh it, with part of it he kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a fire, and baketh bread; with part of it he maketh a god, and worſhippeth it; he falleth down before it, and prayeth unto it, and ſaith deliver me, for thou art my God."</p>
            <p>THIS precept forbids us to give that love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to any creature which belongs only to God, who is a jealous God, ſpeaking after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028999_0066_0FDDD05166AB71D0"/>of men, and who will not ſuffer a rival in our hearts. This command therefore reſpects our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of heart, as well as our external homage, We come,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſpeak of the nature and qualities of that true and acceptable worſhip, which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. We are to worſhip God ſpiritually, as well as externally, and in a way and manner agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his holy nature, and revealed will. No worſhip, can be acceptable to God, but ſuch as he hath directed. His will diſcovered by the light of nature, but eſpecially by the clearer light of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is our only guide, in this intereſting enquiry.

               </gap>ſt heathen were in the dark as to this important matter; and knew not how to approach the holy preſence of God, with acceptance. But the holy ſcriptures have revealed to us the will of God, and the way of our acceptance by the righteouſneſs and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. There we are taught the neceſſity of a humble, teachable and reſigned ſpirit, willing to know and practice the will of God. That to worſhip him to acceptance, we muſt renounce all ſinful luſts, paſſions and appetites, as ſenſuality, pride, envy, cenſoriouſneſs and the love of this world, and that our hearts be pure, ſincere, and filled with the love of God, and of mankind. And that to worſhip him acceptably, we muſt come in the way of grace revealed in the goſpel, expecting audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and acceptance only in the name, and thro' the merits and mediation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.— "He is the way, the truth and the life; and none cometh to the father, but by him."</p>

1. A neceſſary qualification of our acceptance with God in our worſhip of him, is a humble ſenſe and confeſſion of unworthineſs. That of ourſelves we have not any righteouſneſs, goodneſs or merit to claim his favourable notice,—that we are fallen, guilty offenders againſt his holy law, and are juſtly condemned to ſuffer its awful curſes, that the law is holy, juſt and good, but that we are unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and vile. The important and requiſite qualification of the ſinners acceptance with God, is a conſciouſneſs of unworthineſs and a ſenſe of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the rich mercy of God in the redeemer.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Let not conſcience make you linger,</l>
               <l>"Nor of fitneſs fondly dream;</l>
               <l>"All the fitneſs he requireth,</l>
               <l>"Is to feel your need of him."</l>
            </q>
            <p>THE ſinner before he has this preparation of heart to worſhip God acceptably, may imagine that he has need of nothing, but upon the plan of the covenant of grace, he muſt be indeed convinced that he is poor and miſerable, as to his ſpiritual condition, before he will be diſpoſed to prize the remedy which grace has provided for the guilty and helpleſs. He muſt renounce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is own goodneſs, as having no merit to juſtify him, and feel his dependence on the divine plan of ſovereign grace which gives all the glory of his ſalvation to God. Chriſt came, not to call the righteous, or thoſe who are righteous in their own apprehenſion, but ſinners, who are indeed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they are ſinners to repentance and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this is a condition which croſſes the natural pride of the human heart, and diſpoſes men to reſiſt the convictions of the divine ſpirit, and their own ſalvation. The ſinner turns from the ſight of his own deformity, as ſeen in the glaſs of the law, and chooſes not to view himſelf as a guilty criminal
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028999_0068_0FDDD057B55B3DA0"/>in the preſence of God, and in a hopeleſs and helpleſs condition. But without this diſcovery realized, there can be no ſalvation, for the ſinner will not be diſpoſed to receive with humble gratitude the ſalvation which the goſpel proclaims, unleſs ſenſible that he ſhall periſh without it. This ſubmiſſion of the ſoul to the plan of grace in our ſalvation, is therefore much inſiſted on in the goſpel as requiſite to acceptance with God, who "exalts and gives grace to the humble, but abaſes the proud."</p>
            <p n="2">2. CONNECTED with this diſcovery of ourſelves, is a ſincere repentance of ſin before God and a ſincere reformation of heart and life. That ſtate of mind before mentioned prepares the way for this. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of impotency and unrighteouſneſs is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to repentance. We muſt firſt be conſcious that we have offended,—and that we are unable to redeem ourſelves from condemnation, before we ſhall be diſpoſed to confeſs and forſake ſin, and implore forgiveneſs. And to create in us this right diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the goodneſs of God to ſinners, hath furniſhed us with a rich variety of means, happily calculated to accompliſh the end,—ſuch as the holy ſcriptures, ſaobaths, ordinances—providences—the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conſcience and the operations of the divine ſpirit on our minds. This heavenly agent is divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commiſſioned, by his powerful influence on the mind, to convince of ſin, of righteouſneſs and the judgment to come; and to make the inſtrumental means of light and grace effectual to the ſinners repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion. This he does by ſetting before the mind the terrors of the law, broken by tranſgreſſion; convincing the ſinner that he has offended, and fallen under the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and this prepares the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:028999_0069_0FDDD059375AC6C0"/>
3. To reſort to Jeſus Chriſt the divinely appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſaviour of ſinners, and to commit himſelf to him, confiding in his finiſhed and all-ſufficient righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for acceptance with God, and a title to eternal life. The acceptable worſhipper believes in God; "for he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is;" and without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him. Without ſuch an operative faith in God, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the knowledge of, and love to his character and laws, our external devotion is but a lifeleſs form. Connected with a ſaving, operative faith in God, as merciful to ſinners, is faith in Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have acceſs to the father. He is the only mediator between God and man, and the ſoul prepared for ſalvation confides in him, repoſing its immortal intereſts in his hand, on whom the father hath laid, help, mighty to ſave. "Ye believe in God," ſays our Lord to his diſciples, "believe alſo in me." We are juſtified and ſaved only on account of his perfect righteouſneſs, for whoſe ſake a holy God heareth and accepteth ſinners. And to entitle us to the preſent and everlaſting benefits of that righteouſneſs, it is neceſſary upon the plan of the goſpel, that we believe in Jeſus Chriſt, or gratefully and without reſerve, confide in him as the "Lord <hi>our</hi> righteouſneſs." For he has magnified the law which we have tranſgreſſed, and which we cannot ſatisfy; and the benefits and bleſſings of that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs are offered to all, and conveyed to them who <hi>believe</hi> in him. And none but thoſe who believe are qualified to poſſeſs that bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>THE ſcriptures teach us, that ſaving faith in God, and in our divine ſaviour is an effect of an important and ſurpriſing change; called "a new heart, a new ſpirit, and a being born again." Theſe figurate terms do not imply that any new faculty is given,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028999_0070_0FDDD05EA76D79B0"/>or phyſical change made as to the eſſential powers of the ſoul, but that the change is in the diſpoſition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mind towards ſpiritual objects. The ſubject of this grace has a new taſte for ſpiritual enjoyments. She is offenſive and hateful, and holineſs lovely and deſirable. The mind thus rightly diſpoſed to the objects which religion preſents to its view, may be ſaid to be born into a new world of ſpiritual life, objects and enjoyments. Old things are paſſed away and behold all things are new. The new exerciſes of heart, in conſequence of theſe right views of God, and of the Saviour, are expreſſed in ſhe goſpel, by coming to Chriſt,—believing and truſting in him,—receiving Chriſt,—hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs,—putting off the old man with his deeds which are corrupt, and putting on the new man, which after God, or in conformity to him, is created in holineſs and righteouſneſs. That faith in Chriſt which juſtifies is a living and operative principle, producing purity of heart and the works of holy obedience. Theſe juſtify the believers faith and prove it evangelical, and confirm his hope in Chriſt. The deſign of their redemption from the dominion of ſin and from the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law, is that they ſhould ſerve God in newneſs of ſpirit, and be a peculiar people, to the praiſe of him, who hath called them out of darkneſs into marvellous light. "Ye were ſometimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but now are ye light in the Lord, walk as children of the light."</p>
            <p>THIS preparation, firs, is moſt neceſſary for us, upon the plan of the covenant of grace, would we hope to ſerve and worſhip a holy God, with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Let us then with earneſt and perſevering importunity, humbly look up to the father of lights, from whom cometh down all good and perfect gifts;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028999_0071_0FDDD05FF698BEE0"/>that he would give us a new heart and grace, whereby we may worſhip and ſerve him acceptably with reverence and love and Godly fear, now and evermore.</p>

            <p>HAVING in the preceeding diſcourſe, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the foundation of acceptable worſhip, in the heart renewed after the image of God, by a holy principle, producing the good works of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith and univerſal obedience; we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew in ſundry particulars, the nature of that religious worſhip of God, which is commanded, by the moral and evangelical law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. PRAYER is a moral and religious duty; our
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028999_0073_0FDDD06742DD1010"/>abſolute dependence on God, for all that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs or enjoy, and for all that good and happineſs which we hope for, in time, and forever, teaches us to acknowledge God in all our ways, and in all his mercies and providences, towards ourſelves and others. The light of nature teaches men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, with gratitude to God, their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for in him we live and move and have our being; and to preſent conſtantly the tribute of thankſgiving and praiſe, for all mercies; and ſince eſpecially we have offended God by ſin, that we humbly confeſs to God our ſins, and implore his merciful forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>WE are, by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, to make known our requeſt to God. "I exhort," ſays St. Paul, "therefore, that firſt of all ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men,—for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour."</p>
            <p n="2">2. READING, preaching and hearing the word of God, is a part of that religious worſhip, which God hath appointed. "How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and how ſhall they hear without a preacher? "So faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." God hath appointed ſtated, and regular attendence, on his word and ordinances, as the ordinary way of obtaining ſpiritual and ſaving knowledge. He meets his ſincere worſhippers and bleſſes them in his houſe of prayer. "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, where full aſſemblies meet to pray and praiſe and hear," more than all the private dwellings of Jacob. The apoſtles of Chriſt, went abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations, preached the word of ſalvation, and gathered churches to Chriſt, among idolatrous
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028999_0074_0FDDD069C4283D50"/>gentiles. The eſtabliſhment of chriſtian churches, among the nations had been predicted by ancient prophets. "From the riſing of the ſun, even unto the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the gentiles, and in every place incenſe (of prayer and praiſe) ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name ſhall be great among the heathen." God has appointed, that in theſe aſſemblies we hear his word with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and receive it with love and obedience.— "Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear, than to offer the ſacrifice of fools, for they confider not that they do evil."</p>
            <p n="3">3. PRAISING God in ſacred pſalmody is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of public and ſocial worſhip; and without this animating part, public worſhip is languid and lifeleſs. With <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ul, and ſolemn and cheerful voices, we are to celebrate the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and greatneſs of Jehovah. "Singing and making melody in our hearts unto the Lord." Our Lord and the diſciples, at the concluſion of the ſacramental ſupper, ſang an hymn. Public worſhip is with propriety introduced with pſalmody. "En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his courts with ſinging. Let the word of God dwell in you richly, in all wiſdom; teaching and admoniſhing one another, in pſalms and hymns and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord."</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſacred ordinances of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, conſtitute a ſolemn part of public worſhip. Chriſt ſent out his apoſtles to baptize all nations, believing parents and children "in the name of the father, and of the ſon, and of the holy ghoſt:" and inſtituted the holy ſupper, to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028999_0075_0FDDD06B41F57ED0"/>in the church, as a lively emblem of his atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the ſacrifice of himſelf for ſin, and of the efficacy of his mediation, and hath promiſed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and bleſſings with his miniſters and churches, in the adminiſtration of theſe ordinances, to the end of the world. Theſe ordinances are to be celebrated in the public aſſembly; that by the baptiſm of water, the congregation may be reminded of the ſolemn obligations of their covenant with God, and the neceſſity of purification from daily offences, by the cleanſing virtue of the blood of ſprinkling, which cleanſes from all ſin. And that by the ſacrament of bread and wine, their hearts may be duly affected with the boundleſs love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which he ſhewed to us, in laying down his life for us, when he made his life an offering for ſin, and bore the curſe of the law, even the death of the croſs, that we might obtain life and glory in heaven. This ordinance ſhews alſo the neceſſity of our receiving Chriſt by faith and feeding on him, as the life and nouriſhment of our ſouls. "The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? And the cup which we partake is it not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the blood of Chriſt?" Every friend of Jeſus, is bound to partake of this memorial of our merciful Lord and Saviour. A principle of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhould bring us to his table, who has provided a feaſt for our ſouls; and his effectionate command, "This do in remembrance of me," leaves us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, if we abſent ourſelves.</p>
            <p>THESE two are the principal ceremonial or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive rites of the goſpel church, happily delivered from the burcenſome bloody and coſtly rites of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient church. "The yoke of Chriſt is eaſy, and his burden is light."</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:028999_0076_0FDDD0714FD86198"/>
5. THE bleſſing at the concluſion of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is alſo a part of the ſame. The Moſt High, appointed Aaron and his ſons, to bleſs the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And this the apoſtles alſo did in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian churches. And they uſually conclude their epiſtles to the churches, with a ſacred benediction. Theſe are a ſummary of the ſeveral parts of public ſocial worſhip, which God hath appointed to be obſerved in his church, and whoſe inſtitutions we are to obſerve always, for the glory of God, and the furtherence of our own ſalvation, by the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and bleſſed, for the conveyance of ſpiritual bleſſings, to the ſincere enquirer, from the God of all grace and conſolation, who hath promiſed to "make his people joyful, in his houſe of prayer."</p>
            <p n="6">6. IT is the will of God, that we worſhip him by prayer, in ſecret and in family devotion. In the duty of ſecret prayer, our Lord hath directed us,— "When thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut the door, pray to thy father, who ſeeth in ſecret, and who will reward thee openly." The duty and advantages of conſtancy in prayer, or our being ever in an habitual praying temper, he has taught us in the parable of the importunate widow, and the unjuſt judge; "ſaying, men ought always to pray, and not to faint." In every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and occurrence of life, the habit of the ſoul ſhould be towards God, ſending up its deſires in pious ejaculations to him, who hears the ſofteſt whiſpers of the ſoul, and ſatisfies the deſires of the mind, that piouſly reſts on him.</p>
            <p>THE worſhip of God in families is a divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We have family mercies to implore—fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily ſins to confeſs, and family bleſſings, that demand the ſacrifice of praiſe. And with family devotion,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028999_0077_0FDDD072C8B7FEA0"/>family inſtruction, counſel and correction, are divinely inſtituted.</p>
            <p>MOST honorable was the encomium which, the Moſt High was pleaſed to give to the pious patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Abraham,—"I know him, that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his children, and his houſehold after him, that they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, and do juſtice and judgement."</p>
            <p>THE morning and the evening ſacrifice was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed under the law, and the morality or fitneſs of the appointment remains, in full force under the goſpel. In the ſcriptures, prayerleſs families are claſſed with the heathen, and fall under the ſame condemnation with idolatrous pagans. "Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen who know thee not, and upon the families, that call not upon thy name." Tho' God pours temporal bleſſings into the lap of families, who neither know, nor acknowledge him; they are but providential gifts, they come not in covenant mercy, and if ungratefully received, will eventually prove curſes, inſtead of bleſſings. For the goodneſs of God to men is intended to lead them to repentance.</p>
            <p>THE worſhip which we are to render to God has its foundation in the heart. It is the worſhip of the ſpirit. This is a worſhip and ſervice ſuitable to the nature of the great object of our devotion, and for us, as ſpiritual and rational beings, to pay. God is a ſpirit, from whom our ſpiritual nature is derived, and we muſt worſhip him with our ſpirits, in truth and ſincerity. To worſhip God acceptably compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends a knowledge of God, a belief in his word, a ſubmiſſion to his authority, a devotion of all the powers of body and mind to him, and an earneſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028999_0078_0FDDD0789593D1A8"/>diſpoſition to glorify him in our bodies, and our ſpirits which are his. It implies a ſupreme love to God—fidelity in his ſervice, and purity of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; conſcious of his preſence, our obligations, and accountableneſs to him.</p>
            <p>GOD regards the diſpoſition of the heart in all our profeſſions and ſervices, more than our external obedience. That his people may preſent to him this inward ſpiritual homage, he hath graciouſly promiſed, that he will give them, "a new heart and put his ſpirit within them; and cauſe them to walk in his ſtatutes, and write his law upon their hearts." The prayer of the heart only is accepted. It is the aſpirations of a pious ſoul. The ſacrifice, which God accepts, is a ſincere, contrite ſpirit. "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." The prayer of Hannah at the temple, met with gracious acceptance, tho' it was only the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her ſervent mind, for her voice was not heard. The Phariſee at the ſame place, had not the ſpirit of prayer. His prayer aroſe not, from a ſenſe of ſpiritual want. But the prayer of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican was accepted, becauſe it was the ſincere deſire of a ſoul, humbled before God, by a ſenſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, believing in the mercy and juſtice of God. We muſt therefore draw nigh to God with the heart, would we hope for audience and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Praying always with all prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance." Theſe remarks reſpecting the temper and ſtate of the mind, in the exerciſes of religion apply to every duty and ſervice, which we offer to God. Our prayers, our preaching, and hearing, and attendance on ordinances, muſt be done ſpiritually, would we hope for acceptance, with a holy God, the ſearcher of hearts. The accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028999_0079_0FDDD07994D5A610"/>worſhipper, can with humble confidence, with St. Paul, appeal to him, ſaying, "God is my witneſs, whom I ſerve with my ſpirit, in the goſpel of his ſon." "He," ſays our Lord, "who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them," who receives them into his heart and practiſes them in his life, "is like a wiſe man who built his houſe upon a rock." Our ſongs of praiſe muſt be ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual as well as vocal. "Singing and making melod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in your heart unto the Lord." The ſacraments we are to attend upon, and receive with devotion of ſoul. As baptiſm is an outward ſign of inward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it requires the worſhip of the ſpirit, the graces of faith, ſincerity and purity, in him who dedicates himſelf, or his offspring to God, in that ordinance. And in our attendance on the Lord's ſupper, we are to examine ourſelves, whether our hearts are right with God, and to know our ſpiritual ſtate, that we may diſcern the Lord's body, and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed on him, the bread of life and the water of life.</p>
            <p>THUS all parts of public worſhip are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with our ſpirits, as unto the Lord. By what has been ſaid, on the ſpirituality of devotion, let none imagine that a perſonal attendance and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are not required. For we are to ſerve God with our bodies, as well as our ſpirits. This is evident from the nature of the ſeveral branches of inſtituted worſhip, as well as the expreſs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcripture. From the preaching of the word, —public prayer and praiſe, and the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and the inſtitution of the ſabbath for the public worſhip of God, our perſonal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and homage, are made neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028999_0080_0FDDD07B05383650"/>
OUR worſhip of God, muſt be performed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his word, or agreeably to his appointment. As all parts of the ſacred tabernacle, were to be made after the pattern which was ſhewn to Moſes on the Mount, ſo all parts of our religious worſhip, both as to the diſpoſition of heart, and external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, muſt be according to thoſe rules and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which God hath given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in his word. Any deviation from them is ſinful and idolatrous. So far as we depart from the perfect rule given for our direction, our worſhip degenerates into human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and idolatry. Perſons are in danger of this ſin, who diſregard the divine directions, in faith, in manners, and modes of worſhip, and follow the dictates of their own fancy and impulſes. Having no certain guide, they wander in endleſs mazes of error. And altho' ſuch evil-worſhippers may be ſincere in their devotions, their ſincerity will not ſanctify their errors, or excuſe their diſobedience to the divine will. And the reaſon is, that the truth may be found, if men are diſpoſed with ſincere and unprejudiced minds to enquire after it. "If any man," ſays our Lord, "will do his will," in truth and ſincerity, ſo far as he already knows the will of God, "he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether it be of men." A mind open to conviction, and impartially enquiring after truth, will not be in danger of embracing any eſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial errors.</p>
            <p>PERSONS are ſometimes ſincere and zealous in great errors; and their ſincerity and zeal will not excuſe them from blame and puniſhment. The worſhippers of falſe gods were zealous and ſincere in their idolatrous practices. How fervent were the worſhippers of Baal in calling upon their imaginary gods? and the people of Epheſus, in the worſhip of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028999_0081_0FDDD0811D45BA88"/>their great goddeſs Diana? But could their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity extenuate the crime of worſhipping and ſerving a creature, inſtead of the Creator? The Iſraelites were ſincere, in the worſhip of the golden calf in the wilderneſs; but heavy judgments fell upon them for their idolatry. The worſhippers of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, crucifixes, ſaints and angels, in the church of Rome, are ſincere and devout, in the adoration of them; but God hath rejected them for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious idolatry. "They ſay they are jews, and are not, but are of the ſynagogue of Satan." Paul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his converſion was ſincere, in his zealous oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt, and perſecution of his diſciples; but when his prejudices were removed and his mind opened to embrace the truth, he condemned himſelf as having done moſt wickedly, as a "blaſphemer and injurious."</p>
            <p>THO' pagan idolaters were ſincere in their worſhip of falſe gods, yet the divine ſpirit hath aſſured us, that "the things which the gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to devils and not to God." Hence we infer the greatneſs of that moral diſorder, which ſin hath brought upon mankind, which ſo awfully dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the reaſon, perverts the judgement, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the paſſions, that without divine aſſiſtance, we know not our duty, and the neceſſity of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to enlighten our darkened minds, and of effectual grace, to overcome the oppoſition of our hearts to the pure knowledge of God, and that ſpiritual worſhip and ſervice, which is ſuitable to his holy perfections and will. We come,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To an explanation of the penalty of this divine law, "viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:028999_0082_0FDDD08297B077E8"/>
SOME would be ready to conclude that this ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law is an impeachment of juſtice, and inconſiſtent with the declaration of God by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, (Ezekiel xviii, 20.) "The ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither ſhall the father bear the iniquity of the ſon, the righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him." Tho' there is a ſeeming oppoſition here, a few conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may ſerve to reconcile them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE evils threatened to the children of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are not ſpiritual but temporal calamities or judgements. God would diſplay this token of anger againſt idolatry, in the view of the world, to teach men how great a ſin it is. But tho' temporal judgements were to fall upon the children of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we are,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider, they are the merciful means, by the bleſſing of God, of reforming the children of ſuch tranſgreſſors. For judgements are commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to reform, and turn men to righteouſneſs, or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD calls to account the children of idolaters, for their own ſins; which juſtice in God, is in part cauſed by the ſins of their fathers; ſo that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not puniſhed for their fathers' ſins, but their own; which however, would not have been ſo ſeverely puniſhed with temporal judgements, had not their fathers tranſgreſſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. CHILDREN being part of the parents in their tranſgreſſion, it is proper that they ſhould feel the effects of their iniquities. As when a rebel againſt his country forfeits his life, his children neceſſarily partake in the puniſhment, by the loſs of honor
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028999_0083_0FDDD08480EAC978"/>and eſtate. It is alſo agreeable to the law of nature, that the children ſhould partake of the effects, of the virtues or vices of their parents. Thus the children of temperate and virtuous parents, are commonly healthy, honorable and uſeful, in the world, and the children of debauched, intemperate and vicious parents, feel the melancholy effects of their parents' crimes. And thus good or evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, by a law of our nature, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the juſtice of providence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE threatning implies, that the children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves practice the evil ways of their fathers, and thus fill up the meaſure of their own, and their fathers' ſins, and ripen themſelves for judgement. Thus our Lord pronounces the judgements of heaven upon that generation, who walked in the evil ways of their fathers, who had killed the prophets; and ſays that of them, ſhould be required the innocent blood which had been ſhed, for ages paſt, becauſe they inherited the murderous tempers of their fathers. Thus awful denunciations of judgements, are threatened to reſtrain men from ſin, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the evil conſequences to follow, not only on themſelves but on their unborn poſterity, they may have powerful motives of all kinds to fear God, and keep his commandments. I will add, that there is an exemption from the threatning to thoſe children of vicious parents, who ſnun their fathers' crimes, and obſerve God's law. (Ezeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> xviii, 14.) "If he begat a ſon that ſeeth all his fathers' ſins, which he hath done, and conſidereth them, and doth not ſuch like,—he ſhall not die for the iniquity of his father, he ſhall ſurely live."</p>
            <p>THE laſt thing to be conſidered is, the motives to envite us, to the true and acceptable worſhip of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028999_0084_0FDDD08970AB07B8"/>God, contained in the promiſe, "ſhewing mercy to thouſands of them that love me, and keep my commandments." Here we may notice the great extent of the mercy of God, beyond his juſtice. "Viſiting iniquity to the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—but ſhewing mercy to thouſands, to the lateſt generations of them that love God and keep his commandments."</p>
            <p>THIS gracious promiſe gives an inviting motive to parents, to maintain the knowledge and worſhip of their God and ſaviour in their own hearts, and families, and places where they dwell. God will reward their pious zeal, with bleſſings temporal and eternal. From pious families, his providence uſually takes thoſe who are honored with diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſefulneſs in the world. While the poſterity of accurſed Cain periſhed in the flood, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents of an undutiful Ham, and of a profane Eſau, felt the effects of their fathers impieties, the deſcendents of pious Abraham, of venerable Jacob, and holy Job, were diſtinguiſhed with the bleſſings of heaven. The ſame conduct, a juſt and merciful God, appears to manifeſt towards the people and families of the earth, at the preſent day. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of the wicked and idolatrous nations and fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies, ſtill ſuffer his frowns; and the poſterity of the people and families, who maintained his pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and laws, in ages paſt, are ſtill bleſſed. With gratitude to a promiſe-performing-God, ſuffer me to mention, the apparent fulfilment of this gracious promiſe to us, the deſcendents of the pious ſettlers, of ſome of theſe ſtates, who loved God, and kept his holy commandments. Has not God ſhewed mercy, ſirs, to us, unparalled in the hiſtory of the world, even as he ſhewed mercy to the deſcendents of Iſrael? Like them, our fathers received the law
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028999_0085_0FDDD08AC4322C48"/>in this wilderneſs, (when they were few in number and ſtrangers in the land) not from Mount Sinai, but from Mount Zion, and the uncorrupted word of God. Here they erected the true church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pattern of the goſpel, and ſincerity kept the ordinances and commandments of their God. Let us with unfeigned gratitude, acknowledge the kindneſs of God to them, and to us their degener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate poſterity, ſince God hath ſhewed us ſuch ſignal mercies in things temporal and ſpiritual. At the ſame time a holy fear becomes us, leſt by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and crimes—our ſpiritual idolatry—our neglect, and contempt of the word, worſhip, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and commandments of God, our Saviour, we forfeit the favorable protection of our God, and the God of our fathers, and ripen ourſelves for an aggravated condemnation.</p>
            <p>THUS having conſidered the nature of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and homage which God requires of us, and which our duty, our intereſt and felicity, invite us to render to him, I ſhall conclude with a few</p>
            <div type="reflections">
               <head>REFLECTIONS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE learn the great evil and guilt of all kinds of idolatry. Let us guard againſt every ſpecies of this ſin, which is the greateſt of evils, and worſhip and love and ſerve God in truth and ſincerity. Let us not, by idolizing ourſelves, or the deareſt earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments, provoke the dreadful vengeance of a jealous God. He is pleaſed to receive his people into the bonds of a marriage covenant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that we cleave to him in love, loyalty and obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:028999_0086_0FDDD08C3A9B0188"/>
THEY provoke God to jealouſy and wrath, who diſregard his firſt and great command, and love him not with all the heart; but place their beſt love and delight, on the periſhable goods and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this life, and idolize the creatures. Let us, ſirs, guard againſt this ſpiritual idolatry, nor ſuffer our ſouls to reſt in the periſhable goods of this world. In this enlightened age, we may not be in great danger of the <hi>groſs</hi> idolatry of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping images; yet are not multitudes really guilty of ſpiritual idolatry, in the ſight of God? Let us ſhun the ſin of that <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> or love of riches, which is <hi>idolatry.</hi> "For the love of money, for its own ſake, is the root of all evil." If that is an idol upon which our love and dependence are placed, then all they are idolaters, who truſt in uncertain riches, and deſerve no better treaſure than gold and ſilver; "who ſay to the gold thou art my hope, and to the fine gold, thou art my confidence." A perſon is as guilty of idolatry, in the ſight of God, who puts his truſt in bags of gold and ſilver, as he would be, ſhould he caſt them into an image, and worſhip it.</p>
               <p>THEY whoſe chief happineſs is in the gratification of animal and ſenſual appetites and luſts, "whoſe God is their belly, who mind earthly things," are criminal idolaters. All they whoſe ſupreme happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts in houſes, and lands, goods and flock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. LET our ſubject admoniſh us, of the neceſſity of a daily and ſerious examination of the principle of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028999_0087_0FDDD0915BC0A128"/>our profeſſions and obedience. Is the love of God the great and powerful principle of action? Do we love him for his whole revealed character, as a God of holineſs and juſtice, as well as goodneſs; ſtriving to be conformed to him in theſe perfections, to be holy and merciful as our almighty father in heaven? Does our love to God produce its genuine good fruits of loyalty and obedience, a willing, cheerful, perſevering and univerſal obedience? God has promiſed bleſſedneſs to them who <hi>love him</hi> and <hi>keep his commandments.</hi> And to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do them, is the proof of our love. If we have not this evidence, we have not the love of God reigning in us; but fall under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of idolatrous lovers of this world, of ſin, and lovers of ourſelves, more than lovers of God.</p>
               <p>BUT happy is the man whoſe heart condemns him not, in this enquiry. Who knows he loves God with all his heart, and whoſe hope and truſt and joy the Lord is. Who with the diſciple of Jeſus, can appeal to the ſearcher of all hearts, in truth and ſincerity, ſaying, "Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee." And with the royal pſalmiſt, "whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is nothing upon earth, that I deſire beſides thee? As the heart panteth after the water-brook, ſo panteth my ſoul, after thee, O God."</p>
               <p n="3">3. WE infer that it is the duty of all men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. It is a dictate of the law of nature, and a precept of revelation. Even wicked men, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the public ſhorſhip of God, may obtain the grace of converſion. The goſpel was firſt preached to unregenerate men, and to thoſe of this diſcription it is ſtill to be preached, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> it is their duty to attend and hear, as for their lives. "For

               <p n="4">4. OUR ſubject ſhould ſerve to excite our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, that he hath not ſuffered us to grope and periſh in the darkneſs of paganiſm; but hath cauſed the light of the goſpel to ſhine upon us. "Let us look to the rock, whence we were hewn, and to the hole of the pit, whence we were digged." Let us open our eyes with gratitude and joy, to the "day-ſpring from on high which hath viſited us, who once ſat in darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death, without God and without hope in the world." O may we bring forth the fruits of praiſe and love, to the honor and glory of him who hath redeemed us.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, let us cultivate an habitual ſenſe of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God; whoſe preſence, providence and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and goodneſs continually ſurround us. And eſpecially, in all our ſolemn approaches to God in ordinances, let no atheiſtical thoughts intrude upon our devotion. In all our attendance upon the ſacred inſtitutions of God's worſhip, in our cloſet, in our families, and in the houſe of God, may the life and power of religion, reign in all our hearts, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our lives. And through the rich grace of our divine Saviour may we obtain that mercy, which is promiſed to them, who love God and keep his commandments.</p>

            <p>THIS ſolemn precept is connected with the two preceding, and teaches us, that we ſhould ever habituate ourſelves to think and ſpeak of God, with the profoundeſt reverence and ſubmiſſion: and that we ſhould feel the ſame ſacred awe on our minds, in receiving the notices of his will, revealed to us by his word, his works, his ordinances and providences, and by his holy ſpirit.</p>
            <p>As the ſecond precept teaches us the way and manner, in which it is the will of God that we ſhould worſhip him, <hi>this</hi> ſhews us, that our worſhip muſt be paid with that profound reverence and love, which are due from creatures to their creator, in all their tranſactions with him; and that we alſo have a ſolemn ſenſe of obligations to God, and accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to him in all our intercourſe with mankind. The ſanction annexed to this precept, reſtraining men from an irreverent uſe of the name of God, ſhould impreſs all minds with holy caution and fear,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028999_0090_0FDDD09A01D2EF28"/>left at any time, they treat the name of God, and all that is comprehended in his name, with irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and profanity. <hi>"For the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs, that taketh his name in vain."</hi> All pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs is forbidden, by the prohibition of taking God's name in vain. Let us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. INQUIRE what it is to profane the name of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SHEW the evil and guilt of this ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE oppoſite virtues.</p>
            <p>IN the illuſtration of the firſt diviſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it will be proper to explain, what is meant by the <hi>name</hi> of God, and what it is to profane his name.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>name</hi> of God, is frequently uſed in the ſcriptures for God himſelf, and is expreſſive of his abſolute exiſtence, or his being and perfections. "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; that is, the glory which is due to him as God. O magnify the Lord with me, let us exalt his name together. Then began men to call on the name of the Lord. The Lord proclaimed the name of the Lord. I am the Lord, that is my name. I will ſanctify my name, and make my holy name known in the midſt of my people." Perhaps the general phraſe <hi>name,</hi> may be uſed for God, becauſe no particular word, can convey an adequate idea, of his glorious and incomprehenſible nature.</p>
            <p>IT is ſometimes uſed to convey to us, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what he is pleaſed to reveal of himſelf, ſo far as may be neceſſary to regulate our conceptions
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028999_0091_0FDDD09C0BB64E68"/>of his moſt holy nature and will, and of our duty. At the ſecond writing of the law, the Moſt High ſaid, "I will proclaim the name of the Lord,— I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious;—and the Lord proclaimed his name, the Lord God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, long ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, and forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſſion and ſin, and that will by no means clear the guilty." When God commiſſioned Moſes to deliver Iſrael from the houſe of bondage, he called himſelf by the comprehenſive names, <hi>I am,</hi> and <hi>I am, that I am;</hi> which titles are moſt expreſſive of his abſolute being and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is uſed for the infinite greatneſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God: "In Judah God is known, his name is great in Iſrael." For his glorious perfections diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the works of creation and providence: "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!" For the purpoſes of his grace and mercy towards mankind by Jeſus Chriſt: "I have, ſays our Lord, manifeſted thy name, to the men, which thou gaveſt me out of the world." For the goſpel; of Saint Paul, it is ſaid; "he is a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen veſſel to bear my name among the Gentiles." For the promiſes of grace, to believers: "let them that love thy name be joyful in thee." For the worſhip of God, and the divine ordinances: "I purpoſe, ſays Solomon, to build an houſe unto the name of the Lord my God." And to his father David, God had ſaid; "thy ſon, whom I ſhall ſet upon thy throne, he ſhall build an houſe to my name:" or for my worſhip, in prayer and praiſe, and in reading and hearing my word.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>name</hi> of the Lord, is uſed for the Lord himſelf, and ſignifies all that God is, and all thoſe things which he is pleaſed to reveal to us, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>To profane, or take in vain the name of God, is to think or ſpeak of God irreverently, or to treat his holy names or titles, his works, his word, his ordinances and providences, with levity. As man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are in danger of this ſin, by reaſon of the temptations of a depraved nature, of a profane world, and the great enemy of God and our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in danger of tranſgreſſing this holy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either in our thoughts, our ſpeech or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and thereby provoking and meriting the wrath and vengeance of a holy God; we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in what inſtances and circumſtances particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the name of God is profaned. It is profaned,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN God is mentioned with levity, irrev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence or needleſsly in common diſcourſe. "Holy and reverend is his name." God is to be had in reverence by his creatures, and we ſhould ever think and ſpeak of him, with utmoſt ſeriouſneſs, and the profoundeſt reſpect. It is a melancholy evidence of the depravity of human nature, and of the alieanation of the heart from God, that among certain claſſes of people, the name of God, is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemiouſly profaned, in their common and idle diſcourſe. Multitudes impiouſly preſume to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to God, and ſwear by him who liveth forever, to the truth of their inconſiderate and paſſionate converſation.</p>
            <p>A reverence of the name of God is not uſually loſt at once: but the vice of profaneneſs is gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted, until it becomes a confirmed habit. An idea of the majeſty, holineſs and juſtice of God,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028999_0093_0FDDD09EF7423998"/>received by the works and word of God, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon the conſcience, naturally inſpires the mind, with a ſolemn awe, at the name of God. It is this impreſſion of God on the mind, which guards and reſtrains men from the commiſſion of ſins and tranſgreſſions, which their vicious hearts, would prompt them to commit, could they eraſe from their thoughts, his awful and glorious being and attributes, and a future ſtate of retribution. But perſons by indulging themſelves to ſpeak of God, and ſacred inſtitutions, in a light and airy manner, finally contract a habit, of bold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bluſhing profaneneſs. Againſt this God-provoking crime, this precept of the law, ſolemnly cautions men. "Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain." The name of God is profaned when it is needleſsly mentioned, as well as when uttered in light and trifſing diſcourſe, and on common occaſions. It ought never to be mentioned, except when the occaſion is weighty and ſolemn, and for our own, and the edification of others. To uſe the name of God to confirm or atteſt our trifling diſcourſe, is an act of moſt daring familiarity and impudence: but to uſe it to atteſt a falſehood, is the moſt criminal profaneneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; and unleſs the mercies of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hrough the bleſſed mediator, to penitent profane ſinners, were infinite, ſuch bold tranſgreſſors could not expect forgiveneſs, neither in this world, nor in the world to come. How daring and provoking is it, for an inſignificant mortal, and child of the duſt, to invoke the God of truth, to witneſs to a lie? Againſt the temptations to this awful ſin, the pious prophet Agur prays: "Give me neither poverty, nor rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;—leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:028999_0094_0FDDD1A0B3B40DB0"/>
THAT which makes the vice of proſane ſwearing, more criminal than other ſins, is the remarkable circumſtance, that it is commonly committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a temptation. Other vices have each their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar temptations, to perſuade and impel men to tranſgreſs the laws of God, and of ſociety. But what advantage does the proſane perſon propoſe to himſelf, by this crime? There is neither the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of honor, profit or pleaſure, thoſe great ſprings of action, to induce the ſin. The vice of avarice, has the proſpect of gain and wealth, for its object. Intemperance and lewdneſs; the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſenſual appetite, and fleſhly luſts. Fraud and diſhoneſty; the poſſeſſion of the property of others. Slander and falſehood; the malicious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of revenge. But what temptation can there be, to profane the name of God, or treat with levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the character and attributes, of that high and holy being? It is, as one obſerves, to catch at the devil's naked hook: there is not the bait of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to invite. It is a vice indicative of the deep depravity of the human heart, and of hatred of God. O deteſtable and ruinous fruit of ſin!</p>
            <p>IT is an affront to ſerious men; who are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grieved, to hear the name of their God, whom they fear and love, treated with profanity. It is a violation of the laws of decency and good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and a vice beneath the character of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and is moſtly to be found among the lower claſſes. It would be happy for the peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſociety, and the benefit of the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were this ſhocking vice univerſally baniſhed from converſation. That perſon muſt be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to virtue, who has not reſolution to reſiſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. It is evident that the profane perſon has little regard for God, when the preſence of any of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028999_0095_0FDD5FE503C3F958"/>men, whom he regards, or fears to diſoblige, will reſtrain him, altho' the knowledge of God's preſence, will not. But every profane perſon is a practical atheiſt: he does not believe in the being or preſence of God, nor the threatnings of his word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD's name is profaned by unlawful oaths, vows and promiſes; and alſo by the violation of lawful ſolemn promiſes and vows. A lawful oath is a religious act, in which is contained the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the exiſtence and preſence of God, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judge, and an appeal to him for the truth of what is ſpoken; and an implicit imprecation of his juſtice upon him who ſhall knowingly utter falſehood. Before lawful courts, it is uſually accompanied with lifting up the hand towards heaven, in a way of ſolemn appeal to God. It is the moſt ſpeedy and ſure method, which human wiſdom can deviſe, to come to the knowledge of facts, in which the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of ſociety is concerned. It proceeds upon the principle, that no perſon will knowingly utter falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; but conſcienciouſly declare the truth, when he thus ſolemnly appeals to God. In ſo ſerious a tranſaction, it becomes a perſon, to cultivate the deepeſt reverence of God, and ſacred regard to truth, leſt by inattention or miſrepreſentation, he pervert juſtice, and draw down upon himſelf, the anger of that dread being, who will not hold him guiltleſs, who ſins by falſehood and perjury. Let a ſolemn caution guard thoſe, who are about to appeal to God, by oath, in any matter.</p>
            <p>IT is a profanation of the name of God, to ſwear or promiſe raſhly, and without due conſideration: as did Herod when, probably heated with wine, he promiſed with an oath, to give to Herodias, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe ſhould aſk. It is a great ſin to make a raſh
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028999_0096_0FDDD0A39E3ACCD0"/>or unlawful vow, but a greater ſin to keep it. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod's oath was fooliſh and criminal; but his crime was greater when to accompliſh it, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red an innocent and holy man. "And the king was ſorry; nevertheleſs for the oath's ſake, and them that ſat at meat with him, he ſent and beheaded John in priſon." The oath or promiſe was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore not binding. The obligations of duty to God and man, ſhould reſtrain men from unlawful vows, or excite them to repentance of them, when made; and to refrain from the performance. The vow of Jephtha alſo was raſh and unlawful: He promiſed more than he had a lawful right to do.</p>
            <p>THE wiſe men of the eaſt, who came to worſhip the new-born Saviour, did right in their non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the promiſe, which the bloody minded Hered, had extorted from them; when inſtead of returning to Jeruſalem, they went into their own country, another way. We have an inſtance of unlawful promiſes, in the men who bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by an oath, that they would neither eat, nor drink, until they had killed Paul. All promiſes or oaths in things unlawful and injurious to others, are not binding: but are diſannuled by a prior and ſuperior law, which obliges us to promiſe and do, only ſuch things as are lawful, and agreeable to the moral law, or to the expreſs will of God. It is the duty of a perſon who has made a raſh or ſinful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or vow, ſincerely to repent thereof before God, and to make reſtitution to men, ſo far as he may have thereby injured any.</p>
            <p>THE inference from theſe remarks is, that unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promiſes and vows, are not to be made, or kept. But when perſons ſolemnly vow or promiſe, things lawful at the time, and afterwards it appears, that
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028999_0097_0FDDD0A6D4D7A5C8"/>the performance will be detrimental to the promiſer, ſtill his ſolemn promiſe is binding. Thus the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous man is deſcribed; "tho' he ſweareth to his own hurt, he changeth not." We may alſo infer that unlawful promiſes extorted by violence or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, are not obligatory.</p>
            <p>A queſtion connected with this laſt obſervation, meets this ſubject; but which may not be ſo eaſy to reſolve, which is; Whether a perſon in captivity, may lawfully promiſe allegiance, to an enemy, in time of war? The ſolution of this queſtion, depends upon the nature and extent of the promiſe, or oath required. If it requires, that he ſhall behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a peaceful and dutiful ſubject of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the civil laws of ſociety; he may lawfully promiſe ſo to do; becauſe there is no human power ſuperior to controul him, and becauſe his perſon is in their hands. To this conduct, the moſt High directs the people of Iſrael in captivity in Babylon. "Seek the peace of the city, whether I have cauſed you to be carried away captives: and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof ye ſhall have peace." But if it is required of him to aſſiſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, in the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the property or lives, of his countrymen and friends; that he may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do: becauſe his obligations to <hi>preſerve</hi> them, are prior and ſuperior, to his obligations to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Neither is it lawful for a perſon to utter a known falſehood, nor to abjure the true religion, for the moſt flattering proſpects of favor or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or even the ſaving of life itſelf: For the moral law of God to men, has infinitely ſuperior ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to any human authority. In ſuch caſes, men muſt obey God, rather than man: and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend to that declaration of our Lord to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, to fear that high and holy being, who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:028999_0098_0FDDD0A8008C3A70"/>
LAWFUL promiſes and vows are ſuch as are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the revealed will of God; and are ſacredly binding: unlawful promiſes and vows, are ſuch as are contrary thereto, and are not binding.</p>
            <p>AN objection, ſome ſuppoſe, is found againſt oaths in general, in the declaration of our Saviour, the ſupreme lawgiver of the chriſtian church, in his expoſition of this precept, Mathew fifth. "Again ye have heard, that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thyſelf, but ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto the Lord thine oaths. But I ſay unto you ſwear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth for it is his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool; neither by Jeruſalem, for it is the city of the great King.</p>
            <p>NEITHER ſhalt thou ſwear by thy head, becauſe thou canſt not make one hair white or black.</p>
            <p>BUT let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil."</p>
            <p>Two things are obſervable in thoſe words: firſt, that profane ſwearing, was a faſhionable vice among the Jews; and ſecondly, the ſwearing here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was not ſolemn oaths, before a lawful judge or court. That the vice of profane ſwearing, is what our Lord here condemns, appears from the nature and objects of the oaths, it was ſwearing by heaven, by Jeruſalem, by the earth, by the head, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably by the members of the body, as by the eyes and the like, as is common among the profane lower claſſes of people, at this day. And altho' the name of God, was not mentioned in thoſe common and vulgar oaths; yet our Lord aſſures us, that this
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028999_0099_0FDDD0A976826C08"/>ſacred precept of the law, is tranſgreſſed by them; ſince there is implied in them, an appeal to God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and all its limbs and members. By his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures God makes himſelf known, and his preſence is in, and with them. To ſwear by them, is to ſwear by the Creator; according to that rule, "when men ſwear, they ſwear by the greater."</p>
            <p>OUR Lord does not condemn lawful oaths; but condemns the corrupt doctrine of the Scribes and Phariſees, who taught that it was not unlawful to ſwear by creatures, provided the name of God was not mentioned. All petty oaths, ſo called, as when perſons in common diſcourſe exclaim, Lord, Chriſt, by faith, conſcience, or ſalvation; tho' ſeemingly modeſt oaths, yet are condemned, as profaning God's name; ſince all creatures and properties of creatures, are his. Againſt this ſinful and indecent cuſtom, the command of Chriſt is given, "ſwear not at all." That the oaths condemned, were ſuch as were mixed in common converſation, appears from their being mentioned as mingled with their daily communication. "Let your communication be yea, and nay." The affirmation of yes, and no, is ſufficient in common converſation. A ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth and duty makes any ſtronger declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or appeals to God, or creatures, unneceſſary and ſinful. The perſon who interlards his diſcourſe, with profane exclamations and oaths, to gain belief, evidences that he has not a regard to truth, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affirmations; and that he has a ſuſpicion in his own breaſt, that he ought not to be believed; and by ſwearing impeaches his own veracity. And indeed you can have no confidence in his regard to truth, ſince by profane ſwearing, he ſhews that he
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028999_0100_0FDDD0AEEAD32A50"/>has no regard to the God of truth, and the avenger of falſehood.</p>
            <p>THIS vice, condemned by our Lord, is alſo condemned by the apoſtle James: "But above all things, my brethren, ſwear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay." Theſe words are nearly a repetition of the ſentence delivered by our Lord, already mentioned. The apoſtle adds, "leſt ye ſall into condemnation." The condemnation alluded to, is the awful penalty of this precept: "the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs."</p>
            <p>FROM an erroneous interpretation of theſe texts, ſome ſects of chriſtians, have altogether refuſed to take an oath, in civil courts. That oaths are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſometimes neceſſary, appears not inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with the precepts of the moral law; but are agreeable to the will of God, revealed in both the old and new teſtament.</p>
            <p>BY the judicial law, which God gave to Iſrael at Sinai, it was allowed, to a perſon, in ſome caſes, ſuſpected of a crime, to clear himſelf by a ſolemn oath. God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ondeſcended to give a promiſe to the patriarch Abraham, and to confirm it by an oath; that by theſe two immutable witneſſes, the promiſe and oath, he, and all belivers might have ſtrong conſolation, in the certain expectation of the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the divine promiſes. We here ſee that the nature and deſign of an oath, is to confirm the truth ſpoken; and as it concerns the Deity, the certainty of the fulfilment of the things promiſed. It was the will of God, that the church of Iſrael, ſhould ratify their covenant with him by an oath. "And thou
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028999_0101_0FDDD0B0556059E0"/>ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth in truth, in judgment, and in righteouſneſs."</p>
            <p>RESPECTING the chriſtian's duty, in this ſolemn act, the apoſtle ſays, Hebrews ſixth, "For men verily ſwear by the greater; and an oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, is to them an end of all ſtrife." Such being the nature and ſalutary effects of a ſolemn oath,—to diſcover truth,—to clear the innocent— to convict the guilty, and to put a ſtop to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of unhappy contentions; the chriſtian, who rightly knows his duty, will not refuſe it, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by lawful authority. But it is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that the frequent repetition of oaths, tends to leſſen their ſolemnity, and defeat the good end of their inſtitution; and that it is but too common to adminiſter, and take them, without due conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>GOD's name is wickedly profaned, when perſons wiſh evil and deſtruction upon themſelves, or others. Profane ſwearers wiſh awful judgments and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon themſelves; as tho' they accuſed God of injuſtice, in delaying to execute vengeance upon them; as tho' their damnation lingered. Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful implety! Perſons are liable to the judgment of this law, who wiſh evil in their hearts, to any. "Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart. Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf." Were the golden rule of the goſpel, of wiſhing and doing to others, "as ye would that others ſhould to you," in univerſal practice; all wrath and profaneneſs would be baniſhed, and the bleſſings of chriſtian love and peace abound.</p>

            <p n="1">1. PROFANE ſinners are expoſed to the wrath and judgments of almighty God, both in this life, and in the life to come. They caſt off the fear and love of God, are rebels againſt his holy laws, forfeit the

            <p>AGAINST ſuch proud and impious ſinners, we muſt reaſonably expect, that the dreadful curſes of the law, are pointed, and that "God will not hold them guiltleſs." And tho' thro' the forbearance of God, they may eſcape remarkable judgments in this life, the holy ſcriptures aſſure us, that awful aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yated puniſhments, is reſerved for thern, in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world of wo.

            <p>HUMAN laws cannot reach all the tranſgreſſions of this law: profaneneſs, perjury and blaſphomy, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently eſcape adequate puniſhment in this world. Laws are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But one ſalutary end of the inſtitution of majiſtracy, is the ſuppreſſion of the crimes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs: and much, no doubt, could be done, to diſcountenance this deteſtable vice, moſt injurious to ſociety, were majiſtrates in general, inſpired with greater zeal for God, and fortitude in duty.
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028999_0106_0FDDD0C1790751C8"/>It is however to be acknowledged, with gratitude to heaven, that in this part of the country, we are bleſſed with many reſpectable characters of this hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable profeſſion, who ſupport the dignity of their office; who are a terror to evil doers, and of whom, profane ſinners ſtand in awe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. PROFANENESS is a vice, ruinous to the morals of a people. It is almoſt univerſally attended with other immoralities. The profane ſwearer, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of promiſes and of the truth; he is falſe, proud, heady and contentious. He ſeeks his own intereſt or pleaſure, as his chief good, and ſacrifices the intereſts and happineſs of men, when opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities offer, to himſelf. He ſpeaks evil of dignities, and ſets his mouth againſt heaven: for having caſt off the fear of God, he regards no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> man. And what bond can reſtrain him, who boldly defies the laws of God and of ſociety? What principle has he at heart, impeling him to the cultivation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtues? His example is hurtful and pernicious. He is a bad father, a bad ſon, a bad maſter, a bad ſervant and a bad ſubject. While treaſon againſt civil government is puniſhed in this life, treaſon againſt God, will be puniſhed in the life to come, by hin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> who will recompence wrath to his enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. PROFANE perſons ſometimes meet with ſome awful ſtroke of divine indignation, in this world, as a puniſhment of this crime, and a prelude to more dreadful puniſhment in the eternal world. As we ſee in the inſtance of a profane Cain, on whom God ſet a mark, as the victim of his juſtice, and doomed him to wnader a vagabond on the earth, ſhunned and deteſted by men. In the profane ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the old world, who mocked at the ſolemn warnings from heaven; until deſolation to the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028999_0107_0FDDD0C209798598"/>uttermoſt came upon them. In the impious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>offers at godlineſs, in the cities of the plain; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by ſtorms of fiery vengeance. In a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Eſau, a hardened Pharaoh, a proud Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer, and a bloody Herod; and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ungodly and profane people of the Jewiſh nation, among whom the vice of profaneneſs reigned; who diſpiſed the prophets of the Lord and divine ordinances, and filled up the meaſure of their crimes by the crucifixion of Jeſus, and impiouſly imprecated the divine vengeance to fall upon them. And upon them, the juſt wrath of God has fallen, from the days of our Saviour and his apoſtles. For this cauſe, the once favoured and fertile land of Judea, now mourns under the curſe of barrenneſs and barbarians; and the people of that nation, have become a "hiſſing and bye word in the earth," and outcaſts among the nations. They are a living evidence to all the earth, of the wrath and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Almighty God, due to all profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and people.</p>
            <p>FOR the crimes condemned by this divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, they were once doomed to long captivity in Babylon, and now to a wandering life of anxiety and wretchedneſs, over the earth. "Seeing ye deſpiſed the oath, by breaking the covenant, ye ſhall not eſcape. Thus ſaith the Lord, as I live, ſurely my oath, that he hath deſpiſed, and my covenant that he hath broken, will I recompence upon his own head, and I will bring him to Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and plead with him there, for his treſpaſſes that he hath treſpaſſed againſt me." This life is a ſtate of trial and retribution to nations. They are pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed or proſpered accordingly as they obſerve the immutable laws of morality and the doctrines of revelation. And the reaſon of this economy is,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028999_0108_0FDDD0C819274520"/>that nations, as ſuch, have no future exiſtence. The ſocial ties, which combine nations, are diſſolved, by death. The righteous Governor of the world, therefore hath eſtabliſhed a rule of conduct towards them, according to their general national character. He hath eſtabliſhed the invariable connection of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional righteouſneſs and proſperity; and of ſin and ruin, agreeable to a ſolemn declaration of the moſt High, applied to all nations, in all ages, recorded in the eighteenth chapter of the prophecy of Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah. In ſome inſtances God has diſplayed in a wonderful manner, the viſible tokens of his favour, towards a righteous and holy nation; and dreadful deſtroying judgments, upon a people ripened for ruin. But the caſe is otherwiſe with individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The righteous man ſometimes ſuffers for his righteouſneſs, and the wicked are proſperous. This has been thought by ſome, an argument againſt the juſtice of providence. And it would be, were there not a future ſtate of retribution, in which the righteous will be gloriouſly recompenced, for their perſeverence in faith and patience in offlic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the profane a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſers of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtly puniſhed.</p>
            <p>BUT the wiſdom of God in his moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, has connected a certain degree of reward to virtue in this life, and of puniſhment to vice; and thus gives to men, by the light of reaſon, a ſure argument, that invariable juſtice governs the world, and that men will receive in the future world, a recompence, according to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. Thus the vice of falſehood is followed with the loſs of credit,—fraud and diſhoneſty, by infamy, —intemperence and ſenſuality, by the entailment of diſeaſes and untimely death,—and profaneneſs by the loſs of influence and reputation, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028999_0109_0FDDD0CA98462450"/>of good men. Theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ens of heaven's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of vice, are expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſive monitions, of greater puniſhments, which a wait hold tranſgreſſors, when they ſhall have finiſhed their ſtate of trial for eternity.</p>
            <p>BUT a pleaſing reward, the anticipation of future happineſs, attends a life of virtue and piety. The righteous man is honored and loved, by the wiſe and good: the profane perſon is feared and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The righteous man has peace of mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in God, tho' his outward condition may be diſtreſſing: the profane perſon has perplexity and trouble of conſcience, tho' his worldly circumſtances may be proſperous.</p>
            <p>PROFANE perſons, tho' apparently bold, are in reality great cowards: they are profane in a calm, but devout in a ſtorm,—they are impious in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity, and mean in adverſity,—they blaſpheme God, but are afraid of men. Their happineſs is in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and not real. Unleſs hardened beyond reproof, they feel at times the dreadful accuſations of an awakened conſcience; and "deſtruction from God is a terror to them" They are believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the proſpect of death, but infidels in health. An impious Belſhazzar profanes the ſacred veſſels of the ſanctuary, in mid-night revelling; but his limbs trembled and ſmote together, at the diſcovery of the divine hand, writing his doom. The ways and works of the profane will not eventually proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The moſt high hath ſaid, "The curſe ſhall enter into the houſe of the thief, and into the houſe of him, that ſweareth falſely by my name." If profane ſinners eſcape temporal judgments, they have reaſon to fear the infliction of judgments more dreadful, even ſpiritual judgments, of hardneſs of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028999_0110_0FDDD0CBF81A1B38"/>heart, and the divine dereliction, placing them even in this life, beyond the calls of mercy and ſalvation, and dooming them to remedileſs deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE imprecations of profane ſinners, and their works are ſometimes retaliated upon them. "As they have done, ſo God hath required them." Or, in the prophetic ſtile of the pſalmiſt, "As he loved curſing, ſo let it come unto him; as he clothed himſelf with curſing, like as a garment, ſo let it come unto his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones, let it be unto him, as the garment that covereth him."</p>
            <p>WITH lively emotions of compaſſion and ſorrow, let us leave the profane tranſgreſſor, to his own conſcience and to God, and enquire,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, what are thoſe virtues and duties, which are oppoſite to the ſins prohibited. The oppoſite of the profanation of God's name, is to reverence or ſanctify it. "Sanctify the Lord of hoſts, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread." Our Lord hath taught us, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanded in this precept, in the firſt petition, of the divinely comprehenſive form of prayer, <hi>"hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy name."</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. IT implies the duty of meditating on God, with reverend and devout exerciſes of heart, and looking to him with humble and adoring importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for all that light and grace which are neceſſary, to our forming juſt and true conceptions, of his adorable character, perfections and will. God is the greateſt and moſt glorious being in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and we ſanctify his name, when we make him the chief object of our thoughts, our ſtudy, and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028999_0111_0FDDD0CD7645E3F0"/>our love. We ſhould meditate on God, as that glorious being, by whoſe power and goodneſs we, and all creatures enjoy, each moment of exiſtence, and on whoſe favor we are to depend, for its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and for all that good which ſhall be needful, to make our future exiſtence, deſirable and happy. It implies that we ſpeak of God, with devout ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of fear and love. That whenever we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his name, his perfections, works and word, that it be always in ſerious diſcourſe, or on ſolemn occaſions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implies that we readily and cheerfully obey the notices of his will. The will of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to our duty, is communicated to us, by rich and plentiful means. The exiſtence, the majeſty, the wiſdom and beneficence of God, are diſplayed in the works of creation and providence; and many of the virtues of morality and righteouſneſs towards men, and of piety and devotion towards God, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable from theſe ſources, and from the divine impreſſions on the natural conſcience; but the ſacred ſcriptures give us more true and exalted conceptions of God, and juſter notions of our condition, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and obligations, than all other means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which heaven hath given to mankind.</p>
            <p>ALTHO' the works of creation proclaim the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the goodneſs of God: yet the ſun, moon and ſtars, do not preach the goſpel, or teach guilty ſinners, the way of their acceptance with a holy God; how he will be worſhipped, or how they may be ſaved from condemnation, and poſſeſs eternal life and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. For theſe luminous and joyful diſcoveries, for want of which, the wiſeſt heathen wandered in darkneſs, perplexed with errors; for theſe diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies we are indebted to divine revelation, emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028999_0112_0FDDD0D318534F68"/>called "the word of God, which can make us wiſe to ſalvation." There we have line upon line, and precept upon precept, to guide us in the paths of peace and holineſs, unto eternal life. We are to receive the bible as a moſt precious meſſage from God, containing the whole duty of man; to read, hear and meditate upon its bleſſed contents, with that ſeriouſneſs, love and devotion which it demands from us; and make it the profitable and pleaſing ſubject of our daily meditation. We ſanctify God in and by his word, when with praverful hearts, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of prejudice, we enquire at thoſe holy oracles, what is truth? and conform our faith and practice wholly to its ſacred precepts. For the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul; and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Jeſus, can make the ſimple wiſe to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE are devoutly to wait on God in all the ways of his appointment, to obtain the ſaving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his grace. The ordinances of the ſabbath, the miniſtration of the goſpel, the ſacraments and prayer, are to be obſerved by us, with ſeriouſneſs, ſolemnity, gratitude and praiſe; imploring the bleſſing of God upon them, to our comfort and ſalvation: for they are inſtrumental means, divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained, for this end. If our hearts are opened to inſtruction, they will be ſanctified to us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our knowledge of God and of duty, to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and confirm our faith in the divine promiſes, and invigorate our hope, and love and zeal; to purify our hearts from ſin, and aſſimulate us to a holy reſemblance of him, who hath called us out of the darkneſs and guilt of our fallen ſtate, into the marvellous light of his ſpiritual and everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE are to ſanctify God, by meditation upon the glorious works of creation and providence, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028999_0113_0FDDD0D511CC3E70"/>adoring him for all the wonderful diſplays of his greatneſs, his wiſdom and goodneſs therein. "His works are marvellous, ſought out by all them, that have pleaſure in them." In the contemplation of the ſtarry heavens, and thoſe works of the almighty which come within the compaſs of our knowledge, the ſerious mind will be filled, with admiration, and the heart warmed with love and reverence of the creator, from whom the hoſts of heaven came, and whoſe adorable perfections are manifeſted in them. We are to reverence God in his providences; by gratitude and praiſe for mercies, for protections and deliverences: to acknowledge his hand in all events which happen to us, humbly ſubmitting to afflictive diſpenſations, as wiſe and juſt and good, and committing ourſelves at all times to his holy keeping.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WE ſanctify the name of God, by ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence of ſin, and confeſſion to God, and a willing and cheerful ſubmiſſion of our ſouls to the method of our ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. The gift of Chriſt to redeem us, is the richeſt gift of heaven to men. "This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners." Thanks be to God for this unſpeakable gift. The Saviour comes to redeem us from ſin, and all our wo, and to raiſe the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obedient, to diſtinguiſhed honors and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in the heavenly world. A proper ſenſe of the mercy of God herein, will excite the pious mind to reverence and adore the divine goodneſs, which remembered us in our low eſtate, and ſent his ſon to ſave us. We are to reverence God, by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened zeal to maintain his pure worſhip and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in oppoſition to errors, from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and "to ſtand faſt in the light and liberty of
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028999_0114_0FDDD0D6908F3260"/>the goſpel; viſiting the temptations of the world, the fleſh and the devil; and ſupporting a lively faith in God our Saviour, which obtains the victory, and overcometh the world."</p>
            <div type="reflections">
               <head>WE will cloſe this ſubject, with a few REFLECTIONS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is matter of grief to good men to hear or ſee the name of God profaned, either in that more reſtrained ſenſe, to which common ſpeech confines the profanation of the name of God or that more extenſive ſenſe, to which the latitude of the precept extends. As a ſubject honors his ſovereign, and a child his father; and are offended when their name and character are abuſed, ſo the faithful ſervant of God, is wounded at the profane ſpeeches, and ungodly lives of ſinners. "I beheld, ſays the pſalmiſt, the tranſgreſſors, and was grieved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they keep not thy law." Their grief ariſes from two cauſes, one is their regard for God, and zeal for his glory; and the other, the dreadful guilt which profane ſinners heap upon themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are preparing for haſtening dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A ſacred zeal for the honor of God, whoſe ordinances were profaned by unlawful traffic, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Lord, to drive from the incloſures of the holy temple, thoſe mercenary ſinners, who had pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted it. A degree of the like pure zeal for God, and the ordinances of the goſpel, inſpires every pious mind. They eſteem the ſabbath a delight, and its ordinances holy and honorable; ſtriving to maintain the beauty of holineſs, in the ſervices of God, and their Saviour. They are edified and pleaſed to ſee others walking in the ordinances and commandments of the Lord, and honoring their
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028999_0115_0FDDD0D80CED5380"/>chriſtian profeſſion, by lives of ſobriety, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and godlineſs. They are grieved to ſee the houſe and ordinances of God neglected, and his name prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d, by the unhallowed lips and lives of men. This regard to divine ordinances is, ſirs, a teſt of your love and loyalty to God. If you are the friends of God, you will honor his inſtitutions, and by your good example, will ſtrive to have all men glorify your father in heaven. Oppreſſed with a diſtreſſing ſeige in Jeruſalem, a pious Hezekiah, was more grieved at the blaſphemous ſpeeches of the enemy, againſt God, than any other calamity. The honor of God was dear to him. It is a ſure evidence of a child of God, to be troubled at the diſhonor which ſin does to God, eſpecially the ſin of profaning his name, his worſhip, his word, his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the bounties of his providence.— Have you this filial temper? Is the honour of God, your heavenly father, near your heart? When you behold the tranſgreſſors, the profane, the intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, the irreligious and immoral, are you grieved, becauſe they tranſgreſs the good and holy laws of your God? Do you ſincerely pity them, and by all prudent ways, endeavour to reclaim them to virtue, and to God? Remember for your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that he that converteth a ſoul, from the error of his ways, ſhall ſave from death, and hide a multitude of ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS ſubject ſounds a dreadful alarm to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane finners. "God will not hold them guiltleſs." The wrath of God, is now revealed from heaven, in terrible accents, in the curſes of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>CURSING and ſwearing is emphatically called the language of hell.

By the dreadful increaſe of this ſin, the land mourneth. Multitudes of the riſing generation liſp the language of profanity. They take it by imitation from their ſuperiors in age. How melancholy the thought, that in any inſtances, children catch this vice from their parents. That thoſe who are in the place of God, to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to teach them to reverence the name and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, yet do by their example, teach them to profane his name. O ye profane parents, will it alleviate your future torments, that you have brought your children, and others to that world of miſery? The guilt and puniſhment of your own ſins, and the ſins of others, will lie dreadfully upon you, an inſupportable weight, ſinking you down in the gulf of eternal errors. A holy God, provoked by this heaven-daring impiety, has threatened, that he will cauſe his fury to come, to take vengeance. Will profane ſinners provoke the Lord to wrath? Are
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028999_0117_0FDDD0DEB9B3CA20"/>they ſtronger than he? An alarming conſideration, attends this vice, which is, that it hardens the heart, and fortifies it againſt conviction of the truth, and thus prevents the ſinners ſalvation, and ſeals his dreadful doom.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, my brethren, let us habituate our minds to a ſolemn reverence of God.

            <p n="1">I. THE ſabbath was inſtituted by Jehovah, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the finiſhing the glorious works of creation. In the ſecond chapter of Geneſis, its original inſtitution is recorded. "God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it; becauſe that in it, he had reſted from all his works, which God created and made."</p>
            <p>ADAM and Eve were created on the ſixth day, and God appointed the ſucceeding ſeventh day, as a day of holy reſt, and religious ſolemnity and joy. God bleſſed and ſanctitied the ſabbath. It was made for man's edification and comfort in God. It was firſt kept by our innocent primeval parents in Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: The holy angels aſſiſting, and uniting with them, in the celebration of the praiſes of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creator. And what a ſolemn joyful day to them, who but the day before, came from nothing
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028999_0120_0FDDD0E9486B0780"/>into exiſtence, perfect in ſtature, and in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with hearts that beat reſponſive, in wonder, gratitude and love to God, for all his glory and goodneſs, diſplayed around them, and upon them! The ſun has never roſe upon ſuch a happy pair. In all the charms of innocence, and blooming youth and beauty, on that ſacred morning, they beheld for the firſt time, with raptures of holy joy, light dawning in the eaſt, and the ſun ariſing mild and glorious; and their new formed tongues broke forth in exclamations and ſongs of praiſe to their Creator. All things were new to them, and excited their profoundeſt, devout admiration and love. They ſaw and adored the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, in their own creation, and in all his ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous works on the earth and heavens. The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial creation, ſeemed to them to confeſs God, as its author, in ſilent, but expreſſive language. And the living creatures, birds and beaſts, pleaſed with their new exiſtence, praiſed God in various harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious notes and ſounds. And Adam was as the prieſt of creation, to praiſe God, for them. The holy angels united with our firſt parents, in the celebration of the high praiſes of God, for all his wonderful works of power and goodneſs, on that holy day. Then thoſe morning ſtars, the ſons of God, ſang together, and ſhouted for joy.</p>
            <p>THE moſt high having ſanctified the day, as a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of religious ſolemnity and ſacred joy, probably on the firſt ſabbath, condeſcended to give to the parents of mankind, ſome ſpecial tokens of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Paradiſe, and directions for the obſervance of the day, for their edification and comfort, and his own glory. Never was a ſabbath ſo devoutly and joyfully obſerved: For man was then but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower than the angels in intelligence and dignity,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028999_0121_0FDDD0F011833720"/>poſſeſſing the image of his maker, in holineſs and rectitude. But we have reaſon, alas, to conclude that it was the laſt, as well as firſt ſabbath, which has ever been kept in perfect purity, innocency and happineſs. O ye highly favored, yet unhappy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the human race, how ſoon, thro' the frailty of your nature, and the ſubtle enmity of the foe of God and man, too ſoon, did ye looſe the crown of innocency, and fall as Lucifer, ſon of the morning. But if the earthly paradiſe was loſt by the firſt Adam, yet bleſſed be God, a celeſtial paradiſe is found, by the ſecond Adam, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the fallen ſons of men are now invited to enter its bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and immortal bowers.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of the tranſactions of the firſt ages of the world, are ſummarily compriſed in a few pages, by Moſes, the inſpired hiſtorian, &amp; thro' the long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of two thouſand five hundred years, from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to the deliverence from Egypt, there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention of the ſabbath. But we have reaſon to conclude that it was obſerved agreeably to the original inſtitution, by pious patriarchs and the church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much interruption, to that time. Adam, no doubt, taught his children to keep it. There is an intimation that Cain and Abel worſhipped God by ſacrifice, on that day. It is mentioned that in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time,</hi> they brought an offering unto the Lord: or as it may be tranſlated, <hi>at the end of the days,</hi> that is on the ſabbath. The ancient ſaints and patriarchs publicly worſhipped God, and as to the manner and ſeaſon, no doubt, agreeably to the divine direction. And that time was the ſabbath, which God took care early to ordain, as a bleſſed mean of preſerving the knowledge of the true God, and original reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:028999_0122_0FDDD0F183B39608"/>
IT is evident that the ſabbath was known and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before the delivery of the law at Sinai. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of it ſoon after Iſrael's leaving Egypt, as a thing known to them. "To-morrow is the reſt of the holy ſabbath unto the Lord,—ſo the people reſted on the ſeventh day." This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nth day in ſucceſſion from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Egypt, and that day might happen on the ſabbath, or elſe the ſabbath was re-inſtituted, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that great deliverance. Altho' in the text the reaſon given for the obſervance of the ſabbath, is God's reſting from his works, the ſeventh day, yet in Deuteronomy, in which the decalogue is repeated, another reaſon is given, which was the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverance which God wrought for the people of Iſrael, in their redemption from Egypt. "Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the ſabbath day to ſanctify it,—and remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God, brought thee out thence, thro' a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched out arm; <hi>therefore</hi> the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the ſabbath day." The ſabbath was originally, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to commemorate the work of creation; but here to commemorate the redemption of the church of God, from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Egypt; figurative of our redemption from ſin: and poſſibly the day was changed from the ſeventh, to the day of that deliverance. "The Lord bleſſed the ſabbath day and ſanctified it." It is not ſaid that the ſeventh, but the <hi>ſabbath day</hi> was bleſſed and ſanctified. And which day of the week this ſhall be, depends upon the poſitive will of him who is Lord of the ſabbath. The moral obligation of the law remains unalterable, but the particular day is a poſitive inſtitution, and therefore might be changed, and ſome other day inſtituted, in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028999_0123_0FDDD0F84D92F5D8"/>of ſome great deliverance, as that of the church of Iſrael from Egypt.</p>
            <p>THIS was ſo wonderful an event as it reſpected the church and the world, that God commanded them to alter the beginning of their civil year in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it. And with equal propriety might the day of the ſabbath be altered; and that without diſannulling the commemoration of the works of creation. It is called <hi>ſabbath,</hi> which ſignifies a holy reſt, not only a ceſſation from ſecular buſineſs, but a ceaſing from the ſervitude of ſin; and ſpending the day in the active ſervice of God, and the duties of religion. It is a day which God has in a ſpecial manner bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſanctified, for religious purpoſes. It is to be ſanctified by us, or kept holy, becauſe it is a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the heavenly reſt; and is given as a pledge of the holy and everlaſting ſabbath of reſt, in the heavenly world. There were other days of religious feſtival appointed to be obſerved by the Jewiſh church, which are ſometimes called ſabbaths, as the paſſover, in commemoration of their deliverance from Egypt, and typical of our redemption, by Jeſus Chriſt, the lamb of God, by whoſe blood we are ſaved from wrath to come:—the feaſt of taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, in remembrance of the miraculous preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the church in the wilderneſs; and the annual days of atonement for ſin. There was alſo the ſabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical year: for every ſeventh year the land lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled. There was neither ſowing, nor harveſting that year. God gave therein, conſtant proof of his ſpecial ſuperintending providence over his church, and taught them their dependence. The great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the ground, during the ſix preceeding years, afforded an abundant ſupply for the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>THE religious obſervance of the ſabbath, or a
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028999_0124_0FDDD0F9C9A1A320"/>ſeventh part of time, is both a moral and poſitive law. That it is a moral law, or a law neceſſarily reſulting from the reaſon and fitneſs of things, appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN its being given with the other precepts of the law, all of which are of a moral kind. It was given by Jehovah with utmoſt ſolemnity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed on ſtone as a perpetual law. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial laws were repealed on their accompliſhment by Jeſus Chriſt. They had reſpect to him and to the goſpel church, and therefore vaniſhed when they had accompliſhed the end of their inſtitution. But the weekly ſabbath remains in force, becauſe it is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of the heavenly reſt. It was not therefore aboliſhed by the goſpel diſpenſation, as the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial laws were. As theſe laws and obſervances were ſhadows of good things to come, and were not ſet aſide until thoſe good things did come: ſo the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſabbath, being a ſhadow of the heavenly reſt, will not be ſet aſide, until the end of the world, when the everlaſting ſabbatiſm of the church of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, will commence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT the inſtitution of the ſabbath is a moral law appears, from the obligations of creatures to worſhip God. And in order to this a certain time or ſeaſon muſt be ſet apart. As mankind are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dependent and united in ſociety, and as ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties receive bleſſings from God, it is proper that they ſhould worſhip God together in a ſocial ſtate. As the light of nature, or a principle of gratitude, obliges us, as individuals, to acknowledge our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and obligations to God, for perſonal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the ſame principles oblige us ſo to do, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or ſocial worſhip. Heathen people offer to God, public ſacrafices of thanſgiving and atonement. Natural gratitude invites to the one, and conſcious guilt impels them to the other. The ſabbath is an inſtitution calculated and intended, to increaſe our
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028999_0125_0FDDD0FB4470D740"/>knowledge of God and duty, and the promotion of our mutual edification comfort and ſalvation. And God is more viſibly glorified by worſhipping aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, than private devotion. As God is glorified, and our knowledge and ſalvation promoted by the ordinance of public worſhip, on the ſabbath, we hence infer its obligation, becauſe theſe are the two principle ends of our exiſtence. The law of the ſabbath is a poſitive law, ſo far as it preſcribes the proportion of time, to be conſecrated to the duties of religion. God was pleaſed to ordain a ſeventh part of our time. We may admire the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in this. Had it been the eighth or tenth, or twentieth day, we ſhould have been more liable to loſe a ſenſe of God, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal influence of religion; and had it been oftner than one day in ſeven, it would have interfered with the neceſſary duties, of our temporal life.</p>
            <p>THUS the ſabbath is a moral law, as it requires the public and ſocial worſhip of almighty God, and is neceſſary to our knowledge of God and duty, and our ſpiritual and eternal happineſs. All that is poſitive in its inſtitution, is the deſignation of the day, or the proportion of time conſecrated to its obſervance. It is neceſſary that the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould deſignate the time, for were it left to the option of mankind, a diverſity of days would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, by different ſocieties and people, and the good effects of its inſtitution loſt in a great degree, and perhaps totally. Impreſſed with a ſenſe of duty to God, and of the wiſdom of the inſtitution, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian legiſlatures, have univerſally, by human laws eſtabliſhed the obſervance of the ſabbath. They have found the great utility of it to ſociety, and to the order, peace and happineſs of mankind. And its happy influence on ſociety, was probably one deſign of our merciful Creator, in its inſtitution. So we come,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:028999_0126_0FDDD10109C367A8"/>
II. To ſhew the advantages of the religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the ſabbath.</p>
            <p>ALL God's ordinances are wiſe and merciful, and intended for the beſt good and happineſs of mankind. This is eſpecially the caſe in the ordinance of the ſabbath. It is happily calculated for the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts of mankind, in this world, and in the world to come. Civil laws, with all the neceſſary pains and penalties of diſobedience, cannot ſo effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the order, the harmony and happineſs of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or reſtrain from immorality, as the religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the ſabbath. And the reaſon is, that this divine inſtitution, as it immediately reſpects God, takes hold of the conſcience, and regulates the principle of action, the life and converſation. But it is principally deſigned, to train up mankind, by divine inſtruction, for the pure and perfect ſociety of the heavenly world, and for the everlaſting, holy and joyful ſabbath, premiſed to the faithful. A conſideration of a few particulars will explain the wiſdom of the inſtitution and advantages of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the ſabbath.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE human frame requires reſt from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of labour, one day in ſeven. It is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to recruit the exhauſted ſtrength, and ſpirits of the laborious part of our ſpecies, that with renewed ſtrength and cheerfulneſs, man may go forth to his work and labour, thro' ſix days of the week. The Iſraelites were commanded, not only to ceaſe from labor, but to exact none from their ſervants, or any under their care. They were to recal to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, their rigorous ſervitude in Egypt, which they were compelled to perform on the ſabbath, and all days, to their extreme grief.</p>
            <p>To the humane, it is a pleaſing confideration, that this day is favourable to the comfort of the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028999_0127_0FDDD102C269D410"/>brutal creatures. They enjoy a reſt. They labor in the ſervice of mankind, ſix days of the week, and many of them meet with hard and cruel uſage, from their unmerciful owners. They are ſubjected to the vanity and caprice of men, not willingly; and groan for deliverance. It is to them a merciful law. "On the ſeventh day, thou ſhalt reſt, that thine ox, and thine aſs may reſt, and that thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the ſtranger, may be refreſhed." The reſt of the ſabbath is not a detriment to men's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral intereſt: but on the contrary is promotive of it, as it affords renewed vigor to man and beaſt, to purſue the labours of the week. Labor without ceſſation would deſtroy the health and ſhorten the lives of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT cheriſhes and ſupports the kind and ſocial affections. Tho' men may diſagree in all other points, they are united with a few exceptions, in the religious obſervance of the ſabbath. A whole people meeting together, at the place and ſeaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to pay their acknowledgments of duty and obedience to God, ſenſible of their wants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, and their mutual dependence alſo upon each other, and imploring the divine mercies for themſelves, their friends and fellow men; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily unites men in bonds of mutual benevolence and love. To aſſemble, by the command of God, upon his holy day, to receive his bleſſing, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the glories of his perfections and works, to hear the ſolemn and ſublime truths and duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his word, and to offer up devout ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in prayer and praiſe, and ſtanding as in the immediate preſence of the creator and parent of the univerſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſpirits, and the common benefactor of mankind, upon whoſe bounty and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all are equally and forever dedendant: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028999_0128_0FDDD1045265A7E0"/>like this muſt effect every heart, which is not uncommonly depraved, with noble and elevated ſentiments, eradicate each low and malevolent thought, and inſpire the ſoul with a benevolence of diſpoſition, towards his fellow worſhippers, and all mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. PUBLIC worſhip is a public ſchool of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and virtue. The doctrines and practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of natural and revealed religion, are explained and enforced upon the conſciences of men, in our worſhipping aſſembles, on the ſabbath. Its inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion habituates our minds to a conſciouſneſs of the exiſtence, the preſence and perfections of God, and our accountableneſs to him. It impreſſes upon us the certainty of a ſtate of final and eternal retribution, of felicity or miſery, according to our moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Bible is the ſacred oracle of the ſabbath, and in the miniſtration of it, we are taught all that the Lord our God requires of us. What are thoſe ſpecial duties which we owe to God, to one another, and to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>BY the religious obſervance of this day, we arrive at the knowledge of the end of our creation, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of virtue and durable happineſs. A future ſtate of exiſtence is a natural principle, but almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed among the rude nations of the world, by the prevalence of various luſts and paſſions. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the ſabbath is neceſſary to keep alive this principle, and to call it into exerciſe. And where it is obſerved, people ſhew its happy fruits in the practice of the duties of piety and righteouſneſs.— The inſtitution preſerves the morals of a people, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to things true, juſt, honeſt and of good report. The enemies of revealed religion, thoſe wiſe philoſophers of this world, have conceded to its
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028999_0129_0FDDD105E2FDD708"/>advocates, the utility and advantages of the ſabbath, as it reſpects the order and happineſs of ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE obſervance of the ſabbath is neceſſary to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold viſible religion and morality. This is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon and obſervation. In thoſe places in which the ſabbath is not religiouſly obſerved, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ill manners and vices abound. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are generally idle, profane and contentious, and ripen themſelves for divine corrections. Thoſe who reject divine inſtitutions, and the worſhip and fear of God, are deſtitute of an efficient principle of righteouſneſs towards men. "For they who fear not God, neither will they regard man." Perſons of this deſcription, have no reſtraint from the ſupreme purſuit of their own intereſt or pleaſure; and to the accompliſhment of their ſelfiſh purpoſes, all things are made ſubſervient. A ſelfiſh diſpoſition abſorbs the judgment and the paſſions, and they are lovers of pleaſure, more than lovers of God.</p>
            <p>IT is a ſolemn conſideration, which ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly arreſt the ſerious attention of parents; that a vicious and ungodly life uſually commences with the profanation of the ſabbath. And on the other hand, thoſe who have been taught from early life, to attend to the ſacred duties of this day, have gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally retained a regard to virtue and religion, thro' life. Allow me to mention, what has been often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that of the ſmall number of criminals, who have come to untimely deaths, by the hand of public juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in this part of the country, perhaps the greater part, have dated the beginning of the crimes, which brought them there, from their neglect and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſabbath, in younger life.</p>
            <p>As ſerious parents would ſhudder at the thought
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028999_0130_0FDDD10A8D570230"/>of their children's growing up in ignorance of God, and becoming examples of vice and miſery in this world, and of perdition in the world to come; as they ſhould fear leſt the guilt of their blood, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands, to whom God has committed their children as a ſolemn charge, to be educated to know, to love and ſerve him forever: as they wiſh them to be good, uſeful and happy in life, and bleſſed beyond the grave; they will not neglect to teach them by precept and example, the ſolemn and important duty of remembering and keeping the holy ſabbath.</p>
            <p>THE ancient chriſtians called the ſabbath the queen of days, and choiceſt of the ſeven, becauſe God has conſecrated it, as the medium of ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſings; becauſe the ſoul is purified and elevated by the ſtudy and contemplation of the ſublimeſt and beſt objects, attains to the knowledge and dignity of its nature, and enjoys the manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the love and mercies of God, who makes his children joyful in his houſe of prayer.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude this diſcourſe, with aſking your ſerious attention and earneſt enquiry, after thoſe ſpiritual privileges and heavenly bleſſings, which God gives to thoſe who with pious believing ſouls, ſanctify his holy day. The ordinances of this day are the ſpecial mean of communicating to our ſouls, the bleſſings of eternal ſalvation. God has ſanctified and bleſſed the day to this end. He honors the ordinances of his appointment. "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the private dwellings of his people." There he meets the ſinner, with illuminating and convincing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his word and ſpirit, and turns his feet from the path of death and ruin, into the way of holineſs and life. The humble ſoul convinced of ſin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028999_0131_0FDDD10C5EF13FD8"/>for ſalvation, there hears the voice of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy, ſaying, "Son be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee." There the ſincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, finds light and direction in duty, his faith confirmed, his hopes and conſolations revived, and his ſoul filled with a divine peace, and ſome happy earneſt of the unclouded joys, which are laid up for the juſt, beyond the vale of death.</p>
            <p>SINCE God has graciouſly inſtituted the holy Sabbath, as a ſpecial ſeaſon of grace and ſalvation, and made it our duty to obſerve it; let us, my friends and fellow-worſhippers, moſt gladly and gratefully improve the golden ſeaſon, with humble dependence on heavenly grace, and not neglect the aſſembling of ourſelves together, for our edification and comfort in holineſs, unto eternal life, thro' Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

            <p>I AM now to ſhew that the religious obſervance of the ſabbath, is an ordinance of the goſpel— to explain the ſpecial duties of the chriſtian ſabbath, and the acceptable manner of performing them.</p>
            <p>As the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious finiſhing act of redemption, and in its miracul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, its connection with antecedent predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubſequent events, more than all things elſe, confirmed the divinity of his miſſion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs to ſave; the apoſtles and diſciples, by divine direction, inſtituted the day, on the morning of which, he roſe from the dead, to be obſerved, in honor of their riſen Lord. And altho' there is no expreſs precept in the goſpel, for the change from the ſeventh, to the firſt day of the week, <hi>their</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a ſufficient warrant, and in all reſpects tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a poſitive precept; becauſe in all things relative to the eſtabliſhment of the chriſtian church and worſhip, they were divinely directed.</p>
            <p>FROM the creation, to the redemption of the church of God from Egypt, the ſeventh day was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028999_0133_0FDDD113CF1D9930"/>as the ſabbath: but after that, Moſes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired lawgiver of the Jewiſh church, gives another reaſon for the ſabbath, which was the redemption of Iſrael. And probably its date was eſtabliſhed at that great event. When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had ſiniſhed the work of redemption, a work more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the creation of the material univerſe, and of which the deliverance of Iſrael, was a lively type or figure, the apoſtles and primitive diſciples chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſabbath, to the day of his reſurrection. And that day, the firſt day of the week, has been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably kept by the body of the chriſtian church, from the days of the apoſtles, to the preſent time. Several things mentioned in the goſpel hiſtory ſhew that the day was changed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE apoſtles and diſciples immediately after our Lord's reſurrection, began the cuſtom of aſſembling together, for the purpoſes of religious worſhip, upon the firſt day of the week. And with the change of the day, the name was changed from <hi>ſabbath</hi> to <hi>Lord's day,</hi> in commemoration of the triumphant reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt himſelf was pleaſed to ſanctify it, by his perſonal appearance, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his diſciples on that day, repeatedly before his aſcenſion. On the day on which he aroſe, he appeared to his aſſembled diſciples and bleſſed them. "Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut, where the diſciples were aſſembled, for fear of the Jews, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid unto them, peace be unto you." Again they aſſembled on the ſucceeding firſt day of the week, and Jeſus met with them, and bleſſed them. During the forty days of his continuance on earth, after his reſurrection, he uſually appeared to his diſciples, aſſembled for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip, on the firſt day of the week. And
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028999_0134_0FDDD11650525458"/>no doubt they received his expreſs direction, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it forever, as the day of the ſolemn and joyful ſolemnities of the chriſtian church. And when we reflect on the glory and greatneſs of the work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, by the reſurrection of Chriſt, we ſee abundant cauſe, why the day ſhould be made the chriſtian ſabbath. The wonderful nature of this work, the bleſſed and extenſive effects and benefits of it, in the redemption of a loſt world, bringing "glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, and good will to men;" and the divine greatneſs of the agent, renders it altogether a work exceeding in glory, any thing which has come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And the day which compleated this work, and "ſaw the Lord ariſe," merits to be honored as the day of our religious ſolemnities, the holy jubilee of the chriſtian church: a day which the Lord hath made, and in which we will be glad, with ſacred joy and wonder, gratitude and praiſe.</p>
            <p>AFTER our Lord's aſcenſion, the apoſtles and the chriſtian church kept the firſt day as the ſabbath. St. Paul on his way to Macedonia, viſited the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians at Troas, and there abode ſeven days, "and upon the <hi>firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them.</hi>" That they met ſtatedly, and by divine appointment on that day, further appears from the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians. "Now concerning the collection for the ſaints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even ſo do ye, upon the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him, that there be no gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings when I come." Theſe examples teach us that the day of our Lord's reſurrection, was the ſabbath of the diſciples and primitive chriſtians. It was ſanctified by the wonderful effuſions of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028999_0135_0FDDD117BA58B8C8"/>on the diſciples. I was, ſays St. John, in the ſpirit, on the <hi>Lord's day.</hi> The day was named <hi>ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> by pagan nations, becauſe on that day, they worſhipped the ſun. And for another reaſon it was ſometimes called by the ſame name by chriſtians, even becauſe on that day, the glorious ſun of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs aroſe from the dead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN the fourth chapter of the Hebrews, the apoſtle ſpeaks of the change of the ſabbath from the patriarchal, to the chriſtian, by the name of a <hi>reſt.</hi> That the prophetic pſalmiſt, in the ninety fifth pſalm, ſpeaks of a future reſt to be given to the church of God; which reſt could not mean the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the creation, nor the reſt of the earthly Canaan, becauſe theſe were paſt, ages before, he therefore ſpeaks of a reſt to come, which no doubt is intended primarily of the heavenly reſt, but inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, the reſt of the chriſtian ſabbath. This will appear by a careful attention to the reaſoning of the apoſtle. "For if Joſhua had given them reſt, then would he, (the pſalmiſt) not have ſpoken afterwards of <hi>another day.</hi> There remaineth therefore, a (ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſmos) a ſabbath, or reſt to the people of God." That the weekly ſabbath is included, and that the day is the reſurrection of Chriſt, appears by the words following. "For he that is entered into his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own works as God did from his." The "certain day, limited" for the future reſt of believers, of which the pſalmiſt ſpeaks, by the argument of the apoſtle, points out the day on which Jeſus Chriſt finiſhed the work of redemption, or the chriſtian ſabbath, typical of the heavenly reſt. For then he was releaſed from all the demands which the law had againſt him, as the ſubſtitute of offenders, having "finiſhed the work, which he came to do." And to celebrate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028999_0136_0FDDD11D5F266168"/>work of redemption is now the ſpecial buſineſs of the ſabbath, not however excluding the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wonderful works of creation, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances wrought for the church, in ancient and later times.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE redeemer of his church claims the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of eſtabliſhing the day, which we are to obſerve. <hi>The ſon of man is Lord, even of the ſabbath.</hi> "To him ſhall every knee bow and every tongue confeſs." As the ancient ſabbath was a ſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jehovah and the church of Iſrael, that the Creator of the heavens and the earth was their God. and they his people: ſo the chriſtan ſabbath, is now alſo a ſign, or teſtimonial that Jeſus Chriſt is the almighty redeemer of his people, whom they are to worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſabbath is a moral law, and therefore not ſet aſide by the goſpel diſpenſation as the ceremonial laws were. To the arguments already adduced in ſupport of its moral obligation, we may obſerve that it was inſtituted in paradiſe, before a ſaviour was promiſed or needed, and therefore was neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic, nor ceremonial, nor typical of Chriſt, in its original inſtitution. The ends to be anſwered by it, are moral; the refreſhment of our nature from the burdens of life, and our increaſe in knowledge and piety, and the celebration of the wonderful works of God, in creation and redemption. It is a perpetual law. Our Lord addreſſing his diſciples on the deſtruction which was to come on Jeruſalem, which happened in about forty years after his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, directs them to pray that their flight fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the impending deſolation might not be on the ſabbath day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:028999_0137_0FDDD1201ADA0DD0"/>
IT appears by the writings of St. Paul, and of the fathers who lived in or near the age of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, that ſome jewiſh chriſtians, obſerved both the jewiſh and chriſtian ſabbath.
<note n="*" place="bottom">IGNATIUS, who lived in the apoſtolic age, exhorts the Jewiſh chriſtians, to keep the Lord's day, as the ſabbath of the chriſtian church. And Juſtin Martyr, who lived ſoon after Ignatius, aſſerts that it was the practice of chriſtians univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to aſſemble the firſt, or Lord's day, to pray, to hear the word, receive the ſacraments and devoutly ſing God's prailes.</note> But the jewiſh ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath came gradually into diſuſe, and the chriſtian was ſoon univerſally obſerved, by jews and gentiles.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſeen that the Lord's day, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſtituted as the chriſtian ſabbath; it is an inquiry of great importance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHAT are its ſpecial duties, and the manner of their acceptable performance. By the mild diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the goſpel, brought to the world by Jeſus Chriſt, the chriſtian church, are not obliged to obſerve the ſabbath with ſo much ſtrictneſs and rigor, as were the ancient church. Some things of ſmall conſequence on other days, if done on the ſabbath, were capitally puniſhed. The ſtrict and rigid diſcipline of the ſabbath, was impoſed upon the jews, becauſe of their ſmall attainments in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual underſtanding, and becauſe they were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an untoward and diſobedient temper. They were ſtrictly forbidden impoſing any work upon their children, ſervants and cattle on the ſabbath; becauſe they were a people eager to accumulate wealth, and would otherwiſe have obliged them to unremitting ſervitude. The ſabbath was therefore ſtrictly and mercifully inſtituted, that all orders and conditions, might enjoy a reſpite from extreme ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a favorable ſeaſon, for religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, contemplation and devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="unknown:028999_0138_0FDDD121EC7879C8"/>
THE chriſtian ſabbath demands a more rational ſpiritual and ſublime ſervice, and is exempted from the mortifying ſeverity and diſcipline of the moſaic. "For the yoke of Chriſt is eaſy, and his burden light." But to obtain, by the bleſſing of God, the moral and divine purpoſes of its inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ceſſation from worldly labour and ſecular employments is neceſſary. It is a day not only of reſt from labor, but of active ſervice, in the duties of public and ſocial worſhip, and of private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe worldly thoughts, plans and works, which are lawful on week days, are unlawful on the ſabbath; becauſe an indulgence of them, would defeat the bleſſed ends of its inſtitution, which are principally that God may be viſibly and publicly glorified on earth, and our knowledge and ſalvation promoted. Six days are allowed us, for worldly labor, and they are abundantly ſufficient for all the purpoſes of health and ſubſiſtance, but a ſeventh part of our time, is conſecrated to the Lord, to be employed in his worſhip, and to our ſpiritual edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and comfort. Chriſtians are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſabbath day, and keep it holy. "Take heed to yourſelves that ye bear no (unneceſſary) bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on the ſabbath day—neither do ye any work, but hallow the ſabbath, as I commanded your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers." We are commanded to reſt from our works, as God reſted from his. As that was a holy reſt, ſo ſhould ours be. It is not a reſt of ſloth or idleneſs, as ſome profane ſinners imagine, and uſe it accordingly. The brutes obſerve the day better than ſuch thoughtleſs perſons. Tho' the body is excuſed from worldly labour, the mind has much to do, in devout meditation, reading, hearing, prayer and praiſe. The bodily exerciſe required on the ſabbath is eaſy: to meet and unite with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028999_0139_0FDDD122F3A3CD88"/>of God in the ſanctuary, and attend the duties of devotion in the family, and in ſecret. Works of charity and mercy are to be done on the ſabbath, as well as other days. Our Lord gave ſight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, ſtrength to the decriped, and health to the ſick on the ſabbath. And paſſing thro' a corn field, his diſciples gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ears of corn, rubbing them in their hands, and eat them, to ſatisfy hunger. The captious and ſuperſtitious phariſees objected, that Chriſt profaned the ſabbath by his works of mercy. Our Lord condeſcended to vindicate his good works, by the example of God the father, "ſaying my father worketh hitherto, and I work." God works by his holy preſerving and ſuſtaining providence, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the wants of his creatures, on the ſabbath, and our Lord imitated the divine example, in works of mercy, on the ſabbath.</p>
            <p>To determine the lawfulneſs of doing any work on the ſabbath, which comes under the name of <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> muſt be taken into conſideration, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of the work, the length of time neceſſary to do it, and the conſcience of the perſon, enlightened by the word of God.</p>
            <p>WORKS or actions, ſinful on other days, are more ſinful committed on the ſabbath; becauſe the day being the Lord's in a peculiar ſenſe, and to be employed in holy duties, the guilt of ſinful actions, is thereby greatly increaſed. All ſins of omiſſion as well as ſins of commiſſion, are to be ſacredly guarded againſt on the ſabbath. That we may meet with acceptance with God, in the aſſemblies of his worſhippers, and have our hearts prepared to wait upon him, according to the preparation of the ſanctuary, and worſhip him, in the beauties of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; We are,</p>

1. To prepare for the Lord's day, by finiſhing the buſineſs of the week, as far as may be, in the week, that our thoughts may not be diſtracted with worldly cares, and</p>
            <p n="2">2. BY previous meditation on the duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the approaching ſabbath, and preparing our hearts for them, that ſo it may be a happy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of reſt and comfort to our ſouls. We ſhould go to the houſe of God with a praying frame of ſpirit, humbly imploring the preſence and bleſſing of God, on our purpoſes to worſhip and obey him, and to receive the inſtructions of his will in all duty,—that he would pour out upon us, and upon our fellow-worſhippers, the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication— afford his ſpirit and bleſſing in the miniſtration of the word and ordinances, that they may be attended with light and comfort, and that it may be a good day to our ſouls. That the ſacred duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the day, may be our delight; the ſweeteſt recreation, and refreſhment of our ſpirits, in this houſe of our pilgrimage, in the way to our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt. And when the public exerciſes of the day are finiſhed, our religious duties are not ended: for we are then eſpecially to guard againſt the inſinuating temptations of the world, and of our own hearts, leſt we looſe that ſolemn and devout frame of ſpirit, and thoſe pious reſolutions in duty, whch the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the day are deſigned to bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE whole day is to be kept as holy time. A whole day, the ſeventh part of time, was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028999_0141_0FDDD12915F8D8F0"/>at the creation. And altho' the day was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was not abridged. It is a moral law, and of perpetual obligation. The importance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is taught us, by the emphatical word <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> and ſhews us that the holy and profitable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Lord's day, ſhould be the pleaſing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our thoughts, thro' the days of the week; that we meditate upon it before it comes, and recal it to mind after it is paſt, that ſo the good fruits of this bleſſed inſtitution, may abide in our hearts, and appear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> our lives. We learn from the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians, that the diſtribution of charity or alms to the neceſſities of the ſaints, and the poor, is a duty of love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, on the ſabbath, and an offering pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>THE ſabbath is profaned by the neglect of ſerious conſideration, and preparation for its approach—by ſpending the day or any part of it in idleneſs in the houſe, or in ſauntering abroad, or in the fields—by waſting its ſacred morning in ſleep, on which Jeſus aroſe early for our ſalvation.—It is profaned by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing plans of worldly buſineſs—by ſettling accounts —writing letters—and reading books which have not a relation to the buſineſs of the day. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned by thoſe who abſent themſelves, from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances of the day, for trifling reaſons— by thoſe who excuſe themſelves with the plea, that they can read good books at home; thus deſpiſing the houſe of God, and ſetting their own wiſdom above the wiſdom of God, who has eſtabliſhed his church as the ground and pillar of the truth. Can ſuch proud and wilful neglecters, expect the bleſſing of God? Will their idle pleas avail at the bar of final and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment? It is profaned by thoſe who are hypocritical, who externally worſhip, while their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs, or their fenſual
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028999_0142_0FDDD12AF19442C0"/>pleaſures,—by thoſe who indulge themſelves in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention and drowſineſs, in time of public worſhip— by thoſe who pride themſelves in pomp and gay cloathing—or attend becauſe it is a faſhionable cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. To theſe deſcriptions of thoughtleſs, irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhippers, are addreſſed the words of Chriſt, "Ye hypocrites, well did Eſaias prophecy of you, ſaying this people draweth nigh to me, with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me."</p>
            <p>FOR our encouragement to ſanctify the ſabbath there are precious promiſes, of bleſſings ſpiritual and temporal. God richly recompences the people who honor him on earth, in the conſciencious obſervance of his ſacred day. The heathen who worſhip not God, periſh under his frowns; but his viſible cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant people, he builds up and bleſſes. Then do we improve the ſabbath moſt profitably, when we devoutly uſe its holy ordinances, as the divine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of communication of ſpiritual bleſſings. On the morning of this day Jeſus Chriſt finiſhed the work of our redemption, and on this day we are eſpecially encouraged to aſk and ſeek for the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefits of his grace, in pardon, juſtification, peace and acceptance with God, and a title to the high privileges of adopted children, and heirs of the heavenly inheritance. All thoſe happy ſouls who aſk with humble penitence, and unfeigned faith, have the promiſe that they ſhall obtain; and the almighty father of mercies will make them joyful in his houſe of prayer.

<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028999_0143_0FDDD12C83C79B08"/>has made it our immediate duty to attend to the ſolemn and momentous concerns of our ſalvation! Our advantages, fellow chriſtians are much every, way, but chiefly becauſe God hath committed unto us, the ſacred oracles, and the holy ſabbath. We come into the immediate preſence of the almighty and univerſal parent and judge of our ſpirits, and worſhip at the footſtool of the creator of all worlds. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A congregation of united worſhippers, ſending up one heart and voice in adoration and praiſe, to the Lord of all, acknowledging their dependence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, imploring bleſſings, and preſenting the offering of grateful hearts, for all his boundleſs mercies, thro' a glorious redeemer, and with ſolemn attention, receiving his will that they may obey him; is the moſt affecting and glorious ſpectacle this world can give, and a diſtant reſemblance, of the ſtate and employments of angels and ſaints in heaven, who perpetually worſhip around the throne of God and of the lamb.</p>
               <p>LET us ſhew our regard for God and zeal for his worſhip, by our perſevering attendance, on the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord's day. Let our hearts rejoice and be glad, when they ſay, "come let us go up to the houſe of the Lord, our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates O Jeruſalem." Let us carefully examine our hearts, whether we profit by the inſtitutions of the Lord's day. Do we find that it is good to draw near to God, and that one day ſpent in communion with God in ordinances, is more profitable and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than all the pleaſures of the world? Does each ſucceeding ſabbath, bring us nearer to our heavenly reſt, by aſſiſting us to make progreſſive advances in holineſs? Are we glad at the return of the ſabbath, and opportunities for devout meditation? Are our

While we aſk for mercy and forgiveneſs, can we alſo feel pitiful to our greateſt enemies, forgive and pray for them?

Bring them to the houſe of God, and teach them the knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. Examine how they profit, and teach them to profit. Inſtruct, catechiſe and pray with them, and for them.

               <p>LASTLY, let chriſtians particularly remember Jeſus Chriſt on this day, whoſe triumphs over death, the grave, and all our ſpiritual foes, we celebrate with grateful and pious joy. He hath ceaſed from his work, and entered into his reſt. And when, O believer, the labours of the week days of life are done, you will alſo enter into the everlaſting ſabbath of reſt, which remaineth for the people of God.</p>

                  <p>Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE firſt table of the moral law begins with the duties which we owe to God; the ſecond, with the duties which are due to our natural parents. Next to God, our parents claim our reverence, love and obedience. They are in God's ſtead to children. As parents and children are mutually dependent on God; children are eſpecially dependent on their parents.</p>
            <p>THIS precept is the moſt important of thoſe of the ſecond table of the law, and therefore placed firſt: for to him, who fulfils the obligations of filial piety, the duties which he owes to mankind, which are enumerated in the ſucceeding laws of the decalogue, will be eaſy and pleaſant. For he who is loving and dutiful to his parents, will be juſt, righteous and merciful to mankind. And on the other hand a diſregard of parental authority, and an ungrateful neglect and abuſe of parents, is the fulleſt proof of a depraved and vicious heart, prepared when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028999_0146_0FDDD1344BBE7840"/>and temptations invite, for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of all thoſe crimes, which the remaining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts ſolemnly prohibit, by the ſevereſt penalties.</p>
            <p>FILIAL piety is the baſis of all ſocial and relative duties and virtues. It forms a habit from youthful days, which tempations to wickedneſs cannot eaſily eradicate. As filial obedience begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> in infancy and continues thro' life, the Deity is pleaſed to give it a place at the head of all thoſe duties which we owe to mankind. Other moral obligations are included in this precept, and grafted on the ſtock of filial piety. They will be noticed in their order. I ſhall attempt to ſhew, the obligations and duties of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their parents—The duties of parents to their children—The various ſocial and relative duties of life—And the animating motives to filial piety, contained in the promiſe which God hath given to them who honor their parents.</p>
            <p>"HONOR thy father and thy mother." The word honor, in this place is of extenſive ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and implies that we reverence and love their perſons, obey their lawful commands, and labor to promote their intereſts and happineſs, by all ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means. It comprehends all the duties and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of filial piety. The word is alſo uſed to expreſs the duties which we owe to our civil rulers, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical fathers of the people. The command "<hi>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> the king," implies all the duties which men owe to the government, which they are under. It is uſed to expreſs the mutual duties and obligations of mankind in all ſocial relations.—"Render to all their due, tribute to whom tribute, (is due) <hi>honor</hi> to whom honor."</p>
            <p>THE obedience of children to parents, has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028999_0147_0FDDD135B7F11738"/>the name of <hi>filial piety,</hi> becauſe if faithfully done, and from a right principle, it is an important branch of that religion, which is good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and which he will graciouſly and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly reward.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE duty of children to parents, is to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and love their perſons. They ſhould cheriſh a cordial regard for them and expreſs it, by all ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words and actions. Altho' their parents may not be ſo worthy as others, yet are children bound to ſhew them greater reſpect than others. This obligation is not diſannulled, altho' the parents might be vicious and profane. For, under God, they are the authors of their exiſtence. Had it not been for them, children would never have been. They have tenderly cheriſhed and cared for them in their infantile helpleſs days, and reared them up to youth and manhood. The obligations are ſtill greater to worthy and virtuous parents, becauſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have received more kindneſs and favors from them. In childhood, in youth, and before chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren arrive to the age of diſcretion, or to act for themſelves, they are under the abſolute government of their parents, and are to obey them in all things, except in things immoral or ſinful. And after they have attained to the age of manhood and are in a capacity to act for themſelves, they are ſtill bound to reſpect and reverence them, and ſeek their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happineſs in all reſpects. They are obliged to conform themſelves to the rules and regulations of their fathers' family; to bear their proportion of labor for the ſupport of the family: and when the parents become helpleſs by age or infirmity, they are to provide for them; to ſtrive to make their condition as comfortable as may be, by kind and tender behaviour and dutiful expreſſions; to bear
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028999_0148_0FDDD13B37A87578"/>with their infirmities, and their unfaſhionable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and ways, tho' contrary to the notions of children. A principle of gratitude to parents for all their former kindneſſes, and the laws of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, oblige children to this duty. And thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities which frequently attend old age, children above all others ought to bear with meekneſs and patience; for if parents, broken by age and infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, do not meet with that indulgence, from their children which their condition requires, they cannot expect to find it from any others. There is in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a natural affection and gratitude towards their parents, which prompts them to ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in old age. Thoſe who treat their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs parents with neglect and diſreſpect, are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the world as void of every human and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principle, as violaters of the moral and chriſtian law, in one of its moſt important precepts, and as brutes in human ſhape.</p>
            <p>FILIAL piety is ſeen in the moſt amiable light, when children exert every kind office to raiſe and comfort their parents, when by the providence of God they are overwhelmed with poverty, ſickneſs or other afflictions.</p>
            <p>HOW nobly did this virtue appear in the conduct of the pious youth Joſeph in Egypt, towards his venerable and afflicted father Jacob! Tho' exalted to all the honors of earthly grandeur, he was not unmindful of his aged father, ſuffering the horrors of famine in a diſtant land. With child-like love and tenderneſs he ſent for him, brought him down to Egypt, fed him with bread, and comforted his declining years. It was no doubt the happieſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his life, that God gave him that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to comfort his helpleſs parent, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his tottering ſteps down the hill of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="unknown:028999_0149_0FDDD13D62F927D0"/>
THE dutiful child is not aſhamed of the low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his parent in the world. His reſpect and reverence are not leſſened. He endeavours by all laudable means to better his condition, and is moſt grieved, when it is not in his power to afford relief. We have an example of dutiful reverence to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in King Solomon, to his aged mother. She came to aſk a favor of the King, her ſon "and the king roſe up to meet her, and bowed himſelf to her, and ſat down on his throne, and cauſed a ſeat to be ſet for the king's mother: and ſhe ſat on his right hand." 1 Kings ii, 19. For his filial piety, and other virtues, heaven remarkably bleſſed and proſpered him. The reverſe of this we ſee in the treatment which aged Noah, in an unguarded hour, received from his profane ſon Ham. The divine diſpleaſure followed on the heels of his undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the curſe of heaven fell upon him and his remote poſterity. God bleſſed the two elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Shem and Japhet, for their reſpect to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is the duty of children to receive and obey the councils and inſtructions, and to ſubmit to the reproofs and corrections of parents. Parents have lived longer in the world, and have paſſed thro' thoſe trying ſcenes of life, thro' which their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have to paſs; they are therefore qualified to guide them. They may have taſted the bitter fruits of youthful inexperience and folly, and ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the wounds of the ſins of their youth, until they turned their feet into the paths of rectitude and virtue. Or if they have happily, thro' the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace and good providence of God, eſcaped the ſnares of temptations, they have ſeen the rocks on which others have made ſhipwreck, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſkilful pilots, to thoſe who have juſt launched
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028999_0150_0FDDD13ED684FFD8"/>on the ſea of life, ſtrangers to the dangers of the ocean over which they are to ſhape their courſe.</p>
            <p>PARENTS who have known by ſweet experience, the pleaſures of early piety, can recommend to the young a life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ill be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the efficacy of a good example. Wiſdom ſhould dwell with years; and happy is the youth who profits by the inſtructions and virtuous example of his parents. Thus did a wiſe and pious Moſes, whoſe youth had been formed by the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of religion, the only true and durable wiſdom. "He harkened to the voice of his father-in-law Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro," and found much advantage and comfort in following the advice of his wiſer parent.</p>
            <p>CHILDREN are meekly to ſubmit to parental cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for their faults. They are to conſider that the taſk is painful to the affectionate parent; and their good and happineſs is the motive and the meaſure of correction and the ſeverity of diſcipline. "We have had fathers of the fleſh, who corrected us, and we did them reverence." Children are carefully to avoid a repetition of thoſe faults which deſerve correction, and to pleaſe their parents in all dutiful and virtuous behaviour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is the duty of children to obey all lawful commands of their parents. As children are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on their parents, they are ſubjected to their lawful authority. This law of nature is enforced by the precepts of chriſtianity. "Children obey your parents in all things; for this is well pleaſing unto the Lord." While children are under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parents, implicit filial obedience is due, whether they command them to do this, or the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028999_0151_0FDDD14038115908"/>other labor or ſervice. They are to come or go at the parents bidding. Obedience to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of parents, is to be underſtood with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of things lawful. Children are not to obey, if a parent ſhould be ſo unnatural as to command any thing unlawful or ſinful, as to ſteal, to lie, to prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the name of God, and the like. Neither are they to obey, if commanded to abſtain from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs which God has commanded, ſuch as reading the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rayer, attendance on public worſhip and the like. They are not to obey in theſe caſes, becauſe the authority of God is above the authority of parents, and we are to obey God rather than man, in all caſes in which thoſe authorities interfere. The apoſtle qualifies the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral rule of filial duty, "with things which are good and right and well pleaſing to God:" and in ſuch things the parents' authority is abſolute. "Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right." It is right or agreeable to the light of nature. It muſt be "in the Lord," or agreeable to his revealed will.</p>
            <p>IN obeying parental authority, all meekneſs and ſubmiſſion are to be ſhewn; without murmuring, gainſaying or contradiction. Children are to pay a willing and cheerful obedience; performing all filial duty, heartily as unto the Lord, conſidering their parents as in God's ſtead to them. The apoſtle ſpeaks of children's reverencing their parents, even when they correct them. "They corrected us, and we did them reverence." Thus children are taught their obligation to obey with fidelity and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all lawful commands, and ſubmiſſively to yield to the reproofs and corrections of their parents.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is their duty to provide for their parents. Gratitude obliges them to make all ſuitable returns
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028999_0152_0FDDD1465ED12CE8"/>for the love, the care, the watchfulneſs and kindneſs which parents have beſtowed on them. They ſhould adminiſter to their temporal wants whenever their dircumſtances call for it. The obligations of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren both to their father and their mother, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y binding, and to be fulfiled equally to both. Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren can never requite them for their kindneſs, either the father's, in providing for them when young, weak and helpleſs; or the mother's, for all her pains, anxieties and ſorrows; the ſleepleſs houts, and watchings, the homely offices done for them, and all her ceaſeleſs cares and labors for them thro' all periods of infancy and childhood. To them, under God, they owe their life and health, food, raiment and education: and nature teaches them that when ſuch friends and benefactors, are reduced either by the accidents of providence, to poverty and dependence, or when diſabled by the infirmities of age, to provide for their own comfort, that ſupport and comfort ſhould be liberally and cheerfully afforded them by their children. Thus a pious Joſeph nouriſhed his aged father in Egypt, in a time of famine. The ancient Jews had a ſaying, that children ought to work with their hands to provide for their parents, and to beg for them when they have nothing of their own to give.</p>
            <p>CHILDREN are to provide for the comfort of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents when ſick—when deprived of reaſon and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The conſolation of aged people depends much upon the duty and kindneſs of children towards them. It is more to them than earthly enjoyments, and next to thoſe divine conſolations which religion gives, in the hope of a better life beyond the vale of death. We have a remarkable inſtance of filial duty and affection, in the two daughters in-law of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, particularly in a virtuous Ruth, towards her afflicted
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028999_0153_0FDDD149F488F980"/>and diſconſolate parent. "She ſaid to her mother, whither thou goeſt I will go, and where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou dieſt, I will die, and there will I be buried, and nought but death ſhalt part me and thee." The duty of providing for parents extends to children-in-la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and to grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children. Of the grandſon of N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mi, it is ſaid, "he ſhall be unto thee a reſtorer of thy life, and a nouriſher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee, who is better to thee, than ſeven ſons, hath borne him."</p>
            <p>CHILDREN ought to put the moſt favorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon the words and actions of parents—to vindicate their reputation—defend them from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries—and not willingly ſee or hear any thing to their diſadvantage. The two ſons of Noah when their father overtaken with wine, expoſed his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, took a garment, and with filial reverence, went backward and covered him. And for this inſtance of duty, God bleſſed and proſpered them.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord reproves and condemns the injurious and vile conduct of the jews in their neglect of their aged helpleſs parents. The law of Moſes had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that children ſhould provide for them; but they found means hypocritically to evade the law. By conſecrating a ſmall part of their intereſt to the uſe of the temple, their pharaſaical teachers diſſolved them from filial obligation. "They tranſgreſſed the commandment of God by their tradition; for God commanded ſaying, honor thy father and thy mother; and he that curſeth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye ſay whoſoever ſhall ſay to his father or mother, it is a gift, by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me, and honor not (does

The ſalutary effects of early inſtruction are laſting. "Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." The foundation of a virtuous and uſeful life is laid in childhood. The bleſſing of God, on early inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, parents are encouraged to hope for: and for that bleſſing ſhould they with pious ardor pray, while they labor to fulfil this duty to their beloved offspring. "Fathers provo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord."</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is the parents duty to reclaim their children from faults and follies, by reproof and correction. A propenſity to tranſgreſs the laws of duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the ſalutary reſtraints of religion and virtue, alas, but too generally appears in our firſt entrance into this depraved world. "Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it from him." On the appearance of a vicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in children, the rod ſhould accompany re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. "The rod and reproof give wiſdom; but a child left to himſelf, bringeth his mother to ſhame." Correction ſhould be tempered with wiſdom; and never adminiſtered haſtily, or to gratify the parent's ſudden and paſſionate reſentment. The child ſhould firſt be convinced of his fault, and the juſtice of his puniſhment, and that it is the effect, not of paſſion, but of reaſon and love.</p>
            <p>IN the moſt pious and eminent families on ſacred record, inſtruction and government were maintained. Of the illuſtrious family of Abraham, the Moſt
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028999_0156_0FDDD1530D11C3A0"/>High gives this commendation, "He will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his children and his houſhold after him, that they ſhall keep the ways of the Lord and do juſtice and judgment." By too great indulgence at the vices of his ſons, the judgments of heaven fell heavily on the houſe of Eli.</p>
            <p>AFTER training up their children in knowledge and virtue, and the duties which they owe to God and to mankind; thus qualifying them, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God to be good and uſeful, parents are to aſſiſt them, according to their ability, in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and uſeful profeſſion or imployment—in the world. And in doing this they ſhould conſult the genius and inclinations of children, and put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a courſe of life, as ſhall afford the beſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their ſerving their generation to God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
            <p>PARENTS who neglect to provide, in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in their power for their children's uſefulneſs in this life, and for their immortal happineſs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by an inſpired apoſtle. "If any man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith and is worſe than an infidel." The obligations of parents extend to children in law, and to adopted children, equally with their own.</p>
            <p>BUT the principal care and labor of parents ſhould be to ſave the ſouls of their beloved offspring. To qualify them for the adoption of children into the family of God, and houſhold of faith; that at the laſt great day, when parents with their children ſhall be aſſembled before the throne of univerſal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and give up their account to God, they may be able to ſay, thro' divine grace attending and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

May it pleaſe God of his mercy to grant that this may be the happy condition of all of us parents and children, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lover of the children of men; to whom be honor and glory now and ever.</p>

            <p>IN this comprehenſive precept, the duty of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their parents is commanded: this is however but one important particular of many duties intended; and is placed at the head of other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obligations, becauſe it is the moſt weighty of any, eſpecially as it prepares men for the faithful performance of all relative duty to mankind.</p>
            <p>HE who loves and honors his parents, is likely to do well in all the relations of life. Having ſhewn the mutual duties of parents and children, let us now,</p>
            <p n="3">3. INQUIRE into the nature and obligations of other important, relative and ſocial connections. Allow me to mention,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE mutual duties which combine the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage relation, and exiſt between the huſband and the wife. As benevolence or virtuous love is the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028999_0159_0FDDD1570715A110"/>principle of all relative duty, and the fulfiling the whole of this table of the law, it appears in no one connection in life, more important and neceſſary, than in the intimate and endearing connection of huſband and wife. The tendereſt love and kindeſt uſage, is due from the huſband to the wife. To her ſhould be given all willing and cheerful aſſiſtance, to alleviate her troubles and bear her ſorrows; and by good example and wiſe inſtructions to aſſiſt in the promotion of her happineſs in this life, and her ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the life to come. By the marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they are one, and are to love one another as they love themſelves. "Huſbands love your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the church and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it. So ought men to love their wives even as their own bodies, he that loveth his wife, loveth himſelf." Their intereſts and their cares are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually one. By the merciful Creator, the woman was given to the man, as a comfort and relief from the gloom of ſolitude, when it was found "not good for man to be alone." The wife ſhould therefore be received and loved by her huſband, as a gift from heaven; and "he who findeth a wife, a virtuous wife, obtaineth a bleſſing from God." Forſaking all others, the huſband is bound to the wife, by the law of the marriage covenant, which is founded in the law of nature, and made a precept of the chriſtian religion. "For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and his mother, and ſhall be joined to his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh." A union of perſons in this relation, ſhould ever be attended with an union of affection, and with increaſing love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the marriage ſtate may be happy and a bleſſing to the parties. "Rejoice with the wife of thy youth, let her be as the loving hind and pleaſant roe,—and be thou always raviſhed with her love." It is the duty of the huſband to take the lead in the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028999_0160_0FDDD15C980AD4B8"/>religious exerciſes and government of the family. "Likewiſe ye huſbands dwell with your wives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, giving honour to the wife, as unto the weaker veſſel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
            <p>THE duty of the wife is to love and reverence her huſband; and promote his intereſt, comfort and happineſs. That the happineſs of mankind might be increaſed an help meet was given to man, at the creation. Perſonal and perpetual love and fidelity are mutually pledged in the marriage covenant, and the wife expreſsly promiſes obedience to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. "Nature, ſays one, may have made and left the ſexes of the human ſpecies, nearly equal, in their faculties and perfectly ſo in their rights; but to guard againſt thoſe competitions, which an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or a conteſted ſuperiority, is almoſt ſure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, the chriſtian religion enjoins upon the wife that obedience which ſhe promiſes, and in terms ſo peremptory and abſolute, that it ſeems to extend to every thing not criminal, or not entirely inconſiſtent with the woman's happineſs."</p>
            <p>THE mahometan and pagan ſyſtems of religion and morality, give the power of tyrants to huſbands; and place the wife in a degrading ſtate of ſervitude. But the chriſtian morality which is founded in love, places the wife in a happy condition, and makes her the companion and friend of the huſband. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands obedience only in all things lawful: and this mild ſuperiority was originally ſignified by <hi>his</hi> priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of creation, and by the woman's being taken out of him, and given to him as a companion and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and by his ſuperior ſtrength of body and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of mind, ſitting him for the arduous labors of
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028999_0161_0FDDD15D78BE3EC0"/>life. The more chriſtianized a people are, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier is the condition of the women. "Wives be in ſubjection to your own huſbands, that if any obey not the word, they may be won by the converſation of the wives, while they behold your chaſte conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation coupled with fear, whoſe adorning,—let it be the hidden man of the heart, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price. For after this manner in old time, the holy women alſo who truſted in God, adorned themſelves, being in ſubjection to their own huſbands, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord; whoſe daughters ye are, ſo long as ye do well."</p>
            <p>THE character of a virtuous wife is drawn by a maſterly hand, in the book of proverbs. "The heart of her huſband doth ſafely truſt in her;—ſhe will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. She ſeeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hand. She is like the merchant's ſhips, ſhe bringeth her food from afar. She riſeth alſo while it is yet night and giveth meat to her houſ-hold; —with the fruit of her hands the planteth a vineyard;—ſhe layeth her hands to the ſpindle, and her hands hold the diſtaff;—ſhe ſtretcheth out her hand to the poor and to the needy. She is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the ſnow for her houſhold for they are cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcarlet. Her huſband is known among the elders of the land. Strength and honor are her clothing, and ſhe ſhall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wiſdom, and her tongue is the law of kindneſs. She looketh well to the ways of her houſhold, and eateth not the bread of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leneſs. Her children riſe up and call her bleſſed; her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band alſo and he praiſeth her."</p>
            <p>IN the government and religious order and duties of the family, it is neceſſary that the parties be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028999_0162_0FDDD15F0B623710"/>and united. But the principal mutual duties of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> relation, are to aſſiſt each other, in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſerve their generation to God's acceptence; to be married in the Lord, and ſerve him as heirs of the grace of life, and expectants of future glory; that ſo their virtuous love, may be the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a pure and immortal friendſhip, in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The mutual duties of rulers and ſubjects.— The duties of magiſtrates are the eſtabliſhment of wiſe and ſalutary laws, and the impartial adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice. Rulers are called God's miniſters, and are appointed to rule and judge in righteouſneſs. The magiſtrate's commiſſion is compr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſed in the declaration of an ancient king, 2 Chronicles 19. "He ſet judges in the land, and ſaid unto them take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment,— wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, nor taking of gifts." The magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate's duty is not confined wholly to legiſlation, and diſtributive juſtice; it comprehends alſo all ſuitable labors for the eſtabliſhments of morality and religion; for without the ſanctions of theſe civil government and order are not eaſily maintained. A people who are deſtitute of the practical knowledge of God and accountableneſs to him, and of a future retribution, are deſtitute of an efficient principle of moral conduct in ſociety. "They who fear not God, neither will they regard man." Morality founded in the principles of religion, is the beſt ſecurity of civil government. Good morals are more efficacious than good laws. The ſupreme ruler of nations honors and proſpers a people who worſhip him and obey his immutable
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028999_0163_0FDDD165B6A34E00"/>laws, and eaſts down the thrones and governments which reject them. He hath eſtabliſhed an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table connection between public virtue and public happineſs, and between public vice and miſery. "Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is the ruin of a people." Magiſtrates are to defend the people from external enemies, and from domeſtic internal factions; to guard the peace and advance the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic proſperity. They are to be examplary in all virtue, going before others in all good works: to deliver the oppreſſed, ſhield the innocent, defend the helpleſs, and reſtrain and puniſh the vicious and rebellious. They are appointed for the puniſhment of evil doers, and the praiſe of them who do well. As civil government is a divine ordinance, magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates are called gods in the ſacred writing, to denote that they act as the vicegerents of the ſupreme ruler of the world, and that they are to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his revealed will; mindful of their account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to him, for the high truſt repoſed in them. Under this impreſſion, juſtice will be adminiſtered in mercy, and righteouſneſs be the ſtability of the times.</p>
            <p>THE duties of ſubjects or people to rulers are, ſubjection to lawful authority, and ready obedience to all good and ſalutary laws. It is an important precept of the chriſtian religion, that "every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, for the powers that be are ordained of God. Render to all their due: tribute to whom tribute, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. Speak not evil of dignities." In the execution of the arduous duties of their office, people are to afford to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lers all willing aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and concurrence in all things neceſſary for the good and welfare of the community; and to offer up ſervent prayers to God for them, that they may
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028999_0164_0FDDD166D9AB9438"/>be endued with wiſdom, fortitude and fidelity. "I exhort, ſays St. Paul, that prayers and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty." It is the duty of the people to ſupport their civil rulers, that they may devote their time and abilities to the public.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE are ſpecial duties reſulting from the relation of miniſters and people. The ſpecial duties of the miniſters of the goſpel are fidelity in all miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial offices, and zeal to promote the edification and ſalvation of the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er whom the Holy Ghoſt, hath made them overſeers. To labor in this work, by faith, by purity, by prayer, by preaching, and by private inſtruction; ever mindful of their accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to their Lord and Redeemer, whoſe ſervants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>THE duties of people towards their miniſters, are to hear and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the miniſters of religion, who devote their ſtudies and life to the edification and ſalvation of men, all in whom the ſpirit of the goſpel reigns, will be diſpoſed, heartily, to adminiſter to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſupport. The ignorant and avaricious only, will refuſe their equitable proportion, to maintain an inſtitution calculated to promote univerſal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; happineſs; but deſigned principally to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſalvation of the ſouls of men. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed founder of the chriſtian church and miniſtry hath ſaid, Luke x, "The laborer is worthy of his hire."</p>

4. THE obligations of maſters to ſervants are, juſtice and kindneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> them; providing for their temporal comfort and eternal happineſs; kind acceptance of their faithful ſervices; not threatning or ſeverely correcting for ſmalier faults, remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they themſelves are the ſervants of Chriſt, and have many faults which need forgiveneſs. "Ye maſters, doing the ſame things unto them, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing threating, knowing that your maſter is in heaven, and there is no reſpect of perſons with him." It is the maſter's duty to ſet before his ſervants and thoſe under his care an example of virtue and religion, and to enforce by daily inſtruction and authority, the knowledge and fear of God, and reſolve with that valiant ſaint and ſoldier Joſhua, that they ſhall ſerve the Lord. Allowing and encouraging ſervants to worſhip God both publicly and in ſecret; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining and correcting all inſtances of vice and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion. It is the duty of ſervants to honor and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their maſters, with fidelity. "Exhort ſervants to pleaſe their maſters well in all things, ſhewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things." Tho' ſervants may meet with hard uſage, and be compelled to unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant labor, they are meekly to bear the burden from a ſenſe of duty to God. And tho' ſervants to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on earth, they ſhould renounce the more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervitude of ſin, and earneſtly ſeek to be made free in Chriſt, with that bleſſed and everlaſting free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſin and condemnation, which he gives to all, without reſpect of perſons, who believe in him and do his commandments.</p>
            <p>THE duties of the rich towards the poor, are compaſſion and charity, diſtributing to the wants of the needy, and adminiſtering conſolation to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. The duties of the poor towards their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028999_0166_0FDDD16986642778"/>are gratitude and their prayers for them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the aged towards the young, are condeſcenſion, counſel and direction in duty: of the young towards the aged, are reverence and obedience to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and readineſs to afford them aſſiſtance in every office of kindneſs, when the wants of the aged demand their help. The duty of ſuperiors in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and honors, is "condeſcenſion to men of low degree"; and of equals, mutual love and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Theſe important relative and ſocial duties, the great law of nature and revelation obliges us to do and practiſe towards others; although they ſhould neglect to practiſe them towards us. Our duty is to be done, tho' others neglect theirs. The great commandment of the law, "to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor as ourſelves," will incline us ſo to do. "And as ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo to them." We are,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, To conſider the animating motive to enforce the important duties of filial piety, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the promiſe annexed to this commandment. "That thy days may be long on the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." This is a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to filial obedience. Health and long life, to thoſe who honor their parents. The bleſſings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in former ages to the obedient, were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally promiſes of temporal bleſſings, as health, peace, affluence and longevity: but the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeſs more valuable bleſſings; the bleſſings of the covenant of grace; and yet in that merciful cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant temporal bleſſings are alſo included, and given to the righteous; ſo far as they ſhall be neceſſary for their beſt good, and the glory of God. "For god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs had the promiſe of the life which now is, and of that which is to come." Under the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, altho' children who honor their parents
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028999_0167_0FDDD1705F024F08"/>are not infallably aſſured of long life; yet are they aſſured of other bleſſings more valuable, in exchange. If the promiſe of long life was in a manner peculiar to obedient children under the law, ſtill we have ground to conclude, that under the goſpel diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the lives of obedient children are prolonged beyond thoſe of the diſobedient and profane. Some read the promiſe in the original, "That they, thy parents, may prolong thy days." Parents by their prayers and bleſſing on obedient children, are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of drawing down bleſſings from heaven upon them, as long life, uſefulneſs, honor and happineſs. Thoſe who now obey their parents in the Lord, if they do not always enjoy long life, yet the loſs, if it may be called a loſs, ſhall be made up to them, in bleſſings more valuable: and ſuch perſone are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more uſeful, reſpected and beloved while they live, and lamented when dead. "For honorable age is not that which ſtandeth in length of time, nor that is meaſured by number of years: but wiſdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unſpotted life is old age."

            <p>KINGS, Magiſtrates, miniſters, the aged, maſters, and inſtructors of youth, as well as natural parents, in the ſacred ſcriptures are called fathers; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, people, the young, ſervants and pupils, are called children; and the mutual obligations and
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028999_0168_0FDDD171C1270370"/>duties of theſe reſpective relations, are ſummarily compriſed in this divine precept; and juſtify the extent and latitude in which it is here explained. Let this ſubject be improved in a few inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the obligation of children to parents is placed at the head of all moral and relative duty to men, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfer the great importance of filial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; that children ſhould love their parents, cheerfully obey all their lawful commands, and ſeek their intereſt, comfort and happineſs in all reſpects. Allow me, dear children and youth, to invite and urge you to the conſtant obſervance of the ſacred duties which are due to your parents. They are of the utmoſt importance to your honor and happineſs, and to the comfort of your parents. "Hearken ye children to the inſtructions of a father, and attend to know underſtanding." Experience and wiſdom are to be expected from your parents, and you are favored by heaven, in that you have ſuch affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and faithful guides to direct you in knowledge and virtue. Thoſe whoſe names are mentioned with approbation in the ſacred pages, were dutiful and affectionate to their parents. Jacob the ſon of Iſaac attended to the wiſhes of his pious parents, in his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in the world, and comforted them; as did alſo his pious father. The behaviour of Eſau was the reverſe, and procured him the character of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſon. Joſeph was a moſt dutiful ſon, and God highly honored and proſpered him. Above all, let me propoſe to your imitation the example of the bleſſed Jeſus, who in the days of his childhood and youth, was ſubject to his earthly parents. He has given you a bright pattern of filial piety, in love and obedience. He alſo wrought with his own bands in the days of youth, to ſupport himſelf and them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="unknown:028999_0169_0FDDD173733B8A20"/>
ALTHO' you can never make an equal return of love and obedience to your parents, for all their care and kindneſs towards you, yet let it be your earneſt endeavour to recompenſe them. Shew your grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to them, by your zeal to pleaſe them. Shun all occaſions of grief to them; and let them have the pleaſure to ſee the good fruits of their labors and cares for you, in your good and virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. For they can have no greater joy in this world, than to ſee you walking in the truth.</p>
            <p>DISOBEDIENCE to parents is a dreadful evidence of a degenerate and wicked heart, and of a perſon's ripening for all manner of evil and ruin. It is claſſed by the apoſtle with unthankfulneſs and unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other crimes; "and they who do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God." The curſe of heaven will fall on ſuch, either in this world, or the world to come. "The eye that mocketh at his father, and deſpiſeth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley ſhall pick it out, and the young eagles ſhall eat it:—his lamp ſhall be put out in obſcure darkneſs."</p>
            <p>IT has been juſt remarked that thoſe who have been loving and dutiful to parents, God has uſually proſpered in the world, and themſelves alſo bleſſed, with dutiful children, and with the riches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly grace. And that thoſe on the other hand, who have been diſobedient and cruel to parents, have been puniſhed with children like themſelves. As then, children and youth, you would enjoy the approbation of your own minds,—the bleſſings of your parents,—the eſteem of the virtuous and good,—uſefulneſs in life,—comfort in old age and peace in death, and the plaudit of your righteous and merciful judge, love and practiſe the duties which
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028999_0170_0FDDD174DD0EF318"/>you owe to your parents, and "obey them in the Lord."</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF ſuch are the obligations of children to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, equally important are the obligations of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. On them devolves the two-fold obligation, to recompenſe the tender love and care of parents to them, in their's towards their own children; and to "train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." To you, honored parents, God has committed an important charge. To you he hath given children to be educated for him, in virtuous knowledge and the fear of God,—to be qualified for a uſeful life, and for the holy and happy condition of the children of your father in heaven. Their reputatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and uſefulneſs in life, under God, depend much on your faithful inſtructions and good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and on you may alſo depend their happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the other world. If you ſtrive to promote their ſalvation, you have gracious encouragement. that the ſeeds of pious inſtruction ſhall be watered with heavenly grace, and bring forth fruit unto eternal life. As you wiſh their preſent and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal happineſs; be perſevering in your labors to guide them in the paths of religion. Follow your inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions until you ſee the good fruits, in their virtuous lives. Awful will be the condemnation of thoſe parents who have neglected the ſouls of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or by their ill example drawn them to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ruin. "Their blood will be required at their hands." It will appear that altho' they were capable of being taught their obligations to God, you ſuffered them to grow up in ignorance of him; tho' they had precious ſouls to be ſaved, you ſuffered them to be loſt. What mutual, dreadful accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will irreligious parents and children retort upon each other, in that world of wo, which is prepared
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028999_0171_0FDDD176435F1538"/>for the ungodly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How dreadful the employment, of the days of miſerable exiſtence, through ages of hopeleſs end.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other hand, peaceful is the exit of the pious parent, who has labored to ſecure the ſalvation of his children. His labor is with the Lord, and his reward in heaven. Having done his duty towards them, as a faithful parent, by the aſſiſtance of grace, how muſt his happineſs in heaven be increaſed, when there he ſhall find that his labor was not in vain; when his children ſhall be "his crown of joy, and riſe up and call him bleſſed."— Impreſſed with a ſolemn belief of a ſpeedy entrance upon one or the other of theſe momentous ſcenes, let us, parents and children, humbly look to God, imploring his efficacious grace, that we may ſo fulfil the duties of theſe relations as to obtain acceptance, thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To conclude: let it, ſirs, be our daily care and labor, to do, with all good conſcience, in the fear of God, the duties of the ſeveral relations which we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain towards our fellow men. And may we ſerve our generation well, by the will and grace of God, whether we are parents, or children,—brethren or ſiſters,—magiſtrates or ſubjects,—preachers or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,—maſters or ſervants,—rich or poor,—ſuperiors, inferiors or equals: remembering that death will ſpeedily diſſolve theſe connexions, when "we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt," to give account how we have done our duty in them: that we may give it with joy, and be accepted as good and faithful ſervants, may it pleaſe God of his mercy to grant, for the ſake of Jeſus our Lord, who hath loved the children of men, and to whom be praiſes everlaſting.</p>

            <head>SERMON XIII. The duty and the means of preſerving life,—the oppoſite vices.</head>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is a ſhort, but comprehenſive precept, and like the other negative precepts of the law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the duties oppoſed to the ſin prohibited. It forbids the taking of life, either our own, or the life of others; and comprehends the duty of perſuing all lawful and ſuitable means to preſerve life. It is to be underſtood with the reſtriction of unlawful put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to death: for the law of nature juſtifies taking away life in certain caſes, and the precepts of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity do not diſannul that law.</p>
            <p>As this precept forbids unjuſtly putting to death, it neceſſarily forbids thoſe evil paſſions, or actions, which have a direct or remote tendency to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of this great ſin. And on the other hand it demands the cultivation of thoſe benevolent and friendly affections towards our fellow men, which are neceſſary to make life deſirable and happy. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates all our thoughts, words and actions in our intercourſe with mankind. It is a law given by the omniſcient ſearcher of hearts, who demands good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rectitude of principle and thought, as well
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028999_0173_0FDDD17FF99FF018"/>as propriety and benevolence of behaviour. That it is thus extenſive and ſpiritual as well as external, appears from the expoſition given of it by our Lord, Matthew 6. "Whoſoever is angry with his brother, without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judgment." And "whoſoever, ſays St. John, hateth his brother is a murderer." For it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained indulgence of the malignant paſſions of anger, hatred and revenge which impels to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of this enormous crime. This precept then reſpects the due government of our paſſions and appetites, as well as our words and actions. As it reſtrains the iraſcible paſſions, it alſo condemns all wrathful expreſſions and actions, all contentions, wounding, duelling and the like brutal behaviour. As all ſinful diſpoſitions and actions tending to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy life, are forbidden, the practice of the oppoſite virtues are commanded. I ſhall attempt to explain and illuſtrate this precept, by conſidering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE duty of uſing all ſuitable means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE unlawfulneſs of taking away our own, or the life of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE duty of ſelf government, and of bringing under the ſubjection of religion, our ſpirits, paſſions and appetites, and the cultivation of the oppoſite virtues.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE are to employ all lawful means to preſerve our own life, by uſing with moderation and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the bounties of providence, in the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and life of the body.</p>
            <p>THE gifts of nature are liberally diſpenſed for the ſupport of life. The ſoil, the ſea, the air and the
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028999_0174_0FDDD181834BE710"/>elements, are all laboring to prepare food and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforts for mankind. But the exertions of men are neceſſary to bring to maturity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the means of a comfortable ſubſiſtance: and by the ſweat of his face, man is to get his bread. A certain proportion of food is neceſſary for the life of the body: more than this is exceſs and intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The wants of nature are few and are eaſily ſupplied: a luxurious appetite creates many artificial ones, and is not eaſily gratified. Health is preſerved by temperence. It is alſo neceſſary to protect our bodies from the extremes of heat and cold and ſtorms, by ſuitable cloathing; and in ſickneſs to uſe proper means and medicine, for the reſtoration of health. The bounties of providence deſigned for the health and life of the body, are in numerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by the abuſe of them, the means of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Diſeaſes and untimely death are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly among the unhappy effects of intemperence. Self-preſervation is a natural principle, and a law of revelation. "No man hateth his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it." Man is, by his Creator, in ſome degree committed to his own keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the means of preſerving life are within his reach. There are many dangers in life, in which the interference of others can afford him no aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and under providence, he muſt depend upon his own exertions. And in the uſe of the ſupports of life he cannot make uſe of the aid of others.</p>
            <p>THERE are however certain exempt caſes in which duty to God obliges to hazard life, and even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or take it away. Theſe are neceſſary ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,—lawful war,—and in the cauſe of religion, in times of perſecution. When one is attacked and life aimed at, if the perſon cannot eſcape, he may lawfully take the life of the murderer. The reaſon
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028999_0175_0FDDD1830E6086D8"/>of this is, that the preſervation of his own life, is committed to him as the firſt object of his care. The chriſtian religion teaches us the duty of preſerving our own life, when in danger from an enemy, by all prudent and lawful means. When the enemies of Paul combined to take his life, he uſed proper means to preſerve it. He ſought that protection from authority which is the deſign of the inſtitution of government to afford to the ſubject.</p>
            <p>IN lawful defenſive war, perſone are obliged to hazard the lives of others, as well as their own. When men riſe up violently to deſtroy the lives and properties of others, they may be lawfully reſiſted and deſtroyed. If they act the part of furious beaſts of prey, like beaſts of prey, they are to be deſtroyed. But this is lawful only in neceſſary ſelf-defence, and when all other means of preſervation have failed.</p>
            <p>THERE have been inſtances of perſons who have ſacrificed their own lives to ſave the life of others. "Peradventure, for a good man, one would even dare to die."</p>
            <p>IT is alſo a duty for a perſon to reſign his life for the cauſe of God, or in defence of the true religion. When a perſon is not permitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> live, unleſs he will renounce the worſhip of God, or abjure the true religion, it is his duty to ſubmit to death. This was the fiery trial to which the ancient worthies, and the martyrs in former and later ages ſubmitted. They were tortured not accepting deliverence. They ſealed their teſtimony to the truth with their blood, and eſteemed the ſufferings of death, of ſmall account compared with the glory that awaited them in heaven. To ſuch are addreſſed the animating words of Chriſt. "Fear not them that kill the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028999_0176_0FDDD18907F29B60"/>body, but are not able to kill the ſoul; but rather fear him who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell. For he who ſaveth his life, ſhall looſe it; and he who looſeth his life for my ſake and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhall find it." As the love of God is a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely preferable to life, life is to be willingly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in the competition, whenever he is pleaſed to permit perſecution to rage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. MEN may not lawfully take away their own lives by laying violent hands on themſelves. The precept, thou ſhalt not kill, which perhaps with greater propriety might be tranſlated <hi>thou ſhalt do no murder,</hi> equally prohibits the taking our own life and the life of others. No condition of ſufferings can juſtify an impatient wiſhing for death, and much leſs the putting a period to life. Suicide and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to haſten death, is forbidden by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. God has appointed to us our ſtation in this life, and we are not to diſmiſs ourſelves, but wait the appointed time. The ſuicide is chargable with the aggravated guilt of murder. His fear of preſent or future ſufferings in life, hurry him to the horrid crime, and prove him to be of a daſtardly ſpirit. His deliberately ruſhing into eternity for refuge from trouble, argues his great impiety, and bold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the authority and juſtice of God. Shall a deſerter be puniſhed with death by the hands of men? what will then be his condition, who deſerts his ſtation in this world, and appears in the awful preſence of his maker, unſummoned and unpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eriſhed king Saul, falling upon his own ſword, on Mount Gilboa, too cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly to bear a reverſe of fortune; and thus fell Judas, that he might go to that place for which his crimes had prepared him.</p>
            <p>FROM the charge of the guilt of ſuicide, we muſt exempt that ancient ſoldier and ſervant of God, Sampſon. His caſe was peculiar. His cruel enemies and the enemies of God had him in their hands. They had put out his eyes and inſulted him in his miſery. From the circumſtances of his death, it appears that he was divinely directed as to the manner of it; that by his voluntary death he might prevent the philiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines from inflicting one more cruel, do valiently in the overthrow of thoſe whom God had doomed to deſtruction, ſtop the triumphs of the daughters of the uncircumciſed, over one of the faithful ſervants of God, and expoſe the vanity of their Idol deities. God wrought a miracle, to make his death glorious and uſeful. He is ranked by the apoſtle, among the worthies who died in faith, the circumſtances of it, muſt therefore have been by divine direction. In the ſame light we are alſo to underſtand the trying act of the patriarch Abraham, in obedience to the command of God, about to offer up his only ſon in ſacrifice. In this myſterious affair, the faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Abraham was moſt marvellous, and ſo was alſo the reſignation of Iſaac. He voluntarily ſubmitted to be ſlain. His age and ſtrength could have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully reſiſted; but perſuaded that it was the will of God, he bowed his head, patient as a lamb, upon the alter, waiting the fatal ſtroke: and the father when he drew the knife and was on the point of plunging it into the heart of his ſon, loved him as his own ſoul, and gladly would have died for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:028999_0178_0FDDD18C16927910"/>
THIS marvellous action was deſigned to ſhew the patriarch and the ancient church, in a lively fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, the death of Chriſt the promiſed Saviour. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's ſlaying his ſon was to expreſs the almighty father giving his beloved ſon to die, to atone for the fins of men; and the ſubmiſſion of Iſaac, the patient reſignation of Jeſus to death. <hi>Then</hi> the goſpel was preached to Abraham,—<hi>then</hi> he ſaw in lively viſion "the day of Chriſt, and was glad." He believed in God and in the certain advent of the Meſſiah, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. I ſhall only add here, that the ram miraculouſly caught in the thicket and offered in ſacrifice, in the room of Iſaac, was deſigned to ſignify God's acceptance of the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices of animals until the advent of the great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin, as perpetual memorials to his ancient church of that glorious event.</p>
            <p>GOD is the proprietor of the lives of his creatures, and may conſiſtently with his goodneſs and juſtice, make uſe of one to take away the life of another; as he uſes natural means or ſecond cauſes, to bring to a period the lives of his creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are to preſerve the lives of our fellow men, by all ſuch friendly and benevolent means, as tend to promote their health, their peace and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; by guarding them from injuries and wrongs, by adminiſtring comfort to the afflicted—cloathing to the naked—food to the famiſhing—medicine and nouriſhment to the ſick, and help to the helpleſs of all ages and conditions. The obligations of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the lives of others appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN that mankind are made for ſociety. "It is not good for man to be alone." If it was lawful for one man to take the life of another, for any or every
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028999_0179_0FDDD18DC2C899C8"/>cauſe, a general and univerſal maſſacre would take place; for the right of one ſo to do, would be the the right of all, and the world would become a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſe of deſolation and field of blood. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that ſince mankind are placed together, by their creator, on the earth, it is his will that they ſhould be mutually helpful and beneficial. We therefore find that we are dependent on each other for aſſiſtance and ſociety, to our comfortable exiſtence here, and defence againſt the many accidents and evils of life: the helpleſs infant is dependent on the parent, and the ſick and infirm, on thoſe who have ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
            <p>MANKIND are dependent on each other, not only for the attainment of the means of a comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in life, but for that knowledge and aſſiſtance which are requiſite to their ſpiritual and immortal happineſs. <hi>This</hi> is the life of the ſoul, infinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and of more value than this temporary life. Ignorance and vice are the death of the ſoul: but in the knowledge and love of God, conſiſts its ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and eternal life. The ſalvation of the ſoul, is worthy the name of life. This preſent exiſtence will ſpeedily cloſe; but the life of the ſoul, will never ceaſe.</p>
            <p>THE principle which impels us to preſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life of ourſelf and others, ſhould more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impel us to ſecure and preſerve this better life.— For what ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhould prolong the days of this vain life to its utmoſt bounds, and gain the whole world, and loſe an immortal life?— This life is the one thing needful, and which the ſight of nature and the precepts of the goſpel, teach us to ſeek firſt and laſt, as our chief duty and felicity. They are chargeable with the guilt of murdering their
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028999_0180_0FDDD1922936E740"/>own ſouls, who continue in ignorance of God, of the Saviour, &amp; the truths &amp; duties of revelation, while the means of knowledge and grace are at hand. They are guilty of deſtroying the ſouls of others, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe under their care to grow up in ignorance and wickedneſs, or hinder their ſalvation by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious example. <hi>They</hi> preſerve the life of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls who ſtrive to know God and their duty; who love God in ſincerity, and believe in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and do his commandments. <hi>They</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the life of the ſouls of others, who are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of reading them in the paths of virtue and religion, to the knowledge of God and our almighty Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY who neglect to preſerve the lives of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by all ſuitable means in their power, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as acceſſory to their death: and guilty of a ſpecies of murder. The principle which inclines us to preſerve our own life, ſhould compel us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the life of others. For the law of nature and revelation has made it our duty to "love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor as ourſelves." This divine law, our bleſſed Lord hath illuſtrated by his own example, as the pattern of our imitation, even that mankind ſhould love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with the ſame love which they have for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The love which we bear to ourſelves, which powerfully excites us to uſe all poſſible means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life,—to ſhun things hurtful and dangerous to our own life and happineſs, we are to put in exerciſe towards our fellow men, in like circumſtances. And by the ſame principle of benevolence to others, we are alſo bound to ſeek their ſpiritual edification, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs, by all the means and advantages which God hath put into our hands.</p>
            <p>THIS great moral law of univerſal love to mankind,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028999_0181_0FDDD19384F10F78"/>which was wonderfully diſplayed in the life and death of Chriſt, is much inſiſted on by numerous precepts and examples in the goſpel. Without that charity to our fellow men, which powerfully inclines us in our reſpective relative and ſocial connections, to do good and ſeek the temporal and eternal happineſs of others, an inſpired apoſtle aſſures us, that we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor. Follow after charity. By love ſerve one another: for all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thyſelf." Were this principle of uncorrupted religion, in univerſal uſe, mankind would do no injury knowingly; but be diſpoſed to promote the intereſts and happineſs of others as their own. The miſeries which men ſuffer from their own follies and crimes, and which are brought upon men by their fellow men, would be no more, and ſecurity, quietneſs and peace univerſally abound. But as this is not the condition of man in his preſent ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy from God and duty; it is neceſſary that laws and puniſhments ſhould be the reſort, to reſtrain men from crimes. While the corrupt paſſions of men overcome the dictates of enlightened reaſon, and break the laws of God and ſociety, caſes will ariſe in which it is thought lawful to take away life; ſome inſtances of which have been already mentioned, on which a few additional obſervations will be made.— Such inſtances are, juſt ſelf-defence againſt aſſaſſins, —lawful defenſive war,—and the execution of civil juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. HE who ſuffers himſelf to be killed, when there is not a poſſibility of eſcaping death, except by the death of the aſſaſſin, is chargeable with the guilt of not preſerving his own life, and in effect alſo, of val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028999_0182_0FDDD195C50464B0"/>the life of the murderer more than his own, which he is not obliged to do. Such a ſudden aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault juſtifying the ſlaying an enemy, is on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the aſſaulted has not opportunity to eſcape, or appeal to the magiſtrate, or thoſe means of defence which the laws have provided. On the ſame principle we are to defend the life of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor or fellow men, when attacked by aſſaſſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE law of nature juſtifies ſlaying an enemy in a juſt defenſive war. The law of ſelf-preſervation which juſtifies an individual, in ſlaying his enemy in the defence of his own life, makes it the duty of people to deſtroy the lives of public enemies, when their own cannot otherwiſe be preſerved. Chriſtian rulers have in all ages deemed it a duty to reſiſt with armed violence, the deſtroyers of nations. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this extremity is reſorted to, a people ought to be well ſatisfied that the war is juſt and neceſſary, and that all prudent and pacific meaſures have been uſed, and have failed. It is to be lamented that mankind, have ſo univerſally diſcovered a prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for war; and too frequently plunged into the dreadful gulf, to gratify a ſpirit of unforgiving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or mean ambition, or avarizious plunder. The precious lives of myriads of the human race have been ſacrificed upon this all devouring altar.</p>

               <l>"O why will kings forget that they are men?</l>
               <l>"And men that they are brethren?"</l>
            </q>
            <p>AN inſpired apoſtle traces this evil to its ſource. "From whence come wars and fightings? Come they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your members?"</p>
            <p>THAT war is juſt, in certain caſes, appears in that the Moſt High himſelf, commanded the Iſraelites to
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028999_0183_0FDDD19B6E238600"/>war againſt the Midianites and deſtroy them. And a curſe is denounced againſt him, that kept back his ſword from blood. In ſuch caſes the peaceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Saviour does not forbid it. To his diſciples he ſays, "he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment and buy one." Chriſtians have a right to ſelf-defence. His diſciples carried arms to defend themſelves from enemies, as appears by one of them drawing his ſword to defend Chriſt at the time of his ſurrendry of himſelf to his perſecutors. The neceſſary duty of ſelf-defence, is conſiſtent with his declaration, that "they who uſe the ſword, ſhall alſo periſh by the ſword:" which has, no doubt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to offenſive wars, or wars as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly managed.</p>
            <p>ITS lawfulneſs further appears, from the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exhortation which his harbinger, John, gave to the ſoldiers who came to his baptiſm, and aſked, "And what ſhall we do?" that is, that we may be qualified ſubjects of the kingdom of the Meſſiah. Had their profeſſion been ſinful, it was of the laſt importance that they ſhould know it. John anſwered them, "do violence to no man,—accuſe no man faſlely,—and be content with your wages." He cautions them againſt the peculiar temptations at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the profeſſion of arms; but does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the profeſſion lawfully uſed. It is indeed a great oalamity that men are ſometimes forced to the dreadful trade of war, in ſelf-defence; for while they reſiſt their enemies, they hazard their own life, and the innocent and oppreſſed fall in battle, as well as their guilty oppreſſors. Happy would it be for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals as well as nations, did that direction of the apoſtle ſuitably impreſs all minds, "As much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men."</p>

THE mode of warfare which the people of Iſrael carried on againſt the nations of Canaan, was ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>. They deſtroyed promiſcuouſly, the priſoners, women, children and the aged. The apology for this is that they acted by a divine commiſſion. The people of Canaan had ripened themſelves for deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by their enormous wickedneſs, like the people of Sodom. And God made uſe of the Iſraelites as a ſcourge to deſtroy them, as unfit longer to live; as he ſometimes makes uſe of earthquakes and other judgments to deſtroy men.</p>
            <p>To theſe exceptions from the text, may be added the lawfulneſs of taking away the life of criminals, by the hand of public juſtice. One end of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil government, is to be "a terror to evil doers." It is ſaid to be a dictate of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that murderers ſhould be put to death. It was a judicial law given to Iſrael, "Thou ſhalt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a murderer to live." Some humane advocates for the mitigation of the ſeverity of capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have however, doubted of the lawfulneſs of taking away the life of a man, even for murder. They aſſert that as the <hi>judicial</hi> laws of the Jews were local and temporary, they are not now obligatory: and that as a man has not power over his own life, he cannot convey to ſociety a power to take it away. But to this it is replied, that as an individual has a lawful right, (as has been already ſhewn) to deſtroy his murderer; on his death, that right devolves to the ſociety, and they may lawfully uſe it, for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the public. If a puniſhment could be deviſed more efficacious to reſtrain from the commiſſion of this dreadful crime; it would be the dictate of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

THE commutation of the puniſhment of death, for ſolitary confinement and conſtant labor, which ſome legiſlatures have adopted is a dictate of mercy as well as juſtice. And as it gives offenders an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to reflect upon their crimes and to reform; it is to be hoped will be more effectual to reſtrain bold tranſgreſſors, than even the puniſhment of death.
<note n="*" place="bottom">The legiſlatures of Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut have adopted this humane and wiſe method of puniſhment. Felons are confined, ſome for life, and others for terms proportioned to the nature of their crimes. In Connecticut, a deep open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the bowels of a mountain in the town of Simsbury, was formerly made for the purpoſe of digging copper ore.

            <p>THIS precept forbids private or perſonal revenge for any real or imaginary injury. Whether a perſon prompted by a malicious ſpirit of revenge wiſhes miſchief to another, or by ſecret arts aims at the deſtruction of his comfort or life, he is a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in the ſight of God, and falls under the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this law. Unreſtrained anger leads to the commiſſion of this greateſt crime of man againſt man. And as ſuch, it has annexed to it, the moſt ſhameful, dreadful puniſhment: univerſal horror and untimely death, from the hands of men, and the wrath of almighty God, in the world to come. So we come,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the great and aggrevated guilt of this ſin. So precious in the ſight of God is the life of man, that in the laws delivered to the jews, the ox or other beaſt, that had killed a man, was to be put to death, and its fleſh to be held in abomination. The reaſon given in that law, why one man may not put another to death, is, that in the image of God, made he man. There was ſomething divine, originally in man, and his life is ſacred. Man's
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028999_0187_0FDDD1A64F2F5FF8"/>life here, is the beginning and the preparation of an exiſtence, which will probably be commenſurate in duration, with the exiſtence of the eternal Jehovah. He, who deprives another of life, is guilty of the greateſt robbery towards God,—injuſtice and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards a fellow immortal, the higheſt offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſociety,—and the greateſt folly and madneſs towards himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE murderer is guilty of robbery towards God. All creatures are the abſolute property of God. In him they live, and move, and have their being; and God only, has a right to diſpoſe of their lives. He alone may kill or keep alive, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his permiſſion and direction, none may lawfully deprive another of life. He who takes the life of another, boldly attempts to take him out of the hands of God, out of whoſe, hands, none can deliver. It is robbing God of a ſubject, a child, a ſervant whom he hath ſent into this world, and to whom he hath aſſigned his work and labor, during an appointed time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is an act of the greateſt injuſtice and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards a fellow creature: as it deprives him of that life which his creator gave him, and which he only can rightly take away. It is an injury for which the offender can make no ſatisfaction. It cuts off the ſufferer from the poſſeſſion of life and all his earthly comforts. It is an injury great beyond all calculation, as it deprives him of the time and advantages of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for death and eternal ſcenes, and it may be preventing of his eternal ſalvation. He is ſuddenly deprived of an opportunity of making his peace with God. It is an irreparable injury to the friends of the deceaſed, as it deprives them of a brother, a fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a ſon, on whom perhaps they depended for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028999_0188_0FDDD1A652CFEB00"/>It is a violation of that law of our nature which obliges us to love our fellow men and to do them good and not evil, and purſue their peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is an high handed offence againſt ſociety, as it deprives the community of a member; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt magiſtracy and the laws of the community.— It is to wreſt the ſword of juſtice from the hand of authority, and trample upon human and divine laws.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE murderer is guilty of the greateſt folly and madneſs towards himſelf. He does himſelf, event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually a greater injury, if poſſible, than is done to the ſufferer. He deſtroys his own peace and happineſs, plants the daggers of ſelf torment within him, and feels a thouſand wounds, for the wound which he hath given: he ſeeks for death as a refuge, and plunges into hell.</p>
            <p>OTHER public crimes againſt the laws of God and ſociety are puniſhed according to their demerit: but the ſpecial juſtice, and wrath of God and man, are executed upon ſuch great offenders. The blood of Abel cried to heaven from the ground, demanding vengeance. It has a voice which is heard to heaven, and which alſo makes the conſcience of the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hear and tremble. Human juſtice uſually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes ſuch dreadful ſinners in this world. "As they have done to others, ſo God hath requited them." Such is the horror of mind following the commiſſion of this crime, that murderers have ſometimes ſought relief by a public confeſſion, and ſurrender of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the hands of juſtice. The laſhes of a tormenting conſcience have extorted a confeſſion of guilt and a wiſh for death. "Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and hearken to my ſpeech: for I
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028999_0189_0FDDD1A7ED0540D8"/>have ſlain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt." And the firſt murderer Cain, under the preſſure of terrors of conſcience, exclaims, "my puniſhment is greater than I can bear." Their thoughts are continually diſturbed with the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unnatural deed, and the imaginary ghoſt of the ſufferer, and the terrors of the almighty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract them. Thus dreadful is the guilt of taking the life of another, and equally dreadful is the crime of taking away one's own life. The crime of ſuicide, is loaded with the aggravations juſt mentioned, and with this additional evil to the criminal, that it cuts him off from all opportunity of repentance for that great ſin; for after death there is no room for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>THE laws of God have penalties annexed to them, of puniſhments in this world; but as the ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer puts himſelf beyond the reach of puniſhment here, it remains to be taken cognizance of in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. This crime therefore is not expreſsly mentioned, altho' it is included in the precept under conſideration. And this precept is broken whether a perſon deprives himſelf, or another of life; and perhaps the firſt is the greateſt crime, becauſe the moſt unnatural of the two. The guilt of this ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a perſon's being in the poſſeſſion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reaſon, and wilfully and deliberately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it. Whether it is done in the heat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication of paſſion, or as the effect of malice afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, it is murder, in the view of the moral law; altho' it may be conſidered very differently, in the view of the civil law. Where a perſon is accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of the death of another, having not an intention of injury, ſuch a death, called chance med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, comes not under the condemnation of this law. When this however happened under the law of
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028999_0190_0FDDD1A94E3DA140"/>Moſes, the accidental man-ſlayer, was obliged to fly to the neareſt city of refuge, and there continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>until the death of the High Prieſt; deſigned perhaps to teach that this ſin, which might be committed, thro' want of due care and attention, as well as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſins, were to be atoned for by the death of Jeſus, our great High Prieſt, who was to come into the world. To the queſtion whether a murderer can be ſaved; it may be replied, that we have ground to conclude, that but few of this deſcription are ſaved. For they whoſe hearts are ſo hardened againſt their fellow men, are alſo hardened againſt God. Altho' to teach us the greatneſs of the divine mercy, and that we are not to limit the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace of God, we find on facred record, that there are inſtances of murderers to whom the grace of repentence was given, and they obtained mercy: as David and Paul, and ſome of the murderers of Jeſus. But it is alſo to be conſidered that ſome of theſe did it ignorantly, and thro' blind zeal for God; or the force of impetuous luſts and temptations. We come,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, to the conſideration of the great duty of ſelf-government, and bringing our ſpirits, our appetites and paſſions into ſubjection to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religion, that thro' grace we may be guarded from all advances towards the ſins prohibited, and cultivate the oppoſite virtues.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT the aid of aſſiſting grace, our depraved hearts, alas, too readily cheriſh the malignant paſſions of anger and revenge, againſt thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us. If theſe paſſions exiſt in the heart and are cheriſhed there, altho' they do not break out into acts of violence, yet are they a tranſgreſſion of this law in the ſight of God, who demands of us, love
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028999_0191_0FDDD1FA50CABC90"/>and kindneſs towards the perſons of our fellow-men, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy; but I ſay unto you love your enemies and do good to them that perſecute you."

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of our offences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN the government of our paſſions in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with mankind, our firſt duty is to ſuppreſs ſinful anger. Our bleſſed Lord, in explaining this precept of the law, Matthew fifth, hath ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that cauſeleſs anger is a violation of it. "Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill:—but I ſay unto you that whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe is in danger of the judgment." It alſo forbids all raſh and unguarded expreſſions. Anger is ſinful when it exiſts without cauſe; when it boils in the heart and ſeeks revenge: when it terminates on the perſon of the offender, rather than on the ſin. The Apoſtle directs chriſtians to govern the paſſion of anger: "be ye angry and ſin not." This implies that all anger is not ſin, or that there is ſometimes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a juſt and ſinleſs anger; and alſo the danger which we are in, of permitting juſtifiable anger againſt the ſins and vices of men, to run to ſuch an extreme as makes it criminal: "Let not the ſun go down upon your wrath." For by indulgence it will terminate in revenge. We are carefully to watch and guard but paſſions, leſt our lawful anger and deteſtation againſt the wickedneſs of others ſhould become criminal. Anger is juſtifiable only when ſin is its object; when it ſhews a proper reſentment at the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028999_0192_0FDDD1FBB1E5C208"/>conduct of the wicked and profane, either againſt God,—the honor of religion,—and their injurous treatment of ourſelves or others. Sinleſs anger in theſe caſes is attended with pity to the perſon of the offender, and a diſpoſition to ſeek his beſt good. Jeſus prayed for his murderers, "father forgive them." He reproved his diſciples for their ſinful anger, when on his paſſing with them, thro' an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable village of the Samaritans, the inhabitants offered him an affront, which the diſciples greatly reſented; and aſked his permiſſion for fire to fall from heaven and deſtroy them. Jeſus reproved them, ſaying, "ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of."</p>
            <p>UNDER the regulation of a religious principle, anger is lawful, as when the honor of God, or of religion; our own, or the reputation, intereſts or lives of others, are injured by the wickedneſs of men. It is a religious duty in ſuch caſes, to manifeſt a proper reſentment; but anger is ſinful when it cheriſhes revenge. Revenge ſeeks the deſtruction of the offender, rather than his reformation, and is moſt oppoſite to a religious temper. "For if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your father in heaven forgive your treſpaſſes." Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained anger is furious and hateful; it degrades the dignity of a man to the condition of a wild beaſt. See a man in the paroxiſm of this infernal paſſon: his body ſwells with inward rage ſeeking for vent: deathlike paleneſs or flaming redneſs disfigure his face; his eyes dart fire, and ſeem to ſtart from their ſockets; his teeth gnaſh; his jaws foam; his ſight grows dim, and his hearing deafens; his parched throat utters hoarſe and broken ſentences; his hands clench and ſtrike together with involuntary violence; his feet ſtamp the ground; his ſoul is a whirlwind,

            <p>THE perſon who cultivates a peaceable and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving diſpoſition, will cautiouſly ſhun contentions and litigations: he will recede and give up to his adverſary ſome things which he might lawfully claim, rather than contend; and ſtudy for peace, rather than inſiſt on extreme right. The compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which a perſon commonly receives for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of contending much at law with his neighbors, are mortifying attendance,—loſs of precious time,—the agitation of paſſions, hope and fear, hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,—his moral ſenſe of right and wrong, truth and falſehood,—the loſs of credit,—the hatred and contempt of good men,—the waiting of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by every freſh law ſuit which he engages in—the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028999_0194_0FDDD204C3DBD2D0"/>entailment of beggery to his family, and probably endleſs ruin to himſelf.</p>
            <p>THIS precept enjoins the government of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal appetites; for by the intemperate indulgence of theſe, thoſe criminal paſſions are inflamed, which impel men to injure others and themſelves. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands moderation and temperence in diet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns gluttony and drunkenneſs. Drunkenneſs is the ſource of innumerable evils. Of all the arts which men have invented to degrade themſelves, this is the moſt effectual. Its effects, when it becomes a ſettled habit, are fatal. It deprives a perſon of his reaſon, the perfection and glory of man; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces him to a breathing carcaſe without a ſoul, and to a level with the brute that periſheth. This ſin diſqualifies a perſon for ſociety and the neceſſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and duties of life. Some of the ancient philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophers, ſometimes permitted their ſlaves to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, that their children, by ſeeing the odious vice, might early learn to deteſt it. And what a deſpicable figure does the drunkard make? his drowſy eyes ſtupidly ſtare,—"his tongue faulters— his lips quiver—his hands ſhake,"—his knees bend under the weight of his wreathing body,—his ſtomach heaves,—but decency forbids the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the moſt melancholy conſideration, is that as the rational faculties are ſtupified by a habit of intemperance, the perſon cannot be made to ſee the evil and ruinous nature and effects of this vice. It is the ſource of contention and wounds without cauſe, and untimely death. The perſon who by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication deprives himſelf of reaſon, is juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the crimes committed in that condition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had the power of refraining from intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drink. All other fleſhly luſts which deſtroy the peace, health and life of ourſelves and others, are
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028999_0195_0FDDD206901003C8"/>forbidden by this precept; which alſo makes it our duty to cultivate and practiſe the oppoſite virtues; as benevolence, meekneſs, mercy and forgiveneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, and temperence and ſobriety towards ourſelves.</p>
            <p>THE government of the tongue is an important, moral, and religious duty. It is a little member; but capable of doing much good or harm. It is the outlet of the paſſions, and ſhould ever be under the controul of diſcretion. "Speak evil of no man," is a general rule of government for the tongue. All ſlander and evil ſpeaking are ſeverely prohibited by the moral and divine law. This vice is repeatedly reprobated in the new teſtament, and the practiſe of a kind and benevolent ſpeech and behaviour forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recommended. The moral ſocial and relative duties of life, this precept obliges us to practiſe from the threefold conſideration of duty to God, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ourſelves. "Be patient towards all men; ſee that none render evil for evil to any man. Avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay ſaith the Lord. If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink; for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head." Theſe are coals which will not burn him, but melt him down into kindneſs, if he poſſeſſes the ſpirit of a man.</p>
            <p>THUS have we conſidered the nature and guilt of the ſins prohibited by this precept, and our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to preſerve the life, the health and happineſs of ourſelves and our fellow-men. Before I conclude, I would remark that the precept, "thou ſhalt not kill," is a general precept, and to be underſtood of our fellow-men; yet alſo, does it include the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028999_0196_0FDDD207B8E5C7D8"/>of killing wantonly and for ſport, any innocent animal. The great proprietor of his creatures, has given us permiſſion to kill any of the animals of the air, the earth and ſea, which are neceſſary for our food and nouriſhment; and without ſuch permiſſion, it would be unlawful for us to put any of them to death, except in defence of our own lives. Let us guard againſt every degree of cruelty and inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity towards the inferior creatures which God hath ſubjected to the dominion of man.</p>

Mortify the fleſhly and unmanly appetites. Indulge not the iraſcible paſſions, they will ſtrengthen with years. If you are wrathful when young, your paſſions will be a torment to you, and intolerable to others, when you are old. Beware of the vice of intemperance, which, like that of revengeful anger, becomes by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence a confirmed habit, from which, inſtances of reformation are not often ſeen.

            <p>THIS conciſe law reſpects the virtue and duty of chaſtity. By our Saviour's expoſition of it, we are taught that it is a very extenſive law, and given to regulate the emotions and paſſions of the mind, as well as the external behaviour.</p>

            <p>THE obligations of mankind to the virtue of chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, is inforced by a ſolemn prohibition of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite vice. This as well as other moral duties are delivered in negative precepts, forbidding ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the proclivity of our depraved nature to leap the bounds of duty, rather than to practiſe it. Hence our obligations to practiſe the poſitive du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are more forcibly taught and felt, than they would be, by poſitive precepts. They are included in the prohibition of evil doing. The ſin here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned is the ſource of manifold evils to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor and to ſociety. Our bleſſed Lord in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine expoſition of the decalogue,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> vi.</note> has taught us that this law extends to the thoughts and deſires of the heart, as well as to external behaviour: and as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands purity of thought, it deſtroys the evil at its ſource. "Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not commit adultery. But I ſay unto you that whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." In the conſideration of the ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by this law, let us paſs by thoſe enormous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations of it which brought down the wrath of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the ancient people of the plains, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire. The ſame beaſtly luſts were alſo practiſed by the more poliſhed pagans of Greece and Rome; when men and women leaving

            <p n="1">1. ADULTERY is forbidden. In the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the terms adultery and fornication are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed promiſcuouſly, in other places a diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This ſin is a violation of the vow of fidelity and a diſſolution of the marriage covenant. It is an irreparable damage to the injured party, and attended with extenſive evils to ſociety.

It faſtens the guilt of perjury on the conſcience of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and has generally been held in abhorence, even by uncivilized nations.

2. THIS precept forbids the ſin of polygamy. As divine providence, hath made the ſexes nearly equal in number, hence the law of nature, teaches the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and propriety of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> one woman only uniting in the marriage relation. This duty is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught by that divine providence, which, at the creation made but one woman for Adam, and united them as one in the marriage covenant. Since the ſexes are equal, to multipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wives would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to thoſe who muſt neceſſarily be deprived of any,—degrade the female character, and introduce diſcord and diviſions in fami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es.</p>
            <p>I am aware that the examples of ſome of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, both before and after the delivery of the law, has been alledged in juſtification of polygamy; Abraham and Jacob, David, Solomon and others, had each a plurality of wives. They were eminent men and favorite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of heaven. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> practice was a violation of the law of nature, why was it permitted, and why not expreſsly diſallowed? To this it may be replied, that altho' there was no expreſs revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in early times relative to this matter, yet that it was wrong, as before obſerved, might have been infered from the creation of the original pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and the equal number of the ſexes, in all ages; and God might ſuffer this evil, as he ſuffered the jews to put away their wives for various inferior cauſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardneſs of men's hearts, and their incapacity, in thoſe ages of infancy in knowledge, to receive a more pure law. When our Saviour condemned the cuſtom of the jews in putting away their wives for every cauſe, and marrying others, he refers them, for correction of this ſin, to the original inſtitution of marriage, ſaying, "it was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſo from the beginning." Had the inſtitution of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy been lawful, it would ſeem never more
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028999_0203_0FDDD219D26945A8"/>needed than at the creation, when a world was to be populated: but God then created but one woman for one man. "For this cauſe, ſhall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife." Our duty, in many things, is to be deduced by inference from the ordering of providence, and the conduct of the Deity towards men; although nothing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly revealed.</p>
            <p>THE moral evil of this practice was alſo to be learned from its unhappy tendency to excite the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and malevolent paſſions and claſhing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of various wives and children of one huſband. And they who indulged themſelves in this liberty, uſually ſmarted for their libidinous pleaſures, in the diſcord of their compound families. This we find in the contentions of Sarah and Hagar, Iſaac and Iſhmael in the family of Abraham: and the breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Joſeph, in the family of Jacob. Similar unhappy effects ſprung from the ſame cauſe, in the families of David and Solomon. The faults of pious men are recorded in the bible, not for our imitation; but warning. Polygamy was a ſin which was then winked at; but now would be criminal; becauſe, by divine revelation, it is forbidden.</p>
            <p n="3">3. INCEST is a ſin condemned by this law. This trime can be committed only by thoſe who are of near affinity or conſanguinity; as between parents and children, brothers and ſiſters. The laws of Moſes particularly prohibit marriage between near blood relatives. One deſign of this law was to guard the chaſtity of the members of a family, who being accuſtomed to habits of intimacy, might be induced to tranſgreſs the laws of chaſtity, did not the divine authority interpoſe, and forbid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage connection. Another reaſon of this law may
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028999_0204_0FDDD220B40E5AE0"/>be to extend and enlarge the benevolence of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> kind by the union of different and diſtant families in the marriage relation.</p>
            <p>LEGISLATURES of nations have eſtabliſhed differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent laws regulating this important contract. Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of the judicial law of Moſes, have alſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtood the law, relative to the marriage of brother and ſiſter-in-law; Leviticus eighteenth: "Neither ſhalt thou take a wife to her ſiſter, to vex her, to uncover her nakedneſs, beſides the other in her life time." A degree of obſcurity covers this paſſage, which has puzzled expoſitors. Some ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the woman taken is the natural ſiſter of the wife, and that the huſband is forbidden to marry her, while his wife, her ſiſter, is ſtill living; and that the law does not forbid him to marry her after the deceaſe of his wife. Some underſtand by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a near or diſtant relative, agreeably to the latitude in which the terms ſiſter and brother are ſometimes uſed, and that the precept condemns polygamy, eſpecially when a man reſorts to it with the malicious deſign to vex and puniſh the wife: a different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the original is given, "Thou ſhalt not take one wife to another, to vex her." But on the other hand, it is obſerved, that the law condemns mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages between relatives leſs nearly allied; as between a man and his brother's widow, verſe ſixteenth. Altho' we find this law was in one caſe diſpenſed with. To marry a half ſiſter, is alſo prohibited.— Perhaps we ſhall not be in an error, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome of the precepts of the levitical law relating to the marriage of corelatives, as political rather than moral precepts, and as calculated with peculiar reference to the oeconomy of that diſpenſation, until the coming of Chriſt. But whether the precept relating to the marriage of the wife's ſiſter, or the
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028999_0205_0FDDD222F4F80B18"/>huſband's brother, is of this kind, I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to determine. The law of nature teaches us that marriages of ſuch near conſanguinity as tend to introduce confuſion in families and ſociety, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. The glory of God and the happineſs of mankind are the great end of the inſtitution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. FORNICATION is a violation of this precept of the law. It is a ſin committed by two unmarried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the oppoſite ſexes. The evils conſequent on fornication, are great to ſociety, and to the parties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to ſociety. The well being and happineſs of ſociety depends on the well ordering and education of families. But the promiſcuous intercourſe of the ſexes, as it is a diſcouragement to marria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, defeats the good inſtitution of family order. A great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive to honorable marriage is allayed by a lawleſs intercourſe, and the community is deprived of thoſe advantages which it derives from the lawful marriage of its members and the orderly education of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Its evil effects are extenſive and pernicious; as it deſtroys the moral principle, and throws down the barriers againſt other vices. The criminal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of the ſexes, is the beginning of an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and abandoned life; for it incapaciates the mind to diſcern (in many important caſes) the difference between right and wrong, and good and evil in moral conduct. By habitude in this vice, the mind becomes fleſhly, and ſottiſh to the things which are "lovely, juſt, honeſt and of good report." He who caſts off a regard to his own chaſtity, and the chaſtity of the female, on the preſervation of which depends her reputation, peace and comfort in the world, contemns the law of nature and order of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and is deſtitute of the reverence and fear of
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028999_0206_0FDDD22439B23BB0"/>God. Let the libertine reflect a mornent on the conſequences; ſhould this vicious in egularity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come common and univerſal. What a diſordered world of ſenſuality, confuſion and miſery, would it produce? The enkindled wrath of heaven did once interpoſe to purge the earth from this dreadful pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. The tranſgreſſor, perhaps, deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the imagination, that his example can do but little harm; but it is a falſe and vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince it is a vice ruinous to individuals, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the order and peace of families, and injurous to ſociety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ITS evils are great to the parties. To be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the paths of chaſtity is, eſpecially to the female, an irreparable injury. Chaſtity is the ornament and dignity of the female character. The loſs of it, is the loſs of reputation and peace. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of the proſpect of an advantageous and bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crable marriage, which they once had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect. It lowers them in their own, and the eſteem of their virtuous acquaintance. And altho' they may obtain on repentance, forgiveneſs with God, yet a cenſorious world will not forgive. The wound rankles in their own breaſt, and the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollection is painful. It is a grief and diſhonor to the family and friends of the unfortunate female, but eſpecially to the virtuous parent. The heart bleeds at the loſs of the virtue of a beloved child. It is an injury which wealth cannot repair. Great is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and dignity of female chaſtity, to their honor and uſefulneſs in life and peace indeath. Let the fair daughters ſacredly guard this amiable and dignified virtue, by avoiding a needleſs diſplay of real or fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charms invi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing looſe deſires, and may they culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a meekneſs of ſpirit and modeſty of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which can never fail to recommend them to the deſerving, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſe and the good.</p>

               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:028999_0207_0FDDD225E253F6C0"/>
THE ſin of the guilty ſeducer, who deſtroys the innocency and chaſtity of the virtuous female, is great. The malignity and hurtful conſequences of this ſin reach to limits beyond calculation; invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ruin of a virtuous female, depriving the community of a valuable head of a family, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a laſting wound to friends. And ſhould the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male under the preſſure of this misfortune, take to abandoned courſes, and periſh eternally, the guilt of her ruin will fall upon the head of the criminal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer. Capital puniſhments have been inflicted on crimes leſs enormous, than the crime of ſeduction.— The number of bold tranſgreſſors of this claſs, would probably be ſmall, were they, when known, ſhunned and diſcountenanced by the virtuous fair, with that neglect and contempt which crimes againſt female chaſtity juſtly merit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE violations of this command are ruinous to the bodies and ſouls of men. Some have fallen vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to this ſin in the midſt of life. "Many ſtrong men have been caſt down by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, uſeful and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the world, have been outcaſts of ſociety and periſhed in want and infamy.</p>
            <p>THIS crime was awfully common among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nations of Canaan; for which ſin, as expreſſed by the prophet, the land vomitted out its inhabitants. It was alſo the prevailing ſin of the heathen nations who once inhabited the favored regions where we now dwell, and on account of which the beſom of deſtruction hath ſwept them away.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle mentions this ſin as committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the body. "Flee fornication. Every ſin that a man doth is without the body." Other ſins againſt
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028999_0208_0FDDD227697F9C88"/>men are external; they reach and terminate upon others; "but he that commiteth fornication, ſinneth againſt his own body." It is a crime committed againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>THAT our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has redeemed our bodies as well as our ſouls, ſhould be to us a moſt perſwaſive motive to uſe them as holy temples for the reſidence of his bleſſed ſpirit; and the members thereof as inſtruments of righteouſneſs, of chaſtity and every virtue.</p>
            <p>THIS vice is ruinous to the ſouls of men. "The carnal mind is enmity againſt God; and to be carnally minded is death." There is no ſin equal to this to detach the heart from God, and harden it againſt the duties of religion. It is inſenſible to conviction of the truth, and dead to the duties of piety. "She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth." "Whoſo commiteth adultery, lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth underſtanding: he that doth it deſtroys his own ſoul. A wound and diſhonor ſhall he get: and his reproach ſhall not be wiped away. The houſe of this ſin, is the way to hell, and goeth down to the chambers of death."</p>
            <p>IT is a ſin, perhaps beyond any other ſin, effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to prevent the good effects of the means of grace, in the ſalvation of the ſouls of men. In vain do the terrors of God's broken law, ſound the dreadful peal of vengeance on the ſenſual mind. In vain do the mercies of a bleeding Saviour call ſuch ſinners to repentance and ſalvation; for this unclean ſin indulged, takes away the heart from God, and from an awakened ſenſibility to future and eternal ſcenes. From every defiling ſin, may the mercy of God preſerve us pure and blameleſs, thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>HAVING ſpoken of the nature and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the complicated ſin, prohibited by this precept, we come</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the conſideration of the duty and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of watchfulneſs againſt all enticements and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations thereto. While in the body, perſons are to expect that the virtue of chaſtity will be attacked, either by the emotions of ſin within, or temptations from without. God has made it our duty, and our own peace and purity of mind require, that, with perſevering conſtancy, we reſiſt all temptations to every degree of the ſin forbidden, and love and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the oppoſite virtues; and gracious encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given, that perſeverence, in the virtuous conflict, ſhall be crowned with unſpeakable profit and pleaſure. To this trial of virtue, the young in life are eſpecially called. May the minds of blooming youth be fortified with the principles of virtue and religion; with the love and fear of God, and reverence of the divine authority. This princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happily eſtabliſhed in the heart, will be the moſt effectual ſecurity againſt this and every known tranſgreſſior of the divine law, and the animating
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028999_0210_0FDDD2310C9DC450"/>motive to univerſal duty. Temptations to this ſin ariſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. FROM the evil propenſities of the heart. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> fountain of all evil. "From within, out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, fornication."—The depraved, unreſtrained heart, cheriſhes this and other defiling luſts. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are directed to mortify their affections that are upon the earth, and which, reign in our earthly ſenſual nature, and all the propenſities thereto. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very virtuous mind is enliſted in this warfare, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating every fleſhly luſt that wars againſt its inward purity and peace. In the conflict with theſe boſom enemies he will not deſiſt until victory is obtained, and death releaſe him from the field. He who ſtrives with perſevering watchfulneſs, againſt the unholy deſires of the fleſh and the mind, will be happily ſecure from the great tranſgreſſion. He keeps under the body, beating down, with the arms of faith and prayer, every fleſhly luſt, and bringing all its power under ſubjection to the purity of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus: he will triumph at the concluſion, ſaying, thanks be to God who giveth us the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. TO guard againſt the advances of this ſin, is to avoid all thoſe things which affect the ſenſes or imagination with impure images, and throw their luſcious and poiſonous effects upon the unguarded paſſions. Of this kind are all wanton ſongs, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt pictures, and books of obſcenity. They offend againſt the laws of decency; and the young unguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart is in danger of receiving the impreſſion of looſe and vicious thought. Novels, plays and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical exhibitions, which adorn vice in the ſtolen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, are hurtful to morals. They give
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028999_0211_0FDDD232AA277160"/>the inexperienced falſe notions of real life, and of virtue and vice; and lead to ruin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WANTON dalliance, and indecent familiarity of the ſexes,—"chambering and wontonneſs," are cloſſed by the Apoſtle, with the groſs ſins of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, envyings and ſtrife, and are to be equally avoided, by every one who would preſerve purity and peace of mind.</p>
            <p>THE commonneſs of the ſin of fornication, is perhaps pleaded by ſome as an extenuation of its guilt. But the commonneſs of a ſin increaſes its guilt, and more ſpeedily brings down the aggravated doom. "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there are who go in thereat." Tho' ſinners join hand in hand, to keep each other in countenance, in guilt; yet will the judgements of the almighty find them out.— Tho' the claſs of bold tranſgreſſors is numerous; yet the place of puniſhment is broad and large. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates in guilt will afford to each other no ſoothing comfort, when the terrors of the almighty ſhall wound their ſpirits; or his wrath overwhelm them, in the world to come. The commonneſs of the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, did not ward off the ſtorms of fiery ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, from the cities of the plains; and compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in guilt will be mutual tormentors in hell.— There the rich man, in vain, petitioned that his brethren might not come to that place of torment. He dreaded the ſociety of the once jovial companions of his ſins.</p>
            <p>THE tempter of ſouls ſuggeſts that fornication is a ſecret ſin and will not be known. Conſcious of guilt, the tranſgreſſor ſeeks to hide this ſin from the eyes of the world; but perſiſting in it, glories in his ſhame, with unbluſhing impudence. But tho' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028999_0212_0FDDD234129A9A90"/>from men; it cannot be concealed from the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iſcient eye of God: to whom the night ſhineth as the day. Tho' "the eye of the adulterer wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the twilight, ſaying no eye ſhall ſee me;" yet cannot the thickeſt darkneſs hide him from that all ſeeing eye, which will bring all his works into judgment. This ſin is a bold defiance of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God, who ſays to the tranſgreſſor, "even I know, and am witneſs, ſaith the Lord." A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſs, in that day when the unclean tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor's ſins ſhall be brought to light, in the view of angeſs and men; "when he ſhall walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame."</p>
            <p>THE abandoned woman is repreſented by Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as uſing with ſhameleſs hypocriſy, the maſk of religion to draw, to her fatal ſnares, the unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious youth.

            <p>THUS the ſin which this precept condemns, is the ſource of complicated and numerous evils; and ought to be ſhuned as a moſt ruinous vice, by all who would prize the favor of almighty God the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace of their own minds, and their eternal happineſs. We have ſeen that it is deſtructive of the order and happineſs of ſociety, that it opens the door to almoſt every other tranſgreſſion, and is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed with a profane and abandoned life. It is a ſin which defiles and hardens the conſcience, and dooms the impenitent to the incenſed vengeance of almighty God.</p>
            <p>As a remedy againſt the ſins of fornication, and every degree of violation of this divine precept, God has been pleaſed to ordain marriage: "marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undeſiled." It is alſo a divine command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="unknown:028999_0214_0FDDD23C4BFB3320"/>
THE advantages and comforts of the connubial connections are great and the bleſſing of heaven at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the inſtitution; eſpecially on thoſe "who marry in the Lord," or enter into that ſtate, with a lively ſenſe of their dependence on God, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs to him. By this inſtitution the increaſe and happineſs of mankind, the order of ſociety, the virtuous education of families, the ſtability of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and encouragements to induſtry and every ſocial virtue, are promoted. But the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant end of this ſacred inſtitution is that the huſband and the wife may mutually aſſiſt each other in honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God on earth, and preparing for that bleſſed and holy ſociety in heaven, "where they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are equal unto the angels, being the children of God." I am,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, to ſpeak of the advantages and pleaſures attendant on the virtue of chaſtity. The profits and pleaſures of a life of chaſtity are oppoſed to the loſs and miſeries of a life of lewdneſs. Chaſtity is the moſt ornamental and amiable virtue of the fair. Purity of mind and modeſty of behaviour, which adorn the ſemale character, an inſpired apoſtle earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly recommends: eſpecially to women who profeſs the pure religion of Jeſus: "That women alſo adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel with ſhameface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſobriety." By this virtue, that honorable and unſpotted reputation is acquired, which, eſpecially to the ſemale, is more valuable than riches, and fairer than rubies. To men of virtue and worth, it is a recommendation preferable to honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pedigree or wealth. It has elevated women from cottages to thrones, and to the love and veneration of all. The vicious, themſelves, rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence female chaſtity, and are abaſhed in its preſence. To preſerve this treaſure, every occaſion and incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028999_0215_0FDDD23C50F66458"/>to impure deſires; all aſſociation and familiarity with vicious characters, are to be ſhuned; and the pureſt principles for regulating the thoughts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, imbibed and cultivated.</p>
            <p>THE perſon who is fearful of offending, and deſirous to pleaſe his maker, and preſerve the peace and dignity of his own mind, will not only totally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtain from the groſſer crimes of adultery and fornication; but from every degree of uncleanneſs, either with himſelf or others; and maintain his body in ſanctification and honor. And in the conjugal ſtate, will uſe its lawful enjoyments with that moderation and temperance, for which it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; and not as an incentive, but a remedy to laſciviouſneſs. "It reſtrains ſays one, not only from groſſer acts; but ſets a guard upon the eyes, the hands, the tongue and the imagination." It is a virtue which keeps the paſſions and faculties of the body in due ſubjection to reaſon and religion, and preſerves purity and peace in the inner man. The thoughts are raiſed above low and inferior pleaſures, and the ſoul enobled by the contemplation of the pureſt and ſublimeſt objects, and by daily prayer and communion with the father of ſpirits. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with ſome inferences from this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE learn the importance and amiableneſs of the virtue of chaſtity; and the neceſſity of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and cheriſhing purity of thought, ſpeech and behaviour, at all times and on all occaſions. And that to guard againſt the violation of this pure virtue, the avenues of the heart muſt be ſhut and barred againſt every impure deſire. "Keep thy heart," is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given us, "keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life." Say to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding luſtful thought, "be gone; thou art an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028999_0216_0FDDD23DC09D2E48"/>to me. I cannot allow thee room in my heart and be innocent. Thou comeſt as a deceitful gueſt to betray and ruin me." The mind thus reſolute in virtue, humbly depending on the aids of grace, will maintain its integrity, and rejoice in victory, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its moſt ſubtle and dangerous enemy.</p>
            <p>WHEN expoſed by the enticements of the vicious, the temptations of the world, or the propenſities of a depraved nature; it behoves perſons to be partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly watchful over themſelves, and reſiſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of this ſin. They ſhould renew as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, their virtuous reſolutions, and ſeek for aid from heaven; as did that pious man Job; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "I have made a covenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I look upon a maid."</p>
            <p n="2">2. To guard againſt all degrees of this ſin, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould ſhun idleneſs. Idleneſs is the foe of chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and every virtue. Diligence in buſineſs, as it finds employment for time and the thoughts, is a preventative of this ſin.

            <p>IDLENESS and intemperance are vices nearly allied, they lead to laſciviouſneſs; they brought ruin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sodom. "Behold this was the iniquity of thy ſiſter Sodom, pride, fulneſs of bread and abundance

            <p n="3">3. THIS ſubject, in the extenſive view which we have taken of it, is intereſting to perſons of all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and ages, but to none more than thoſe who are in blooming days of youth, whoſe imaginations are ardent in the expectations of the pleaſures of life. To you, younger brethren and friends, allow me to addreſs a few words of benevolent advice, the dictate of a ſincere deſire for your temporal welfare and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs. To preſerve your virtue undefiled, and ſecure you from every defiling ſin, let me direct your thoughts to God, your conſtant dependence, and obligations to him. Be much in prayer to the God and guide of your youthful days, that his effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious grace and all animating goodneſs, may guard you eſpecially from the ſin, in all its branches which this holy law diſallows, and enable you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a virgin chaſtity in all your thoughts and in all your behaviour. By living near to God in youth, you will preſerve a pure mind in a pure body, and keep your garments unſpotted from the world and the fleſh. You will happily know the bleſſedneſs of "the pure and undefiled, who walk in the law of the Lord."</p>
            <p>BY exerciſing yourſelves in the duties of piety, in reading, meditation and prayer, you will ſweetly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the fulfilment of his gracious promiſe, "to keep them in all their way who commit themſelves to him." Make the word of God your ſtudy; and the divine and animating promiſes ſcattered thro' the ſacred volume, the pleaſing ſubject of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and daily meditation. "When wiſdom enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleaſant unto
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028999_0218_0FDDD246D1EA5590"/>thy ſoul, diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall keep thee, to deliver thee from the way of evil men,—and from the ſtrange woman that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with her words, which forſaketh the guide of her youth and forgeteth the covenant of her God, for her houſe inclineth unto death:—that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous."</p>
            <p>LET a ſolemn ſenſe of the preſence of God, be deeply and perpetually impreſſed upon your minds, as the moſt powerful ſecurity againſt tranſgreſſion.— Thus fortified by a principle of virtue, tho' aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as was once a pious Joſeph in the houſe of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipher; with chriſtian heroiſm you will overcome; ſaying, "how can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?" Thus guarded againſt this deſiling ſin, you will readily ſhun all indecent familiarity and every degree of wantonneſs. You will maintain a a modeſty and manlineſs of deportment, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all your thoughts and converſation. And may it pleaſe God, who liberally diſpenſes his grace to them that aſk, to ſtrengthen your youthful reſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHILE I would faithfully warn the youth, in the language of the apoſtle, to "flee fornication," and all degrees of unchaſtity; and affectionately invite them to the practice of virtue; I cannot refrain from expreſſing a fear, that in too many inſtances the guils of the more ſcandalous violations of this divine law, by thoſe in younger life, lies at the door of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent perents: Who, like indulgent Eli, ſuffer their children to be vile without reproof. Are there not families in this chriſtian land, in which the name of
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028999_0219_0FDDD2485091BEB8"/>God is rarely mentioned, except in profane diſcourſe, and his worſhip unknown—in which children are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to grow up in ignorance of the duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in the practice of vice; in idleneſs, in night walking, and other vices which lead on to the great tranſgreſſion. Let parents recollect that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are committed to them as a ſolemn charge;— and that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>MAY the leſſons of wiſdom find welcome acceſs to all our minds, and the grace of God preſerve us from evil. May the riſing generation conſecrate their youthful vigor of body and mind, to the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of him who died for them and hath called them into his holy kingdom: and O moſt divine and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Saviour! who will ſay at the laſt day, to his faithful friends, "He that overcometh, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my ſon." In the hope of this bleſſedneſs, with humble dependance on his efficacious grace, let us keep his commandments with a pure heart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable life, through Jeſus Chriſt, our only Lord and Redeemer.</p>

            <p>THIS precept of the law immediately reſpects the worldly property of mankind. It implies that it is the will of God that men ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which they may excluſively call their own.— It is his gift to men, to poſſeſs, uſe and enjoy, in the way and manner which he hath been pleaſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, which are for his glory, and the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ourſelves and others. "Thou ſhalt not ſteal." Thou ſhalt not, by fraud or violence deprive another of his lawful poſſeſſions; or take his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty without his conſent. This law has a primary effect to perſonal and private property. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the owner, in certain caſes, is diſpenſed with, when the public good makes it neceſſary to invade perſonal property; but the moral law obliges the public to make compenſation.

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. MEN have temporal or worldly property, which ought to be ſacredly guarded from invaſion and plunder. All property or whatever men may call their own, is from God the ſupreme proprietor of all things; by whoſe creating power and providence, all things are brought from nothing and preſerved. All things being the abſolute property of God, his right to diſpoſe of them to whom he pleaſes, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controled. He gives earthly goods to men. He hath ſet the bounds of our habitation and divided to nations and to individuals their inheritance. By expreſs revelation, the Moſt High gave to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents of Abraham the land of Canaan; and mount Seir, to the children of Eſau. Men do not however, come into the poſſeſſion of territory or worldly property by revelation; but by the favour of providence, according to the order of nature and the laws of ſociety. Men being inveſted with prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, by the ordering of providence, for their ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, comfort and uſefulneſs; have an excluſive right thereto, and no one may diſpoſſeſs another of the goods which he has lawfully acquired. The poſſeſſion of individual property is neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of mankind, and the welfare of ſociety. Were all property in common, all things would be in confuſion,—the ſtrong would every where diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the weak, and univerſal langour and idleneſs prevail. That the laborer ſhould be entitled to the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028999_0222_0FDDD25305C29C00"/>fruits of his induſtry, is a powerful motive to perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exertion and enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>THERE are various modes or means of obtaining the rightful poſſeſſion of property, as by inheritance, will, gift, purchaſe, induſtry and enterpriſe in ſome lawful calling. What a man obtains in theſe ways, he holds, under God, as his own. They are to be uſed and employed by him, agreeably to the will of the ſovereign proprietor, who beſtows them. It is robbery in another to take poſſeſſion, without the conſent of the owner. Every man, however, who enters into or enjoys the advantages of ſociety, gives his conſent, either perſonally or otherwiſe, that his property ſhall contribute, according to certain rules, eſtabliſhed to the ſupport of the civil, moral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious inſtitutions of ſociety; becauſe by theſe his property is ſecured from invaſion, and his injuries redreſſed.</p>
            <p>THERE are other properties which men enjoy, and of which they may not be diſpoiled, ſuch as, a good name, which is more valuable than riches,— of their opportunities to do good to mankind,—of their liberty and peace, and right to worſhip God, according to their own conſciences, &amp; the advantages which providence gives to men for their progreſs in uſeful knowledge and their eternal ſalvation. He who abridges or deprives others of theſe, is a violator of this law. Men become the rightful owners of goods acquired by lawful means, and the moral law, and the laws of ſociety, give them a title to the ſole and abſolute uſe of them. Every man has a right to do as he pleaſes with his property, provided he does not counteract the benevolent purpoſes of providence in the application of its gifts.</p>

               <hi>THEFT</hi> in its groſs ſenſe is taking the goods of a man by violence. By the judicial laws of Moſes the man who killed a thief breaking into his houſe in the night, was not puniſhed. This crime is next to murder in guilt. The perſon who is attacked in the dark and filent hours devoted to repoſe, has not the advantage of defending himſelf or his property. An averſion to labour, or to honeſt induſtry, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the motive to the crimes of theft and robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. No induſtrous perſon need ſuffer thro' want in this land; where there are all poſſible encouragements to induſtry in labor, and the means of a comfortable ſubſiſtance plentiful and abundant. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cofinement and labor, for thoſe who live by plunder on the goods of others, is a puniſhment moſt ſuitable and ſalutary. Suitable for ſuch criminals, becauſe it counteracts their ruling vice, which is idleneſs; and moſt ſalutary to the community, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who have commenced hoſtility againſt mankind, ought not to go at large. This thought introduces,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE conſideration of the guilt of unlawfully invading the property of others, and of miſuſing our own. Thoſe are evils which, this precept principally intends to prevent and remedy.</p>
            <p>PROPERTY is a truſt which the ſupreme proprietor has committed to the poſſeſſor, to be uſed as he has directed, and to be accounted for, with other talents, to him who gave it. No one may lawfully take from another that betruſtment. It is an invaſion of the prerogative of the Deity, who gives or takes away. "It is the bleſſing of the Lord that maketh rich;" and his providence only may rightfully take back the goods committed to men. I ſhall mention in ſundry particulars the ways or means by which this divine law is broken.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="235" facs="unknown:028999_0224_0FDDD25A966FE198"/>
1. BY taking advantage of the ignorance, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of others, to make gain. This is a wicked "oppreſſion of the poor and him that hath no help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." To overreach another in trade or buſineſs, is not only an act of diſhoneſty and fraud committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one who is leſs knowing or ſuſpicious; but a criminal perverſion of thoſe ſuperior abilities which are given to him, who commits the injury. It is an act of ingratitude to God, and injuſtice to man. To make gain of the neceſſities of thoſe who are in ſtraits thro' want, is an act of robbery and cruelty.— It is impiety towards God and unmercifulneſs to men. Next to the ſin of oppreſſion, is that of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing compaſſion and aid to thoſe, who by the divine providence are in ſuffering circumſtances. "If a brother or a ſiſter be naked and deſtitute of daily food, and one of you ſay unto them depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled: notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?" It is a ſolemn conſideration, which ſhould arreſt the attention of all men, that our Lord, in his deſcription of the final condemnation to be paſſed upon the wicked, makes the withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of compaſſion and alms from our ſuffering brethren, and eſpecially from the poor of the houſhold of faith, the cauſe of that condemnation. "Then ſhall the judge ſay unto them on the left hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,—For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty and ye gave me no drink: a ſtranger and ye took me not in: naked and ye clothed me not: ſick, and in priſon and ye viſited me not."</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS precept condemns unlawful uſury. The jews were forbidden to exact uſury of each other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they were allowed to take it of other people, who reſided among them, for the purpoſe of traffic.
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028999_0225_0FDDD25C8F55B478"/>The ſin conſiſts not in demanding uſury or intereſt, but in exacting more than is juſt and equitable. It alſo condemns monopolizing the proviſions neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſupport of life. This is making an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſcarcity, that the engroſſer may make great gain. Joſeph in Egypt, being divinely warned of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching famine of ſeven years continuance, wiſely expended the treaſures of the kingdom, during ſeven preceeding years of plenty, to purchaſe the produce of the land. He was influenced ſo to do, not by the mean and mercenary motive of enriching himſelf, but the generous and noble principle of ſaving a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the horrors of famine. In the years of ſcarcity, he liberally dealt out the treaſures which he had accumulated, and made a people joyful in the midſt of a diſtreſſing judgment. Far different from this, is the caſe of that ſelfiſh mortal, who purchaſes up the neceſſaries of life, with a view to make a ſcarcity, which providence never intended, that he may graſp the wealth and ſubſtance of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS law is broken by perſons waſting their goods by idleneſs, intemperance and prodigality. Worldly goods are a treaſure which God commits to men, as ſtewards, to be uſed for good and uſeful purpoſes. They are a talent for which men muſt give account. They are not to be expended in the exceſſive gratification of the fleſh or fancy. No man has an <hi>abſolute</hi> right to do as his pleaſure may dictate, even with his own. In the uſe and improvement of his goods, his duty is to conſult the pleaſure of him, from whoſe providence he received them, that the apoſtle ſays of chriſtians, "ye are not your own;" may be ſaid of men's wealth and goods, "they are not your's." They are bought by the blood of Chriſt, and for his ſake, are intruſted to you, to uſe and employ, to the glory of the giver,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028999_0226_0FDDD25E5AA18528"/>your own and the beſt good of others. As men are to glorify God in their bodies and in their ſpirits which are God's; ſo alſo are they to glorify him in their worldly goods, which are his alſo. He then who waſtes his property by idleneſs, intemperance and other vices, is chargable with embezzling his Lord's goods, robbing himſelf, his family and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men. He who created food to ſatisfy the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry multitude, taught his diſciples oeconomy, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "gather up the fragments, that nothing be loſt." The miſimprovers of the gifts and bounties of providence, deprive themſelves of the comfortable enjoyment of them, and of the means of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating comfort to others, and reduce themſelves to wretchedneſs. "He that loveth pleaſure ſhall be a poor man. He that loveth ſtrong drink ſhall not be rich. The drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty, and drouſineſs ſhall cloth a man with rags."</p>
            <p>PERSONS are liable to injure themſelves or others by raſhly adventuring in trade,—by becoming ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for others,—by laviſhing property in the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitation of the pride of dreſs, building, equipage and the oſtentatious parade of life. A large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of precious time and expence are too often beſtowed on the ſuperfluities of life. Whatever is beyond the point of decency and convenience, in the mode of living, is a criminal waſte of property. It is beſtowing on things of ſmall conſequence, that which might be uſefully employed. The ſuperfluities of the rich and gay, would make comfortable the families of want and ſorrow; and be an offering acceptable to him, who hath commanded us to do good and to communicate; with the aſſurance that with ſuch facrifices God is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, this precept is violated by
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028999_0227_0FDD5FE318E513D0"/>thoſe who rob themſelves and families, of thoſe enjoyments of life which God hath given them, thro' a penurious and avaricious diſpoſition. Who, in the midſt of plenty, ſtarve themſelves, leſt at ſome future time, they ſhould come to want. This is that ſin of covetouſneſs, which the apoſtle calls idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry. It is a criminal diſtruſt of divine providence; and is an evil more often found among the rich than the poor; and muſt be conſidered as a curſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inordinate love of money. To pine over plenty, and ſuffer thro' fear of ſuffering, is ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to heaven, and contrary to preſent experience of its bountifulneſs. This is the deſpicable condition of the miſer, who broods over his wealth, and fears a thouſand wants; who clothes himſelf in rags, and denies his body its proper nouriſhments, and dies poor in the midſt of opulence. He leaves his hoarded treaſures, when he can hold them no longer, to thoſe who feel no gratitude for his memory. "There is, ſays Solomon, that ſcattereth and yet increaſeth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty. Bountifulneſs is as a fruitful garden and mercifulneſs endureth forever." A covetous diſpoſition is a fource of unhappineſs, to the perſon who indulges it, and to others. The temptations ariſing from a redundancy of wealth, as well as of diſtreſſing poverty, were foreſeen by the wiſe and pious prophet Agur, who in prayer to God, ſays, <hi>"give me neither poverty, nor riches, leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor and ſteal and take the name of my God in vain."</hi> That exceſſive anxiety for the goods of this world, which robs the ſons of men of peace and reſt, was one of the evils which the royal preacher ſaw under the ſun. "There is one alone and there is not a ſecond; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor, neither is his eye
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028999_0228_0FDDD25F976EEE90"/>ſatisfied with riches, neither ſaith he, for whom do I labor and bereave my ſoul of good."</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS precept is violated by litigious laws ſuits. In this way, there is frequently robbery committed on men's goods, reputation and peace. It is lawful for a chriſtian to appeal to juſtice and the laws, for protection from the lawleſs, and the reſtitution of right. "For the law is good if a man uſe it lawfully." But this neceſſary inſtitution is abuſed when perſons under the ſhelter of law, injure others in unjuſt proſecutions, which it may not be in the power of the law to detect: in haraſſing the patience of others by appeals and delays, with a view of forcing them to unreaſonable terms. This is robbing by legal forms, and is one of the worſt ſpecies of theft, becauſe it is ſheltered from puniſhment or reſtitution. The apoſtle reproves the chriſtians at Corinth for their contentions at law; and recommends to them rather to ſuffer wrong, than contend; or to leave their controverſies to the deciſion of impartial arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators in the church.</p>
            <p>ON the chriſtian's right to ſeek a redreſs of injuries by appealing to the laws of the country, I would notice an objection which is alledged by ſome, founded on the words of Chriſt, Matthew 5, and which are thought to forbid going to law in any caſe. "Reſiſt not evil. But whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo. And if any man ſhall ſue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo." Two things are evident here, one is, the duty of chriſtians to bear injuries with meekneſs; the other, that theſe are proverbial phraſes, and not to be underſtood literally. And it alſo appears that the leſſes were in ſmaller matters. It is better to give a coat for peace, than by contending, to looſe all one's clothes. It is a
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028999_0229_0FDDD265E637EF80"/>duty to give up things of ſmall value, rather than contend at law. And it was the duty of chriſtians, in thoſe times eſpecially, with patient meekneſs to ſuffer loſs; for they were the objects of the hatred and perſecutions of Jews and Gentiles; and there was but a ſlender proſpect of their obtaining juſtice, by appealing to the courts of their perſonal enemies. That the phraſe of turning the other cheek to him that ſmites, was proverbial, and deſigned to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in general the virtue of meekneſs, is evident from our Lord's example, who when he was unjuſtly ſmitten on the cheek, by one of the officers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for the injury, ſaying, "if I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil, but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me." And ſaint Paul, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſmitten by command of the high prieſt reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the indignity, and pronounces upon him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic judgment. We hence conclude that our Lord forbids a ſpirit of litigation among chriſtians; but does not deprive them of the privileges of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in the redreſs of inſufferable injuries. This explanation of our Saviour's words may ſerve as an anſwer to a like objection, from a paſſage in 1 Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthians v. 7. "Dare any of you having a matter againſt another, go to law before the unjuſt and not before the ſaints?" This refers to differences which may be accommodated by judicious neighbors. "I ſpeak to your ſhame. Is it ſo that there is not a wiſe man among you, not one that ſhall be able to judge between his brethren? This is utterly a fault among you, becauſe ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather ſuffer yourſelves to be defrauded?" Too much of this, to the ſcandal to the chriſtian profeſſion, yet remains among the profeſſed diſciples of the meek and patient Jeſus. "Who, when he was reviled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. ALL the diſhoneſt arts and tricks of jugglers and fortune-tellers, who deceive and defraud; are condemned by this law. They who fear God, will ſhun their impious ways. They are the works of darkneſs. The entrance of true religion into the heart, will detect and expel theſe wicked arts. "Many of them which uſed curious arts, brought their books together and burned them before all men." This law alſo condemns the non-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of promiſes, where promiſes are lawful, and perſons have ability to fulfil;—running in debt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the proſpect of payment; and delays of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to laborers and creditors. "Owe no man any thing." All bribery in judgment, and partiality in deciſions, between men; all thoſe kind of prefeſſions which are ſupported by the vices and follies of men; all gambling and ſports of chance, in which property is hazarded, are condemned by this law. It forbids withholding ſupport from the government under which we live, and from the worſhip of God, and public moral and religious inſtitutions. It condemns all perjury, forgery and couzenage; all fraudulent alienation of things devoted to charitable and ſacred uſes; concealing loſt goods and embezzling the property of others; partaking of diſhoneſt gains or ſtolen goods, and all thoſe ways which tend to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of our neighbor, either in his perſon, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or reputation.</p>
            <p>LASTLY: It condemns man-ſtealing. This is the worſt and moſt criminal ſpecies of theft. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon theft robs a man of his property; but this robs him of himſelf. The thief, takes not only the goods of a man, but the man himſelf; and makes gain by
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028999_0231_0FDDD269B16D5200"/>the barter of human fleſh. The ſlave-trade, ſo called, comes under this condemnation. To the ſcandal of the chriſtian religion, this unnatural and cruel traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, has been practiſed by European nations and their colonies, more than two centuries, and is not yet aboliſhed. Thouſands of the unhappy children of Africa, our equals by nature, are draged from their native lands, loaded with irons, and crouded into floating priſons: and during a long voyage, acroſs the Atlantic, are ſubjected to all manner of ſufferings and death. They are expoſed to ſale, and bought, and made to ſubmit to the ſevereſt toil, and tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the pleaſure of their cruel maſters. They pine away in a foreign land, and their hard bondage is continually imbittered, with the recollection of the liberties and pleaſures of their native country, and all the tender ſympathies of domeſtic life, forever fled from them. Death comes to them, a welcome refuge. Thouſands are annually imported. While the people of this our favored land, double their numbers in a few years, the imported Africans in the colonies decreaſe, and the race would ſoon be extinct, were there not continual acceſſions to ſupply the deficiency. Enlightened people of Europe and America, what injuries have you or your fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to juſtify your cruel ſeverety to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate defenceleſs people? Humanity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion drop a tear over you, ye degenerate chriſtians who deal in the "merchandize of ſlaves and ſouls of men."</p>

<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028999_0232_0FDDD26E9ADBE290"/>is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, the ungodly and ſinners,—for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of fathers and murderers of mothers, and for men-ſtealers."

                  <p>Such is the ardent thirſt of wealth in the heart of man, that reaſons drawn from the principles of humanity and religion, make but feeble impreſſion on thoſe who receive gain from this traffic.

In ſome of the moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous colonies in the Indies, the injured ſlaves have become the dreadful ſcourges of the divine vengeance, on their oppreſſors. Thouſands of families, who once lived delicately, on the tears and groans of ſlaves, have become victims to their vengeance, and fled, many to this continent, or other places, for ſafety.</p>
                  <p>To the honor of humanity and our native country, ſlavery is aboliſhed in theſe northern ſtates; and within a few years, by a ſolemn decree of our general government, it will ceaſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever throughout the nation. The powerful republic of France have alſo aboliſhed ſlavery; and generous efforts have been made in the Britiſh parliament to put a ſtop to the African ſlave-trade.

            <p>WE have conſidered the nature and guilt of the ſins prohibited by this divine precept. Let me now, invite your conſideration,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the poſitive duties which it enjoins. Its poſitive duties are, to preſerve the properties and promote the intereſts of our fellow men, by all lawful means. The precept, "thou ſhalt not ſteal," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not only a total abſtinence from the ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and which have been enumerated; but like the other negative precept, it commands the oppoſite duties and virtues: that men ſhould be, not only negatively virtuous, and do no harm, but that they be poſitively good, beneficient and uſeful. The property of our fellow men, to which this law pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily relates, reſpects their <hi>perſons,</hi> their <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>reputation.</hi> Theſe comprehend all the worldly goods of men, and which we are to preſerve and defend, as we would our own.</p>
            <p n="1">1. HONESTY is a virtue, which we are ſacredly to obſerve, in all our dealings with men. It is directly oppoſed to the vice of knavery, which prompts
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028999_0234_0FDDD270C59411F0"/>perſons to take advantage of others. Let us, ſays St. Paul, walk honeſtly as in the day. "In all things willing to live noneſtly." The honeſt man is conſcientious in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ings with others, and would do them no injury, altho' his preſent intereſt might be increaſed thereby. He is the ſame in all his commerce with mankind, whether in ſecret or in public. He would rather ſuffer loſs himſelf, then defraud another; even tho' the fraud could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the knowledge of the world. By this principle, the upright man is diſtinguiſhed from the artful and deſigning. The latter will not heſitate to take an advantage of another, when it can be done without a diſcovery. The honeſt man is the ſame in all conditions. He will do his neighbor no wrong.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE moral and the chriſtian law concur in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of men, that they do to others as they would that others ſhould do to them. "As ye would that men ſhould do to you do ye even ſo to them." This is the golden rule of univerſal righteouſneſs towards men. It directs us to deal with others, as we are conſcious, they ought to deal with us. It is comprehenſive and intelligible and calculated for daily uſe. It implies that we allow ourſelves a moment's conſideration, and imagine ourſelves in the condition of him, with whom we have to do, and impartially aſk ourſelves, what we ought to expect, and then do accordingly. Were this moſt juſt rule in univerſal uſe, all fraud, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, cruelty and unrighteouſneſs would ceaſe, and the good fruits of juſtice and beneficence abound. Our love to ourſelves would be the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our conduct to others; and men would have no more inclination to injure others, than themſelves. Self-love powerfully influences a man to preſerve his own life, his property and reputation, his comfort
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:028999_0235_0FDDD27248E40810"/>and happineſs. The ſame principle ſhould alſo powerfully influen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to preſerve theſe beſt intereſts of our neighbor. "Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thyſelf," is the great commandment of the law.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord, by a parable,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 10.</note> has in a lively manner, exemplified the great guilt of the ſin prohibited by this precept, and the amiableneſs of the oppoſite virtue. In anſwer to the queſtion, "Who is my neighbor?" Jeſus ſaid, "A certain man went down from Jeruſalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves which ſtripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain prieſt that way; and when he ſaw him he paſſed by on the other ſide. And likewiſe a Levite, when he was at the place came and looked on him, and paſſed by on the other ſide." The wounded traveller looked up to theſe as kind angels from heaven, come to bind up his wounds and recal to life, his departing ſpirit: for they were his countrymen, and miniſters of peace, and preachers of mercy. But alas, they turned their faces from the piteous ſpectacle, and paſſed by on the other ſide. "Compaſſionate Saviour! are there any of thy miniſters ſo loſt to the tenderneſs of ſympathy and pity! They are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the ſacred office, and diſhonor thy benevolent religion." But compaſſion and kindneſs are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found, where they are leaſt expected. "But a certain Samaritan," whoſe nation was hoſtile to the jews, "as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he ſaw him he had compaſſion on him; and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and ſet him on his own beaſt and bro't him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence,
<note n="†" place="bottom">A roman penny was about one ſeventh of a dollar.</note>
               <pb n="248" facs="unknown:028999_0236_0FDDD273B5C99F70"/>and gave them to the hoſt, and ſaid unto him, take care of him: and whatſoever thou ſpendeſt more, when I come again I will repay thee." The good Samaritan ſaw in the wounded Jew, a fellow creature, a brother in diſtreſs. And he haſtened to his relief. He did, as he would that another ſhould do to him, in like circumſtances. By this parable our Lord has taught us, that there is no man, but what is our neighbour: whether he be our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a foreigner. And that when a fellow creature is in diſtreſs, and lies at our mercy, we are to do our utmoſt to relieve him, even tho' an enemy; and one, whoſe political or religious creed may be altogether oppoſite to our own.</p>
            <p>FROM this example, enforced by the ſhort, but extenſive command of Jeſus, "go thou and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;" may we learn the practice, and imbibe the lovely ſpirit of his religion, who in his life and death diſplayed the virtues of an unbounded philanthropy. He is himſelf the good Samaritan, who came into the wilderneſs of this world, to ſeek and ſave them that are loſt. Who finds us on the highway of danger and death, who delivers us out of the hands of our ſpiritual foes, thoſe robbers of our peace and murderers of ſouls. Who has compaſſion on us, and binds up the wounds of ſin and guilt, pouring into the troubled ſoul, the oil of grace, and the wine of divine conſolation, who gives deliverance to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and freedom to them that are bound. Who pays for our healing, with his own blood, and raiſes us from the loweſt ſtate of wretchedneſs, and carries us in the arms of his redeeming love and mercy, to the celeſtial manſions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS law requires of us fidelity in every truſt repoſed in us. Whatever duty is conſided to us to
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028999_0237_0FDDD27BAC3BFD68"/>perty fraudulently taken. He who has a juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his obligation to God, will be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make all reaſonable ſatisfaction for an injury done to another, of whatever kind the injury may be. When convinced of the ſin of injuſtice, moſt free and cordial was the confeſſion of the Publican Zaccheus, &amp; his reſolution to make ample ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to all to whom he had been unjuſt. "He ſtood and ſaid, if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four fold." It is a dictate of the immutable law of righteouſneſs, that he who wrongs another, either in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, property or character, ſhould repair the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by full confeſſion and reſtitution. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is ſecret, there are ways which the offender may take to reſtore and make reſtitution, without making it publicly known. Tho' the party who is injured in his property be dead, yet the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon may not keep it, becauſe it is not his. He may do well to diſtribute it to the poor. The tranſgreſſor of this law, is firſt to confeſs to God, his ſin, imploring forgiveneſs, and nextly to make ſatisfaction to the party injured. In vain will the tranſgreſſor expect peace and comfort, while he retains the goods of others, or refuſes to ſatisfy. Conſcious guilt breaks his peace, and the terrors of God's broken law alarm his fears. "Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts," and practiſe the pure laws of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and mercy.</p>
            <p>As the material world is kept together, by the laws of attraction, and the heavenly bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve around each other in admirable order, beauty and uſefulneſs; ſo the moral world is to be kept together by the attractive principle of love
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:028999_0238_0FDDD27CB69A93A0"/>and benevolence. Material bodies would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve &amp; be ſcattered &amp; loſt in the boundleſs univerſe, were a principle of repulſion inherent in every particle of matter. And were univerſal injuſtice and wrong to prevail, ſociety would diſſolve and the human race no more exiſt. The ſelfiſh man, who builds his intereſt on the rein of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men, may hence ſee the evil of his conduct, ſhould injuſtice and robbery become univerſal. In this deplorable condition of the world all men would arm againſt all men, and every man's hand be turned againſt his neighbor.</p>
            <p>As the evils forbidden by this precept are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with perſonal and univerſal ruin, we infer the obligations of men to cultivate the oppoſite virtues of honeſty, kindneſs, mercifulneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and every good diſpoſition and action, which rends to advance the intereſts and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind, and the exerciſe of that love, that worketh no ill to our neighbour.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, the duty of promoting the ſpiritual edification and ſalvation of our fellow-men, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by this law. The love of our neighbor as ourſelves, will diſpoſe us heartily to ſeek his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts in all reſpects; and as his ſalvation is the greateſt, to promote it, will be an object of the moſt ardent deſire and labor of every one, whoſe heart is rightly affected towards his fellow men. Do we eſteem it a moral and ſacred duty to guard the perſon, the property and character of our neighbor, and ſhall we eſteem it a duty of leſs importance, to ſecure his eternal happineſs, by every wiſe and benevolent means in our power? By good example, by friendly inſtruction, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028999_0239_0FDDD27E6F1423A8"/>direction and prayer? Earneſtly deſiring that when he ſhall leave this world's goods at death, his ſoul may be happy: that he may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs thoſe ſpiritual riches, of which death and the grave cannot deprive him, but which will forever increaſe in value? And that when his earthly poſſeſſions fail him, he may be received into thoſe everlaſting habitations, which the Almighty and merciful redeemer gives to every believing and obedient diſciple. Unleſs we ſincerely deſire, and labor to promote the ſalvation of the ſouls of men, we are deſtitute of that true and extenſive love to them, which the law of God demands from us; becauſe this is the beſt intereſt, &amp; the ſublimeſt happineſs, of which they are capable. Compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to which, their temporal proſperity, and the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of the whole world, are but of trifling importance. "For what ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?" Having ſhewn in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars, the ſins prohibited, and the duties demanded by this general precept, let me invite you to ſome Reflections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſee the guilt and danger of an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love of riches. It is the root of all evil. The ſource of injuſtice, diſhoneſtly, theft and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery. "Love not the world neither the things of the world." To cheriſh an ardent thirſt for the goods and poſſeſſions of this life, opens the door for manifold temptations. "He that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth haſte to be rich, hath an evil eye. He ſhall not be innocent." Through the prevalence of a ſelfiſh ſpirit, he will be tempted to do his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor wrong. They who purſue riches, as the firſt and greateſt object of happineſs, fall into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028999_0240_0FDDD283A59FF928"/>luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE infer the ruinous nature and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the crime of theft. It is a violation of the laws of God and of ſociety; of juſtice, truth, honeſty and charity; and moſt diſgraceful and hurtful to the criminal. The groſſer kinds of theft, as public robbery; the more refined kind, as taking advantage of the wants or ignorance of others: and the more ſecret theft, which clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinely takes or embezzles the goods of others, &amp; every ſpecies of diſhoneſty, in our commerce with mankind, are condemned. "Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more." Let him humble himſelf before God, and make reſtitution to thoſe he has injured. This ſin eſpecially requires repentance towards God, becauſe the thief boldly aſſumes the divine prerogative, and takes from others the goods which God has committed to them. It is an act of great impiety, as well as injuſtice. The dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breakers of this law of righteouſneſs, are deſtitute of the fear of God, and unalarmed at the threatened terrors of his wrath. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a wide waſting curſe on this ſin. "It ſhall enter into the houſe of the thief,"—it ſhall purſue him into his moſt ſecret retirement—"It ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof, &amp; the ſtones thereof." Shame and loſs uſually attend this vice, in <hi>this</hi> life, and eternal puniſhment awaits it in the next. The unjuſt poſſeſſor of other men's goods, is deprived of peace and ſatisfaction in the uſe of them. An accuſing conſcience ſpoils his enjoyment. Belſhazzer trembled at an impious feaſt, while he drank wine in the golden bowls, ſtolen from the temple of Jehovah. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028999_0241_0FDDD28510D53440"/>did the thief Judas find, in the thirty pieces of ſilver, to obtain which, he robbed his Lord of life? Ill-gotten riches tormented his conſcience. He ſought to find peace, by reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. In vain he threw them at the feet of the partners of his crime. They derided him in his ſorrows. Horror of conſcience will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who live and die in this ſin.</p>
            <p>THIS crime is commonly diſcovered. It begins in ſecret, but is at laſt brought to light. The reaſon is, that a repetition of this ſin, hardens and emboldens the ſinner. If he is once ſucceſsful, and eſcapes undetected, he is encouraged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the tranſgreſſion, until it becomes a habit, &amp; ſo open and frequent, that it is eaſily diſcovered. Though like Judas, who was a thief, perſons of this character, may for a ſeaſon paſs undiſcovered, yet will their iniquity find them out. They are hateful to God and men. Mankind readily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and puniſh a thief, becauſe he is a common foe. No truſt or confidence can be repoſed in him. He is feared and ſhunned: and when it is no longer ſafe to ſuffer him to go at large, he is ſecluded from ſociety; or finiſhes a miſerable life by an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death. The guilt of his crimes follow him, beyond death. Unworthy to live on earth, he will be ſhut out from the ſociety of the ſpirits of juſt men, and condemned to the priſon of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal darkneſs and deſpair, where peculiar wrath awaits the enemies of God and man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. LET this ſubject be improved in a way of examination of our own hearts; whether we have in daily exerciſe that benevolent principle, towards our fellow men, which inclines us to ſeek their good, proſperity and happineſs, in all reſpects.
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028999_0242_0FDDD2867351D140"/>Have we, ſirs, ſuch a love to our neighbor, as diſpoſes us to rejoice in his proſperity, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as far as it may be in our power, his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal intereſts? Altho' we decreaſe, do we rejoice at his increaſe, &amp; feel not the emotion of envy and ſorrow? The benevolent ſpirit of the religion of Jeſus will diſpoſe you to rejoice with them that rejoice; as well as weep, with them that weep. Does your love to your neighbor extend to the great intereſts of their ſouls, and diſpoſe you to uſe all proper means to aſſiſt them to ſecure their ſalvation? By ſorrow for the ſins of others, by friendly admonition in the ſpirit of meekneſs, and by fervent prayer, that God would give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life? Are you grieved when you behold the tranſgreſſors, becauſe God is diſhonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the tranſgreſſors expoſed to awful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Unleſs you thus love the ſouls of men, &amp; ſeek their ſpiritual and eternal happineſs, you have no true love to their perſons. Suffer not ſin then upon a brother for whom Chriſt died. Strive to bring him to the knowledge of the ever-bleſſed God and Saviour. In this way you will promote his beſt, his immortal intereſts, and incline him alſo to practiſe the duties of righteouſneſs towards men: for he who loves God will love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor alſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. OF the ſin which this ſubject condemns, children and youth, are eſpecially in danger. A principle of ſelfiſhneſs, and a diſpoſition to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the goods of others, are often diſcovered in early life. A diſhoneſt principle uncontroled in childhood, is in danger of growing into an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable habit. Thoſe unhappy perſons who have been brought to public puniſhment and death, for the crimes of theft and robbery, have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:028999_0243_0FDDD28CEE2DC318"/>been of that claſs of families, in which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty in childhood, has met with unreſtrained indulgence. This vice brings parents to ſhame, and children to ruin.</p>
            <p>Let me affectionately warn children and youth againſt taking the ſmalleſt property from others. Groſs theft ſprings from ſmall beginnings. Thoſe who have arrived to the height of this enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vice, began with pilfering ſmall things. Conſcience reproved, but a repetition of the ſin, hardened the conſcience, and they went on to more bold tranſgreſſions. As the water that finds but a ſmall opening in the dam, ſoon wears it away and carries all before it; ſo this ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged ſpeedily hurries the tranſgreſſor down to ruin. To public ſhame and untimely death, and to the dreadful wrath of almighty God.</p>
            <p>REMEDIES againſt temptations to the ſins, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we are warned by this law, are ſuch as the following, diligence in profitable and uſeful employments, from early life. Idleneſs is the nurſe of this, and every vice. "Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more: but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth." Some ancient legiſlatures, obliged parents to have their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren educated, and taught ſome uſeful mechanic art, to prevent the temptations ariſing from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to form them to the virtues of honeſty and fidelity in buſineſs. Let temptations to this ſin be reſiſted, by earneſt prayer to the author of grace,—by mortification to the world,—by the cultivation of a heavenly temper,—and placing the affections on celeſtial riches. "Lay not up for yourſelves treaſures on earth, where morth &amp;
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028999_0244_0FDDD28DF5C13330"/>ruſt corrupt, and where thieves break thro' and ſteal; but lay up for yourſelves treaſures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven." Let our minds be filled with a ſolemn ſenſe of a preſent God, the witneſs and judge of all our ways; and of the ſupreme tribunal at which we muſt all appear. <hi>And the Lord make you to increaſe and abound in love one towards another and towards all men; to the end he may eſtabliſh your hearts unblameable in holineſs, before God, even our father, at the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all his ſaints.</hi>

            <p>THIS precept regards principally the peace, ſatety and happineſs of our fellow men, in the preſervation of their good name. To defame, ſlander, and falſely accuſe one, are ways moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to deſtroy his character and influence, and to wound the heart of an innocent man. Since a perſon's peace and uſefulneſs among men, depend upon the preſervation of a fair cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, falſely to accuſe or ſlander him, is doing him an irreparable injury. It is alſo an injury to ſociety, as it deprives a perſon of opportunities and advantages of uſefulneſs to others. It is a
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028999_0246_0FDDD2958DE27950"/>crime moſt offenſive to God, who hath moſt ſolemnly ſaid, "Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs."</p>
            <p>To <hi>witneſs,</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> give a teſtimony or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of any thing. To bear or give falſe witneſs, is to miſrepreſent a thing wilfully &amp; knowingly, and with an intention to deceive. The crime is the ſame, whether intereſt, favor, prejudice or hatred, are the motives. A perſon is obliged to ſpeak the truth, even of his greateſt enemy. No temptation can juſtify falſehood. The precept commands, "not to bear falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>againſt</hi> our neighbor"; and the ſpirit of the law equally condemns ſpeaking falſely <hi>for</hi> him, in any caſe whatever. Let ſacred truth be the rule and guide of all your words and actions.</p>
            <p>BY the judicial laws of Moſes, a perſon could not be convicted of a crime, unleſs the charge was ſupported or eſtabliſhed, by the mouth of two or three witneſſes. The reputation and life of a perſon would be more unſafe, were they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a ſingle witneſs, by whom truth would be more liable to perverſion, thro' prejudice, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conception and the ſelfiſh paſſions, than by two or more. Witneſſes muſt alſo agree in their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>TO remove the formidable barrier, which the malevolent paſſions have raiſed, againſt an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive philanthropy, and good will to men, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant precept before us is given. It ſhall be my duty, by the divine aſſiſtance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To explain the primary intention of this law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the nature and guilt of the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate crimes prohibited, and</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="259" facs="unknown:028999_0247_0FDDD29C4A74BE18"/>
3. THE ſacred obligations of <hi>truth</hi> in all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and tranſactions with men.</p>
            <p>THE primary intention of this precept is to prevent the violation of ſacred truth, eſpecially in civil courts; on whoſe deciſion the intereſts &amp; lives of perſons depend. To theſe tribunals, <hi>bearing witneſs</hi> particularly reſert. It is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on oath, to facts, concerning others. Thoſe who are eſpecially intereſted and cautioned, are the oppoſite parties. It is neceſſary, in the adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of cauſes in civil courts, and in arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of differences between contending parties, that judges and jurors ſhould be truly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially informed of the merits of all cauſes brought before them for deciſion, that ſo they may form true judgment. The moſt likely way to obtain this knowledge, is by the ſolemnity of an oath. In which perſons are adjured as in the preſence of God, the witneſs and judge of thoughts, words and actions, to declare the whole truth. This ordinance, of a ſolemn oath, is agreeable to the divine will, and the welfare of ſociety renders it neceſſary. By this act they are brought as into the immediate preſence of the God of truth, and avenger of perjury, that the mind may be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt uttering a falſehood, or ſpeaking raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Such is the good end of bearing witneſs on oath. The precept, however, is not confined to <hi>witneſſes</hi> only, but is equally a rule and law of conſcience, to all concerned. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. TO the parties, the accuſer and accuſed, plaintiff and defendant. Neither the accuſer in ſtating the caſe, nor the defendant in his vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould deviate from the truth, miſrepreſent or mix things true and falſe together, or deny the truth of a juſt charge.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="260" facs="unknown:028999_0248_0FDDD29DBA257F80"/>
2. THAT the advocates for the parties, do not miſrepreſent the caſe, or by ſophiſtical arts hide the truth or blind the court by falſehood, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en counſel by words without knowledge. It alſo requires that judges and jury decide impartially, from the beſt light which they can obtain in the caſe, and give true judgment, according to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, without partiality, bribery or favor, as in the fear of God.</p>
            <p>THE nature and obligations of ſolemn oaths, we have already conſidered, under the third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the decalogue. <hi>This</hi> condemns falſe oaths or perjury. Perjury is a more heinous crime than lying. Lying is commonly committed without thought of God or accountableneſs to him: but in an oath, God is called upon as the witneſs and judge of the truth. And the witneſs calls upon himſelf to ſpeak to God, or as in his preſence. Perjury is therefore a deliberate ſin. In addition to the impious guilt of calling upon God to witneſs to falſehood, the crime is great towards men, inaſmuch as an oath is the only ſure way of coming at the truth &amp; certainty of things, in many caſes, in which the intereſts and life of individual perſons, are concerned. Perjury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys that certainty, and ſtrikes at the foundation of every thing valuable in life. Peculiar wrath awaits this ſin. Againſt it, the divine law points its ſharpeſt arrows. By the laws which the Moſt High gave to the Jews, the perjured perſon was condemned to ſuffer the ſame puniſhment, which his perjury would have brought upon another. "If a falſe witneſs riſe up againſt any man, to teſtify againſt him, that which is wrong; the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhall make diligent inquiſition: and behold, if the witneſs, be a falſe witneſs, and hath teſtified
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028999_0249_0FDDD29F52275AA8"/>falſely againſt his brother: then ſhall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo ſhalt thou put away evil from among you. And others ſhall hear and fear."
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> XIX.</note> To ſuch God hath ſaid, he will come near to judgment, as one who takes unerring aim at his prey," and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt falſe-ſweaters, who fear not me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. "Perjury is a crime of peculiar aggravation, becauſe it is level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt both God and man. We come,</p>
            <p n="2">2. TO the conſideration of thoſe ſubordinate crimes, which are violations of this law, as lying, detraction and ſlander. Theſe are ſins, which altho' they are leſs criminal in their nature than perjury, <hi>yet are they</hi> ſolemnly condemned by the divine law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>LIE</hi> is uttering falſehood, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deceive. It is a wilful miſrepreſentation of truth. A declaration by words or actions of a thing, contrary to the mind or intention of him, who makes the declaration. In this falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with men, the tongue and the heart, are at variance. To lie to our neighbor, is to do him an injury, proportioned to the magnitude of the object about which he is deceived, and his intereſt therein. It may eventually deſtroy his peace, his property or his life.</p>
            <p>WHEN a perſon ſpeaks to be believed, he vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually promiſes to ſpeak the truth. His intention is, that his words ſhall be received as true; and the hearer has a right to expect the truth. Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is then a breach of promiſe.</p>
            <p>THIS precept alſo condemns the violation of a
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:028999_0250_0FDDD2A56E561368"/>promiſe. Promiſes are ſacred: To fail of the performance of a promiſe, is to be guilty of a ſpecies of lying. From this guilt the perſon is freed, who finds by further knowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that the promiſe was unlawful, which, however, he thought was lawful, at the time. We hence infer the neceſſity of due conſideration in promiſes. Where a perſon is ſincere in a lawful promiſe, and he does all in his power to fulfil it, but by the providence of God, or ſome unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen occurrences, he is unable to perform; in ſuch caſe, he is clear of the guilt of falſehood.</p>
            <p>ONE who conceals or denies the truth, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpate from blame or to eſcape puniſhment, is guilty of the ſin of lying. To reſort to falſehood, as a ſubterfuge from blame, is to increaſe the guilt of the offender.
<q>
                  <l>"For he who does one ſoult at firſt,</l>
                  <l>"And lies to hide it, makes it two."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH human laws do not oblige an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to accuſe or condemp himſelf, yet the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law obliges him not to deny his guilt when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. Sins which are ſecret, &amp; by which another is not injured, a perſon is not obliged to confeſs to men. He may be a true penitent before God, &amp; the world know nothing of his offence. But the caſe is different with one who has injured another. His confeſſion to God is his firſt duty, and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the perſon injured, is in the next place neceſſary.</p>
            <p>IT is a vice inherent in the depraved nature of man, to practiſe the acts of prevarication &amp; falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to ſhield himſelf from blame, for ill doing.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028999_0251_0FDDD2A6B1D08C58"/>The tempter of men, who is called emphatically the <hi>father of lies,</hi> early inſtilled this principle, in the lapſed parents of the human race. With what violation of truth was not Adam chargeable, when to exculpate himſelf, he throw the blame of his tranſgreſſion upon the woman; and the woman alſo, in caſting her's upon the ſerpent? We ſee the early buddings of this ſin, in the arts and ſtratagems of children, to ſkreen themſelves from blame for evil conduct.</p>
            <p>THIS divine law condemns that ſpecies of lies, which invents fictions and things marvellous, to excite admiration and impoſe upon the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Perſons of a lively imagination are expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this temptation. It originates in vanity and pride. It is that fooliſh talking which the apoſtle condemns, and which tendeth not to edification. Altho' a perſon may have no deſign to injure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, by the relation of lying wonders, yet as they are propagated for truths, they are hurtful; becauſe they miſlead the credulous, and confound the difference between truth and falſehood. For every idle word men muſt give account to God, whoſe laws demand truth in all our converſation, and awfully condemn thoſe who deal falſely, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in word or conduct.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Diſſimulation and hypocriſy are violations of this divine precept. Diſſimulation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood as an attempt to deceive others, with falſe appearances in the affairs of life; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy is pructiſing the ſame art, in religious concerns. One expreſſes a regard for others, which the actor has not; the other, that regard for religion, which is deſtitute of ſincerity. They wear the appearances of what they are not, and
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028999_0252_0FDDD2A83A7E6D20"/>are an odious ſpecies of lying. Hypocriſy, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies going beyond the mark, or pretending to more than is real. Theſe vices are commonly put on to ſerve a purpoſe, and are painful to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The diſſembler and the hypocrite labor to conceal themſelves behind a maſk. The effort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unnatural, diſcovery and ſhame mun be the final iſſue. Nature will peep out at unguarded moments; and when reſtraints and temptations are removed, the maſk will be thrown aſide. Perſons of this deſcription would ſave themſelves a world of labor, were they ſuch in reality, as they wiſh to appear to be. To him who is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere towards his God and his fellow men, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his ſincerity will be natural, and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous; but without the reality, it is difficult to maintain the appearance of virtue. To put on the ſemblance of goodneſs, to gain eſteem with men, ſhews that there is ſomething in teal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which commands our approbation. And if the appearance is good, much more ſo is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. The vicious pay an involuntary reverence to perſons of religious characters. The lovelineſs virtue commands their veneration. The beſt and ſureſt way to appear to be virtuous, is to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtuous.</p>
            <p>HYPOCRISY and diſſimulation, wander in artful ways, and thro' much perplexity ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their purpoſes: but virtue and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty purſue their object in the ſtraight road, and will finally proſper: for "truth is mighty and will prevail." Should the deceiver for a while ſucceed, in the practice of impoſition upon men, yet he cannot deceive God, whoſe omniſcient eye pervades the darkneſs and the thickeſt veil, and who requires truth and ſincerity of heart in all
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028999_0253_0FDDD2AF1847E588"/>our profeſſions of him, and in all our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with men He will gloriouſly reward the lovers of ſincere truth and goodneſs, and ſeverely puniſh all hypocritical diſſemblers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ALL malicious lies invented or propogated to the prejudice of others, are utterly condemned by this law. This is to bear falſe witneſs before the world, againſt our neighbor; and is a crime hateful to God and nijurious to men. Before I proceed to the particular conſideration of the vices of ſlander and detraction, comprehended in this article, allow me to take notice of the evil nature and ruinous effects of falſehood in general.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A DISPOSITION to utter falſehood or lies, is a proof of a vicious heart. Perſons given to this odious habit are deſtitute of any good principle of action. They have loſt the moral ſenſe of right and wrong, and the wide difference of truth and falſehood. They ſhew that they have no proper regard for their own intereſt or happineſs, or of their fellow men, and that they have wholly caſt off a ſuitable fear of God. The ſhameful and hurtful nature of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vice, proves the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of its ſource. From the vicious heart proceed evil thoughts, and every degree of falſe-hood. In the heart of Judas, lying dwelt, as inits proper habitation. He pretended to be grieved for what he called the wall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of ointment; (the gratful tribute of a ſincere penitent to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate ſaviour) but his declaration was a falſe-hood to conceal his fraudulent intention. The ſame principle which inclines a perſon to utter falſehood, and to cheat and deceive by lies, will alſo induce him to cheat others of property, when
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028999_0254_0FDDD2B074537260"/>opportunities preſent. The liar is therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, and is not to be intruſted with the goods of others. Theſe vices uſually meet in the ſame perſon. The precept forbidding theft, preceeds that which forbids falſehood: For theft is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly followed by the ſin of lying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE evil and guilt of lying appears from the neceſſity of the obſervance of truth, to the happineſs and exiſtance of mankind; and alſo from the dreadful conſequences which would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhould falſehood and lies become an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal practice. Without the obſervance of ſacred truth, mankind could have no confidence in each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> words, thoſe images of the thoughts, would he of no uſe. No contracts, promiſes or ſolemn covenants, would bind men. Univerſal diſtruſt would take place, ſocial union be diſſolved, and peace baniſhed from the earth. Such are the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous effects of falſehood, that all men deteſt a liar. For he is the enemy of mankind. Other vices are kept in countenance, by finding guilty companions, who practiſe and applaud them: but the moſt vicious deteſt the liar. The moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned clubs expect and demand truth from each other, after they have caſt off every other virtue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE vice of lying is puniſhed in a degree, in this life. The liar loſes the confidence of all who know him. He is deſpiſed and ſhuned, and labors under the great inconvenience of not being believed when he ſpeaks the truth. And as by lies he attempts to deceive others, the evil is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted upon him, by a diſbelief of truths, which he may utter. Thus lying is a vice, rewarded with univerſal hatred. A heathen poet could ſay,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:028999_0255_0FDDD1AABB86C8E8"/>
               <q>
                  <l>"He who'll think one thing, and another tell,</l>
                  <l>"My ſoul deteſts him, as the gates of hell."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. AGAINST thoſe who practiſe this ſhameful ſin, the wrath of almighty God, is alſo proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Liars are claſſed among the greateſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and the ſevereſt doom awaits them. They are excluded the pure abodes of juſt men, and ſent to aſſociate with the father of lies. "All liars ſhall have their part in the lake which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimſtone." Into the new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, "there ſhall in no wiſe enter any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or maketh a lie,—For without are dogs (the contentious and unclean) and ſorcerers, and whatſoever loveth and maketh a lie."</p>
            <p>DETRACTION and ſlander fall under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the ſin of bearing falſe witneſs. They are a ſpecies of lying and full of hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our neighbor. Detraction is a vice, which depreciates another's merit. Which does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him the good properties which he poſſeſſes, and which aggravates his failings. It is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of envy and hatred. Slander is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or propagation of falſe reports, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of anothers good name. Theſe are vices condemned by the moral and evangelic law, and are directly oppoſed to that charity and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which mankind ought to exerciſe, one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another. Theſe vices are denominated in the ſacred writings, by the odious names of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, tale-bearing; and the propagaters of them, buſy bodies. They are blinded to their own fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but watchful to ſpy the failings of others. They diſcern a mote in their neighbor's eye, while they perceive not a beam in their own eye. They
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:028999_0256_0FDDD2B852B853F0"/>put the moſt favorable conſtruction upon their own faults, and aggravate and blaze abroad the faults of others. Perſons of this character are envious and cruel in their diſpoſitions. Deſtitute of merit themſelves, it grieves them to ſee others poſſeſs it. Their torment increaſes in proportion to the increaſe of their neighbor's proſperity. The gall of hatred is ſpit from their invenomed tongues, to poiſon the character of others. They are like the ſpiteful aſp, who torments himſelf by gnawing, with bloody jaws, upon the impeneta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble file. It is ſurely a moſt uncomfortable and hateful temper. It is to act the part of him, who is emphatically the accuſer and deſtroyer of men.</p>
            <p>A GOOD name is a moſt valuable poſſeſſion. It is what every one wiſhes and labors to eſtabliſh, by meretorious conduct. It is the virtuous poor man's only inheritance here, and the valuable le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy which he leaves to his children. It is a treaſure, which the owner would not part with for any earthly reward, becauſe upon it depends his peace of mind, his credit and uſefulneſs on earth. To injure a perſons character is an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and irreparable injury. It is an act of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery; and the guilt is increaſed, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the robbery does not enrich the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. He ſays one,
<q>
                  <l>"Who ſteals from me my purſe, takes traſh,</l>
                  <l>"'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been ſlave to thouſands;</l>
                  <l>"But he who 'robs' me of my good name</l>
                  <l>"Robs me of that which not enriches him,</l>
                  <l>"And makes me poor indeed."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To propagate unfavorable reports of others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028999_0257_0FDDD2B975276048"/>even on the ſuppoſition of their guilt, is a violation of this law. To "ſpeak evil of no man," is an excellent rule of government of the tongue. We ought to conceal the faults of our neighbors, unleſs the good of others, or of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, makes it neceſſary that we ſhould witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. And when that neceſſity happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, the benevolent perſon, will not ſpeak with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but with pain of the faults of others. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the reformation of the offender, renders it neceſſary that his faults ſhould be expoſed to public view, that being reproved before all, he may be aſhamed, and repent. But the amiable temper of religion will teach us to do this, with a ſpirit of meekneſs and love, to the offender. To raiſe falſe reports of another, and propagate them is a far greater ſin than ſpreading abroad thoſe, which are true concerning him. It is adding the ſin of lying, to calumny. It is to do the greateſt injury to an innocent perſon. To deſame a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his abſence, is to act the part of the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, who ſtabs in the dark, and behind the back. Perſons alſo are chargeable with the guilt of this ſin, who willingly hear the character of others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; and who do not vindicate the abſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon, and frown upon the ſlanderer. To ſlander one to his face, is alſo a great indignity, eſpecially when done in the intoxication of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He who beſtows praiſe upon one for well doing, confers a deſerved reward: but he who detracts from another's merit, is guilty of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and robbery.

            <p>IN the preceeding diſcourſe was ſhewn the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal nature, and hurtful conſequences of the ſins prohibited, by this divine precept. What it condemns, is ſummarily comprized in the vices &amp; crimes of perjury, lying, detraction and ſlander. I ſhall now point out the poſitive duties and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which it demands. Theſe are all contained in the ſacred obligations of <hi>truth,</hi> in all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with mankind. As this law condemns all falſehood and diſſimulation, it forcibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the univerſal practice of truth and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. MANKIND are ſacredly obliged to ſpeak the truth to, and of each other. The reaſon of this
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028999_0260_0FDDD2BCBA894E48"/>appears, in that the intereſt and happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, depend upon the confidence which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in each other's words and promiſes. The chriſtian religion forcibly inculcates this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of the moral law. "Wherefore laying aſide all evil ſpeaking, ſpeak truth every man with his neighbor. Speak not evil one of another. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are true,—think on theſe things."</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are bound to adhere to the truth, when called to ſpeak of the character of our neighbor, and in our vindication of him. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to hate our brother in our heart; but to love him as ourſelves. This love is ſhewn, by giving him all ſuitable reſpect for his virtuous and uſeful deeds, and in vindicating his good name from reproach.</p>
            <p>A GREAT incitement to calumniators, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate evil reports of others, is the patience and willingneſs with which perſons liſten to ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reports. This diſpoſition, too natural, alas, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the depraved heart, ariſes from a wiſh to pull down others, to a level with themſelves, and to have themſelves held in greater eſteem. But the perſon who fears and loves God, knows his own many failings, and will not take pleaſure in the failings of others, nor in falſe and ſuſpicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning them. The generous and pious perſon will frown upon the take-bearer. "As the north wind driveth away rain, ſo doth an angry countenance a back-biting tongue." A good man, will be ſlow to believe unfavorable reports of his neighbor. He will rejoice to hear him well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; he will grieve to hear any thing to his diſadvantage. He will put the moſt favorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on his words and conduct. He will not
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:028999_0261_0FDDD2B205A1AA68"/>exaggerate his faults; "for charity is kind, and thinketh no evil, but rejoiceth in the truth." If we cannot ſpeak in commendation of another, it is a good rule to be ſilent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS law obliges us to bury in oblivion the ſins of others, after they have repented of them, and made ſatisfaction. Their faults ſhould be forgotten, as tho' they had never been. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy towards us, teaches us ſo to do, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our fellow men. God is graciouſly pleaſed on our repentance, to pardon and blot out our ſins. He will not ſuffer them to riſe to ſhame or condemn us. They are ſaid to be caſt behind the back, and buried in the depths of the ſea. And "except ye in like manner forgive men their treſpaſſes, neither will your father in heaven forgive your treſpaſſes." If our gracious Lord thus freely forgives us, the debt of ten thouſand talents, ſhall we be unforgiving to our fellow offenders? The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of injuries from the beart, is that amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper which the goſpel breathes, and that charity which hides a multitude of faults.</p>
            <p>WE are obliged to ſhew our regard to truth, and to our offending neighbor, by ſuitable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, in the ſpirit of meekneſs and love, to reclaim him. Thus to deal with an offender is the moſt likely way to bring him to conſideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and thus to ſave him from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his ſin. In this way a perſon may be moſt ſerviceable to another, in the concerns of his beſt intereſts, and his temporal and eternal happineſs. For "he who converteth one from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and hide a multitude of ſins."</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS law obliges us to ſhun paſſing a ſevere
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028999_0262_0FDDD1B0624D9DC0"/>judgment upon others, or raſhly condemning any. "Judge not that ye be not judged. Judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time." No perſon can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully judged or condemned, without clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of guilt. When guilt is evident, and the glory of God and the good of others make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that we expoſe his ſins, a ſacred regard to truth obliges us on the one hand, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon his faults and crimes, and on the other, not to hide them. We are not to ſuffer ſin upon a brother; but our motives in reproving or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him, ſhould be pure, and the neceſſity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. Remembering that we alſo are in the body, and that we are chargeable with faults and crimes, againſt God and men, for which we need forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THIS precept obliges us to ſhew kindneſs to all men, and that we take no pleaſure in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and failings of any. To make others the ſubject of ridicule and contempt, on account of any natural infirmity, either mental or bodily, which they may labor under; is cruel and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It is an injury to the perſon, becauſe it is not in his power to remedy the defect; it is impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as it is a reflection on the creator. "Who maketh thee to differ from another, and what haſt thou, that thou has not received?" The profane youth of Bethel once ridiculed the holy prophet Elijah, on account of this baldneſs; and the Moſt High reſented the indignity, and beaſts of prey were commiſſioned to tear them in pieces.</p>
            <p n="6">6. TRUTH and juſtice alſo require that we vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our own reputation from detraction and ſlander. A fair character is a poſſeſſion next in value to life itſelf. It is every perſon's duty to
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:028999_0263_0FDDD1B1A3010388"/>obtain and poſſeſs this treaſure. It is acquired by a uniform life of virtue; by the ſacred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of truth and ſincerity; and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in benevolent and uſeful deeds towards men, and piety towards God.</p>
            <p>HE will poſſeſs this treaſure, more precious than rubies, who "ſpeaks the truth in his heart: who does to others, as he would that others ſhould do to him: who does juſtly, loves mercy, and humbly walks with God."</p>
            <p>THERE is among mankind ſuch a reſpect for a truly virtuous character, that altho' ſome worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſons may envy, and others defame, yet the man who is uniformly good, will be eſteemed and reſpected. While the vicious and profane hate his virtues, they reverence his principles of action. By the bleſſing of God, every man may attain to a fair reputation. It depends not on greatneſs of genius, or learning, or wealth or worldly diſtinctions; but on integrity and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence towards men, and piety towards God. The moſt virtuous characters are ſometimes found, among the poor of this world, and oftener than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rich. Poverty is more friendly to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue than opulence. Many of the ancient ſaints, of whom the world was not worthy, were poor. They were deſtitute, afflicted, tormented. They took patiently the ſpoiling of their goods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in heaven they had enduring ſubſtance. The only perfect pattern of goodneſs, that ever bleſſed the dwellings of men, and in whom the perfection of every virtue dwelt, was poor. He voluntarily choſe the condition of virtuous pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. "The ſon of man had not where to lay his head." Jeſus is the rich and the poor man's pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:028999_0264_0FDDD1B31F714D18"/>in every amiable and uſeful accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His followers, tho' poor in this world, if rich in faith, and the chriſtian virtues, are heirs to a kingdom, glorious and unfading. They are bleſſed who imitate him; who have the ſame mind in them, which was alſo in him. Who walk as he walked in truth and ſincerity, and in all the duties of righteous and piety. Perſons of this character will be reſpected and loved, by wiſe and good men, and reverenced by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whatever their worldly condition may be.
<q>
                  <l>"Honor and ſhame from no condition file,</l>
                  <l>"Act well your part, there all the honor lies."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH the virtuous poor may be hidden from the obſervation of the world, they are ſeen by that omniſcient judge who approves and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them openly. It is the duty of a good man, by juſt and lawful means to defend and vindicate his reputation, from falſehood and ſlander. A ſacred adherence to truth, is as neceſſary in the vindication of his own as of his neighbor's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Saint Paul, when falſely accuſed of the Jews, defended himſelf before king Agrippa. "I think myſelf happy, king Agrippa, that I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for myſelf, touching the things, whereof I am accuſed of the Jews." And his vindication terminated in his honor, and the confuſion of his accuſers. And when his enemies at Corinth, labored to leſſen him in the eſteem of his brethren there, as a perſon of inferior accompliſhments; he modeſtly commends himſelf; but laments that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the diſagreeable taſk. "I am become a fool in glorying but ye have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended of you, for in nothing am I behind the very chiefeſt
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028999_0265_0FDDD1B48946C180"/>apoſtles, tho' I be nothing. But by the grace of God I am what I am."</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH it be a ſmall matter to a virtuous man, to be judged by a cenſorious world, yet does his duty to God, and juſtice to himſelf, render the vindication of himſelf neceſſary, becauſe the honor of God and of religion, is connected with the unblameable lives of the profeſſors of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and becauſe a fair character is neceſſary to their uſefulneſs. And that others ſeeing their good works may glorify their father in heaven. By the eſtabliſhment of a good name, by worthy deeds, the ſphere of a man's uſefulneſs is enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mankind benefited by his good works and good example.</p>
            <p>THUS are perſons obliged to guard againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which brings a juſt reproach on their character,—to be very tender of the reputation of others,—zealouſly defending the injured,— frowning upon the ſlanderer, and thoſe who are pleaſed with malicious reports, and when injured themſelves, to uſe all ſuitable means in their own vindication.</p>
            <p>LET me add, that it is ſinful for a perſon to bear falſe witneſs againſt himſelf. This perſons may do, by accuſing themſelves of things of which they are not guilty, and by needleſsly expoſing their own ſecret faults and infirmities, which do not concern their fellow men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THIS precept obliges men to perform all lawful promiſes. As men place dependence on the promiſes of each other, the nonperformance, is an injury to the party, and a violation of truth.
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:028999_0266_0FDDD1B978EEBCD0"/>They ſhould no more be broken, than oaths and written contracts. A conſcientious perſon will perform his promiſe, tho' it be to his hurt. The virtuous and generous man will not however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the fulfilment of a promiſe, when it cannot be done without great detriment to the promiſer, and eſpecially when the good promiſed or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent, is not attainable.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome things indifferent in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which a promiſe may be made, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe intended, and in which others cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, by withholding or varying the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. There are alſo conditional promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men, in which the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by the one party, binds the other to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the promiſe. And on the other hand, the failure of the condition, liberates the promiſer from the obligation of his promiſe.</p>
            <p>IT is the character of a good man, that tho' he promiſes to his hurt, he will perform his promiſe. Tho' temptations to violate a promiſe, made to one's detriment, are powerful to plead in excuſe, for a failure in performance, no temptations, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can juſtify a failure in things lawfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. For every failure is a violation of truth.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral inſtances, recorded in the ſacred writings, of virtuous and pious perſons, uttering falſehood, and practiſing the arts of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. Theſe inſtances ſhew the imperfection of human virtue, amidſt the darkneſs and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the preſent ſtate of guilt and depravity. They are recorded, not for our imitation but for our warning. The ſacred volume begins, with an account of the falſehood of the original pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:028999_0267_0FDDD1BB4FF4DE90"/>of the human race, immediately on their tranſgreſſion; tempted thereto by the malicious arts of the father of lies, who was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.</p>
            <p>THE inſpired writers of the ſacred ſcriptures, have recorded the faults and crimes of the moſt eminent perſons, and their own. This is a proof of great honeſty and impartiality, in thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that they were guided in what they wrote, by the divine ſpirit. They give glory to God, who pardons the ſins of his people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their own guilt, that the riches of grace in their forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>neſs, may be magnified. From the charge of falſehood, the great and good charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the patriarch Abraham, is not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted. Thro' fear of death in Egypt, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his amiable Sarah, he denied her to be his wife, and called her his ſiſter. The like fault we find in his ſon Iſaac. The ſtratagem of Jacob and his mother Rebecca, to circumvent Eſau and deceive the aged parent, is a complication of falſehood. God overruled their conduct therein, to accompliſh his own divine purpoſes, towards their deſcendants. Although God had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>reed the bleſſing to Jacob, yet this did not exculpate him, in the uſe of unlawful means to obtain it. The midwives of Egypt, to ſave the lives of the male children of Iſrael, made a falſe report to the king. God bleſſed and built up their families, not becauſe they had ſpoken falſely, but for their kindneſs to his people. The penitent Rahab of Jericho, who had been an harlot, but who obtaine the grace of forgiveneſs, is ranked by the apoſtle, among the worthies who died in faith. She was guilty of falſehood, in her attempt to conceal the ſpies, who fled to her houſe for protection. She
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028999_0268_0FDDD1BCD0F6ED10"/>is commended for her faith and for receiving the ſpies; but not for her falſchood, in concealing them. Samſon, another of the ancient worthies, was guilty of falſehood in anſwer to the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his enemies, into the cauſe of his great ſtrength. The embaſſadors of Gibeon, who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for peace, were chargeable with great diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. To preſerve life, they were tempted to utter falſehood.</p>
            <p>WE diſcover falſehood in Jonathan, the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend of the ſon of Jeſſe, when his father Saul ſought his life. Jonathan excuſed his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by a falſehood. The like diſſimulation and falſehood we alſo find in David, when he fled for his life to Ahimeleck the prieſt, and to Achiſh king of Gath.</p>
            <p>THE inſtances of falſchood in good men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the bible, were principally in caſes in which life was in danger, and the fear of death over came for a time, a juſt ſenſe of the ſacred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of truth. Some of them afterwards ſuffered for their falschood, and all repented of the ſin.</p>
            <p>SOME reflections will conclude this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. LET us habitually cultivate in our hearts a principle of love and loyalty to God, as the moſt efficacious motive to the ſacred obſervance of truth, and ſincerity, in all our converſation with mankind. "Thou, O Lord, deſireſt truth in the inner parts. The eyes of the Lord are upon the truth. "Impreſſed with a lively ſenſe of the divine omniſcience, we ſhall do no injuſtice knowingly to men. Let us not violate ſacred
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028999_0269_0FDDD1BE4ABF6760"/>truth, though tempted by the moſt flattering proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of wealth, honor or life. For he who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatizes from truth and a good conſcience, to ſave life, ſhall loſe it. Let it be the rule &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all our words and actions. Let a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the odious nature, and hurtful effects of falſehood, guard us from this ſin, and excite to a watchfulneſs over the thoughts, that we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not with our tongue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE impreſſions of kindneſs and charity towards our fellow men, will reſtrain the tongue from injury. When duty calls to ſpeak of the ill deeds of others, or to hear them ſpoken of, let us conſider what we ſhould reaſonably wiſh, were we in their condition; and practiſe upon that juſt and benevolent rule of religion, "as ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them." Let not prejudice, fear or partiality, tempt us, at any time, to deviate from the line of truth and rectitude. Let us ever diſcounten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the vice of ſlander, and ſtop our ears to the language of detraction; and avoid the company of thoſe, who propagate idle tales, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their neighbor. If any have been guilty of this heinous offence, let them ſeriouſly reflect on the injury, which they have done to others. If by the ſuggeſtions of the father of lies, and the depravity of their own hearts, any have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aiſed groundleſs reports againſt their neighbor, ſet them take all ſnitable methods to repair the injury. Let them follow the ſcandal, which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, through all its windings, and unſay and contradict it, and make reparation. Let the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender look forward to that ſolemn day, when for every idle &amp; falſe word, he muſt give account to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="unknown:028999_0270_0FDDD1C46CD06980"/>
As motives preventive of this vice, let me men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1. That ſlander is the way to widen the breach of friendſhip between men, and increaſe contention. "A tale bearer ſeparateth chiefeſt friends." A ſincere regard for an offending bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will diſpoſe us, in the ſpirit of meekneſs, to endeavour to reform him from his faults; but ſlander tends to create them. It excites the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and hatred of both the injured, and the offender.</p>
            <p>GIVE praiſe where it is due; and be as ready to commend another, for his good deeds, as to cenſure him, for thoſe which are evil. If the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is guilty of the ſin, of which you accuſe him, remember that you alſo are an offender: that you have ſins lying upon your conſcience, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, greater than thoſe, for which you condemn him. Do you not need mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs from God, as well as your offending brother? And can you perſwade yourſelf, that your offences are leſs than his, becauſe they are yours? If the ſin which you charge upon another, is falſe and groundleſs, your ſin is the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you condemn the innocent.</p>
            <p>LET us guard againſt that fooliſh talking, which ſports with the reputation and happineſs of others. He who ſo does, is compared to a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who caſts abroad fire-brands, arrows and death. Tho' it is mirth to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>er, it is the occaſion of grief to the injured. To guard againſt the evils condemned by this law, we are to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe that ſincerity, openneſs and integrity, which is oppoſed to guile, hypocriſy and falſehood. What a worthy commendation does Jeſus give, of one of his diſciples, "behold an Iſraelite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028999_0271_0FDDD1C5C2C69628"/>in whom is no guile." Let us ſtrive, ſirs, to obtain this worthineſs of character.</p>
            <p>IF you have deſerved reproach, receive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it as an admonition to repent and reform; and go and ſin no more. Thus you will make an enemy, the inſtrument of your ſpiritual advantage and ſalvation. If you are innocent, pity the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and let the reproach ſerve as a guard againſt all juſt occaſions of offence.</p>
            <p>IF you ſuffer reproach for doing your duty to God and mankind, dare to be ſingular in your adherence to the cauſe of religion, and in the midſt of mockery and perſecution, meekly bear the ſhame. Let your example be the meek and patient Jeſus, "who when he was reviled, revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not again, when he ſuffered he threatened not." His ſuffering followers, he will reward with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honors. "Caſt not away your confidence in him, for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe." If you meet with oppoſition from this quarter in the progreſs of your ſalvation, meet it with fortitude; humbly depending on the grace of Chriſt, who for us, ſuffered without the gate; And go forth, therefore, unto him without the camp, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>OUR Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is called the faithful and the true witneſs, becauſe he declared to men the counſel of God, and made known all things neceſſary to our faith and practice, with plainneſs, faithfulneſs and truth. In him was no guile. He witneſſed a good confeſſion before Pontius Pilate, ſaying, "To this end was I born, and for this cauſe, came I into the world, that I ſhould bear

            <p>AWFUL will be the final doom of falſe-ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, liars and the perjured. They will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the lake of fire and brimdone, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the breath of incenſed juſtice. But the everlaſting bleſſedneſs and glories of heaven, will be given to him that ſpeaketh the truth in his heart, who loves God with all the heart, and his neighbor as himſelf, and is true and faithful to men. "Lord, who ſhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly, and worketh righteouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart."</p>
            <p>

                  <p>Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbor's houſe, thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man ſervant, nor his maid ſervant, nor his ox, nor his aſs, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.</p>

            <p>THIS is the laſt precept of the moral law. The four preceeding, reſpect the life, the chaſtity, the property and the reputation of our fellow men. There is a ſtriking gradation in the arrangement of the duties and virtues of this ſecond table of the law. The greater crimes are firſt prohibited, and the obligation of the higher duties implied. And the prohibition of theſe crimes, and the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the oppoſite duties and virtues, are wiſely laid on the foundation of ſilial obedience; which is the firſt law of duty towards mankind. For the virtue of filial piety, prepares the ſubject for the faithful performance of all ſocial and relative duties. This tenth and laſt precept is added as an appendix to the whole, and is a key to open and explain the ſpirituality, the latitude and extent of the other precepts of this univerſal law. "Thou ſhalt not <hi>covet,</hi> any thing that is thy neighbor's." This precept relates immediately to the heart, and ſhews that this, and all the reſt, are ſpiritual as well as external. It ſtrikes at the root of all evil in conduct towards our fellow men; for all evil originates in a ſelfiſh and covetous principle, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſhed in the heart. We are hence taught the
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028999_0274_0FDDD1CFC8126BE8"/>ſpirituality, and perfection of the moral law. That it reſpects the ſtate of the mind; the government of the paſſions and affections, and all the faculties and exerciſes of the heart, as well as the external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Our text confirms the declaration of the Apoſtle, "The law is ſpiritual." And alſo of the pſalmiſt, "Thy commandment is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad."</p>
            <p>To look back to the precepts of this ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we find, the fifth teaches us, very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, the duties which we owe to ſuperiors and inferiors; the remaining precepts, our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our equals; the ſixth, in the preſervation of his perſon and life; the ſeventh, his innocency and chaſtity; the eighth, his property; the ninth, his reputation. And ſince all evil conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, proceeds from a depraved nature, this laſt precept gives a rule of government to the heart, forbidding every luſtful or coveting emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the goods, poſſeſſions and enjoyments of others, and demanding univerſal good will to men, and contentment with our own condition. Thus every degree of injurious conduct towards others, is deſtroyed at its ſource; the fountain is healed, that good and beneficent actions may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly flow to men.</p>
            <p>THIS precept is added to ſhew us, that God's law muſt be impreſſed upon the heart, would we acceptably keep his commandments. And that it muſt be divinely written there, by the powerful operation of renewing grace, by which it is able to convert the ſoul, reforming not only external immoralities, but changing the heart from a ſtate of rebellion againſt God, and hatred of others to the love of God and our neighbour. This is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028999_0275_0FDDD1D100C57E98"/>the caſe with him, on whoſe heart God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law operates in its ſpirituality and purity.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt table of the law, the ever bleſſed God is propoſed to us, as the firſt object of our thoughts, our love and obedience. And from the nature of the law, and the perfections of God, the father of our ſpirits, we muſt infer that no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be acceptable with him, unleſs done from principle, or an habitual regard to him. And that his glory muſt be the chief end of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his creatures. The duties of the ſecond table, originate in the ſame divine authority, and teach us, that they are to be performed by us, for his ſake, or from a ſincere regard to the divine authority. Thus truth and ſincerity of heart are demanded, in all the duties of piety towards God, and of righteouſneſs towards men. To him who keeps this laſt precept in ſincerity, all the other duties of this table will be eaſy. "Thou ſhalt not covet."</p>
            <p>I ſhall, 1. Explain the nature and extent of this prohibition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Recommend the virtue and duty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
            <p>AND laſtly, the exerciſe of the benevolent and friendly affections towards our fellow men.</p>
            <p>COVETOUSNESS is a ſordid, ſelfiſh paſſion. It is an exceſs of love and complacency in earthly objects, and a criminal deſire to poſſeſs the things of others. Whoever ſeriouſly conviders the evils attendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

FOR the miſeries which mankind bring upon themſelves and on others, by the crimes of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and unmercifulneſs; the invaſion of ſocial and civil rights, intemperance, laſciviouſneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, robbery and war; and the baniſhment of the benevolent affections from the human heart, may all be traced to the ſin of <hi>coveting,</hi> or eagerly thirſting after the goods and enjoyments of this life. Tho' the text condemns coveting any thing that is our neighbor's, it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn lawfully deſiring, or endeavors to obtain, ſome things which are the property of others. Mankind are placed in a condition of mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, for many things neceſſary to life and happineſs. This dependence is the ſpring of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and exertion, in every occupation. We lawfully ſtrive to obtain by purchaſe, the goods which others poſſeſs, and which we need. What is condemned, is the deſire to poſſeſs thoſe goods of others, which we cannot lawfully poſſeſs; and which others cannot part with, without injury to themſelves. The crime forbidden, appears in ſtriking colors, in a ſelfiſh Ahab, coveting the vineyard of Naboth.
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.</note> The latter refuſed to part with ſo valuable a patrimony, the inheritance of his anceſtors. But the avaricious monarch, inſtigated by the criminal paſſion of covetouſneſs, deviſed means to accompliſh the death of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man, and by force ſeized the poſſeſſion of his neighbour. For this crime, a prophet was divinely commiſſioned, to pronounce upon him, an untimely death, and the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> principle is the ſource of covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. A covetous man views himſelf, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object in the univerſe, whoſe wiſhes are to be
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:028999_0277_0FDDD1D7D9784F38"/>gratified. His ſoul is contracted and draws all things to itſelf. It is a ſtranger to benevolence, and the tenderneſs of ſympathy. To correct and eradicate ſo mean a principle, let the ſubject ſtrive to conſider himſelf, but as a poor helpleſs indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, in the great family of mankind. Let him place himſelf, as in the preſence of his creator, and aſk himſelf, in what light he appears in the view of the univerſal preſerver and judge of his creatures; and whether he has a right to claim greater favors, than myriads of his fellow men? A ſlight diſcovery of his helpleſs and dependent condition, and his unworthineſs of the leaſt of the divine mercies, would reſtrain thoſe ſelfiſh and unreaſonable deſires, which graſp after the goods of others. But this view of himſelf, the covetous mortal has not. He imagines the world made for his uſe, and ſtrives to riſe on the ruin of others. He cares not who ſinks into poverty and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, provided he may ſwim in wealth; nor by what means he gets poſſeſſion of the goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Covetouſneſs is a criminal paſſion,</p>
            <p n="1">1. BECAUSE its tendency is deſtructive to the intereſts and happineſs of others. It diſpoſes a perſon to deprive another of his goods, without a juſt equivalent, and thus reduce him to penury and wretchedneſs. And when power is united with avarice, all within the reach of that power, will feel the effects of this ſelfiſh principle, for it produces injuſtice, oppreſſion &amp; violence. Men have a legal right, by the laws of God and of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to their own goods and enjoyments, but to covet, or anxiouſly deſire them, is to be unjuſt &amp; unmerciful to men.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="290" facs="unknown:028999_0278_0FDDD1D94B8CC980"/>
2. IT is a temper and practice, directly oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the will of God. For it is his pleaſure that mankind ſhould poſſeſs and enjoy the bounties of his providence, and the fruits of their lawful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: but covetouſneſs oppoſes this benevolent intention of the creator. It takes from another, what he claims by the beſt title, even the law of the univerſal proprietor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is a ſin hurtful to him who indulges it. It deprives him of contentment and peace of mind; fills the heart with reſtleſs deſires; and ſets the invention at work to deprive others of their poſſeſſions unlawfully, and thus makes work for ſuch uneaſy reflections, as effectually deſtroy all enjoyment. The thoughts are agitated, like the reſtleſs ſea, and the ſoul laid open, to invite many fatal temptations. An increaſe of wealth increaſes anxiety and cares. Our neceſſary wants are few, and eaſily ſatisfied; our fancied wants are many, and are never ſupplied.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Man wants but little here below,</l>
               <l>"Nor wants that little long."</l>
            </q>
            <p>WHY ſhould we augment our burdens, by wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for more, while travelling the journey of this tranſitory life? We brought nothing into the world, and we can carry nothing out of it. The deſire and purſuit of riches are lawful and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, only when our governing motive is to do good; or by them, to enlarge the ſphere of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. It is a low and criminal paſſion which prompts men to acquire wealth, for the ſake of wealth; and without the intention to employ it, to good and uſeful purpoſes. The frowns of heaven are upon the acquiſitions of the covetous,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:028999_0279_0FDDD1E010CEF2B0"/>who purſue after wealth, for its own ſake. "As the ſcorching ſun withers the graſs, and it periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo alſo ſhall the covetous man fade away in his ways." Vain is the defence of riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the accidents of life, and the power of death. They avail not in the day of wrath. "Their ſilver and their gold ſhall not be able to deliver them, in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they ſhall not ſatisfy their ſouls, neither fill their bowels." The covetous perſon, is tormented with the malevolent paſſion of envy. He is envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the proſperity of his neighbor.</p>
            <p>LET the experience of the wiſeſt and wealthieſt of the ſons of men, ſatisfy us, of the vanity and vexation, which attends the purſuit of riches, as the object of the ſoul's felicity. Solomon ſought happineſs in riches, and earthly goods, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. But the purſuit was vain. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſorrowful and diſappointed. Each crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid, happineſs is not in me. Let us hear his own account of the matter. "I ſaid, I will prove thee, with mirth, therefore enjoy pleaſure; and behold, this alſo is vanity. I gave myſelf to wine and merriment. I made great works; I built houſes and planted vineyards; I made me gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and orchards, I got me ſervants and maidens, —I had great poſſeſſions of great and ſmall cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and heaped up ſilver and gold, I got men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers and women-ſingers, and the delights of the ſons of men, muſical inſtruments, and that of all ſorts; and whatſoever my eyes deſired I kept not from them. I withheld not my heart from any joy. Then I looked upon all, and all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit; and there is no profit under the ſun. I hated all my labor, becauſe I ſhould leave it to the man that ſhould be after me, &amp; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:028999_0280_0FDDD1E1794A84E8"/>whether he ſhall be a wiſe man or a fool." Theſe concluding reflections are the reſult of the large experience, of one, who was under the beſt poſſible advantage to make the experiment; and who deliberately went to work, to find all that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which this world can give. He inſcribes vanity and vexation on all things beneath the ſun, purſued as an object, to ſatisfy the immortal deſires of the ſoul. And what can he do who cometh after the king? But the object which he ſo eagerly purſued, he found, where it is only to be found, in the love and fear of God. "Let us, ſays he, hear the concluſion of the whole matter, fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man."</p>
            <p>PERSONS are directed to make ſuitable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this life, by diligence and care in ſome lawful calling; ſenſible of dependence on God; and to "uſe this world as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away."</p>
            <p>THE love of this world is criminal, where it hinders the exerciſe of the duties of religion; or makes the heart cold and indifferent towards them. When the higheſt ſatisfactions ariſe from the poſſeſſions and pleaſures of life, the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſenſes and appetites, and the applauſe of men. When theſe are valued and ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more than the loving kindneſs of God, and a conformity to him; when more pleaſure is found in them, than in the conſolations of religion, in the worſhip of God, his word and ordinances; where perſons experience little or no delight, in devout meditation on the perfections works and providences of God; or in drawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh to him, in devout prayer and praiſe; then is the heart at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:028999_0281_0FDDD1E329441640"/>criminally to this world, and oppoſed to God, and to its own true happineſs. Then does the heart go after its own covetouſneſs. And he that thus loveth the world ſupremely, the love of the father is not in him.</p>
            <p>ALL the good which the world contains, is comprized by ſaint John, in three things, <hi>pleaſure, wealth</hi> and <hi>honor,</hi> by the name of the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, and the pride of life. The heart that is ardent in the purſuit of theſe, as its chief happineſs, is enmity with God.</p>
            <p>THE man of this world, when invited to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render back his heart, which has wandered from God, as the diſſipated prodigal from his father's houſe, forms many excuſes. "One goeth to his farm, and another to his merchandize." One to his worldly buſineſs, and another to his ſenſual pleaſures, and the ſoul periſhes with its periſhable riches.</p>
            <p>LET the concluſion of this diſcourſe impreſs our minds with this truth, that <hi>the expectation of permanent happineſs, in the things of this life, is vain.</hi> The immortal mind muſt look above and beyond this world, for this invaluable pearl. For that which is ſhort in duration, and uncertain in its ſtay, as is the caſe with all things here, cannot give reſt or peace, to the deſires of the immortal mind. In the favor of God alone, ſhall we find that bleſſedneſs, of which no accidents, nor life, nor death, nor things preſent, nor things to come, can deprive us.</p>
            <p>THE happineſs of worldly men, is rather in appearance than real; and a poor kind of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at beſt. The crown of royalty is often a
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:028999_0282_0FDDD1E8A6C654A0"/>crown of thorns, to him who wears it; and the monarch who wields a ſceptre, is leſs happy than the peaſant who guides the plow. All earthly things are changing, and tending to death. They will ſoon be to us, as tho' they had never been. The good man, who hopes to ſee a kingdom which can never be moved, would not wiſh to live here always. To be the ſport of unforeſeen accidents, of expectations and diſappointments; of pains and pleaſures, of proſtrate hopes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding joys; is not that ſtate of permanent reſt and happineſs, which our ever active ſpirits pant after. They reſt only in that peace, which ariſes from a ſweet ſenſe of pardon and reconciliation with God; "that peace, which paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart."</p>
            <p>THE ſhifting ſcenes and ſorrows of life, are wiſely and mercifully ordered, by our creator, to convince us that this is not our home; and thus detach our minds from all ſublunary things, and elevate our nobleſt ambition, and fix our hopes beyond the ſkies.</p>
            <p>BLESSED is the man, who overcomes, through the grace of the ſaviour, the ſordid love of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and of this tranſitory life; and who minds religion now. To him, the ſaviour addreſſes theſe comforting words, "He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my ſon."</p>
            <p>LET the ſolemn caution which is given us in this precept, be continually impreſſed on all our minds, leſt at any time our "hearts be over charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cares of this life," the flattering proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028999_0283_0FDDD1E9BA047A60"/>of pleaſure, or the amuſing charms of the world, and drown the good impreſſions of the holy law of God, and the goſpel of his ſon, on our minds.</p>
            <p>SHALL we pant after the periſhable goods of this life, and turn our back upon heavenly riches? Shall we fondly hug the phantoms of happineſs, which die in our embrace, and fooliſhly call them our portion? Shall we build ſubſtantial dwellings on the moving ſands, and ſtormy ſeas? Let us rather, with humble &amp; perſevering ardor, breathe after that never ending happineſs, which flows from the love of God, reconciled thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THE ſhortneſs of our time to prepare for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ought to excite our moſt earneſt ſolicitude, that we may obtain that eternal world. That you may obtain, let me, ſirs, invite you to him, who has purchaſed heaven for you, and who with unutterable compaſſion addreſſes you, ſaying, "Come unto me, and I will give you reſt. He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt." If ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is loſt, through a criminal love of this world, the ſinner's choice will be without excuſe, and his condemnation without remedy.</p>
            <p>STANDING at the gate of death, and entering on the ſhores of eternity's vaſt, unbounded ocean, how trifling, will all the goods of this life then appear, to you, ſirs, to me, and to all the ſons of men? For that awſul and glorious period, may we all now be preparing and prepared, and ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs. <hi>Provide for yourſelves treaſure in heaven, that

            <p>THE virtue of contentment, is oppoſite to the vice of covetouſneſs. Let us now attend to the nature and duties of this amiable virtue.</p>
            <p>CONTENTMENT has its ſeat in the mind. It is a ſatisfaction with our condition, as ordered by God's providence. It is a virtue which reſpects principally our circumſtances in life. It is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from diſtreſſing care and anxiety, to alter our condition; and contains a cheerful reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and grateful acquieſcence, in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine providence. It is a virtue which depends not on external appendages. Whether we are poor or rich, in eaſe or pain, in company or ſolitude, in elevated ſtations, or the humble walks of life. It is not in the power of earthly ſcenes, to give or take it away. For true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment ariſes from a higher ſource than this world's enjoyments. It ſprings from a firm truſt in God, and a humble grateful ſenſe of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and unworthineſs of the divine mercies. Several conſiderations may be ſuggeſted to eſtabliſh in our ſouls the divine virtue of contentment, &amp; to excite us to a daily cultivation of its pleaſant and profitable duties. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD is the munificent giver of all that we
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:028999_0286_0FDDD1F387AFC218"/>poſſeſs or enjoy. From him we receive the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of exiſtence, and all thoſe circumſtances which make it deſirable and happy. His rich gifts are to be received with gratitude. In his air we breathe, his ſoil gives us bread, his ſun warms, the fleeces of his flocks clothe us, and from his foreſts we are provided with convenient dwellings. He continues to us the bounties of his providence, and us in the enjoyment of them. "In God we live and move and have our being." Whether God gives us little or much of this world's good, contentment and gratitude is demanded of us. "Be content with ſuch things as ye have, for he hath ſaid I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee." The providence of God is engaged to ſupply our real wants. "The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are unworthy of the mercies of God, and cannot claim any good things which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows. Our mercies flow from his ſoveran plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As we are ſinners we have made ourſelves unworthy of them. The ſupreme Jehovah need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not creatures, to increaſe his own eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. To communicate happineſs to them, he was pleaſed to bring them into exiſtence. We have ungratefully rebelled againſt him, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ourſelves the objects of his righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But inſtead of judgments, mercies are ſhowered down upon us. Every favor man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, is more than he deſerves. A ſenſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and of the divine goodneſs, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite gratitude, contentment and peace in every ingenuous mind. In this frame was the patriarch Jacob, who, on the recollection of the paſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and a lively ſenſe of the preſent,
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:028999_0287_0FDDD1F8D95D9F30"/>exclaims, "O Lord, I am not worthy of all the mercies and all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant."</p>
            <p n="3">3. MULTITUDES of our fellow men, as good or better than ourſelves, are not ſo well provided for. While we are in health; others are ſick: while we are ſick and accomodated; others are ſick and deſtitute: while we have food &amp; cloathing; others ſuffer with hunger and nakedneſs: while we are bleſſed with reaſon, kindred and friends; others are deprived of their underſtanding, or have loſt their deareſt friends by death: while we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the advantages and comforts of ſocial and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil life; others are pining in ſlavery and bondage: while we enjoy the bleſſed light of the goſpel, and means of ſalvation; others are wandering in the darkneſs of paganiſm, without God, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hope in the world. When we ſuffer, we are to conſider that others have alſo ſuffered as great or greater trials: and alſo that God can ſuſtain and comfort us, in the greateſt. We are to remember that the hand of God, who does all things well, is in every affliction; and that it might have been much worſe with us than it is. Better perſons, the objects of heaven's peculiar care and kindneſs, have endured greater trials. Many ancient ſaints, of whom the world was not worthy, were deſtitute, afflicted, tormented; yet did contentedly bear the ſpoiling of their goods. Call to recollection the condition of Jeſus, who was emphatically a man of ſorrows, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſigned, and ever contented. Unparalleled ſufferings he endured for you; but yours are all merited. As no murmuring or diſcontentment was found in him, in his great trials, let none be indulged by you. In his ſuperior ſorrows forget
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:028999_0288_0FDDD318DCB27368"/>your own; for yours are infinitely leſs than your deſerts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. CONTENTMENT is neceſſary to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is indeed but another name for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is attended with peace of mind. Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with the diſpenſations of providence, the mind enjoys peace. Serenity reigns within. The ſoul that is pleaſed with the ways of God, all whoſe ways are right, and diſmiſſes all anxious concerns for the periſhable goods of life, poſſeſſes happineſs, which others vainly ſeek, in the increaſe of wealth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Content is wealth, the riches of the mind:</l>
               <l>"And happy he who can that treaſure find.</l>
               <l>"But the bare miſer ſtarves amid his ſtore,</l>
               <l>"Broods on his gold, and griping ſtill at more,</l>
               <l>"Sits ſadly pining, and believes he's poor."</l>
            </q>
            <p n="5">5. CONTENTMENT is neceſſary to uſefulneſs. As the contented perſon is prepared to obey God acceptably, he is prepared to ſerve his generation uſefully. The contented man ſeeks and purſues lawful and laudable means, to advance his own beſt intereſts and happineſs; and he will alſo purſue the ſame, to promote the good of his neighbor. The diſcontented perſon is a trouble to himſelf, and to others: but the contented are pleaſed with themſelves, and with others. He who would have friends, muſt ſhew himſelf friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the example and labors of ſuch, are moſt likely to be good and uſeful to mankind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. GREAT proſit and advantage ariſes from the practice of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irtue. The contented mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a feaſt which never cloys. It finds arguments for gratitude and praiſe to God, in all poſſible cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:028999_0289_0FDD5FE7F4E0AEA0"/>and eſpecially at every freſh inſtance of divine bounty. The chriſtian lives in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who habitually cultivates this virtue. He will ſweetly experience the truth of the declaration of the apoſtle, that "godlineſs with contentment, is great gain."</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE conſideration of the ſhortneſs of the time that we have to live, ſhould be a motive to cultivate the virtue of contentment, with our worldly condition. Why ſhould we be very anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious about what we ſhall leave ſo ſoon? While we are in this world, the good providence of God will take care of us. The part which we are to act on the theatre of life is aſſigned us, and we ſhall find ſupport in the way of our duty. And he who confides in God will never be confounded.</p>
            <p>THO' our condition in the world may be mean and poor, and our hopes cut off by unſeen caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, let us ever bear in mind, that this is not our reſt, and that the ſcene will ſoon be changed. God's good providence may give us to ſee better days. Let hope and truſt in God, bear up our ſpirits, and animate our reſolutions in duty. Let us remember, that at death, and in the future world, it will not be of any conſequence to us, what our worldly condition has been; whether we were once rich or poor, honorable or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, the companions of princes or peaſants; for death levels all diſtinctions. The only inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which will then greatly concern us, will be, whether we have done well, as the children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and friends of our God and Saviour. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and afflictions are among the inſtrumental means of grace, and are oftimes ſanctified, to the ſpiritual and eternal happineſs of thoſe who are
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:028999_0290_0FDD5FFD1C9AE040"/>ſubjected to them. This conſideration ſhould excite the earneſt deſires of the afflicted and poor of this world, after thoſe durable riches, which the ſaviour gives to the humble and poor in ſpirit. "The light afflictions of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory to be revealed." An increaſe of wealth is attended with temptations; and particularly the dangerous one of withdrawing the heart from God, and the intereſts of eternity. Mankind are inclined to truſt in riches, as their defence and confidence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find repeated ſolemn cautions, in the book of God, againſt the ardent purſuit and love of them. "If riches increaſe, ſet not thy heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them." They ſometimes part the ſoul from Chriſt; as we ſee in the inſtance of the young ruler, whom Jeſus kindly invited to follow him, with the aſſurance, that he ſhould have a treaſure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But he went away ſorrowful, becauſe he was rich. Alarming to thoſe, whoſe hearts are abſorbed in the love of this world, is the remark which the divine ſaviour makes, on that occaſion. "How hardly ſhall they that have riches enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven." For to uſe a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar proce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>b, "it is eaſier for a camel to go thro' the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."</p>
            <p>GREAT gain is ſecured to thoſe in whom are united gollineſs with contentment. The gain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the union of theſe divine virtues, are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal riches. And this is gain ſuited to the taſte, and worthy of the purſuit, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal mind. And of this gain, neither life nor death, nor things preſent, nor things to come, can deprive the happy ſubject. For the favor of God is an eternal inheritance, and the happineſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaven, never fading treaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="unknown:028999_0291_0FDDD2C1EFE19950"/>
A GOOD or ill improvement of wealth, depends upon the diſpoſition of the poſſeſſor. An increaſe of riches, alters not the diſpoſition of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, except, as it gives him opportunity to gratify his benevolent feelings, by enlarging the ſphere of his uſefulneſs. For riches are deſirable only as a means of doing good. Should they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or abate, his mind is fitted to his condition, and accommodates itſelf to the alteration of his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. His heart is not proudly elevated with proſperity, nor meanly depreſſed in adverſity. He makes not gold his confidence; but the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs of the Lord is his moſt deſirable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But on the other hand the evils of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment are many. They may be traced up to the ſources of pride, ſelfiſhneſs and unbelief.</p>
            <p n="1">1. PRIDE is a fruitful ſource of diſcontentment. From this evil principle, originate rebellious murmurings againſt adverſe providences, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious emotions of ſoul at the proſperity of others, and covetous deſires to poſſeſs others goods. Inſtead of rejoicing, it grieves at their happineſs. Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by this malignant principle, the proud ſpirit ſtrives to riſe and aggrandize itſelf, at the expence of the intereſts and happineſs, of his neighbor. This haughty ſpirit of proud diſcontent, is to be ſubdued by the cultivation of a meek and humble temper, and a diſpoſition to comport with the ſtation, and condition aſſigned, by a wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>THE proud perſon is forever diſcontented, and expoſed to many mortifications. He is impelled to live beyond his circumſtances, and to draw ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration by the vain parade of life. Let pride and vain glory be mortified, by that humbleneſs
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:028999_0292_0FDDD2C38EAC5CE8"/>of mind, which is amiable in the view of the world, and "in the ſight of God, of great price. God exalteth the humble, and abaſeth the proud."</p>
            <p n="2">2. SELFISHNESS is another ſource of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is a principle which engroſſes every thing to itſelf, and like the circling whirlpool, draws all things to its own centre. It graſps after the goods of others; is not ſatisfied with compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; but labours to poſſeſs what it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Like the grave it is never ſatisfied. How did diſcontent rankle in the felfiſh breaſt of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Tho' elevated to all the honors of a royal court, he was moſt unhappy, becauſe Mordecai refuſed him a ſervile bow. To what extremes of injuſtice and cruelty, did his ſelfiſh diſcontent tranſport him, when, to gratify it, he ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a whole nation? But the juſtice of heaven ſometimes interpoſes, to puniſh the flagitious crimes of individuals, in this life; that others may hear and fear. The crafty are caught by their own devices, and the ruin which they meditated for others, comes upon their own head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DISBELIEF of God's governing providence, is a ſource of diſcontentment. Unbelief is blind to that liberal hand of the munificent parent of the Univerſe, that pours in rich profuſion, his bounties upon his creatures; who cauſes the ſun to riſe, and the rain to deſcend, on the evil and on the good, and on the juſt and the unjuſt. To guard againſt a ſinful diſtruſt of that ever active providence, which protects and provides for us, our Lord called the attention of his diſciples to the lilies of the field, and the birds of the air. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them, that the Almighty hand which clothes the one, in all their gay and blooming colors;
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:028999_0293_0FDDD2C847F4BA58"/>and that feeds the other, will much more take care of men, and eſpecially of good men, who are of more value than lilies and ſparrows.</p>
            <p n="4">4. DISCONTENTMENT with our condition, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifies us for duty. It is oppoſed to that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and reſigned temper, which is neceſſary to render our offerings and ſervices acceptable to God, and our lives a bleſſing to mankind. "The meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way."</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT diſcovers a diſpoſition to take up with a portion in the goods of this life. It is eſtimating too highly the things of this world, the faſhion of which is ſwiftly paſſing away. The diſcontented perſon places his chief deſires, and enjoyments in the goods of this world, as tho' his happineſs conſiſted in the abundance of temporal poſſeſſions. But reaſon would dictate to us, that ſince this life is of ſhort duration, and the time of our death uncertain; and ſince the ſoul will exiſt forever, the comforts and poſſeſſions of this world, ſhould be valued and ſought after, as ſubſervient to our future and immortal exiſtance. The folly of placing a dependence on temporal goods and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, will be ſtrikingly ſeen in the ſolemn hour of death. What will they then profit a man? It is illuſtrated by our Lord, in the parable of the rich man, "who ſaid to his ſoul, ſoul thou haſt much goods laid up in ſtore for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry: but God ſaid, thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided? So is he that layeth up treaſures for himſelf, and is not rich towards God."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="unknown:028999_0294_0FDDD2CB997E2F20"/>
THE like folly and madneſs appears in him, at whoſe inhoſpitable gate, afflicted Lazarus lay. In this world he had his good things, tho' ſhort in duration, and in the other, his evil things, of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs continuance. Tho' he fared delicately here, for this world was all the heaven and happineſs he wiſhed to know, yet in hell he lift up his eyes in torment, and ſaw between him, and the ſeat of the bleſſed, &amp; impaſſable gulf. A deplorable choice of the man of pleaſure and of this world, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of miſery, for a few years of pleaſure!</p>
            <p>THE folly of fixing on the goods of this world for happineſs alſo appears, in that we ſhall have no uſe for them after death. They will then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flee away. That which we want but for a ſhort time, we ſhould ſeek to obtain with a degree of indifference, compared with that good which we ſhall want forever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. DISCONTENTMENT diſcovers an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be diſpoſed of, as God ſhall ſee beſt; and a contempt alſo of preſent mercies. To be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy with our condition, as it is ordered by God's providence, is to murmur at the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but is it not ſafer to ſubmit to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of infinite wiſdom, than to follow the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of our own imperfect and limited under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? If left to our own choice, no doubt our choice would end in ruin. Let us leave the care and diſpoſal of ourſelves in this, and in all worlds with God; for God is infinitely wiſe and good; and let it be our great concern, to conform ourſelves to all the notices of his will, in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life. The diſcontented alſo ungratefully miſimprove preſent mercies. They overlook them, and wiſh for others. The diſcontented
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:028999_0295_0FDDD2CCF7819C28"/>have ground to fear that they ſhall be puniſhed by the removal of mercies already abuſed, and the cutting off of thoſe, which would have been given them. God demands a grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mercies enjoyed, or hoped for. "For theſe things I will be inquired of, to do it for them."</p>
            <p>IT is difficult to convince the diſcontented of the inexcuſableneſs and guilt of this ſin. They perſuade themſelves that they have juſt cauſe. So the peeviſh prophet Jonah thought that he did well to be angry, &amp; was hard to be convinced, even when his maker condeſcended to expoſtulate with him on his unreaſonable diſcontentment. Perſons of this ſpirit are ready to alledge in their juſtification, that they cannot cure a fretful temper. But this cannot be admited in excuſe, becauſe this temper is their ſin. They do not labor to ſubdue it. The remedy againſt either a fretful, haſty or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented temper, is the cultivation of a deep ſenſe of unworthineſs, and accountableneſs to God.</p>
            <p>SOME perſons alledge, that they ought to reſent with ſpirit, injuries brought upon them by men. But no man is qualified to reſent an injury from men, unleſs his mind is ſolemnly impreſſed with the belief, that the hand of God is in it, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for his beſt good. While we lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt evil from men, we are meekly to ſubmit to the divine correction therein. Tho' they mean it for evil, God intends it for good. We come,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, to recommend and urge thoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and benevolent affections towards men, which will powerfully incline us to promote their intereſts
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:028999_0296_0FDDD2D308FBE188"/>and happineſs in all reſpects. The principle that combines in one, all the precepts of duty to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is <hi>love.</hi> "Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thyſelf, for love is the fulfiling of the law." If this great principle of the law and goſpel, reigns in our hearts, we ſhall be happily ſecured from all the evils, comprehended in the ſin of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting the goods of others. In all caſes, let that comprehenſive precept given by our Lord, as the daily directory of every chriſtian, be inſcribed on the heart, "as ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them." And ſincerely practiſing upon this rule we ſhall keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of duty to mankind. Let ſome prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reflections apply and conclude this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE infer the criminal nature and effects of covetouſneſs; or an extreme ſolicitude for the goods of this world, to the neglect of the ſoul's immortal intereſts. Short and uncertain is this tranſitory life! How ſoon ſhall we leave all that the world eſteems great and deſirable, and about which our thoughts, our hopes and fears, are agitated, enraptured or alarmed. Let our ſouls riſe ſuperior to the world, and make the heavenly inheritance their principal object. And ſuffer not the affections to be placed on earthly, to the neglect of heavenly riches. The goods of this world will ſoon be to the owners, as though they had never been. "Make to yourſelves friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations." By ſuch a contented and uſeful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of your earthly riches and advantages, to the glory of God and the happineſs of your fellow men, your good works will go before you into heaven, and give a welcome to your admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:028999_0297_0FDDD2D551841D98"/>there. But on the other hand, what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpects will the worldly ſpirit have, on his admiſſion to the world of ſpirits: that world for which he has made no preparation, and where neither periſhable riches, nor ſenſual pleaſure, will be found? With a ſoul abſorbed in earthly objects, he will find no objects there ſuited to his taſte. Though he may have been wiſe for this world, he will be condemned as moſt unwiſe for eternity, and doomed to dwell with the unholy and unclean.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To guard againſt the ruinous love of this world, let us, ſirs, learn the divine art of living above it. Raiſe your heaven born ſoul to riches and joys, worthy the dignity of its immortal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and open your heart to receive the great ſalvation.</p>
            <p>OUR ſouls are in the purſuit of happineſs. That happineſs which the immortal ſpirit pants after, can be found only in the friendſhip and love of God, through Jeſus Chriſt. Intereſted in this ſalvation, the ſoul will hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, after happineſs in earthly joys.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, let us cultivate a mind ſatisfied with all the allotments of divine providence. Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the will of God is the perfection of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs. Let us learn with the bleſſed Apoſtle, in whatſoever ſtate we are, therewith to be content. Our life is haſtening to a cloſe. Our ſalvation is the one thing needful, let it be purſued with all the ardor of our ſouls. Labor not for the meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth unto everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>WE have now, my brethren, come to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:028999_0298_0FDDD2D6DF682D28"/>of our remarks on the nature, extent, ſpirituality and perfection of the divinely moral law; that ſummary of univerſal duty. And on the review of the whole, is there, ſirs, one of us, who can lay his hand upon his heart, and ſay, all theſe commandments I have perfectly kept? Does not the law conclude us all under ſin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? Is there a ſingle precept which we have not broken, if not in the letter, yet in the ſpirit of it? "If we ſay we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourſelves and the truth is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>AND now unto him who has magnified the law, and brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs; and for whoſe ſake the father of mercies heareth and accepteth ſinners, be ſalvation, dominion and glory, world without end.</p>

            <p>THIS comprehenſive ſentence expreſſes the purity and perfection of that divine law which God gave to mankind, as the ſtandard of truth and ſummary of duty. The apoſtle adds, and the commandment is holy, and juſt and good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the <hi>law</hi> ſeem intended all the precepts of the decalogue; and by the <hi>commandment,</hi> that one in particular, which forbids the ſin of covering, or worldly and luſtful emotions of the heart. The prohibition of theſe, in the tenth commandment, convinced Paul that he was a tranſgreſſor of the law. The other precepts he explained, while depending on his own righteouſneſs for ſalvation, as refering principally or altogether to external duties: but when he examined himſelf by that precept which regulates the heart, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deficient. <hi>For I had not known luſt, except the law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> The whole law is proclaimed holy, and that precept in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which condemns the ſecret ſin of coveting.</p>
            <p>WHEN it is aſſerted that the moral law was given to man at his creation, that it was written upon his heart, and the like; it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with ſome limitation. Adam in his <hi>ſolitary</hi> condition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> creation, had no occaſion for the obſervance of the precepts of the ſecond table of the law. He had for inſtance, no earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:028999_0300_0FDDD2DFD0072E10"/>to honor; there was no perſon living whom he could kill; or with whom be could commit adultery; or from whom he could ſteal; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he would bear falſewitneſs; or whoſe goods he could covet. But on the heart of man at creation, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>principle</hi> of the whole law was inſcribed; conſiſting in love and benevolence; to be put into exerciſe as ſoon as objects and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſhould preſent. The particular precepts of the law conſider man in a ſocial condition, and ſhew him his duty in all important caſes.</p>
            <p>WHAT is now propoſed, is—<hi>To conſider the character which is given of the moral law, it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> By its being denominated holy, we are to underſtand, that it is a <hi>pure, ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> law. It is <hi>pure,</hi> as it condemns all ſin,—<hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as it reaches the heart, demanding truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity there,—<hi>perfect,</hi> as it comprehends the rules of univerſal duty, and is a trinſcript of the imitable, moral attributes of Deity.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord has taught us in the goſpel,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> 5. <hi>and elſewhere.</hi>
               </note> that the precepts of the moral law are very extenſive; that they demand the perfect homage and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the heart, as well as of the external be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Taking his infallible expoſition for our guide, let us proceed to look more attentively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the demands of this perfect law.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE ſupreme lawgiver is a ſpirit, and the author of our ſpirits, and demands the homage and obedience of our ſpirits. The law demands the perfection of the obedience. It gives up none of its juſt claims, in condeſcention to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man weakneſs. In all the ſolemn exerciſes of
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:028999_0301_0FDDD2E137EB8958"/>religion &amp; devotion, or thoſe duties towards God which it demands, he, whoſe thoughts, in the multitude and endleſs variety of them, and all his words and actions, are not in all reſpects per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly right, and conformed to the divine will, is guilty in the view of the law. A ſingle evil thought o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> deſire deſtroys that perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the law requires, and the perſon falls under its condemning ſentence. No one has kept the perfect law of love and obedience to God, who has ever indulged a ſingle ſinful thought. On the ſuppoſition that a perſon could be found, who is meerly negatively righteous, or who had never poſitively tranſgreſſed in thought or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; yet would he fall under the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law, becauſe the law requires poſitive duties; not only an abſtinence from all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, but the practice of every virtue. And the duties required, are to be performed with our utmoſt ability. With the beſt judgment, will and affections. It requires that we love God with all the heart, might and mind, conſtantly, and forever. If then there is a ſingle moment, in which our ſouls are not filled with the habit and exerciſe of the higheſt love to God, of which we are capable, we tranſgreſs, by a deficiency of that righteouſneſs which the law requires. If we could have loved God with a more pure and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection at any time, the caſe is the ſame. If we do not render to him, all that obedience and reverence which are due to him, and that in the higheſt degree, and beſt manner, we come ſhort of what is required. If our hearts are not diveſted of all impatience and murmurings, under afflictive providences: if they are not perfectly reſigned to the will of God, without the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:028999_0302_0FDDD2E7F4BE3A50"/>wiſh that he ſhould deal otherwiſe with us: if our wills, with reſpect to our paſt, preſent or future condition and circumſtances, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and cheerfully reſigned to the ſovran and holy will of God, we are deſtitute of that perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience which the law demands from creatures, towards the infinitely perfect creator, and fall under its condemnation.</p>
            <p>IN a word, if at any time a vain or idle thought has come into our minds; or if our thoughts are not exerciſed conſtantly and intirely about thoſe holy, good and uſeful objects and duties which its ſacred precepts demand, we come ſhort of the righteouſneſs of the law, and are condemned. What man then can ſay, that he has kept the firſt great commandment of the law, and thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loved and obeyed God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE ſame perfection of duty alſo, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law requires of us towards our fellow men. It is not ſatisfied if we are only negatively righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards men; or that we do no harm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure none. It demands poſitive and perfect du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It not only requires that you ſhould never allow room in your heart, for a ſingle evil thought or wiſh, to the prejudice of your fellow men; that you feel no emotion of envy at another's proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that you never think ill, much leſs ſpeak evil of him; that you feel no diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge any injury he has done you; or that you neither think, or ſpeak or do any thing injurious to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> perſon, his property or reputation. Not only theſe negative virtues are demanded; but poſitive duties are to be performed, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. The law demands that you love your neighbor as yourſelf. That you love him ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:028999_0303_0FDDD2E973318F70"/>conſtantly, without interruption or abatement. That you love him with your utmoſt ability and do him good with all your power. That you comfort him in affliction, in diſtreſs relieve him, and in error wiſh &amp; ſtrive to reclaim him. That you weep with the ſorrowful and rejoice with the proſperous. It alſo requires that the ſtandard of your love to him ſhould be fixed and immutable: and that the love which you have to yourſelf, ſhould be the rule and meaſure of your love to him. That the ſame kind of love which you have for yourſelf, for your own perſon, intereſt and happineſs, you ſhould feel and exerciſe for the perſon, the intereſts and happineſs of others. It requires a ſtill harder leſſon of you, that is, that you ſhould exerciſe this perfect love to your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enemies;</hi> and that no injuries which they have done you, ſhould abate your love to them. God's perfect law further requires that this love and theſe duties, proceed from a principle of habitual love to God. And that in all your thoughts and conduct towards men, you never entertain any ſelfiſh or ſiniſter end or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; but perpetually ſeek their happineſs, in the glory of God. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE may diſcover ſomething of the purity and perfection of the law, as it holds forth the duties and virtues which are requiſite to our own ſelf government, over our thoughts, affections, appetites and paſſions. By our Lord's explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſixth, ſeventh and ninth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the goſpel, and by his remarks on the obligations of the whole of our duty to men, we ſee that our undiſſembled love ſhould embrace enemies well as friends; and by the expreſs letter of the laſt precept of the law, we find, that is required,
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:028999_0304_0FDDD2EB06A76E20"/>that the heart ſhould be not only intirely free from, and emptied of all ſinful anger, all luſtful impure deſires, and all envious, malevolent and covetous paſſions; but that the oppoſite virtues of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, kindneſs, chaſtity of thought and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and thoughts and deſires raiſed above this world, ſhould live and reign in the heart, as a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perpetual ſpring and principle of action, in all duty to God and to mankind. And that theſe virtues ſhould be practiſed by us, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt &amp; moſt perfect degre, of which we are capable.</p>
            <p>THUS we are taught that the heart of man is the ſubject to which God's perfect law is addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and that he whoſe heart is not in perfect ſubjection to all and every precept thereof, and that alſo in the moſt perfect manner, is deſtitute of the righteouſneſs of the law, and is convinced of the law as a tranſgreſſor, and falls under its condemnation. How broad and extenſive is this perfect law of God! It requires perpetual love and ſinleſs obedience to God, without the leaſt interruption, and that in the moſt pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner of which the rational nature of man is capable. And a ſingle ſinful thought or wiſh, or the omiſſion of one known duty ſubjects the offender to a forfeiture of the righteouſneſs of the law, and to all its dreadful penalties.</p>
            <p>THIS condemnation it proclaims againſt him, who fails in one ſingle duty of righteouſneſs, love and mercy to men. And on him alſo, who fails in a ſingle inſtance of ſelf government; the virtues of whoſe mind are not pure and ſpotleſs, and wholly conformed the perfect law of God. The law demands the perfection of obedience in the whole of man's threeſold duty to God, to
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:028999_0305_0FDDD2EF7A4B62B8"/>mankind and ourſelver. And the reaſon of this is, that the law is founded on the immutable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of right reaſon. It is the revealed will of God, whoſe will is the fountain of unchangeable rectitude. To man in his preſent lapſed &amp; guilty condition, the law may ſeem awfully ſevere: but to man in innocency, it appeared moſt good, juſt and holy.</p>
            <p>SAINT James expreſſes the perfect rectitude &amp; purity of the law, when he ſays,
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>James</hi> 2, 10.</note> "Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." The obſervance of the law in ſome of its requirements, will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe neglect in others. The wilful omiſſion or tranſgreſſion of a ſingle precept, is an act of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God. Our obligation to keep the whole law perfectly ariſes from the authority of the ſupreme lawgiver. "He that ſaid, do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery; yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the law." What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is commanded or forbidden in the law, is by the divine authority. To tranſgreſs a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar precept of the will of God, is an offence to the divine authority. The will of God in the preſcription of laws to his creatures, is reaſon &amp; motive ſufficient to demand obedience; whether his creatures are able to unable to comprehend the reaſonableneſs of them, or whether they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with their inclination, or not. And diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to one ſingle precept is diſobedience to the whole authority of God. On the ſuppoſition that a perſon ſhould perfectly keep the whole law, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one ſingle inſtance; would his obedience be acceptable? Could he claim life by his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:028999_0306_0FDDD2F108BC63A0"/>Would he do the will of God? The perfection of obedience which the law demands, and the tenor of the covenant of works, aſſure the certainty of his guilt, and the juſtice of his condemnation: for he is an offender againſt the will of God, the righteous lawgiver, &amp; becomes guilty of the whole law; that is, guilty of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God all whoſe laws to men, may be ſummed up in the <hi>will of God.</hi> A ſingle ſin, is a a violation of that whole ſyſtem of duty which the law demands, and the ſinner is guilty, and falls under the condemnation of the law, who breaks one of the leaſt of God's commandments. Righteouſneſs is not only forfeited, but guilt is imputed. As the breaking a ſingle link of a chain breaks the chain; and as wounding one member, wounds the body; ſo the violation of a ſingle precept, is a violation of the whole law. And for one offence, the tranſgreſſor incurs the penalty which it pronounces againſt thoſe, who keep it not perfectly. His <hi>one</hi> offence deprives him of the righteouſneſs of the law, as effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he had not kept a ſingle precept, or had broken the whole: for it accepts of no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, except a perfect one. And it pronounces the dreadful ſentence of death and the curſe, not on him only who is guiltleſs of the ſins prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but on him who <hi>continueth</hi> not to practiſe perfectly, all the duties required.</p>
            <p>THIS, ſirs, is that perfect law of love and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs obedience, which God gave to man, &amp; made man capable of obeying. And this law is ſtill in force againſt us. Here let us for a moment pauſe. And allow me to aſk, has not this holy law concluded us all under ſin and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Will any ſay that they are perfect touching
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028999_0307_0FDDD2F2E7809450"/>the law? Are we not all convinced of the law as tranſgreſſors; and who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?" But on the ſuppoſition that this moment your heart is changed, and you have no more diſpoſition to ſin than Adam had in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, &amp; can keep the law perfectly in thought, word and deed for the time to come; will your future righteouſneſs juſtify you? Will you claim ſalvation by the covenant of works? It is evident that you cannot; becauſe that covenant was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to man to keep by virtue of the powers of his own free will, without the aid of <hi>ſpecial</hi> grace; but if you keep the law by virtue of grace imparted, your righteouſneſs is of grace, and conſequently your ſalvation too, will be of grace. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo, in this caſe, you are condemned for paſt tranſgreſſions, for the law of works promiſes life only to perfect obedience. Are any ſo vain as to dream that they are perfect and clean from ſin? Thoſe who are under this deluſion are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of themſelves and of the law. "If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive ourſelves, and the truth is not in us." Are any depending for acceptance with God, on their negative virtues; ſaying, with the phariſee at the temple; "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, unjuſt, adulterers?" But if by reſtraining grace, you have not been guilty of ſcandalous ſins, are you not chargeable with ſins of omiſſion, ſins of heart, of impenitence and unbelief?</p>
            <p>WHEN we reflect on the ſpotleſs purity, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality and perfection of the law, and the deep depravity and guilt of our nature, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imagination of the thoughts are naturally evil, and contrary to that perfection of purity, love and obedience, which the law demands, we may
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:028999_0308_0FDDD2F99E6A2200"/>exclaim with the pſalmiſt, "If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark iniquities: O Lord, who ſhall ſtand!" Our ſouls would ſink in ſorrow and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; "but, O moſt merciful Lord, with thee there is forgiveneſs, through the bleſſed mediator, that thou mayeſt be feared."</p>
            <p>WITH humble penitence and lively faith, let us look to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi>

            <p>ALL thoſe who embrace the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, are convinced of ſin by the law. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the nature and demands of God's perfect law, gives the ſoul a conviction of ſin, and the certainty and juſtice of his condemnation. And thus the law leads and compels the ſinner to the Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CHRIST is the end of the law,</hi> as the law was fulfilled in all its requirements by him.

            <p>BOTH the ceremonial and moral law received their end and accompliſhment in him. He was the innocent and holy ſufferer, the lamb of God, to whom the various and coſtly ſacrifices of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Let us then ſee <hi>how Chriſt is the end of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial and the moral law.</hi> Chriſt is the end of the ceremonial law, as that law received its fulfilment in him. The ceremonial law was given to the ancient church at Sinai, and conſiſted of various typical rites &amp; ſacrifices, refering to Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; the diſpenſation of grace to be introduced into the world by him. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſervices of the Jewiſh tabernacle and temple, were deſigned to maintain the knowledge of the true G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and to keep alive the expectation of the Saviour, who had been promiſed at the apoſtacy. When Chriſt came and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the work of redemption, the ſpecial care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which God had ſhewn to the people of Iſrael, ceaſed. Sacrifices were the moſt expenſive and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome part of the ceremonial law: but they were no longer neceſſary after the promiſed Saviour had offered up himſelf, a ſacrifice for the fins of men.</p>
            <p>SACRIFICES of atonement were common among pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan nations; and the cuſtom is a confirmation of the divinity of original revelation. They muſt have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it from this ſource; becauſe the principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon could not have diſcovered a connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the death of an animal, and the pardon of ſin.

               </gap> that the doctrine of human depravity, and the neceſſity of atonement for ſin, was the univerſal ſenſe of mankind. The ſacrifices of the law pointed out the certainty and the neceſſity of the death of Chriſt. It was certain, becauſe God had promiſed; and it was neceſſary becauſe the juſtice of the law demanded an adequate ſatisfaction. On the certainty of the death of Chriſt, the ancient patriarchs and ſaints were ſaved. Death and the curſe came by the firſt Adam's eating of the fruit of the interdicted tree; and life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality are given to believers, ſince Chriſt the ſecond Adam bore death and the curſe, on the tree of the croſs. This manner of death is called in the law of Moſes, an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death, probably refering to the death which Chriſt ſhould endure, that he might remove from man, the curſe due to ſin.</p>
            <p>THE epiſtle to the Hebrews is a commentary on the ritual of the ceremonial law, and ſhews how the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and ſervices of that diſpenſation, received their full accompliſhment in Chriſt. It was a figure of good things to come. The ſelf righteous Jews reſted their hopes of acceptance with God, and of eternal happineſs, in their obſervance of that external law. Inſtead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to thoſe ſacrifices and ſervices, as the way to lead them to Chriſt, they truſted in them, as the end of their duty. To the ſenſual &amp; ſelf righteous, they were as a veil that hid Chriſt from them, ſo that "they could not look ſtedfaſtly to the end;" but righteous men ſaw Chriſt thro' the veil of ceremonies, and to them both the preceptive and ceremonial laws, ſerved as a ſchoolmaſter to lead them to Chriſt. They contained the <hi>alphabet</hi> of the goſpel, and taught the doctrine of grace thro' a mediator. When Chriſt expired upon the croſs, having made atonement for ſin, the veil of the temple was rent aſunder, to ſignify, that the ceremonial law &amp; the levitical prieſthood, were no more. The order of Aaron was at an end, the ſceptre then departed from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah; for Shiloh had come, and to him the people out of all nations, were ſoon to be gathered. As the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law of the ancient church received its end, deſign and accompliſhment in Chriſt; let us now enquire how
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:028999_0312_0FDDD307F5F0CAC8"/>Chriſt is the <hi>end of the moral law.</hi> Chriſt is the end of the moral law in two reſpects, firſt, as he perfectly kept it, and ſecondly as by his obedience and ſuffering, a righteouſneſs is finiſhed, by which ſinners, whom the law condemns, may be ſaved. He always did thoſe things which pleaſed God, and ſo to do was the fulfilment of the law, for the moral law is the revealed will or pleaſure of God. He loved God with all his heart, and mankind as himſelf, conſtantly and perfectly. Each particular precent of the moral law, was perfectly obeyed by aim. He deſghted to do the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll of God. His whole life was filled up with obedience to God, and love to mankind. He fulfilled all righteouſneſs in his obedience to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and moral laws of Jehovah. He gave the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious evidence of obedience to God, and love to men, in his life and in his death. He ſhewed in the view of the intelligent univerſe, that the law which man was made to obey, was holy, juſt and good, by the obedience which he rendered to it. He magnified the law and made it honorable. And by obeying and ſuffering the penalty of the law, he has brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs; a righteouſneſs by which, on the conſtitution of grace, the penitent believer in Jeſus, is delivered from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and admitted to eternal life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. BELIEVERS are juſtified from the condemnation of the law by the imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. MANKIND by the guilt of ſin orfeited life and fell under the condemnation of the covenant of works. The mercy of God has provided for them the milder diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of grace, by the mediation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The tenor of the firſt covenant was, <hi>obey and thou ſhalt live.</hi> The tenor of the covenant of grace is <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſdom of the Deity deviſed this plan of grace, by which the law maintains its authority; for its precepts are obeyed, and its juſtice ſatisfied, by a divine ſurety, and life is given to the guilty. And God can now be juſt, and the juſtifier of the ungodly, and grace reigns, thro' <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> unto eternal life, towards them that believe. It is conſiſtent with this wonderful grace, that
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:028999_0313_0FDDD30A852D2A30"/>the endleſs and bleſſed benefits of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſhould be placed to the account of believers in him; and that as to them, the condemning ſentence of the law ſhould be repealed. Thoſe who are intereſted in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt are ſaid to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Let us inquire into the nature of juſtification, and the imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Juſtification is a term borrowed from the uſage of civil courts, in which the perſon accuſed is acquitted on the law's being ſatisfied, either by himſelf or his ſurety. Juſtification is oppoſed to condemnation. Such is the merciful tenor of the covenant of grace, that a ſurety is accepted on the ſinner's behalf, and the guilty are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared righteous on account of the righteouſneſs of the divine ſaviour. To them there is no condemnation. The juſtified perſon was once under the condemnation of the law; but on his believing in Jeſus Chriſt, his ſins are pardoned, and he is accepted as a righteous perſon, on account of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed. He is acquitted from the guilt of paſt ſins, and from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment. The law is ſatisfied, and the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent believer is juſtified. Juſtification does not imply that a perſon is inherently or perfectly freed from all ſin, or the poſſibility of ſinning; but it is an act of grace, by which he is declared juſt with reſpect to the law which he has broken. Paſt ſins are remitted, and for the merciful remiſſion of all ſins to which they are liable, by the force of temptations and depraved nature, for the time to come, believers have an advocate with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ever liveth to make interceſſion for them, on their repentance and ſupplication.</p>
            <p n="2">2. JUSTIFICATION is a ſovran and gracious act of God in which he does not diſpenſe with his law, nor acquit the ſinner without the law receiving honorable ſatisfaction. It was ſovran grace which provided the remedy. In this was manifeſted the love of God, that he gave his ſon to redeem us. As the general plan of the redemption of ſinners, was an act of ſovran grace, ſo alſo is the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that redemption to individuals. He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. And God juſtly leaves thoſe who reject ſalvation, to the fatal conſequences of
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:028999_0314_0FDDD30BF5A63120"/>their own choice. He will glorify his juſtice on the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath, who by the love and practice of ſin, have fitted themſelves for deſtruction. Sufficient means of knowledge and conviction are given the impenitent to leave them inexcuſable, ſelf condemned, and proper objects of the awful curſes of the broken law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE divine ſpirit is the heavenly agent by whoſe powerful operation attending the inſtrumental means of grace, the ſinner is brought to a ſtate of juſtification. This he does by convincing of the nature and guilt of ſin, of the neceſſity of a righteouſneſs anſwerable to the law's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and of the judgment which will be paſſed upon all who fall under its condemning ſentence. By grace ye are ſaved, by the waſhing of regeneration, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE juſtified will not come into condemnation. Their ſtability is ſecured by their union to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual head, the ſecond Adam, the Lord from heaven. They are members of his body, and branches in him the living vine. And becauſe he lives, they ſhall live alſo. Every ſincere believer in Jeſus, may with ſaint Paul, bid the heroic challenge, "Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died; yea, rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us. And who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?"</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE believer is juſtified by a righteouſneſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Unable to ſatisfy the demands of the law, it became neceſſary to man's ſalvation, that a ſurety ſhould ſatisfy for him. And help was laid on one mighty to ſave. The reaſon why man cannot ſatisfy the demands of the law, is that by his guilty apoſtacy, he has loſt both the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the inclination to keep it. By nature the ſervant of ſin and enemy of holineſs, and when renewed by grace, his beſt obedience is weak and imperfect. And there is not a juſt man upon earth, who ſinneth not. The holy angels could not ſatisfy the law for man. Their beſt and moſt perfect obedience, the law which they are under, demands from them conſtantly and ſorever. They
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:028999_0315_0FDDD30D85F84648"/>have no ſurpluſage of merit to place to man's account. But the ability of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to accompliſh a righteouſneſs, by which the ſinner can be juſtified, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> manifeſt, inaſmuch as he is a divine perſon, poſſeſſing the perfections of Deity, uncreated and independent. He was the ſon of God united to a perfect and innocent man, the ſecond Adam. His merit is infinite. By his obedience and ſufferings in the human nature, he finiſhed a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſatisfactory to the juſtice of the law, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent alſo for the purchaſe of eternal life for his diſciples. The righteouſneſs which Chriſt finiſhed on earth was deſigned for the uſe and advantage of mankind. This, ſays the prophet, is the name by which he ſhall be called, <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all. In the ſame ſenſe in which our ſins were imputed to Chriſt, his righteouſneſs is imputed to us. As he felt the dreadful effects of ſins which he had not committed, ſo believers enjoy the bleſſed benefits of a righteouſneſs, which they themſelves have not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. The effects, or the puniſhment of ſin were borne by Chriſt; and the rewards of his obedience are given to believers. As our ſins deſerved death, and death was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on our ſurety, ſo his obedience merits life, and life is given to all who are pardoned and juſtified by his redemption.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſubjects of juſtification are believers in Chriſt. Evangelical faith compriſes knowledge and love; a knowledge of the divine character, and of the law as holy juſt and good. A knowledge of perſonal guilt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and of Jeſus Chriſt, as a holy and almighty Saviour. Theſe important doctrines the mind receives as divinely true, and embraces them with cordial appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and with humble gratitude repoſes its immortal intereſts in the hands of the bleſſed mediator, and pleads his all perfect righteouſneſs, as the only ground of hope and acceptance with God. To conclude,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE learn from the nature of the law, and from the deſign of the goſpel, that man has not a righteouſneſs of his own in which he can with ſafety appear; and that we fall under the dreadful condemnation of that law
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:028999_0316_0FDDD31300E67030"/>which gives us the knowledge of the guilt and deſert of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Since, ſirs, ſuch is our unhappy condition, let us never ceaſe to admire and adore, that wonderful wiſdom and grace of God in our redemption, which makes it conſiſtent with the rectitude and goodneſs of the divine government, to receive a ſatisfaction to juſtice rendered by our divine ſurety, and not exact it at our hands. Had it been demanded of us, alas, we muſt have been caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the priſon of eternal deſpair, there to have remained thro' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nceaſing ages, ſince we could never have paid the uttermoſt farthing, of the immenſe debt which we owe to the divine juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE learn that ſalvation is not applied to men abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and unconditionally. It is by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, we become intitled to the bleſſed benefits of a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſatisfies the law's demands, and purchaſes for us an eternity of happineſs. We hence,</p>
            <p n="3">3. INFER the duty of an immediate ſubmiſſion to the divine plan of grace revealed in the goſpel. There the great and endleſs bleſſings of the finiſhed righteouſneſs of Chriſt are freely offered, and given to every penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver. There is ſalvation in no other name. Let us, ſirs come to God thro' him, for whoſe ſake the father mercies heareth and accepteth ſinners; pardons our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs offences, ſaves us from the curſes of the broken law and from the wrath to come, and will raiſe us to endleſs glory and felicity.</p>
            <p>MAY we, my brethren, ardently aſpire after that bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs which is given to thoſe, unto whom a merciful God imputeth righteouſneſs, the righteouſneſs of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Saviour; for bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, whoſe ſins are covered, and unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs. May we perſevere in faith and love and holy obedience, and thro' grace obtain admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be all the glory of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>AMEN.</p>
