            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Acquainted with the Nature, and Tenderly Affected towards the Neceſſity's and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Mankind, he hath not rendred Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety an Impoſſible Thing; but hath Placed us in leſſer Body's, wherein all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the biggeſt may be had and enjoyed: although that <hi>City</hi> could not be <hi>Built,</hi> yet (<hi>Bleſſed be GOD,</hi>) <hi>City's</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> now there are; wherein we may enjoy the Comforts of Life, do Good to others and be Advantag'd by them; and Beſt Anſwer the End of our Beings.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Pſalm is Expreſſive in General, of the Affectionate Regard King <hi>David</hi> had to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Which had ſundry Advantages Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to it; the Glory's whereof En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame

his Heart, and Exalt his Stile; as we may ſee in his lofty Deſcription of that Place, and the warm Addreſſes he makes to the minds of Men to excite the ſame Cordial Affection towards it. The Text in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Repreſents to us the Glory's of this Place; and there are no other Parts of the Pſalm, that I deſign to Conſider and Deſcant on, but only as they may fall in, in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Diſcourſe. The Words read are an abſolute Sentence and diſtinct Propoſition: <hi>Jeruſalem is Builded as a City, that is Compact together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Thing</hi> here Deſcribed is <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And it may be conſidered in ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: either barely as a particular Place and Portion of Land in the <hi>Kingdom of Iſrael;</hi> or as a Place Comprehending the Inhabitants in a Civil Society; or ſince the <hi>Kingdom of Iſrael</hi> was the only Kingdom where the True GOD was Worſhipped, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Place for the Publick and Solemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of his Worſhippers three times An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, ſo the Word may be a Term uſed to Signify the Church of GOD by: Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> IV. 25. And it may alſo from thence be Typical of the Church of GOD now, as in <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. and in other Places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Deſcription</hi> whereby <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ſet out to us in our Text is, <hi>That it is Builed as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001878_0006_0FB97827704E7098"/>
a City, that is Compact together;</hi> or <hi>Joined to it ſelf,</hi> as rendred by one,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Ainſworth.</hi>
               </note> And it is the ſame Word that is uſed to ſignify the <hi>Faſtening &amp; joining the Parts of the Tabernacle.</hi> It denotes the Unity of the Whole, and the Firm Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the Parts. And the <hi>Deſcription</hi> may agree to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> conſidered in either of the Senſes forementioned.</p>
            <p>Thus conſider it in the firſt Senſe, <hi>It was</hi> Builded as a City, that was Compact toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It was Encloſed as Villages are not; and whereas it was two Villages before, King <hi>David</hi> had United them and made them one, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 7, 8. Or conſider it as a Civil Society in that Place, it was United and <hi>Compacted</hi> then in it's main Intereſts, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> which it was not ſo while the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> Held the Fort of <hi>Zion:</hi> Or Laſtly, Conſider it as the Church of GOD, It was as the Forecited Authour<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Ainſworth in</hi> Loc.</note> ſays, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, fitly Framed, and Builded together for an Habitation of God through the Spirit;</hi> Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Expreſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> II. 21, 22. And it is Deſireable to ſee the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, National, Provincial, or even a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation Adorned with theſe, <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Chriſt by a Lively and Sound Faith,</hi> and to one another by a Fervent Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001878_0007_0FB9782D1C34AC30"/>
without Inteſtine Diviſions and Jarrs, keeping <hi>the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> But the Occaſions of the Day Lead me to Conſider it in the Senſe mentioned before; and I Hope the Text will Bear me out in it. And in Conſidering <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thus, Namely, as a Civil Society Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that Place, I ſhall take no notice of the Particulars of it's <hi>Compactneſs</hi> here Referr'd to, any further than as they may fall in with other things in the Diſcourſe on the Words: In General I Obſerve, the State of that Place, <hi>It was Compact together;</hi> And the <hi>Senſe</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had of it's <hi>Excellency</hi> on this Account: for this is one thing he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it off by, and therefore was Glad of the Reſort made to it, and thinks himſelf and others Bound to Seek and Pray it's Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>My Buſineſs then will be, to ſet this Truth in a Clear Light: Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is highly Conducive to the Happineſs of a Civil Government and Society to be Firmly United and Compacted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Diſcourſe may be Applyed to Kingdoms in General, or Particular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Comprehended within them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001878_0008_0FB9782E4407AD60"/>
What I deſign for the Clearing of this Truth, is by ſhewing
<list>
                  <item>I. Wherein the <hi>Firmneſs</hi> and <hi>Compactneſs</hi> of a Place doth conſiſt: Or what thoſe things are that Conduce to it.</item>
                  <item>II. The <hi>Happineſs</hi> that doth Reſult from it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. I am to ſhew wherein the <hi>Firmneſs</hi> and <hi>Compactneſs</hi> of a Place doth Conſiſt; or what thoſe things are that Conduce to it. And here do I intend to keep within the Compaſs of my own Profeſſion; and to point out only to thoſe that may be Improved as Directions for the Obtaining of it. Now Omitting the mention of what is neceſſary to the Primary and Fundamental Eſtabliſhment of a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Formal Diſtinction of Society's from one another; I may ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is neceſſary to the <hi>Compactneſs</hi> of a Place, That the <hi>Government</hi> be under a ſuitable <hi>Adminiſtration:</hi> whereby I Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Quality's of thoſe who are in Power, and the Regular Improvement of it. And how well ſoever a Society is Compacted together, what Prudent Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſoever are appointed, yet if the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, Direction, and Execution of all things,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001878_0009_0FB9782FB3452328"/>

And thus by keeping the Outward Actions of Men in due Bounds and Channels, the Good of Humane Society is Secured; beſides what Advantage the Practiſe of what is Good, and Avoiding of what is Evil may be to the Mortifying of Corrupt Principles within us.</p>

            <p>For Inſtance, Religion Commands us to <hi>Shew our ſelves Men,</hi> to do nothing Unworthy of Humane Nature; which will Preſerve us from the Little, Baſe, and Pernicious Practiſes that our Degenerate Natures are Prone to.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, It Forbids Pride, the Mother of an Haughty and Inſolent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, of Untractableneſs, of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

            </p>
            <p>Religion ſetteth before us the Brighteſt &amp; moſt Excellent Examples of theſe things, to Stir up our Emulation; <hi>Non Divitiis Cum Divite, Neque Factione Cum Factioſo; Sed Cum Strenuo Virtute, Cum Modeſto Pudore, Cum Innocente Abſtinentia,</hi>

that tend to the Good of Men's Souls, &amp; the Peace of the World.</p>
            <p>The Motives to theſe things are the Greateſt and Strongeſt. What more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive than the Arguments on which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is Built? What more Awakening than a Judgment-Day? What more Inviting than the Rewards of Religion? What more Terrible than the Miſeries it Threatens the Diſobedient with?

            <p>And thus Religion conſidered in the whole Extent of it, hath an Aſpect on Rulers, and thoſe that are under Rule, as might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſhewed.

            <p n="2">(2) We may Obſerve the <hi>Countenance</hi> and peculiar Reſpect, that God giveth to a Truly Religious and Vertuous People. And this is a Support to the preceeding Head: For though the natural Tendency of Religion and Vertue is to the Firmneſs &amp; Flouriſhing of a People; yet the Vices and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, and the External Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things, may Intercept the Natural Fruits and Benefits of it.

            <p>It muſt be Granted, That a Good Man hath not Outward Proſperity Promiſed to him, as a certain Reward of the greateſt Piety and Vertue; and there is no need of it: for as he is an Immortal Being he may Receive his Happineſs in another World.

It is a great Inſtance of the Goodneſs of GOD's Providence over the World, That he hath Diſtinguiſhed men in their Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Genius'</hi>s, Inclinations and Buſineſs. A Common-Wealth is aptly Connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by them, as the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of Old was Coupled together by the <hi>Boards</hi> of it <hi>Faſtned one to another.</hi> Then the various Neceſſities of a Common-Wealth are Supplied, and men are Preſerved from thoſe Querulous &amp; Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Behaviours, that Roile and Diſturb all things. And thus in the Body Natural, though every Part ſhould do it's Duty to the whole, yet there are particular Offices of Eating, Digeſting, Walking, Handling, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Aſſigned to every Part, and it is the Head only that giveth Life and Motion to the Whole.

You ſee, there need not Arguments to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this to you; but the Proſecution of the former Head hath taken up almoſt all our Time, &amp; beſides, the Repreſentation of it is enough to Recommend it to us.</p>
            <p>It is Time now to Apply the Truth before us. And</p>
            <p>I. This may Point out to us thoſe that are fitteſt to be Improved in the Government and Service of a Common-Wealth; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Such as are moſt likely in this Manner to Promote the Good and Welfare of it, That can beſt Preſerve the Honour and bear the Weight of Government, who have Ability for it, and Fidelity to Diſcharge it, and Courage and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001878_0044_0FB9788E1996F6E0"/>
the Priviledge of Chuſing their own Rulers. Where it lieth not in a People's Power to Veſt whom they Pleaſe with the Rule over them, they are to be Pitied when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, the Lame and Sloathful and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly; Or the Tyrannical, the Profane and Ungodly, the Vicious and Debauched, the Covetous and Rapacious, have the Rule over them. But ſuch a People are much to be Blamed who under a <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Diſtinguiſh</hi> not thoſe whoſe known Ability, Integrity and Merits Render them Worthy of Reſpect and Honour: If Private Reſpects Blind their Eyes, if Piques, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and Reſentments Hide from them the Beſt of Men, if they Chooſe Men only to Advance a particular Intereſt, to Abet a Party, and Maintain a Faction; if <hi>a Vile Perſon is not Contemned in their Eyes, and they Honour not thoſe that Fear the Lord,</hi> or if they Chooſe thoſe whoſe Spirits will never Prompt them to any thing that is Great and Worthy. Men can never Expect that GOD will Juſtify thoſe Actions, that are Calculated to the Advancing Unjuſtifiable Ends, and which they are Aſhamed to own. Our Duty is not only to Pray for our Rulers, but to Uſe Prudence in the Choice of them: Elſe a Voluntary Ill Choice may be Interpreted as a Refuſing the Benefits
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001878_0045_0FB9788F90C33AB0"/>
of a Good Government, and GOD may ſay of us, <hi>as they Delighted not in Bleſſing ſo let it be far from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let this be thought on by thoſe who are to Compleat the Work of Election this Day: And it is the Duty of all to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it who may be called to Occaſions of the like Nature hereafter. You have been Told thoſe things that are for the Glory and Strength of a People: Look out then for ſuch as have Wiſdom and Fidelity to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it, and do Exemplify a Regard to this in their Perſonal Private Conduct. Under God, the Good or Miſery of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lieth in your Power, and will Iſſue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the Choice you make. And he that Conſcientiouſly Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon thoſe that are moſt likely to Act Worthy of their Places, may find his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in it now, to be ſure he will at Laſt: But he that Knowingly Pitcheth upon thoſe that are Unſuitable and Unworthy for any Poſts of Government, when better are before him, may Hurt his own Comfort; which will Decline with the Publick Good; and to be ſure, is Anſwerable to God for all the Inconveniences a Government Suſtains by that Choice. Do your Work then in the <hi>Fear of God;</hi> Act Conſcience, and Prudence: Honour thoſe that Love the Publick Good,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001878_0046_0FB9789661420DA8"/>
and can, and will Promote it. It may be there never needed among us more Wiſdom, Dexterity, Tenderneſs and Care to Compoſe our Differences, and keep us from Burſting Aſunder than now. The LORD Direct you; and the LORD Direct, Aſſiſt and Bleſs thoſe on whom this Work may be Devolved.</p>
            <p>And here under this Head I would Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Offer, That an Eye might be had to thoſe in all the Inferiour and Subordinate Stations of the Government, who are Well Qualified by their Wiſdom, Piety, Probity and Courage; who know what to do, and will not be Impoſed on, nor are likely to Sleep in their Stations, to be Flattered or Bribed or Affrighted from their Duty. It would be Well to Advance thoſe whoſe Minds are well Affected towards the Felicity of thoſe Places where they are, &amp; thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seaſoned with an Eſteem and Love to thoſe things that will make a People Happy. When ſuch are Preferred to Office, they are only Commanded, and put into a better Way to Follow the Bias of their own Minds. A Man of Honeſty, Sobriety, Temperance, Chaſtity, Religion, can with a greater Grace and Courage Advance theſe things and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Contrary Enormities, and hath a Stronger Principle to it than another, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001878_0047_0FB978989822F868"/>
is more Reverenced in his Work; beſides the Peculiar Preſence of God he may Expect to make him a Bleſſing in it. But on the Contrary what may we Expect from Wicked and Immoral Perſons, when GOD and their own Minds are againſt them? When they are put upon ſuch Work, they Fight againſt the Darling of their own Souls. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within conſtant Reproofs in all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, <hi>Wherein thou Judgeſt another, thou Condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that Judgeſt, doeſt the ſame things.</hi> They Anſwer not the End of their Beings, will they Anſwer the Ends of Society? They are Unfaithful to God, and to whom will they be Faithful? They are Plagues &amp; Torments to their own Minds, and not likely to be Bleſſings to a Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>II. I would now turn my ſelf to our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rulers, or ſuch as may be for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Year, Namely, the Honourable the GOVERNOUR, the DEPUTY-GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNOUR, and the Worſhipful ASSISTANTS of this Colony; with the whole GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

of GOD, and the Deſires and Hopes of all that Fear him; Namely, That you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all your Wiſdom, Dexterity, Zeal and Diligence to <hi>Compact</hi> us <hi>together.</hi> Take <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for your Model; Nay, take <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem that is Above,</hi> as it is Delineated to us in the Word of God. When Multitudes of us can do but little more than <hi>Pray for the Peace</hi> and Welfare of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> You can Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thoſe Means alſo that Tend to Advance it. It is much with you under GOD, to Appeaſe our Inteſtine Diviſions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and Apply thoſe Bands &amp; Ligaments that ſhall Hold us together, and Prevent our Breaking and Diſſolution. Your <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge</hi> Faithfully Improved, may be the <hi>Stability</hi> of our Times. The Darkneſs of our Preſent Day, the Number and Weight of our Sins, and the greatneſs of our Diſorders make your Work more Difficult: <hi>Deal Courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and the Lord be with you,</hi> And though the <hi>Earth and the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be Diſſolved, Hold you up the Pillars of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am Confident of the Real Advantage of thoſe things I have Lay'd before you, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the Happineſs and Strength of us, and that in Mentioning them I have kept within my own Limits; and can therefore with an Humble Freedom Commend them

to your Care. Give me Leave to ſay then, That we look for your Watch over us, and your Faithful Diſcharge of the Duties of your Places; We Look for your Paternal Tenderneſs towards us, and your Correction of us when we need it. And though a Suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deference to Authority is more nearly to be Preſſed on a People as their Part in Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Publick Welfare, yet it is a Certain Truth, That the Wiſdom, Gravity, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Fidelity and Shining Examples of Rulers do much Tend to Command this from a People; and that the Doing Good to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is the moſt Solid and Sure Means to a Reputation with them, You know Job found it ſo, Chap. XXXIX. Tho' indeed an Ill Diſpoſition ſometimes may Hinder you of Due Reſpect till you are Dead, but then you have Comfort Enough at preſent from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World.</p>
            <p>And Suffer me here Particularly to Preſs Religion and Vertue on your Practiſe and Care; for this is a Principle and a Leading Thing.

               </hi> You muſt Stand a Trial for your Betruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as the <hi>Meaneſt</hi> of us; and you will have nothing elſe to <hi>Diſtinguiſh</hi> you at that Time, but a <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Account</hi> you have to give, and <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Rewards</hi> if you have been Faithful, and <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Miſeries</hi> if you have not. And I Conclude with my Wiſhes, That you may not only have a Share in our Prayers, but in our Praiſes and Thankſgivings to GOD too.</p>
            <p>III. And now I would continue the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation by Addreſſing thoſe of the SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRED ORDER, and my Self the Leaſt in it. That we would Heartily Purſue this Buſineſs. Notwithſtanding the Contempt and Difficulties that our Work brings with it, we have a great deal of Conſolation from the Nature, Tendency and Deſign of it. We <hi>turn not the World upſide down,</hi> nor are <hi>the Movers of Sedition,</hi> as they were Unjuſtly Accuſed, <hi>Act.</hi> XVII. 6. &amp; XXIV. 5. In the Faithful Diſcharge of our Work we Promote the Happineſs of both Worlds. We Uſe the moſt Solid Methods for this; for we Lay a Foundation in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men.</p>
            <p>Our Fidelity tends not only to the Salvation of the Soul, but alſo to make
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001878_0056_0FB978AF4EA2F2C0"/>
Men Better Members of the Common-Wealth, and hath an Aſpect on all Ranks and Degrees of Men, and is to Secure all Intereſts. And beſides the Natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Vertues we Exhort to, we bring a People into the Favour of that God, who was the <hi>Keeper of the City of Jeruſalem,</hi> and Hold's the World together. So that not only in Faithfulneſs to our own Souls, but alſo from a Love to our People, and <hi>the City of our GOD,</hi> we are Obliged to Beſtir our ſelves in our Work, and be Faithful in every Part of it, and Conduct our ſelves Wiſely to the Promoting it. May I here Hint thoſe things, which it were Proper for me to Learn of you.</p>
            <p>What Care and Prudence becometh us in our Common Conduct and Deportment of our ſelves in the World? For that hath an Influence on our Serviceableneſs in our Station. Though where the Gifts of a Miniſter are Extenſive, I know not why his Improvement may not be ſo too; yet at the ſame time it becometh us to <hi>be Wiſe as Serpents and Harmleſs as Doves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> We know the Vile Words that are caſt about, of <hi>Prieſt-Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001878_0057_0FB978B61B9AA680"/>
therefore here ſtandeth us in ſtead to Labour after a Spotleſs Innocency; and to ſee that all our Deſigns be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our Station, and Truly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
            <p>And when we are going to Promote Religion in the World, how doth it become us to give it Life and Power in our own Souls? Our People Expect we ſhould Walk in the ſame Path we Direct them to, and the moſt Obſequious Language to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is, <hi>I Prae, Sequar.</hi> If we would Preſs Religion on our People's Hearts, our Lives are the beſt Seal; and they will make our Services more Excellent. Can we ſo well Declare the Excellency of Religion, unleſs our own Hearts Feel it? Can we make ſuch Warm Addreſſes to the Souls of Men as we ſhould, if our own Hearts are Frozen and Dead? Can we have the Courage to Reprove Iniquity, if our own Conſciences at the ſame time Reprove us? Can we Comfort Men with the Hopes of Heaven if we are Indifferent to all the Joys of it? We are Obliged not only to have the Reality of Religion in our Souls, but the Higheſt Dgrees and the Greateſt Exactneſs of it. Might not this be a Reaſon that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>Exerciſe himſelf unto Godlineſs,</hi> I <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 7. Are
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001878_0058_0FB978B766CEC8B0"/>
we not Separated to the Work of Religion for this End with others, That we ſhould have a Daily Inſpection into our own Souls, and Watch againſt all the Indecencies that Cleave to our Hearts and Lives, that our Lives may be as Clearly Expreſſive as our Language.</p>
            <p>And having Obſerved this Rule, and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Practiſe of it, let us ſet our ſelves to our Work, and make it our Daily Care and Study. Indeed ſuch are the Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Difficulties of many of us that we are to our Sorrow much Hindred; but let them hinder us only where they are Real and Unavoidable, and only as far as they are ſo. But ſuch as are Bleſs't with Eaſy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the World, they are Inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable if they do not <hi>give themſelves wholly to theſe things,</hi> and <hi>make their Profiting</hi> under ſuch Circumſtances, <hi>Appear.</hi> And let them be Exemplary in Acts of Charity and Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and not in the Eager and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Deſires of the Worldling. If their Places have not ſo Enabled them, God hath: And how can they better Beſtow themſelves and what they have, than in his Service, and for the Good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have been Neceſſarily En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Worldly Affairs, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to conſider whether they have not Engaged in them too much, and too long? And having been taken off from their Proper Work and Buſineſs, it is to be Feared, That ſome have not Returned to it, that is, to their Studies, when God hath Bleſs't them in their Endeavours, and Enabled them to it.</p>
            <p>And thoſe of us who may be by Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Low Circumſtances kept off much from our Work, let it not carry us too far. We may Poſſibly Redeem more time than we do in this Affair. <hi>Pliny's</hi>

for that Place, where all Narrowneſs and Selfiſhneſs of Mind ſhall be Removed, and they ſhall Everlaſtingly Prize us as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Higheſt Good to them.</p>
            <p>We have greater things to mind, than our own Particular, Temporal Intereſts, even the Saving Men's Souls and the Good of the World. To that End let us Beſtir our ſelves in the following Manner,</p>
            <p>Let us <hi>put Men in Mind to be Subject to Principalities and Powers, to Obey Magiſtrates, to be Ready to every Good Work, to Speak Evil of no man, to be no Brawlers, but Gentle, Shewing all Meekneſs to all Men.</hi> This is a Neceſſary Work, and thereby we directly Level at the Good of the State, and if ever the thing is Proper to be Enforced, doth not the Preſent Time Peculiarly call us to it?</p>
            <p>And let us Repreſent the Whole of Religion in it's Reaſonableneſs and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Preſs it on the Affections of our People. The Good Succeſs of ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours could not be too much Prized. What can Exhilarate us more than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of that, whoſe <hi>Work is Peace, and the Effect whereof is, Quietneſs and Aſſurance for ever?</hi> And to ſee our People (as a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of it) <hi>to dwell in a Peaceable Habitation, &amp; in ſure Dwellings, &amp; in Quiet Reſting-Places?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:001878_0061_0FB978BCEC46BF50"/>
Finally, As we are <hi>the Lord's Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers</hi> let us <hi>Pray for the Peace of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and keep no Silence, nor give him Reſt, till he Eſtabliſh, and till he make it a Praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude, Let Wiſdom and Prudence, Fidelity and Conſcience, Zeal and an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flacken'd Induſtry, Appear in our Work. God knoweth how few Moments we have to continue in it. The <hi>Treaſure</hi> we have to Diſpence out is put into <hi>Earthen Veſſels</hi> which may Suddenly Break. <hi>The Mighty Hand of God</hi> hath given us, of late in the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Province,</hi> very Humbling Inſtances of this Truth,<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Death of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>IV. Let me Exhort the WHOLE BODY of the PEOPLE, to be ſuitably
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001878_0062_0FB978C1D0626D70"/>
Affected toward the Firm and Flouriſhing State of our Land. It is a General Good and it becometh no man to Obſtruct it, but every Man to Pray for and Endeavour after it. If the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of Old were to Conſider it's Welfare and Seek for it, (if any thing) we are under Stronger Obligations now, May I not ſay to you, <hi>ye are come to the Heavenly Jeruſalem?</hi> We have Priviledges Superiour to what that had; we have the Goſpel Diſpenſation, they the Legal. We have Eaſier and more Exellent Services, Clearer and Fuller Directions to our Duty and what is Good and Reaſonable, Stronger Incentives, more Encouraging Hopes, and Brighter Examples. And the greater our Advantages are, the more ſhould we be Concerned for thoſe Societies that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them to us. And let us Expreſs our Concern in this Manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Briefly</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us be Thankful for all the Good Things we Enjoy, wherein the Security and Laſting Welfare of a People doth Conſiſt. Let us be Thankful for all Publick Bleſſings, for the Wiſdom and Fidelity of our Rulers, and for all the Rich Bleſſings God hath by them Handed down, and Continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o us. Thankfulneſs is the way to Continue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thoſe Bleſſings, and Unthankfulneſs to Cut them Short.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:001878_0063_0FB978C29DE5F9F8"/>
2. Let us Contribute what we can to the Eaſe, and Encouragement, and Help of our Civil Rulers on whom this great Concern more Peculiarly, and Immediately Lies. For we ſhall find our Accounts in their Good Succeſs. The Weight of Government is as Great as the Honour, and we may make it far Greater, and may ſo Conduct our ſelves as to Miſs of the Happy Fruits and Effects of it. Let us then Purſue a Due Love to our ſelves, by the Exerciſe of a Due Wiſdom and Care in this Matter. Let their Honour Dignity, and Expence be Chearfully Supported by us, Let them have a Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Share in the Common Good, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Anſwerable to the Merits of their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Services. Let us Love, Prize, and Honour them, Rejoyce in their Happineſs, &amp; be Grieved in all Cenſures &amp; Reproaches, and be Thankful to them for all the Good they do to us.</p>
            <p>We may Diſcourage their Hearts, &amp; Slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Hands by a Peeviſh &amp; Diſcontented Spirit, by Reflections on their Perſons and Conduct, Denying all the Good they do, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them in all their Deſigns and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for our Welfare, Finding Fault with the Laws and ſetting our ſelves to Find ſome ways or other, to Enervate the Force of the Beſt of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:001878_0064_0FB978C422B62F48"/>
We find them Work by our Tough &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Spirits. And we ſometimes give them Inſuperable Difficulties, by our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions &amp; Diviſions; when we ſo Divide into Particular Aims &amp; Intereſts as at the ſame time Neglect the Common Good, which much Conſiſts in Unity, Love, &amp; Peace.</p>
            <p>To Avoid theſe things, therefore, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways our Duty, and to call upon us is never Improper; but this Day and Time more Particularly Beſpeaks ſuch Counſel, under the Preſent Heats, Diſcontents and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among us. Every Good Man Layeth ſuch things to Heart, and in the Exerciſe of his Goodneſs will Endeavour to Allay and Quench them. Wo be to thoſe that Sow the Seeds of theſe things; the Fruit may be as Thorny to them as others. And it is the Duty of us not to be Eaſy in Crediting Ill Reports, nor to be ſoon Enflam'd by every Incendiary, nor to think that wrong that doth not Pleaſe us.</p>
