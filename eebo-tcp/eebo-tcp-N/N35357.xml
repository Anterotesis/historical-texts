            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Recovered from his wanderings, he became ſenſible of the danger of a neglected education, and was deſirous of guarding his ſon againſt the temptations of a number of inſignificant beings, who followed no other guide but appetite.

               <p>I was ſoon taught to recognize no other deſire but my paſſions, and to have no other deſire but that of gratifying them. Innocence, virtue and beauty could no longer claim reſpect. We got ourſelves introduced into families, where we made it our ſtudy to ſeduce thoſe whom impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had expoſed to our contemplation. Among others, whoſe fall effects me moſt was Caliſta.</p>
               <p>She was charming, my ſon. Her heart was noble, her temper, her underſtanding, every thing about her was worthy of admiration, and irreſiſtably captivating. But what can innocence avail amidſt the tumults of the paſſions, and the deceitful artifices of ſeduction? I gazed at her. She pleaſed me, and from that moment I thought of nothing elſe but to make her increaſe the number of my conqueſts. The moſt flattering propoſals, attachment, ſighs and tears, were practiſed to ſeduce this young beauty.</p>

of his paſſion is a mere child; ſhe reſiſts him, and he is deſpairing, though not beſide a clear ſtream. To be ſerious, my dear, your brain is out of order. Go into the woods, make them echo with your ſighs, and carve your lover's name on the bark of every tree; for you are unworthy either of my advice, or my friendſhip. It is a great pity that you ſhould be loſt to the world; you ſet out well, and I had better hopes of you.</p>
               <p>After this rallying he turned upon his heel, and went out. This reception chagrined me; I perſuaded myſelf that he made uſe of this han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to break with me; I formed a reſolution to ſeduce Caliſta, to convince this diletanti, that I was more worthy of his acquaintance than he imagined.</p>
               <p>That very night I planted my cannon, and was determined to be revenged of Caliſta and Philintus. I intended to triumph over the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the too credulous fair, and then to leave her to the tortures of remorſe. By this, my ſon, you may perceive the dangers of the paſſions, and the misfortune of an ill conducted education. We give only ſuperficial accompliſhments to our children, at the ſame time neglecting to form their hearts; virtue and reaſon, which only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh us from the brute creation, is either overlooked, or deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>In proſecuting my baſe deſign, I hypocritically aſſumed the garb of virtue; by which means I impoſed upon Caliſta, and her relations, and I even expoſed myſelf to raillery on the occaſion. My reformation gave me ſo much credit with people of character, that I was mentioned as an example for thoſe of my own age, You would be ſurprized, nay, you cannot imagine how I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:046224_0006_1020FCC1DEDB6A00"/>
diſſembled; but your ſurpriſe will ceaſe, when you know the world yourſelf, and you will then be of my opinion; that few perſons really are what they appear to be.</p>
               <p>Caliſta accuſtomed herſelf to hear me profeſs my love for her, ſhe liſtened to me with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anſwered me with kindneſs; but her modeſty would not ſuffer her to diſcloſe her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. One day I found her alone, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to make ſome return to my love. She lifted up her eyes to me, which expreſſed both inclination and modeſty. 'Will you never keep company with Philintus any more?' ſaid ſhe, in faultering accents. This queſtion, which had no relation to our diſcourſe, ſurprized and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed me. She perceived it: 'Anſwer me,' ſaid ſhe, 'but, no—do not. I had rather think you will not.' As ſoon as ſhe had ſaid this, ſhe ran away. Her flight diſconcerted me very much. This caprice, which I could not account for, chagrined me; I was reſolved never more to ſee a raw girl that ſeemed to be void of feeling.</p>
               <p>Enraged with Caliſta, I had recourſe to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus. I met him that very day by chance. Though it was ſomewhat diſagreeble to inform him of the bad ſucceſs of my project, the rage in which I was, forced me to diſcloſe the motives for the virtuous conduct, which I had aſſumed. He heard me with patience, and when I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, embraced me. 'This artifice,' cried he, 'ſhews that you are worthy of my eſteem. Why! with all my craftineſs, I could not have played my part half ſo well. Nay, I was myſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by your reformation. I pitied you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times; and was really ſorry for your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But will you fling away the fruits of ſix

months reſtraint? Caliſta is but a weak girl; ſhe is in love with you, and a ſingle moment may bring her into your arms. The queſtion ſhe has propoſed to you, ſuppoſes that you muſt drop my acquaintance. I forgive her, but ſhall wait for my turn. Conceal our reconciliation from her with the greateſt precaution. We will ſee each other in ſecret. Adieu, remember that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation depends upon the affair.'</p>
               <p>When alone, I loved Caliſta more than I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; her tears, her deſpair, which I anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, overwhelmed me with confuſion. But alas! I had gone too far to retreat. I got rid of the impertinence of reflection, thought of nothing but ſecuring the victim.</p>
               <p>I ſaw Caliſta again, on the earneſt invitation of her mother. She was ignorant of the diſtreſs, which ſhe was going to bring upon her daughter. Notwithſtanding all that I had heard from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus. I could not meet her without changing colour. I imagined that ſhe could read in my very eyes the criminal projects which I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into. I found her melancholy; a ſudden fluſh, an emotion, which ſhe could not ſuppreſs, convinced me that I was not diſagreeable to her. This conviction, inſtead of increaſing my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, ſerved to diſperſe it. I perſuaded myſelf that ſhe would at laſt own herſelf obliged to me for teaching her how to ſhake off the yoke of prejudice.</p>
               <p>My paſſion, which increaſed every day, forced me to leave no ſtone unturned to obtain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory. Philintus, whom I ſaw every evening, ſtimulated me by his importunities.

for me, a ſlight accident which happened to me let me into the ſecret, notwithſtanding her reſervedneſs. I had ſpent ſeveral nights in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Philintus and ſome other friends. My conſtitution was rather delicate. A bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the noſe, proceeding from fatigue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, ſeized me in to violent a manner, that I found myſelf very much indiſpoſed. Caliſta, being terrified, rung the bell, and called for her attendants, who were at that time fortunately from home, and ſhe was alone—alone with me in this condition. On my recovery I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her arms, She was bathed in tears. I perceived at that inſtant an inconceivable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of joy, pleaſure, and ſhame. I ſnatched the hand of Caliſta, which ſhe never thought of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, being ingroſſed by other ideas. How happy am I! ſaid I to her. Confirm my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, let one tender conſent complete my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city! I adore you. I have no other wiſh, no other view than to dedicate my life to your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. She made no reply, but her looks diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her thoughts. I imprinted a thouſand kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon her hand; which I ſtill held between mine. The timorous Caliſta, agitated with an emotion which encreaſed every moment fell back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon a couch, when one of her domeſtics entered. I was chagrined at his preſence, and took my leave a few minutes after in ſo much trouble and confuſion, that I could not tell where I was.</p>
               <p>When I came home the idea of Caliſta, her ſweet delirium, her credulity, and her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ruſhed upon my mind, and I thought it was a crime to take advantage of her innocence. My recovery was but of a ſhort date, my unbridled
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:046224_0009_1020FCCD12C9FF60"/>
appetite returned, I once more reſolved that Caliſta ſhould gratify my paſſion. I went to her houſe the next day, where, tho' I found a great deal of company, I found means of having a Tete-a-tete with her. I was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of her affection, but had no regard for the purity of my own. To cut this narrative ſhort, my ſon, ſhe was in love with me, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to her own ruin.</p>
               <p>My attentions for Caliſta diſcovered our inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to our two families. They talked of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us; but the propoſal alarmed me. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were now gratified. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>It was not long before this unfortunate lady repented of the ſacrifice ſhe had made to me. She wrote to me, deſcribed her ſituation, and uſed every method to ſecure my return. I did not condeſcend to give her any anſwer, nay, I had the baſeneſs to expoſe her letters to Philin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Other intrigues ſerved to obliterate the very name of Caliſta from my memory; there was no exceſs which I was not guilty of to avoid the ridicule of being thought religious or virtuous. I was guilty of ſo many, that I found myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of quitting the capital, and went to join my regiment. War was declared ſoon after; I was rejoiced at it, for my villainies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſturb my repoſe. I endeavoured to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize myſelf, not ſo much from a deſire of glory,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:046224_0010_1020FCD0B26D2A18"/>
as to eraze the remembrance of the crimes I had been guilty of. A letter which I received from Philiatus, on his death-bed, made me deteſt my irregularities, and pay the fruitleſs tribute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate of Caliſta."</p>
               <p>Alcindor was advanced thus far in his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the remembrance of his debaucheries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him with ſo much horror that he was not able to continue it, when he perceived Alcipus approaching towards him.—This viſit ſurpriſed him, becauſe for two years, in which they had lived in the ſame neighbourhood, they had made no connection. He recovered himſelf as he could, and went to meet him.</p>
               <p>Alcipus, formerly a friend of Alcindor, had entirely declined his company on account of the badneſs of his character. He ſincerely loved him, and always promoted his intereſts, even unknown to him. After his return to the paths of virtue, Alcindor was ſo much engroſſed by his religious exerciſes and the education of his ſon, that he lived in the greateſt privacy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enquiring who belonged to the eſtate which was contiguous to his own. Some incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the tenants had diſcovered that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Alcipus, but he did not venture to make himſelf known to him, and choſe rather to give up his property.</p>
               <p>Alcipus, after ſome compliments, taking Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cindor aſide, told him ingenuouſly that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his character had made him wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his acquaintance with him, and farther, to unite their families, if it were agreeable. "We are neighbours, ſaid he, we have known each other for ſome time, our families may form an alliance together. With reſpect to fortune, I
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:046224_0011_1020FCD3AD52A940"/>
have more than enough to make your ſon happy. I have no regard for punctilios or falſe delicacy: it is but natural, that as you never viſited me, you could not be ſuppoſed to demand my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of me, and therefore I am come to give you a voluntary offer of her. My dear friend, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, I have heard much of your ſon, I am in love with him; as for my daughter, ſhe is not diſagreeable, and I imagine they will make no bad match. If you will both of you come to my houſe, you ſhall ſee her, and I flatter myſelf that you will not reject the propoſal I have made to you.</p>
               <p>Alcindor made his acknowledgments to his friend; but as he was deſirous of finiſhing his inſtructive hiſtory, or rather finding himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of diſcloſing his diſtreſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punctions, he prevailed on Alcipus to ſpend the evening with him, promiſing to attend him the next morning. Alcipus conſented, they ſupped together, and ſpent their time in talking of things that were paſt. Alcindor let ſome few tears eſcape him, on which account they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſubject of their diſcourſe, and the night was ſpent in the ſweet delights of friendſhip and gratitude.</p>
               <p>It was ſcarce day break when Alcindor enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the apartment of Ergaſtus, who had paſſed one part of the night reflecting upon what his father had diſcloſed unto him, The idea of the approaching alliance had diſturbed him likewiſe, what frivolity, and the love of miſchief occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in young people, Ergaſius experienced, but from a different motive. A mild reſerved tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, aſſiſted with an education, though not faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, yet at the ſame time founded upon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional principles, enabled him to form a right
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:046224_0012_1020FCD9496B7FC0"/>
eſtimate of things. He was apprehenſive leſt a connection formed at his age, on the motive of intereſt, might render him unhappy; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of Alcipus charmed him, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of proving ungrateful, by refuſing an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or of being unhappy in uniting himſelf to a perſon whoſe character and diſpoſition ſhould be contrary to his own. Theſe reflections diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed him, when his father entered his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After giving him ſome inſtructions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the viſit they were to make, he reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his narrative in the following manner.</p>
               <p>I told you, my ſon, that Philintus wrote me a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etter which deluged my eyes with tears. The poor man had abandoned himſelf ſo much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>auchery, that at four and twenty he could not help wiſhing for death, though he durſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. In this criſis he came to himſelf, and repented his having been the ruin of a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young men, who had too implicitely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his pernicious counſels. When we are on the point of giving an account of our actions, the veil, which intercepted the ſight of them, rends, and we are filled with horror; and the weakneſs of the body communicating itſelf to the mind, carries us in an inſtant from the exceſs of vice to that of a forced and involuntary repentance. The impoſſibility of making reparation for the evils which we have done fills as with terror, which of itſelf would be ſufficient to accelerate our end. It was in this fatal moment that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus, terrified with the retroſpect of his paſt life, ſent for his friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confeſſed the crimes he had perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:046224_0013_1020FCDC4F663AF0"/>
changed their conduct, and became illuſtrious for their virtue.</p>
               <p>I was informed of the death of Philintus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as his ſickneſs. The circumſtances with which it was attended almoſt freezed me with horror. I began to reflect, and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the apprehenſions of meeting a ſimilar end had as much influence over me as virtue it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I turned my eyes within, I took a retroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of my irregularities, I groaned at the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy I had been guilty of to Caliſta; ſhame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my face, and deſpair got poſſeſſion of my heart.</p>
               <p>The peace which had lately been proclaimed, left me at liberty to repair to court. I returned thither very unlike myſelf. I employed myſelf in endeavouring to find out the unfortunate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta. Some years were ſpent in the fruitleſs reſearch, at length time abated ſomewhat of the poignancy of my remorſe, and I yielded to the importunities of a family, of which I was the only deſcendant. I married your mother. Love did not preſide at our wedding, my wounded heart could not harbour ſo ſweet a gueſt. We were, however, united by eſteem, and lived ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfortably, when my happineſs was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the loſs of your mother, who died a few hours after ſhe had introduced you into life.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of the crimes of my youth heightened the diſtreſs in which I was involved by the loſs of a valuable wife. I ſhould not have ſupported it, my ſon, if the hopes of being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you had not enabled me. I retired to this eſtate, where my whole ſtudy has been to form your heart to virtue. After the loſs of a law ſui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Being joined by Alcipus, they accompanied him to his caſtle, where they were received by Amelia as perſons whom ſhe expected. Selinda, the companion of Amelia, aſſiſted her in doing the honours of the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arms of his daughter made upon Ergaſtus. This youth kept his eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fixed upon her; his aſſiduity, his trivial attentions, which are important in love, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an air of complacence, convinced him that he was not indifferent to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:046224_0015_1020FCE000084530"/>Friend! ſaid Alcipus to Alcindor, let us leave the young folks by themſelves, I have ſomething to ſay to you, and we will join them in the park. Ergaſtus gave his hand to Amelia, Selinda accompanied them. They walked ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without ſpeaking to each other, and Selin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, abſorbed in melancholy, had no inclination to break ſilence. Ergaſtus, at laſt ventured to ſpeak a few words, his looks and his expreſſions were animated; love itſelf could not appear more irreſiſtible. He revealed his paſſion to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia with a force and energy, which could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſincerity alone. The amiable fair one, being inſtructed by her father before, did not ſtrive to conceal her feelings, and a modeſt, but ingenuous reply, inſured the happineſs of her lover.</p>
               <p>Satisfied with each other, they beheld no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects, and the arbour in which they were ſeated was a little world to them. Amelia, who till that moment, had ſeen none but her lover, recollected Selinda, rolled her eyes in ſearch of her, and was ſurpriſed not to find her. She was diſturbed at her abſence, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in queſt of her. "I cannot ingroſs your attention, fair Amelia," ſaid Ergaſtus to her in the accents of tenderneſs, "what are you afraid of?" Nothing, replied the inamoretta, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I have for you is a kind of ſecurity or a pledge that you have the ſame for me. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda is in diſtreſs, and demands my attention. She has no relations; and being entruſted to my father's care from her moſt tender age, the knows no one but him. Till this criſis ſhe has lived a happy life; but an alarming diſcovery of her preſent ſituation has plunged her into the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:046224_0016_1020FCE18B4DC0C8"/>
glooms of melancholy. I conjure you, Ergaſtus, to permit me to take her as my companion, and ſuffer me to keep her with me as long as I live. Were you acquainted with her virtues? No vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin was ever poſſeſſed of more virtues than Selinda.</p>
               <p>Charming Amelia, replied Ergaſtus, I ſhall never have any will but your's. It will give me the greateſt happineſs to contribute any ways to ſoften the pains of Selinda.</p>
               <p>As they were ſpeaking, they looked after her; but how great was then aſtoniſhment to find her in the arms of Alcindor, who, together with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipus, was bathed in tears.</p>
               <p>My ſon, cried Alcindor, heaven has reſtored me my daughter, your ſiſter, and the very copy of Caliſta.</p>
               <p>Ergaſtus and Amelia looked at each other with ſurprize; but their ſurprize was ſuperſeded by the pleaſure to find a ſiſter in a friend, whom they loved ſo much. Selinda quitted her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's embraces for thoſe of Ergaſtus and Amelia. They demanded with all the eagerneſs of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity how this diſcovery was made? I can inform you, my children, replied Alcipus.</p>
               <p>Caliſta, preyed on by the moſt lively ſorrow, had confidence enough to repoſe in me the ſecret of her circumſtances, and her juſt apprehenſions. Her parents were going to confine her to thoſe gloomy retreats, which are dedicated for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of involuntary penitents. I formed the reſolution of ſnatching her from their obduracy. I was aquainted with the ſuperior of the convent, where ſhe was to reſide till her delivery. We concerted meaſures to reſcue diſtreſſed innocence. The relations of Caliſta were ſo much blinded
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:046224_0017_1020FCE494E10438"/>
with rage, that it was no very difficult matter to impoſe upon them. A pretended illneſs and death, which they ſeemed to hear of with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, were the means we made uſe of to reſcue Caliſta.—My ſiſter carried her to the extreme parts of Sileſia, where ſhe has a ſmall eſtate. The diſtreſſed fair was delivered of Selinda, and her ſorrows put an end to her miſeries. With her dying breath ſhe conjured us to have pity on her orphan daughter, to conceal her birth from her, and make uſe of our utmoſt endeavours to inſpire her with the love of a religious life.</p>
               <p>We undertook this charge. I married a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while afterwards, and had Amelia. I brought them up together. The unwillingneſs of Selin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to take the veil obliged me to diſcloſe ſome part of the fatal ſecret. She felt the diſtreſs of her circumſtances, lamented them with the pangs of anguiſh, and perſiſted in her refuſal. My daughter, whom I took out of the convent, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to let her be with her; I conſented to her requeſt with joy. By chance I underſtood that Alcindor had ſeen his error, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a convert to virtue. I knew he had a ſon, whom he had educated himſelf. I then conceived the deſign of marrying my daughter to him, and to prepare my old friend to recognize his (daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) My wiſhes are accompliſhed. I have but one condition to make with reſpect to my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's marriage, which is this; my fortune is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, I ſhall divide it between Amelia and Selinda: I offer my heart to the latter; her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives his conſent; and to be ſhort, one word will unite all four of us together.</p>
               <p>Alcindor, who had gone aſide to avoid hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the narrative of Alcipus, returned at this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:046224_0018_1020FCE7C16A9450"/>
period, and aſked Selinda if ſhe would give her conſent.</p>
               <p>Yes, my dear father, replied ſhe, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I am under to Alcipus cannot be compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated but by the moſt ſincere affection and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. I am ready to perform any thing you can command.</p>
               <p>Alcindor, Alcipus, Ergaſtus, Amelia, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda embraced and congratulated each other on account of an alliance ſo happy, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen.</p>
               <p>The two weddings were ſolemnized without pomp, but with a general ſatisfaction. Alcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor retired to a ſolitary place, where he employed himſelf in regretting his dear Caliſta. He went yearly to viſit his children, imparted to them the fruits of his meditations, and recommended to them, above all things, to remember his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they might not only preſerve their children from the ſame, but likewiſe all thoſe whom providence ſhould commit to their care.</p>

               <p>MISS Jenny Bradſhaw was one of thoſe figures which, without being very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, had ſomething in her which ſeldom fails to pleaſe and charm. Born with a candid and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous heart, each day produced in her all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite qualities for making a huſband happy. The pride, inſpired by high life, praiſes, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and ſtill more the bad examples and wrong conceived maxims of the Lady, her mother,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:046224_0019_1020FCEA57C4F9E8"/>
wife to Sir James Bradſhaw, of an opulent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in Hampſhire, ſoon corrupted her good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. This Lady reſided always in London during the winter ſeaſon, and with reluctance quitted it even in ſummer, ſo few attractions had rural pleaſures for her, comparatively to the means that facilitated her gratifications in town. She was poſſeſſed with a ſingular mania of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving herſelf a fine wit, and greatly admired for her vaſt erudition. One time ſhe was ſeen to enter the liſt with a band of Literation po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, religious, and metaphyſical diſcuſſions. Mallebranche, Locke, and Newton, were favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite authors with her. Another time ſhe prided in giving her patronage to every young adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in authorſhip of any kind; ſhe read all the pamphlets, plays, and poems they brought her, and in the enthuſiaſms of her heart conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered herſelf as the only arbiter of good taſte.</p>
               <p>Miſs Jenny aſſiſted aſſiduouſly at the conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces held in her Ladyſhip's apartment. As ſhe grew up, the inclinations of the mother gathered ſtrength in her, but ſucceſs was not anſwerable to her deſires. She had ſome difficulty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing herſelf. Often, in the midſt of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſhe would ſtop ſhort, as bewildered. Forming two or three connected phraſes was to her a painful buſineſs. A natural timidity ſtill added to the embaraſſment of her tongue. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could vex her Mamma more than the poor diſplay of her argumentative faculties: ſhe did not ceaſe preaching to her daughter, and in her ſcientific delirium would cite examples to her of ſome philoſophic Ladies, and many others of the ſex, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves for their genius in a variety of compoſition. How can
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:046224_0020_1020FCED081A3800"/>
your frozen imagination, ſaid ſhe, receive no warmth, collect no fire from the reading of the works of ſuch incomparable women? See what glory has crowned them! will you, by indolent life add to the number of ordinary women, whoſe ſole talent is to adorn, and to borrow from art charms which nature has refuſed them, or add to the number of thoſe that waſte their time and ſpirits amidſt the obſcure details of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic occupation. A woman properly is no other wiſe commendable but by the extent of her wit and genius.</p>
               <p>Such was Lady Bradſhaw's manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly lecturing her daughter. She was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how dangerous it is to tamper at procuring too much wit for women. Nature calculated them for pleaſing and not for becoming learned. A forgetfulneſs of the duties annexed to their condition is the fruit of a taſte miſplaced on ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. The wanderings of the mind common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce thoſe of the heart. A young Lady that ſeeks inſtruction, in the view of ſhining as learned, is but too often inſtructed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of her virtue.</p>
               <p>Opportunity ſoon favoured the deſigns of her Ladyſhip on Miſs Jenny. Mr. Reynolds, a young Gentleman of ſome rank, but of depraved morals, ſeemed to her the fitteſt perſon for inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her daughter with a love of the Belles Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres. This Mr. Reynolds was one of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial beings that haunt all our gay towns and places of reſort, yet able only to impoſe on the ſenſeleſs and undiſcerning multitude. He had ſomething of a ſprightly imagination, ſpoke with eaſe and fluency, and reaſoned upon every thing without knowing any thing to the bottom.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:046224_0021_1020FCEF01AEE498"/>
The reading of novels and plays was his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal occupation. He would deſcant on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of every actor and actreſs on the ſtage, and as a perfect connoiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur in theatrical matters, would enter into minute details of their juſtneſs or improprieties. He alſo pretended to be an adept in the doctrine of chances at any ſort of game or diverſion. Nothing could be more pleaſing to him than the favourable opinion La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Bradſhaw entertained of his qualifications. For a long time he had been courting ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from her, and he ſecretly aſpired to Miſs Jenny. He had already made ſome ſucceſsful attempts in that way; but Jenny was a rich heireſs, and himſelf had diſſipated a good part of his patrimony, ſo that he had reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend leſt the inequality of fortune might become an obſtacle to his deſires. How great was his joy, and how confident his preſumption, when he ſaw himſelf permitted to give leſſons to his dear Jenny. He profited of every occurrence in them that could be applicable to love (for his firſt leſſons were out of romances and novels) to make the caſe her's and his own, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when a ſtrained ſenſibility took place, all the ſighs and raptures of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixotiſm were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted. Thus it was that this new Abelard and this new Eloiſa ſpent the moments in amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous parley, which Lady Bradſhaw imagined to be dedicated to ſtudy: 'Mr Reynolds, ſaid ſhe, I find my daughter has a ſmoother and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier elocution ſince ſhe has been under your tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition; her mind begins to open, and her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects ſhew a more clear and lively conception.'</p>
               <p>Reynolds, with many flattering ſpeeches kept the mother in her fatal deluſion. He ſaw with
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:046224_0022_1020FCF4148E92C0"/>
pleaſure the progreſs his young pupil made in the ſcience of love. Now he tried what effect ſoft and tender poetry might have on her mind. Ovid's Art of love and his Epiſtles were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got. To theſe ſucceeded ſome ſelect paſſages from Tragedy. The young Lady's imagination became daily more heated. He was careful to dwell longer on the more paſſionate parts to give Miſs Jenny a due feeling of them; ſhe liſtened to him with avidity, and inſenſibly ſuffered herſelf to be wrought upon to give into all the ſnares of ſeduction. Already they wrote the tendereſt billets-doux to each other. Their interviews and converſation were more frequent under the ſpecious pretext of acquiring wit, and, the more they ſaw each other, the more they loved.</p>
               <p>Sir James Bradſhaw, a man of rough manners, and little or no learning, had however wit and ſenſe enough to know his wife's foible. At times he would become boiſterous, and fly out into a paſſion againſt her, reproaching her tartly with her ſtrange ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ner of conducting herſelf and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He loved ſincerely his children, was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for their welfare, and did not look with ſo indifferent an eye as his Lady on the prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous education of his daughter. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he expreſsly forbad her to receive Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds's viſits. This order ſeemed to ſtrike Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with conſternation. Love had made too deep a wound in her heart. Nothing was capable of effecting her cure.</p>
               <p>The impetuous temper of the Baronet, and the melancholy air of Jenny's countenance, were ſoon as preſages to Mr. Reynolds that ſome ſtorm was gathering againſt his happineſs; and what confirmed him in his notions was the cold recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:046224_0023_1020FCF811380908"/>
he had from Lady Bradſhaw. She at length began to think that his aſſiduities to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be attended with very diſagreeable conſequences. Reynolds had grounded his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal hopes on the confidence that blind mother had placed in him; however, as an expert man, and verſed in the airs of intrigue, he ſchemed other meaſures to attain his end. He knew how Miſs Jenny's heart was diſpoſed; he was belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, and he agreed with her, that it was beſt to deſiſt from further viſits; but, before ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they concerted the means of keeping up an epiſtolary correſpondence.</p>
               <p>Reynolds appeared no more at Lady Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw's aſſemblies, which indeed were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs frequent than before. He wrote pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty often to Jenny, and ſtrove to diſpoſe her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to private interviews. He knew by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that love is irritated by difficulties, and that a young female, once going beyond the bounds of modeſty, runs afterwards of herſelf to the precipice. Miſs Jenny after many reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, fears, uncertainties, and after having liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to and long ſtruggled againſt the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of virtue, yielded at laſt to her lover's ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations. They ſaw each other as often as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities ſerved, by the intervention of a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman, to whom Reynolds, in the diſguiſe of a country farmer, was to perſonate the lover. This ſtratagem ſucceeded from time to time with little or no interruption. In the country, Miſs Jenny and her maid uſed to take their evening walks by the receſſes of wood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

every thing, in ſhort, painted for Jenny the ſcenes and the language of love. While the maid would ſtep aſide to gather ſome wild flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that catched her eye, the amorous pair would go aſtray, and often out of ſight, in their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſolitude. Reynolds became more paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and fond; Jenny more adventurous and more weak. What will not an enterpriſing lover ſo circumſtanced, attempt? Jenny loſt ſight of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and was defeated.</p>
               <p>Reynolds applauded himſelf in ſecret for his triumph. His happineſs appeared certain to him. A marriage ſo much to his advantage would repair the diſorders of his fortune occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the eccentricities of libertine youth. Jenny on the other ſide, ſoon became inconſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Her heart was rent, her mind diſtreſſed and depreſſed by all the remorſe that commonly follows illicit pleaſure and the loſs of virtue. She dared no more appear before her mother, and how ſhould ſhe confeſs her fault to her? To what reproaches was not ſhe going to expoſe herſelf? Her ſituation, however, did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to diſguiſe it longer: Each day the indications of her diſhonour were more and more viſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Encouraged by the ſolicitations of her lover, ſhe went trembling to her mother's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reveals to her the fatal ſecret with all the ſhame the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IF your breaſt has any feeling for the diſtreſſes of a ruined wife and mother, I beſeech you to communicate my unhappy ſtory to the public. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t may poſſibly come time enough to prevent a cataſtrophe, which would add horror to ruin, and drive to utter diſtraction a poor helpleſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who have more miſery already than they are able to bear.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of a very worthy officer in the army, who by a train of unavoidable misfortunes, was obliged to ſell his commiſſion; and from a ſtate of eaſe and plenty has been long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the utmoſt penury and want. One ſon and a daughter were our only children.—Alas! that I ſhould live to ſay it! happy would it have been for us if one of them had never been born! —The boy was of a noble nature, and in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier times his father bought him a commiſſion in the ſervice where he is now a lieutenant, and quartered in Scotland with his regiment, O! he is a dear and dutiful child, and has kept his poor parents from the extremity of want, by the kind ſupplies which he has from time to time ſent us in our misfortunes.</p>
               <p>His ſiſter was in the eyes of a fond father and mother lovely to an extreme. Alas Mr. Fitz Adam! ſhe was too lovely.—The times I have watered her dear face with my tears at the thought that her temper was too meek and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:046224_0026_1020FCFFD08C6788"/>
for ſo engaging a form! She lived with us till ſhe was turned of fourteen, at which time we were prevailed on by a friend to place her with a gentleman of fortune in the country, (who had lately buried his lady), to be the companion of his daughters. The gentleman's character was too honourable, and the offer too advantageous, to ſuffer us to heſitate long about parting with a child whom, dear to us as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he was, we were not able to ſupport. It is now a little more than two years ſince our ſeparation, and till within a very few months it was our happineſs and joy we had provided for her ſo fortunately. She lived in the eſteem and friendſhip of the young ladies, who were indeed very amiable perſons, and ſuch was their father's ſeeming indulgence to us, that he advanced my huſband a ſum of money upon his bond, to free him from ſome ſmall debts which threatened him hourly with a jail.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall I tell you, Sir, that this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefactor has been the crueleſt of all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies! The enjoyment of our good fortune began to be interrupted by hearing leſs frequently from our daughter than we uſed to do; and when a letter from her arrived, it was ſhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and ſometimes blotted as if with tears, while it told us of nothing that ſhould occaſion any concern. It is now upwards of two months ſince we have heard from her at all; and while we were wondering at her ſilence, we received a letter from the eldeſt of the young ladies, which threw us into a perplexity which can neither be deſcribed nor imagined. It was directed to me, and contained theſe words.</p>

and has left me in the utmoſt horror at the thought of what may happen. I dread every thing from the raſhneſs and impetuoſity of my ſon, whoſe notions of honour and juſtice are thoſe of a young ſoldier, who, in defiance of the law, will be judge in his own cauſe, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of injuries which Heaven only ſhould puniſh.</p>
               <p>I have written to him upon this occaſion in all the agony of a fond mother's diſtreſſes. But O! I have fatal forebodings that my letter will come too late. What is this honour, and what this juſtice, that prompts men to acts of violence and blood, and either leaves them victims to the law, or to their own unwarrantable raſhneſs? As forcibly as I was able in this diſtracted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I have ſet his duty before him; and have charged him, for his own ſoul's ſake, and for the ſake of thoſe he moſt tenderly loves, not to bring utter ruin upon a family, whoſe diſtreſſes already are near ſinking them to the grave.</p>
               <p>The only glimmering of comfort that opens upon me is the hopes that your publication of this letter may warn the wretch who has undone us, of his danger, and incline him to avoid it. Fear is commonly the companion of guilt, and may poſſibly be the means of preſerving to me the life of a ſon, after worſe than death has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to a daughter.</p>

               <p>Ye who are now peruſing this narrative, if invincible obſtacles ſeparate you from the object of your affection; if a conſtant but unſucceſsful paſſion afford you no deſirable proſpect to conſole yourſelves with hope: perhaps the next moment a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The lover ſhould not deſpair; let the hiſtory of Salvador, ſon of the king of Ceylon, confirm this aſſertion. In one night he loſt his father, his relations, and his kingdom. The Portugueſe, who had lately made the diſcovery of the Indies, and conquered the iſland of Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, ſent him to L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Of all the Portugueſe nobles who had ſhewed their civilities to Salvador, the count d' Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovar was the moſt ardent in the purſuit of his friendſhip. This nobleman was rich, of great

intereſt at court, but fiery, ambitious, of rigid virtue, too credulous in believing ill, an enemy to his own age and mankind in general, diſpoſed to find fault, and imagining that others were not poſſeſſed of thoſe virtues which he felt in his own breaſt. He was puſhing for the vice-roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the Indies, and in hopes that Salvador might ſome day be of ſervice to him, he omitted nothing to gain his confidence. He eaſily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. The unfortunate run to meet their comforters, and kiſs with tranſport the hands which wipe away their tears. Their connection became ſo imtimate, that Salvador made no ſcruple of accepting a lodging with his friend. The firſt object which ſtruck him was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his new friend; ſhe was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beauties in Portugal: it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the charms and graces which Donna Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella united in her perſon. Her air was noble and engaging, her figure majeſtic, her eyes full of fire, and her head adorned with jetty hair which ſhe dreſſed herſelf: in a word, ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſome angelical exiſtence that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from heaven.</p>

He has conflicted with great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; you will aid me in cloſing his wounds with the balm of conſolation.</p>
               <p>Donna Iſabella made a vague but ingenuous reply, but Salvador was unable to utter a word. The ſight of Iſabella made a ſtrong impreſſion upon him, a ſweet emotion ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtriving to fix them on Iſabella, they lowered themſelves as if unable to ſuſtain the ſplendor of ſo many charms. He ſtrove to raiſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but they lowered themſelves again. His ſoul intoxicated with the ſight, ſeemed to have quitted him: he remained without motion, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an extaſy of delight. Such are the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious moments which feeling hearts experience but once, and which thoſe who are cold, or void of feeling, never experience.</p>
               <p>Salvador found his heart wounded for the firſt time. A conſuming fire, which circulated through all his veins, informed him that he was in love; he ſhuddered at the event, but could no longer prevent it, a ſingle glance had infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for the reſt of his life. It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of great paſſions to be born in an inſtant. The count perceived his embaraſſment, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it to his reviving the idea of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. He made him ſeveral very polite apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and in order to divert his thoughts, took him aſide into his garden. "You are maſter of all my houſe," ſaid he to Salvador; "look upon it as your own; eſteem me as your parent; your age, and my friendſhip, vindicate me in aſſuming that title.

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:046224_0033_1020FD13E95D4F48"/>
pierced his heart with a dreadful light, which diſcovered to him the dangers which attended his paſſion; like a flaſh of lightning in a ſtormy night, which diſcovers to the deſpairing paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the rocks and breakers with which he is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. From that inſtant he was reſolved to ſtruggle againſt his paſſion; but he ſtruggled in vain! It is in vain to wreſtle with our fate. His inflamed heart reſiſted in vain the paſſion by which it was enſlaved. The reflection he made to deſtroy his affection ſerved only to increaſe it. He ſaw and converſed with Iſabella every day, and drank from her eyes the fire which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him. The ſound of her voice, or guitar, pierced his heart, the fragrance of the flowers which ſhe wore in her boſom overpowered him; all his ſenſes were intoxicated with love, and his paſſion was never more violent, than when his feeble reaſon ſtrove to ſuppreſs it.</p>
               <p>Love made as great a progreſs in the heart of Iſabella. Her eyes were fixed upon thoſe of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador, and were rejoiced to meet them; a ſecret anxiety made her uneaſy in his abſence, and the days which they paſſed together ſted away like ſo many moments. The moſt intimate confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was eſtabliſhed between them. Their mouth was a ſtranger to the ſecret of their hearts, their eyes communicated their mutual thoughts and deſires; and the pleaſure of ſeeing each other, left them no other to wiſh for. That age muſt be very deplorable in which the ſight of two young and innocent lovers ſhould appear either ſtrange, or chimerical!</p>
               <p>The happineſs of Salvador and Iſabella want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing for its completion, but ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which taught them the value of it. One

day Salvador, with an heart and eyes full of tenderneſs, met with Iſabella as ſhe was going up to her apartments. The elegant diſorder of her diſhabille ſeemed to give a great addition to her charms. Never had ſhe appeared to him with ſo much beauty. He offered her his hand, and trembled to receive hers. He graſped it ſoftly. He thought he felt it tremble, and in his tranſport <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> glued his burning lips upon it. Iſabella was in great agitation. She blaſhed, and retired.</p>
               <p>Salvador, intoxicated with pleaſure, was at length confuſed with the thought or his daring to offend one whom he loved: it was ſome time before he was able to appear in her preſence. He dreaded her ſight and he had reaſon for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. Iſabella thought herſelf offended. Though ſhe was not without feeling, ſhe was nevertheleſs of rigid virtue; and the raſhneſs of her lover appeared inexcuſable. However, chance offered him an opportunity of excuſing himſelf.</p>
               <p>The king's comedians had brought out a new play. The count d'Almodovar begged Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, who had been at it the firſt night, to give ſome account of it before Iſabella and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous company: the ſubject of the piece was a quarrel between too lovers, occaſioned by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet ſalute. Salvador enforced the excuſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er, that the company would have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, had not the ſhepherdeſs granted him his pardon. Iſabella perceived that Salvador was pleading his own cauſe: ſhe was affected with his remorſe, the turn he gave to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:046224_0035_1020FD1758E3FA90"/>
and with the glance from her eyes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him of his pardon.</p>
               <p>The reconciliation which took place between them was productive of a ſhortlived happineſs. A croud of ſuitors flocked to Iſabella; they were all ſuitable to her in age, fortune, and birth. Iſabella was not a little diſturbed at the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ations which were made to her. She confided in the affection which her father had for her, as a means of avoiding an engagement which was diſagreeable to her. But Salvador was in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, from an apprehenſion of loſing the object of his affections. He reproached himſelf for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an obſtacle to the happineſs of Iſabella; for diſturbing the tranquility of a worthy family; for practiſing upon the affections of the daughter of his friend; and he was reſolved to triumph over his weakneſs. He ſaw Iſabella but ſeldom; but the efforts he made to conquer his paſſion flung him into a profound melancholy, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired his health. Iſabella perceived it, and was greatly alarmed. She was reſolved to run any riſk to procure his recovery. She wrote him a billet, which ſhe ſent by a ſlave, whom ſhe thought ſhe could confide in. Salvador received it with an anxiety, which was not very favourable to his cure; it was to the following effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Your condition makes me very uneaſy, take care of yourſelf for my ſake, and repeat this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couplet which I ſing with as much pleaſure as ſincerity;</hi>

You have fallen into a melancholy, which affects me very much; you drag on a chagrin which preys upon you: your health is impaired; I have till now avoided enquiring into the cauſe of your melancholy, but if it be in my power to afford you any conſolation, the keeping it a ſecret is a crime in the eyes of friendſhip. Does my friendſhip ceaſe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to you? Has my daughter forgot the regards which are due to you? Have my friends or domeſtics neglected you? Have you ſuffered any conſiderable loſs? Speak! my dear friend. My fortune, my life is at your ſervice; you ſhall meet with ſatisfaction in every thing.

               <p>Salvador, pierced with ſo affecting an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and aſhamed to harrow up the ſoul of ſo generous a friend, was for ſome time in ſuſpenſe whether he ſhould not fall at his feet, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the whole affair to him; but he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of making too deep a wound in his own heart; he conceived the raſh hopes of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing himſelf from the heart of Iſabella, and to reconcile her to the views of her father. He pretended that the motive of his melancholy was his diſtance from his own country, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his misfortunes, and ſeveral other circumſtances which is not in the power of the count to redreſs. He thanked him hearti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

read it; on reflecting upon the contents, he was filled with apprehenſions, and proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his maſter's feet, where he confeſſed his crime, and diſcovered the contents of the billet with which he had been charged; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, joy, and tranſport with which Salvador had peruſed it. This impoiſoned the breaſt of the father with jealouſy, hatred, and fury. "It is this wretch, then," cried the count, "that has diſturbed her tranquility, betrayed his friendſhip, and violated the laws of hoſpitality! the wretch! with what artfulneſs did he wipe off the tears, which he alone was the cauſe of! With what perfidiouſneſs did he receive my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes! How calmly did he enjoy the fruit of his crimes! Bid him quit my houſe directly," ſaid he to one of his domeſtics, "and never dare to come there again." In the height of his fury he wrote him the following billet:</p>
               <p>"You have betrayed my friendſhip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: quit a houſe of which you are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and never dare to appear again in the preſence of a friend whom you have ſo cruelly offended."</p>
               <p>The count d' Almodovar ſet no bounds to his paſſion, becauſe he thought that Salvador had ſet none to his. The contempt he had for thoſe of his own times, and the ill-will which he bore them, were united againſt Salvador and Iſabella. He might have been convinced of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but his natural ferocity, and the rigidneſs of his principles were equally hurt; and he ran the riſk of doing an injury to his daughter, merely for the ſake of a pretence of hating a friend. Salvador was overwhelmed with grief, but he reſigned himſelf to his exile without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring

againſt Iſabella's father. He imputed his misfortunes to none but himſelf; he did not heſitate to ſeek an aſylum f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Iſabella heard of the departure of Salvador, without being informed of the cauſe. She durſt not ſpeak of it to any one, nor durſt any one, ſpeak of it to her. At one time ſhe grieved at the cruel uſage, which ſhe was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that he was unable to ſupport; at another time ſhe was offended at his coolneſs; ſhe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of deſerting her, and, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of hating her. "If he loved me ſtill," ſaid ſhe, "would he not have contrived to ſee me? Should I not have ſeen him at church, or the publick walks, or at the play? Would not love have inſpired him with ſome expedients to aſſure me that he loved me ſtill?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding Iſabella conſtantly rejected all the offers that were made her, ſhe artfully eluded the importunities which her father made uſe of to engage her to chooſe a huſband. She knew that Salvador ought to carry his point at court; that the king had honoured him with ſtrong promiſes, and ſhe hoped that if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he might meet with were any wiſe ſuitable to his birth, and the loſs of his eſtates, he would ſoon be in a condition to offer her a hand, which her father himſelf would urge her to accept.</p>
               <p>Salvador cheriſhed the ſame ideas in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. The image of Iſabella was always before his eyes. He would not have wiſhed, for
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:046224_0040_1020FD26CC49A910"/>
the ſake of Iſabella, that ſhe ſhould think too much of him; but he could not but wiſh that ſhe would not imagine him inconſtant. He often repeated the ſong which ſhe ſent him, wrote it upon the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the orange trees which grew upon the banks of that river. He dwelt with ſingular delight upon the laſt line.</p>
               <q>I love,—and I ſhall love for life.</q>
               <p>He knew the inexorableneſs and the views of the count d'Almodovar: he could not flatter himſelf with a certainty of ever poſſeſſing Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la: but at the ſame time finding no obſtacles which might not be ſurmounted, his heart gave entrance to hope. He redoubled his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the king; and in hopes of obtaining ſome favour from him, which might make him nearer to Iſabella in point of fortune, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited the miniſters, and laid aſide that air of importance which his birth and the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his pretenſions inſpired him with. Love, which melts the moſt ſavage, ſoftened his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. He became an aſſiduous, importunate, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>One day as he was at the levee of Don Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de Mello, the Lord high-admiral, a lady whom he formerly had been acquainted with, and was waiting as well as himſelf to have an audience of the admiral, accoſted him. She was an intimate friend of the count d'Almodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var, and had heard a part of Salvador's hiſtory, which affected her. Whether it were from cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:046224_0041_1020FD2989B11C10"/>
or compaſſion for his misfortunes, ſhe ſpake to him concerning Iſabella, informed him that her health was impaired more and more every day; that ſhe conſtantly refuſed every offer which was made her, and at laſt, promiſed to introduce him to her, if ſhe could do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding either her diſcretion, or her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. Salvador cloſed the propoſal with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and the day and place for receiving the anſwer were fixed. At the time appointed he flew to the place of rendezvous; but how great was his agony when he was informed, that "Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella heard his name mentioned with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſhe pretended to queſtion whether he had any great deſire of an interview, and that ſhe at laſt ordered her to acquaint him that ſhe was quite recovered.</p>
               <p>Heavens! cried he, is it poſſible that Iſabella ſhould be inconſtant, unjuſt, and cruel! Even though ſhe ceaſed to love me, providing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference would have contributed to her health, I ſhould not have complained; but to ſuſpect that I was no ways interreſted in her health, to give me notice of her inconſtancy, to plunge the dagger herſelf into my heart, is ſuch a ſhock as I cannot ſupport! I am determined to fly a place where there can be no feelings, when there are none in Iſabella's heart.</p>
               <p>He ran over every part of the inhabitable globe in idea in queſt of a place to bury his grief in. But his choice was ſoon fixed, a ſecret, a natural propenſity generally attracts us to our own country. He recollected, that amongſt the Indians, who are in alliance with his anceſtors, the Marattoes were the moſt numerous, the moſt courageous, and moſt favourable to his own

views, becauſe they were continually at war with the Portugueſe. He was reſolved to ſeek an aſylum among them, and ſolicit a commiſſion in their army. He ſoon informed them of his deſcent, and gave them proofs of his courage. The ſkill he acquired in military affairs enabled him to diſcipline their troops. Though he ſought for death in every engagement, he met with nothing but glory. A man may eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a hero who had no value for his life! The Indians regarded Salvador as ſome celeſtial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who was ſent to protect their liberty and their country; they imagined a ſovereign who reſembled him would inſure their happineſs; and the unanimous voice of the nation placed him upon the throne. He aſcended it with tranſport, in hopes of ſharing it with Iſabella.</p>
               <p>I have, ſaid he, at laſt a throne to offer to one, who is more worthy of it than any other. The abſolute ſovereign of my heart, ſhe ſhall be ſo likewiſe of an extenſive dominion; but this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is rather too ſmall, I could wiſh to be the king of the univerſe, to make her a more meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious offer.</p>
               <p>Salvador thus pleaſed himſelf with the idea of preſenting a crown to his miſtreſs. But he was perplexed for the means of obtaining her accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. —The war which the Portugueſe carried on againſt the Marattoes, and eſpecially the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe diſtance which ſeparated him from Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, formed almoſt inſuperable obſtacles to his wiſhes. He imagined that Iſabella was at Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, and was under a miſtake.

royalty of the Indies, which he had ſolicited ſo long.

                  <hi>Hiſtory of DORANTES.</hi> A Moral Tale founded on fact.</head>
               <p>DORANTES was naturally well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and full of ſenſibility; but loſing his parents in his infancy, he was intruſted to the care of mercenary tutors, who regarded their ſalaries more than the improvement of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil. I need not ſay that their abilities were not very great; it cannot be otherwiſe where perſons are void of <hi>ſentiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dorantes deſpiſed his tutors and conſequently conceived a very high opinion of himſelf, and was obſtinate in all his deſires.</p>
               <p>This character grew into a habit by the time when a perſon enters into the world, and chooſes his manner of life for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Honoured with a military poſt, as ſoon as he was able to enjoy it, Dorantes was introduced to Lucinda; her houſe was the receptacle for all thoſe that were deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rous of ſtudying the <hi>taſte</hi> of the day, to ſeize the faſhion of the moment, or figure in the art of pleaſing.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of ſubmitting to the general <hi>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, would not adopt it till he had ſeen how it would take for one month, which was the way of never ſubmitting to it.</p>
               <p>To brave the torrent of faſhion, to make it the ſubject of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tire, is mere ſingularity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olly: though the perſon who does this may be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, yet he is excuſed.</p>
               <p>What the world could not forgive in him, was
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:046224_0047_1020FD3C041F2918"/>
his obſtinacy in his ſentiments, and the poſitive manner in which he defended them againſt his ſuperiors, I mean thoſe who had gained an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency in ſociety.</p>
               <p>This pertinaciouſneſs may ſometimes be found in the company of truth; but yet it is no proof of it: for error has had its martyrs. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes never quitted an opinion which he had adopted. Perſons of ſuch a temper may at firſt be ſincere, and though afterwards they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived, yet their vanity will not ſuffer them to confeſs it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who were in the right in their diſputes with Dorantes, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ented themſelves with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering him on account of his oddities; for ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority is indulgent. Thoſe who were in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and were for deſtroying the veil of error in his company, were not quite ſo eaſy; on which account he was frequently engaged in ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of honour.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, he broke with Medor, one of his friends, only becauſe he had not ſo high an opinion as himſelf, of an eminent actor. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes grew warm, and they drew their ſwords; the engagement was not a very bloody one, they came off ſlightly wounded but yet, it might have been attended with more fatal conſequences.</p>
               <p>Though they ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The blame was univerſally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aid upon Doran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Lucinda was affected with it. "It is a pity, ſaid ſhe to herſelf, that a man of honour, and one whom I have entered into my liſt,

ſhould ruin himſelf, at the beginning of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer! Come, my dear Cloe, I will prepare a triumph for you. Love muſt reform him—nor is there a greater maſter."</p>
               <p>This propoſal was agreeable to her wiſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lucinda could not have made a better choice. Cloe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> new how to ſet off reaſon without giving up any of its rights. It is frequently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſurrounded with thorns; if the road to it be difficult, it is only owing to the guides.</p>
               <p>It was by this ſecret charm that Cloe acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an aſcendency over Dorantes; ſubdued by her graces, he thought that he yielded only to her arguments.</p>
               <p>As it is impoſſible to draw the character of Cloe to perfection, I ſhall only add that her beauty was the only ſubject of diſcourſe among the other ſex, and that her good friends among the ladies, could find but one defect in her; though her rivals thought ſhe had <hi>two.</hi> "Her eyes, ſaid the latter, are expreſſive of tenderneſs, when they ought to expreſs indifference; and the colouring of her complexion has too near a reſemblance to that of art, on account of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too glaring."</p>
               <p>Cloe ſoon received a viſit from Dorantes: he endeavoured to efface, by his preſence, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which had been ſpread of his duel. "What here already! cried ſhe; you have very little value for your health."—"My health! repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he; I do not underſtand you."—"Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, reſumed Cloe, none of your evaſions; preſerve your ingenuouſneſs, eſpecially as it will not become <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> which is a great thing in your favour." "Well, anſwered Dorantes, I will confeſs. I have had <hi>an affair</hi>; yet I was
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:046224_0049_1020FD40D3EE4F68"/>
but ſlightly wounded; will you blame me for ſhewing that I did not want for courage. It is the inheritance of thoſe who are in the army." "It may be ſo, ſaid ſhe, but politeneſs is their inheritance likewiſe. What was the cauſe of the rupture between you and Medor? You admired the expreſſion, the fire, and ſenſibility of—the actor, and I cannot but ſay I have the higher opinion of your taſte for doing ſo. Medor who is more phlegmatic than you, admires him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enthuſiaſm; in the name of good ſenſe was there any reaſon for your falling into a paſſion on that account? Dorantes, your confuſion and ſilence ſhew that you <hi>are ſorry for it.</hi>" "Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered he, they only ſhew my <hi>aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; I could not have imagined that valour would appear as a crime in your eyes." "I have told you, replied ſhe briſkly, that I have no objection to valour; I only object to the abuſe of it; blood ſhould never be drawn in a diſpute on <hi>taſte.</hi> Repair your fault. —You may do it without any prejudice to your character. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to Medor that you attacked him without grounds or reaſon." "What would you have me do? cried Dorantes. No, I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour myſelf. A conceſſion of that nature would only expoſe me to freſh inſults.—Perhaps I may have been in the wrong. Ah Madam, what an expreſſion have you extorted from me!" This kind of confeſſion was all that Cloe could draw from him; and he was ſorry that he had made it.</p>
               <p>We are very partial to ourſelves, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with thoſe who do not flatter our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. Hence Cloe diſpleaſed Dorantes by the very circumſtance which ought to have increaſed
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:046224_0050_1020FD44B84B8F60"/>
his love. "She cenſures my conduct, which is a ſure token that it is worthy of eſteem: for nothing but what is intrinfically valuable is deemed a proper object for criticiſm. Well I ſhall leave theſe cenſurers to themſelves, and I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to begin with Cloe, ſhe is like others carried away by the ſtream of vulgar errors, and ready to give her ſanction to every thing that is in faſhion; ſhe may indeed have too much ſenſe to differ from me in opinion—but ſhe ſeems at preſent only to flatter thoſe that are my enemies."</p>
               <p>To renounce our preſent connections is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ourſelves to the neceſſity of contracting new ones: Dorantes experienced the truth of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. A character like his, and an opulent fortune, open a favourable proſpect to thoſe who ſtrive to extricate themſelves from their difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by their officiouſneſs, and ſubſtitute the moſt ſervile compliances and intrigue, in the ſtead of honeſt labour for their ſupport.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe with which he was ſurrounded, no one ſurpaſſed Damis in <hi>fineſſe.</hi> Employed inceſſantly in developing the foibles of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, attentive to their motions, their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their looks, he turned all the light he acquired to his own advantage. Perſons of a poſitive diſpoſition are fond of applauſe; this was the inſtrument which Damis availed himſelf of; far from oppoſing his opinions to thoſe of Dorantes, he cried up their ſublimity, and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced them as much as a critic does one of the Greek or Roman claſſics.</p>
               <p>At the firſt ſhaft of flattery Dorantes was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

betray us, and if we aſpire at public applauſe, we are in part ſeduced.</p>
               <p>To diſpute every inch of ground with addreſs; to oppoſe or comply with the public taſte, was the artifice which Damis employed on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. "I muſt bring you acquainted with a young lady from the country, whoſe relations have committed her to my care," ſaid he to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes; and he added, "ſhe is tolerably hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, you ſhall form her, and be her inſtructor."</p>
               <p>Dorantes, prejudiced in favour of Clarinda's character, perceived nothing but ſimplicity, where others would have diſcovered <hi>fineſſe,</hi> and was inchanted with her perſon, which he had given them but a faint deſcription of.</p>
               <p>Not that her perſon was equal to that of Cloe's, but there is a great deal of partiality blended with the judgment we make of beauty. We frequently depreciate in private thoſe charms which others applaud with the greateſt warmth, and commonly fall a victim to thoſe which others paſs by unnoticed. Were it not for this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from partiality to the general taſte, two or three perſons would ingroſs every one's ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the major part of the ſex would not have a ſingle heart left for them.</p>
               <p>Be this as it may, the affection of Dorantes fluctuated between the two Belies; but when he found himſelf applauded by Clarinda, when he contraſted the captivating notes of ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Clarinda had two difficulties to ſtruggle with; her poverty, which is a very great obſtacle in theſe days; but that was nothing in compariſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of modeſt and diſcreet appearances, and to feed his love by little liberties. To ſecure the former ſhe made choice of thoſe ſituations where a perſon may riſk every thing without too much raſhneſs; to procure the other, ſhe tempered by her diſcourſes, the ardor which ſhe had excited? ſhe made him contented in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſmall favours, by giving him a proſpect of obtaining ſtill greater; thus at the ſame time as ſhe inflamed his deſires, ſhe chained them with hope; and from the whole of her conduct ſhe was able both to keep his love alive, and to preſerve his eſteem.</p>
               <p>Dorantes would readily have propoſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, had it not been for the exceſſive precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Clarinda. But ſhe had painted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in ſo diſagreeable an attitude, that he was afraid to furniſh new victims, and add to the number of dupes; or the bad.</p>
               <p>However, to haſten the cataſtrophe, Clarinda changed her battery. She became reſerved and ſcrupulous. She never received Dorantes without lamenting the force of the paſſion by which ſhe was attached to him. She aſſumed an external appearance of devotion; and after having prepared him by theſe artifices, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that her virtue, honour, conſcience, and the advice of perſons of the greateſt piety, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to take refuge in one of thoſe aſylums of innocence, wherein that time is dedicated to prayer, which others dedicate to pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Dorantes entreated, conjured, made a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred proteſtations of affection, and concluded with a promiſe of leading her to the altar.</p>
               <p>If Clarinda had not conſented, if ſhe would
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:046224_0054_1020FD51A49D5638"/>
have applied for a <hi>licence</hi> which would not have been refuſed her, inſtead of bands, nothing could have added to her triumph. But ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed that time in affected delicacy, which ought to have been employed in a more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial affair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe let fortune ſlip out of her hands, while ſhe was contemplating it.</p>
               <p>This news was not long in ſpreading all over the place. Dorantes's former friends, ſhocked at an example which might have a contagious influence, endeavoured to diſſuade him from the match.</p>
               <p>This was no proper time for truth to be heard; always prejudiced with his own ideas, he ſhut his heart to her whiſpers; he was approaching towards a precipice; his feet tottered upon the brink of an abyſs.</p>
               <p>Dorantes, now became the jeſt of the town, and valuing himſelf more for that very reaſon, was to have been married in a week's time. Happily for him, Clarinda, who was near the end of her labours, and held the palm in her hand, grew tired of a diſſimulation which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of no farther uſe, and which is always difficult to ſupport. Dorantes ſaw, as well as the reſt of the town, that he was her dupe, and that ſhe treated him more like a huſband than a lover.</p>
               <p>It may be thought incredible, that ſhe could not have held out one week longer. They who think ſo, forget conqueſt infatuates, and that no one is nearer a fall, than he who has arrived at the ſummit of grandeur; but even they ſhould have reaſon on their ſide, yet I cannot ſacrifice the truth of hiſtory to the falſe delicacy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He compared what he ſaw now, to what he had ſeen, and to what he had heard. Scarcely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked from a long lethargy, and freed from il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, he had recourſe to his friends and owned for once in his life, that advice was neceſſary.

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe his feelings, Thoſe who have experienced ſuch diſagreeable ſituations, can conceive them well enough, while others cannot form any idea of them. The image of Cloe revived in his imagination; he thought he had offended her too groſsly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her eſteem, or expect her forgiveneſs. Fluctuating thus between love, which attracted him to her, and ſhame, which kept him at a diſtance from her, he was informed that ſhe was gone off with another man. The manner in which this event was deſcribed, was ſomewhat remarkable. The ladies who gave this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were no great friends to Cloe, becauſe ſhe eclipſed them. They ſaid, "they ſaw her by herſelf in a loneſome place; after which they ſaw a gentleman accoſt her, who led her away." All this was true; but they ſhould have added, that Cloe proſtrated herſelf at the gentleman's feet and was bathed in tears. But the eye of jealouſy can perceive nothing but what flatters its wiſhes.</p>
               <p>When this anecdote tranſpired, Cloe was vindicated by ſome; others ſaid, that this event gave them no ſurprize, as it was ſuitable to her

character, and ſome, who were more bold, ſaid they foreſaw it. Dorantes was determined to ſearch this affair to the bottom, and to ſnatch Cloe from her troubles; for her virtue was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſpected by him. But he knew not what courſe to take. After many a tedious enquiry, he diſcovered that a veſſel had lately failed from Dieppe, for the iſland of Jerſey, having on board a young lady who was very handſome; who no one was permitted to ſee, and that ſhe was a prey to grief. With this glimpſe of light, he ſet out; no ſacrifices are too great to one who would be a protector of female honour, and is deſirous of delivering his miſtreſs, and meriting her love. He landed. Heavens! what a ſight! He met Medor conducting Cloe to church.</p>
               <p>"Condeſcend, ſaid Medor to him, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the union of two lovers, who are going to vow an inceſſant fidelity to each other." The prieſt was ready, and going to begin the ceremony, when Cloe cried—"Stop! Stop! do not be guilty of ſacrilege; deliver me from his impious hands! Oh, deliver me!"— At this criſis Dorantes diſcovered himſelf; the thunderbolt which ſtrikes a perſon dead in the middle of a feaſt, could not cauſe a greater aſtoniſhment.

               <p>I am the ſon of a younger brother of a good family, who at his deceaſe left me a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a hundred pounds a year. I was put early to Eton ſchool, where I learnt Latin and Greek, from whence I went to the univerſity, where I learnt—not totally to forget them. I came to my fortune while I was at college; and having no inclination to follow any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I removed myſelf to town, and lived for ſome time as moſt young gentleman do, by ſpending four times my income. But it was my happineſs, before it was too late, to fall in love,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:046224_0058_1020FD5CAF36C2F0"/>
and to marry a very amiable young creature, whoſe fortune was juſt ſufficient to repair the breach made in my own. With this agreeable companion I retreated to the country, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured as well as I was able to ſquare my wiſhes to my circumſtances. In this endeavour I ſucceeded ſo well, that except a few private hankerings after a little more than I poſſeſſed, and now and then a ſigh when a coach and ſix happened to drive by me in my walks, I was a very happy man.</p>
               <p>I can truly aſſure you, that though our family economy was not much to be boaſted of, and, in conſequence of it, we were frequently driven to great ſtraits and difficulties, I experienced more real ſatisfaction in this humble ſituation, than I have ever done ſince in more enviable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. We were ſometimes indeed a little in debt, but when money came in, the pleaſure of diſcharging what we owed was more than equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for the pain it put us to; and though the narrowneſs of our circumſtances ſubjected us to many cares &amp; anxieties, it ſerved to keep the body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

elſe to think of, are almoſt inſupportable, were leſs terrible to us than to perſons in eaſier circumſtances: for it is certain truth, however your readers may pleaſe to receive it, that where the mind is divided between many cares, the anxiety is lighter than where there is only one to contend with. Or even in the happieſt ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the midſt of eaſe, health, and affluence, the mind is generally ingenious at tormenting itſelf, loſing the immediate enjoyment of thoſe invaluable bleſſings by the painful ſuggeſtion that they are too great for continuance.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reflections that I have made ſince: for I do not attempt to deny that I ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frequently for an addition to my fortune. The death of a diſtant relation, which happened five years after our marriage, gave me this addition, and made me for a time the happieſt man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. My income was now increaſed to ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a year; and I hoped, with a little econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to be able to make a figure with it. But the ill health of my wife, which in leſs eaſy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had not touched me ſo nearly, was now conſtantly in my thoughts, and ſoured all my enjoyments. The conſciouſneſs too of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an eſtate to leave my boy made me ſo anxious to preſerve him, that inſtead of ſuffering him to run at pleaſure where he pleaſed, and to grow hardy by exerciſe, I almoſt deſtroyed him by confinement.

prudence to foreſee nor courage to prevent. For as it enabled us to extend the circuit of our viſits, it greatly increaſed our acquaintance, and ſubjected us to the neceſſity of making continual entertainments at home, in return for all thoſe which we were invited to abroad. The charges that attended this new manner of living were much too great for the income we poſſeſſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that we found ourſelves in a very ſhort time more neceſſitous than ever. Pride would not ſuffer us to lay down our equipage; and to live in a manner unſuitable to it was what we could not bear to think of. To pay the debts I had contracted I was ſoon forced to mortgage, and at laſt to ſell the beſt part of my eſtate; and as it was utterly impoſſible to keep up the parade any longer, we thought it adviſable to remove of a ſudden, to ſell our coach in town, and to look out for a new ſituation at a great diſtance from our acquaintance.</p>
               <p>But unfortunately for my peace, I carried the habit of expenſe along with me, and was very near being reduced to abſolute want, when, by the unexpected death of an uncle and his two ſons, who died within a few weeks of each other, I ſucceeded to an eſtate of ſeven thouſand pounds a year.</p>
               <p>And now, both you and your readers will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly call me a very happy man: and ſo indeed I was. I ſet about the regulation of my family with the moſt pleaſing ſatisfaction. The ſplendour of my equipages, the magnificence of my plate, the crowd of ſervants that attended me, the elegance of my houſe and furniture, the grandeur of my park and gardens, the luxury of my table, and the court that was every where
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:046224_0061_1020FD62D5410270"/>
paid me, gave me inexpreſſible delight, ſo long as they were novelties; but no ſooner were they become habitual to me than I loſt all manner of reliſh for them; and I diſcovered, in a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, that by having nothing to wiſh for, I had nothing to enjoy. My appetite grew pallid by ſatiety, a perpetual crowd of viſitors robbed me of all domeſtic enjoyment, my ſervants pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued me, and my ſteward cheated me.</p>
               <p>But the curſe of greatneſs did not end here. Daily experience convinced me that I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to live more for others than myſelf. My uncle had been a great party man, and a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous oppoſer of all miniſterial meaſures; and as his eſtate was the largeſt of any gentleman's in the country, he ſupported an intereſt in it beyond any of his competitors. My father had been greatly obliged by the court party, which determined me in gratitude to declare myſelf on that ſide; but the difficulties I had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter were too many and to great for me; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that I have been baffled and defeated in almoſt every thing I have undertaken. To deſert the cauſe I have embarked in would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace me, and to go greater lengths in it would undo me. I am engaged in a perpetual ſtate of warfare with the principal gentry of the county, and am curſed by my tenants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants for compelling them at every election to vote (as they are pleaſed to tell me) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their conſcience.</p>

               <p>This, Sir, is my hiſtory; and if you give it a place in your paper, it may ſerve to inculcate this important truth, that where pain, ſickneſs, and abſolute want, are out of the queſtion, no external change of circumſtances can make a man more laſtingly happy than he was before. It is to an ignorance of this truth that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal diſſatisfaction of mankind is principally to be aſcribed. Care is the lot of life; and he that aſpires to greatneſs in hopes to get rid of it, is like one who throws himſelf into a furnace to avoid the ſhivering of an ague.</p>
               <p>The only ſatisfaction I can enjoy in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation is, that it has not pleaſed heaven in its wrath to make me a King.</p>

and much altered, I ſhould never have recollected, had it not been for the information of a fine old coat, in which I remembered him to have made a figure about town many years ago. After the uſual civilities had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, amongſt many other queſtions, he aſked me when I had ſeen our old ſchool fellow, Sir John Jolly. I anſwered, that I had laſt ſummer ſpent ſome days with him at his country ſeat, in a manner which would have been high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to a perſon of more faſhionable turn, but was to me rather fatiguing, from its exceſs of gaiety and hoſpitality, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my unpolite taſte, were by no means conſiſtent with the ſoft and ſerious pleaſures of a rural retirement. He ſaid, he perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with me in my ſentiments, and paſſed his time in the country in conformity to them: his manner of life, he was ſure, would exactly ſuit me, and obligingly begged I would make the experiment, adding, that he ſhould go down in a few days, and would carry me with him in his chariot. I accepted his invitation, not ſo much out of inclination as curioſity to ſee a new ſcene of country life, formed on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo oppoſite to what I had before experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, and promiſed to attend him at the time appointed.</p>
               <p>But, firſt, it will be proper to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the birth, parentage, and education of my friend. He came young to his title and a ſmall eſtate, and was ſoon after ſent to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; where his title abſurdly giving him the rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

of grandeur, and a pert kind of ſelf-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which he has ever ſince retained, and which neither poverty nor ſolitude has been yet able to conquer. Having in two or three years acquired the advantages of that ſort of education, ſuch as the arts of ſporting, toaſting, billiards, and coach-manſhip, he came to London, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the gay world, and had addreſs and qualifications ſufficient to introduce himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what he ſtill calls the beſt company; that is, the company of ſmarts, bucks, jockeys, and gameſters: nor was he deficient in point of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; for he ſoon commenced an intrigue with the ſiſter of one of theſe his friends. Whether his intentions were at firſt honourable is not perfectly clear; but he was quickly obliged to declare them ſo, being acquainted, that a lady of her rank was not to be trifled with, and that he muſt either fight or marry! the latter of which he courageouſly choſe, as being the moſt daring action of the two. This lady had more gentility than beauty, more beauty than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, more underſtanding than fortune, and a fortune about equal to her reputation. She was tall and well-ſhaped, carried her head very high, and, being the younger daughter of the younger ſon of the firſt couſin of an Iriſh baron, looked upon herſelf as a woman of quality.

town air would not agree with them, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to their country ſeat, about forty miles from London; whither I ſhall now conduct my reader.</p>
               <p>On the morning appointed I attended early at their lodgings in town, where I found the poſt chariot at the door, and my friend ſtanding by it, with a long whip in his hand, ready to mount the box; ſaying, at the ſame time, that coach-men were ſuch inſolent and expenſive raſcals there was no keeping them; and that therefore he always choſe to be his own. In the parlour ſat my lady, and colonel Macſhane; a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had long been very intimate with Sir Harry, and not leſs ſo with her ladyſhip; and in the paſſage ſtood her French woman, in a ſack and long ruffles, with her arms full of band-boxes and bundles; which were no ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of in various parts of the chariot, than my lady and myſelf, with her woman on a low ſtool at our feet, were ſtuffed into the little room that was left. Sir Harry mounted the box, his valet de chambre rode by, and a ſniveling foot-boy climbed up behind. Thus the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with their baggage, and myſelf into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, were conveyed without the expenſe of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtage-coach or a waggon.</p>
               <p>Nothing paſſed during our journey worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating. Her ladyſhip ſpoke little, and that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was only complaints of her bad nerves and her ill ſtate of health; to which, having no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a fee, I paid little attention. They both declared that nobody but a carrier could dine at an inn, therefore they never ſtopped on the road; ſo with the aſſiſtance of a freſh pair of horſes, that had come twenty miles that
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:046224_0066_1020FD71CF9C42F8"/>
morning without a bait, about ſun-ſet we arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at our journey's end. The colonel got there before us, having rode poſt: for Sir Harry fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently declared to us both, that though his friends were welcome, he never entertained their horſes; that it was not the faſhion in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; neither my Lord —, nor the Duke of —, nor himſelf, did it.</p>
               <p>It was not long before the dinner made its appearance; which was ſo very genteel, that had it not been rendered uneatable by a bad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of French cookery, it would not have been half ſufficient, after ſo many miles travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſo long faſting. At the concluſion, we had mead, which paſſed for to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay; and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wine, which Sir Harry ſwore was the beſt Burgundy in England, and that he himſelf had imported it, in conjunction with a noble lord in the neighbourhood. Over a glaſs of this, the cloth being removed, he informed us that when the ſmoke of London, and the bad hours inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to keeping good company, would no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er agree with his own or his wife's conſtitution, he had determined to ſeek health and quiet in an elegant retirement. He had been offered, indeed, a ſeat in parliament, and a conſiderable employment; but his crazy conſtitution would not permit him to accept of the one, nor his ſound principles of the other.— Retirement was their object, therefore all they dreaded was the horrible irruptions of a country neighbourhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this they had happily prevented.—That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, on their firſt coming, every family within ten miles round tormented them with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent viſits; but they returned none, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted them all, and ſo got rid of them.

you think we did right, my dear? turning to his wife. I think, anſwered ſhe, in a ſurly and dejected voice, that it is better to forget the uſe of one's tongue than to converſe with ſquires' wives and parſons' daughters. You are right, Madam, added the Colonel, with an oath and a loud laugh; for what can one learn in ſuch company? To-morrow, ſays my friend, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to me, you ſhall ſee that we want no company, and that we can ſufficiently amuſe ourſelves with building and planting, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and alterations, which I dare ſay will be honoured with your approbation.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the next morning, as ſoon as breakfaſt was finiſhed, my lady and the Colonel retired into her dreſſing room to cribbage, and Sir Harry and myſelf to reconnoitre the place. The houſe ſtands at the end of a dirty village, and cloſe by it are a few tame deer impounded in an orchard, to which he gives the pompous title of a park. Behind is a fen, which he calls a piece of water, and before it a gooſe common, on which he beſtows the name of a lawn. It was built in that deplorable aera of Engliſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, which introduced high doors, long windows, ſmall rooms, and corner chimnies; and of gardening, which projected gravel walks, clipt yews, and ſtrait lined avenues, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of brick walls, iron palliſadoes, and leaden images. But all theſe defects, and many others, he has now corrected by a judicious application of modern taſte. His doors are reduced, you cannot enter with your hat on; and his windows ſo contracted, that you have ſcarce light enough to find it if you will pull it off.

I began now to wiſh for a little of my friend Sir John's hoſpitality, of which there was not here the leaſt appearance.

There was not a neighbor near, except the parſon of the pariſh, and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Grab, a rich citizen, who had purchaſed a conſiderable part of it from Sir Harry.

               <p>HAVING been frequently preſſed by Sir John Jolly (an old friend of mine, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a ſine eſtate, a large park, and a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fortune) to paſs a few weeks with him in the country, I determined laſt autumn to accept his invitation, propoſing to myſelf the higheſt pleaſure from changing the noiſe and hurry of this buſtling metropolis for the agreeable ſilence and ſoothing indolence of a rural retirement. I accordingly ſet out one morning, and pretty early the next arrived at the habitation of my friend, ſituated in a moſt delicious and roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſpot, which (the owner having fortunately no taſte) is not yet defaced with improvements. On my approach I abated a little of my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling pace, to look round me, and admire the towering hills and fertile vales, the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreams, the ſtately woods and ſpacious
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:046224_0071_1020FD7F1FDC4000"/>

               <p>I was received with a hearty welcome, and many ſhakes by the hand, by my old friend, whom I had not ſeen for many years, except once, when he was called to town, by a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the King's Bench, for miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of an act of parliament, which on examination, was found to be nonſenſe. He is an honeſt gentleman, of a middle age, a hale conſtitution, good natural parts, and abundant ſpirits, a keen ſportſman, an active magiſtrate, and a tolerable farmer, not without ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of acquiring a ſeat in parliament by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in a neighbouring borough: ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his purſuits of game, of juſtice, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, beſides the management of a large quantity of land, which he keeps in his own hands, as he terms it, for amuſement, every moment of his time is ſufficiently employed. His wife is an agreeable woman, of about the ſame age, and has been handſome; but though years have ſomewhat impaired her charms, they have not in the leaſt, her reliſh for company, cards, balls, and all other manner of public di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs of the apartment ſhe was obliged to allot me, by reaſon "the houſe was ſo crouded with company during the time of their races, which, ſhe ſaid, began that very day for the whole week, and for which they were immediately prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." I was inſtantly attacked by all preſent with one voice, or rather with many voices at the ſame time, to accompany them thither; to which I made no oppoſition, thinking it would be attended with more trouble than the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition itſelf.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the ladies and equipages were ready we iſſued forth in a moſt magnificent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade; and after travelling five or ſix miles through bad roads, we arrived at the Red Lion, juſt as the ordinary was making its appearance on the table. The ceremonials of this ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous entertainment, which conſiſted of cold fiſh, lean chickens, ruſty hams, raw veniſon, ſtale game, green fruit, and grapeleſs wines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed at leaſt two hours, with five times that number of heads, ruffles, and ſuits of clothes, by the unfortunate effuſion of butter and gravy.

               <p>Being at laſt equipped, I entered the ball<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, where the ſmell of a ſtable over which it was built, the ſavour of a neighbouring kitchen, the fumes of tallow candles, rum punch, and tobacco, diſperſed over the whole houſe, and the balſamic effluvias from many ſweet creatures who were dancing, with almoſt equal ſtrength contended for ſuperiority. The company was numerous and well-dreſſed, and differed not in any reſpect from that of the moſt brilliant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in London, but in ſeeming better pleaſed, and more deſirous of pleaſing; that is happier in themſelves, and civiller to each other. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the door was blocked up the whole night by a few faſhionable young men, whoſe faces I remembered to have ſeen about town, who could neither dance, drink tea, play at cards, nor ſpeak to any one, except now-and-then in whiſpers to a young lady, who ſat in ſilence at the upper end of the room in a hat and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee, with her back againſt the wall, her arms a kimbo, her legs thruſt out, a ſneer on her lips, a ſcowl on her forehead, and an invincible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in her eyes.

Dancing and cards, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of cold chickens and negas about twelve, carried us on till day-break, when our coaches being ready, with much ſolicitation and more ſqueezing, I obtained a place in one, in which no more than ſix had before artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated themſelves; and about five in the morning through many and great perils, we arrived ſafely at home,</p>

I mean not in this number to include myſelf; for though I hurried immediately to bed, no reſt could I obtain for ſome time, for the rumbling of carts, and the converſation of their drivers juſt under my window. Fatigue at laſt got the better of all obſtacles, and I fell aſleep; but I had ſcarce cloſed my eyes, when I was awaked by a much louder noiſe, which was that of a whole pack of hounds, with their vociferous attendants, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out to meet my friend, and ſome choice ſpirits, whom he had juſt left behind at the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and who choſe this manner of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after a night's debauch rather than the more uſual and inglorious one of going to bed.

It being now towards noon, I gave up all thoughts of ſleep, and it was well I did; for I was preſently alarmed by a confuſion of voices, as loud though ſomewhat ſweeter than the former.

of it, Sir John obligingly requeſted me to make my ſtay with him as long as I poſſibly could, aſſuring me, that though the races were now over I ſhould not want diverſions; for that next week he expected Lord Rattle, Sir Harry Bumper, and a large fox-hunting party; and that the week after, being the full moon he ſhould pay and receive all their neighbouring viſits, and ſpend their evenings very ſociably together; by which is ſignified, in the country dialect, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, and playing at cards all night. My Lady added with a ſmile, and much delight in her eyes, that ſhe believed they ſhould not be alone one hour in the whole week, and that ſhe hoped I ſhould not think the country ſo dull and melancholy a place as I expected. Upon this information I reſolved to leave it immediately, and told them, I was extremely ſorry that I was hindered by particular buſineſs from any longer enjoying ſo much polite and agreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but that I had received a letter, which made it neceſſary for me to be in Town. My friend ſaid, he was no leſs concerned; but that I muſt not poſitively go till after to-morrow: for that he then expected the mayor and aldermen of his corporation, ſome of whom were facetious companions, and ſung well. This determined me to ſet out that very evening: which I did with much ſatisfaction; and made all poſſible haſte, in ſearch of ſilence and ſolitude, to my lodging, next door to a braſier's at Charing-croſs.</p>

               <p>The next morning, as I was reading a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper in the coffee-room, I heard a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a very modeſt and decent appearance, inquiring at the bar for the Reverend Mr. W. B. I told him that I was the perſon, and calling for a couple of diſhes of coffee, we ſat down togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and entered upon the ſubject of the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He aſſured me, that if his friends did not flatter him, he was a very agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; that he had buſineſs of conſequence to tranſact at Edinburgh; that he was particularly pleaſed to find, by the advertiſement, that I was a clergyman, having a great veneration for gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that function; that he had entertained thoughts of becoming one himſelf, was a near relation of the Biſhop of—, and though young, as he appeared, he was never ſo happy at when engaged in ſerious converſation with a worthy divine. He was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:046224_0080_1020FD93F17A4E38"/>
in the end, it was agreed that we ſhould ſet out that very evening at ſix o'clock. He was punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to his appointment, with a ſervant on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, leading a handſome gelding for his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who with two young gentleman, his friends, were waiting for me at the inn. I could not help obſerving, while the chaiſe was getting ready, that theſe young gentlemen were taking a good deal of pains to ſtifle a laugh, which, on our ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the carriage, they were no longer able to contain: but I made no remarks upon their behaviour, and we ſet out upon our journey.</p>
               <p>We reached Ware that night, without any thing happening worthy of remark, except that we were ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Z—ds Jack! what playing the ſaint, and travelling to heaven with a parſon!</q>
My fellow traveller gave them a look of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and after aſſuring them that he had not the honour of knowing them, and pulling up the glaſs, ordered the poſſition to drive on.</p>

I ſlept longer than uſual in the morning, and no ſooner was I awake than I diſcovered, with equal confuſion and ſurpriſe, that I was in bed with a woman who, as I attempted to get up, threw her arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:046224_0081_1020FD96E71F7CD8"/>
who ſtill held me faſt, alarmed the whole inn, and drew a crowd of ſpectators into the room headed by my companion, and followed by a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who owned himſelf the huſband of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſwearing that he would have my heart's blood for currupting the chaſtity of his wife. I pleaded my innocence to an unbelieving audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the woman accuſed me of having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her againſt her will; pretending that it was her misfortune overnight to be a little in liquor, and that ſhe had miſtaken the room I lay in for her own.</p>
               <p>To dwell no longer than is needful upon this diſgraceful affair, I was in the end compelled to give a guinea to the ſoldier, and afterwards to ſubmit with patience to the inſults of a mob, who ſurrounded the inn at our entrance into the poſt-chaiſe, and followed it with hootings to the very extremity of the town.</p>
               <p>From the paſſive behaviour of my companion at the inn, and the demure looks that he now put on, I began to harbour a ſuſpicion of him not greatly to his advantage: and while I was deliberating in what manner to addreſs him, an accident happened, which at once threw him off his guard, and diſcovered to me, that inſtead of an agreeable companion I was travelling with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>end. This accident was the ſudden and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent overturning of the poſt-chaiſe; upon which occaſion, though neither of us was hurt, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged ſuch a volley of curſes on the poſtillion as made me tremble to hear him. I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pacify him by the gentleſt admonitions, which inſtead of calming his anger, turned it all upon myſelf; and amidſt a thouſand oaths and imprecations, he vowed revenge upon my head,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:046224_0082_1020FD9977DD8380"/>
telling me that he hated a parſon as he hated Old Nic; that he had bribed the ſoldier's whore to go to bed to me at the inn, and that he came out upon no other buſineſs than to play the devil with me all the way. I ſtood aghaſt at what I heard, and refuſed getting into the chaiſe again; upon which a ſtruggle enſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>We had ſcarce travelled a mile before we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a couple of gypſies upon the road; one an old woman, the other a girl. They were all over rags and filth, and ſo intoxicated with liquor that they reeled every ſtep. My companion cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the poſtillion to ſtop, and after queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe wretches about the way they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, got out of the chaiſe, and told me that he could not in charity fit lolling at his eaſe while two of the tender ſex were walking barefoot on the road; and that if I had no weighty objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he would make the old lady an offer of his ſeat, and miſs, as he was pleaſed to call her, might with great conveniency ſit upon my knee. It was in vain fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> me to expoſtulate, or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt leaping after him: his ſervant held me faſt by the arm, handed the creatures into the chaiſe, and then mounting his horſe, rode cloſe by its ſide, talking obſcenity to the wretches, and inſtructing them to behave to me in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not to be endured nor deſcribed.</p>
               <p>In this manner we paſſed through the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and entered Royſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:046224_0083_1020FD9B10E3AB60"/>
that we might be followed by a mob whom my companion called to at every turning to ſmoke the parſon and his doxies.</p>
               <p>I ſtept from the chaiſe amidſt the hallooing of the rabble and ran into the room, the door of which I locked. Here I determined to remain, or to fly to the magiſtrate for protection had not my tormentor made his appearance at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, telling me, that as the joke was now at an end, and as he believed I had enough of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able companion, he had altered his intention of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting Scotland, and ſhould return to town that morning. I thanked him for the favour, but kept cloſe to my room, till I ſaw him with his ſervant ride out of the inn, and take the road to London. I then ordered ſome refreſhm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As it was no doubt with me, that the gypſies had robbed me, I made immediate inquiry after them, but learnt that they had diſappeared on our arrival at the inn; and though the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch was made for them, they were no where to be found.</p>
               <p>It was now impoſſible for me to proceed; I therefore determined to ſtay where I was till I could receive a freſh ſupply from my wife, to whom I diſpatched a meſſenger with a letter, ſetting forth at large all the cruelties I had met with.</p>
               <p>When the meſſenger was gone, it occurred to me, that however i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this reaſon I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined once more to tranſmit my complaints to you: that if the young gentleman has any one principle of honour remaining, he may ſend to your houſe the ſum I have been defrauded of. My demand upon him is for the ſum of ſeven and thirty guineas, which unleſs he pays within ſix days after the publication of this letter, I will forthwith print his name in the newſpapers, and proclaim to the public the injuries he has done me.</p>
               <p>I have another reaſon for giving you this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is, to caution all gentlemen for the future againſt advertiſing in the papers for an agreeable companion in a poſt chaiſe; as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoles me not a little that I am enabled to make other people wiſe, even by my own misfortunes.</p>

I ſhall prove it to be forged, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently null and void to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes whatſoever.</p>
               <p>If I loved to jingle, I would ſay, that human nature has always been invariably the ſame, though always varying; that is, the ſame in ſubſtance, but varying in forms and modes, from many concurrent cauſes, of which, perhaps we know but few. Climate, education, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſeverally contribute to change thoſe modes; but in all climates, and in all ages, we diſcover through them the ſame paſſions, affections, and appetites, and the ſame degree of virtues and vices.</p>
               <p>This being unqueſtionably the true ſtate of the caſe, which it would be endleſs to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to prove from the hiſtories of all times and of all nations, I ſhall by the way of warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the incautious, and of reproof to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, proceed to explain the reaſons, which I have but juſt hinted at above, why the human nature of the time being, has always been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the worſt and moſt degenerate.</p>
               <p>Authors, eſpecially poets, though great men, are alas! but men; and like other men, ſubject to the weakneſſes of human nature, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in a leſs degree: but it is however cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that their breaſts are not abſolutely ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the paſſions of jealouſy, pride, and envy. Hence it is that they are very apt to meaſure merit by the century, to love dead authors bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than living ones, and to love them the better
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:046224_0087_1020FDA818BD5FC0"/>
the longer they have been dead. The Auguſtan age is therefore their favourite aera, being at leaſt ſeventeen hundred years diſtant from the preſent. That Emperor was not only a judge of wit, but, for an emperor, a tolerable perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer too; and Maecenas, his firſt miniſter, was both a patron and a poet: he not only encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged and protected, but fed and fattened men of wit at his own table, as appears from Horace: no ſmall encouragement for panegyric. Theſe were times indeed for genius to diſplay itſelf in! It was honoured, taſted, and rewarded. But now—<hi>O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

interruption; but, recompoſing himſelf, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that cool contempt that becomes a great man,
<q>I did not mean aſtronomical days, but political ones.</q>
The young fellow replied, "O then, Sir, I am your ſervant," and went off in a laugh.</p>
               <p>Thus informed and edified I went off too, but could not help reflecting on my way upon the ſingular ill luck of this my dear country, which, as long as ever I remember it, and as far back as I have read, has always been governed by the only two or three people, out of two or three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, totally incapable of governing, and unfit to be truſted. But theſe reflections were ſoon interrupted by numbers of people, whom I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved crowding into a public houſe. Among them I diſcovered my worthy friend and tailor, that induſtrious mechanic, Mr. Regnier. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him to know the meaning of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: to which, with his uſual humanity, he anſwered,
<q>We are the maſter tailors, who are to meet to-night to conſider what is to be done about our journeymen, who inſult and impoſe upon us, to the great detriment of the trade.</q>
I aſked him whether, under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, I might ſlip in and hear their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He ſaid, Yes, and welcome; for that they ſhould do nothing to be aſhamed of. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited of this permiſſion, and following him into the room, found a conſiderable number of theſe ingenious artiſts aſſembled, and waiting only for the arrival of my friend, who it ſeems was too conſiderable for buſineſs to begin without him. He accordingly took the lead, opened the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a very handſome ſpeech, in which he gave many inſtances of the inſolence, the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:046224_0090_1020FDB105841430"/>
and the exorbitant demands of the journeymen tailors, and concluded with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <q>that if the government minded any thing now-a-days but themſelves, ſuch abuſes would not have been ſuffered; and had they been but attempted in Queen Elizabeth's days, ſhe would have worked them with a witneſs.</q>
Another orator then roſe up to ſpeak; but as I was ſure that he could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than what had juſt fallen from my worthy friend, I ſtole off unobſerved and was purſuing my way home, when, in the very next ſtreet, I diſcovered a much greater number of people (though, by their dreſs, of ſeemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior note) ruſhing into another public houſe. As numbers always excite my curioſity almoſt as much as they mutually do each others paſſions, I crowded in with them, in order to diſcover the object of this meeting, not without ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that this frequent ſenate might be compoſed of the journeymen tailors, and convened in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that which I had juſt left. My ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion was ſoon confirmed by the eloquence of a journeyman, a finiſher, I preſume, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated with equal warmth and dignity upon the injuſtice and oppreſſion of the maſter tailors, to the utter ruin of thouſands of poor journeymen and their families; and concluded with aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>It was a ſhame that the government and the parliament did not take notice of ſuch abuſes; and that had the maſter tailors done theſe things in Queen Elizabeth's days, ſhe would have maſtered them with a vengeance, ſo ſhe would.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs I could not help ſmiling at this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conformity of ſentiments, and almoſt of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:046224_0091_1020FDB2C48C1BB8"/>
expreſſions, of the maſter politicians, the maſter tailors, and the journeymen tailors. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the two latter really and honeſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what they ſaid, it not being in the leaſt improbable that their underſtandings ſhould be the dupes of their intereſt: but I will not ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily anſwer for the interior conviction of the political orator; though, at the ſame time, I muſt do him the juſtice to ſay, he ſeemed full dull enough to be very much in earneſt.</p>

From theſe ſtudies I contracted an
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:046224_0092_1020FDB52B8962C0"/>
early taſte for gallantry; and as nothing pleaſed me ſo much as the comedies of the laſt age, my thoughts were conſtantly engroſſed with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable ſituation of the heroes of thoſe pieces Your Dotimants and your Homers ſtruck my imagination beyond the brighteſt characters in Pope; and though I liked the gallantry of fighting ten years for a woman, yet I tho't the Greeks might have found a readier way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves amends, by viſiting their friends at Troy and taking revenge in kind. Such were the exploits to command my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch the examples which I looked up to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having manifeſt advantages of perſon, I entertained moſt extravagant conceits of my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture triumphs. Yet even in the height of thoſe extravagancies I had no hope of obtaining every favour that I ſolicited; much leſs ſhould I have been perſuaded that ſuch uncommon ſucceſs could be productive of any thing but conſummate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The hiſtory of my life will prove the contrary; and I chuſe to record it, with a view of ſhowing what a ſucceſſion of trouble, diſtreſs and miſery, aroſe from the very completion of my deſires.</p>
               <p>I was precipitately ſent to Oxford, on being diſcovered in an intrigue with a young girl, whom my tutor had lately married, and who had a prior attachment to me. As my love for her was exceſſive, this ſeparation was inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly painful; and I learned from it, that paſt joys were no conſolation for preſent diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I found the univerſity life to little ſuited to my taſte, that I ſoon prevailed upon my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to let me come to London. Before I had been a week in town I was introduced to a young
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:046224_0093_1020FDBA27D53460"/>
woman, whom I took ſo great a fancy to, that the very violence of my paſſion made me deſpair of ſucceſs. I was, however, ſo agreeably diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that I could ſcarce conceal the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy which poſſeſſion gave me: but this joy was more than balanced, when at the end of ſome months I was told of the condition into which this kind creature was brought by her compliance with my deſires. My anxiety upon this event was too great to be reſtrained; and honour, which alone had ſtopt the overflowings of my joy, prompted me to give a looſe to my concern. I bewailed with remorſe and tears the ſhame and miſery of deluded innocence, and curſed myſelf as the author of ſo much ruin and infamy. I ſpared no expenſe to render her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſituation as comfortable as it could be made, and ſhut myſelf up with her till the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected time of her delivery. That fatal hour infinitely increaſed our mutual ſhame, by giving birth to a little negro, which though it deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at once from the pangs of conſcience, put me to an immoderate expenſe in bribes to the nurſes to keep the ſecret of my diſgrace.</p>
               <p>This unlucky adventure had almoſt ſpoiled me for a man of gallantry; but I ſoon loſt all remembrance of ill uſage in the innocent ſmiles and gentle ſweetneſs of a young lady, who gave me every mark of tender love and conſtancy. Our mutual fondneſs made it impoſſible for us to bear that ſeparation which diſcretion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as ſhe gave up all her acquaintance for my ſake, ſhe ſoon found herſelf abandoned by them; ſo that our conſtant living together, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had been choice, was now become an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity This confinement, though it did
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:046224_0094_1020FDBCB95F2240"/>
not abate, but, if poſſible, increaſe my tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had ſo different an effect upon her temper, as to cauſe a total change of behaviour to me and all about her: ſhe ſtormed day and night, like a fury, and did every thing to drive me from her company; yet if ever I went from her upon the moſt urgent buſineſs, ſhe would throw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into fits, and upbraid me with the moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproaches. On my being ſent for to attend my mother in her laſt moments, ſhe threatened, with horrid imprecations, that, if I left her then I ſhould never ſee her more. I had ſcarce broke from her menaces when ſhe flew from her lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in an agony of paſſion, and has not been heard of ſince.</p>
               <p>Soon after the death of my mother, a lady of quality who viſited her, and who had caſt an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious eye upon her diamonds, which were not contemptible, took occaſion to make ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards me. Whenever we met, her diſcourſe always turned upon the great merits of my mother, and the taſte which ſhe ſhowed in the choice and manner of wearing her jewels; and this converſation as conſtantly ended in an aſſignation at her houſe. Though I was at firſt a little proud to find my preſents meet ſo ready an acceptance, I was not exceedingly flattered in the progreſs of this amour; eſpecially when I began to perceive that the ſtrongeſt recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation I had to her favour was growing weaker every day. I found alſo that a declaration which I had made of not loving cards did not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to ſtrengthen my intereſt in that family.</p>
               <p>My next affair was with a lady who was really fond of me, and I thought myſelf, then, at the height of my wiſhes; for ſhe managed ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:046224_0095_1020FDBFB7D073C0"/>
that we had not the leaſt interruption from her huſband at home: but her conduct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad was a perpetual ſcene of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She would carry me to the moſt frequented plays and keep me in a whiſper during the moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting ſcenes. Not ſatisfied with this, ſhe made me walk with her eternally in the Park, the Old Road, and Kenſington gardens; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete her triumph, ſhe dragged me, a miſerable object! about the ſtreets of London, with the ſame pityleſs oſtentation as the inhuman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror trailed the lifeleſs carcaſe of Hector round the walls of Troy. To complete my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, it happened that the <hi>beau monde</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new mode of gallantry, and all knights amorous were required to make love after the new faſhion, and attend their fair on horſeback. Unluckily for me, my mother, not ſuſpecting that horſemanſhip would ever become, here, a requiſite in gallantry, had made it no part of my Engliſh education: therefore, being an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute novice, I procured the quieteſt beaſt that was to be got, and hoped that I was properly mounted: but I ſoon found my miſtake, for the dulneſs of the beaſt tended to bring a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful ſuſpicion on the ſpirit of the rider; and I was obliged, at all events, to undertake a more mettleſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

different way, and as ſhe was no otherwiſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for a rider but by the conſciouſneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a woman of faſhion, ſhe was thrown againſt a tree, and killed on the ſpot. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her fondneſs for me, though ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome while living, was the cauſe of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to me after her death; and it was near a twelvemonth before I ſettled my affections on a new object. This was a young widow, who though ſhe did not give me the ſame occaſion of complaint as the laſt, created me no leſs pain by turning the tables upon me; inſtead of requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my conſtant attendance, ſhe would complain that I haunted and dogged her; and would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſecret herſelf, or run on purpoſe into ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious company, purely to give me uneaſineſs. Though confeſſedly her favourite, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been denied admittance, when the moſt worthleſs pretenders have been let in: and when I have offered her tickets for a concert which ſhe liked, ſhe has refuſed them, and accepted of an invitation to a dull play, with the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable of my rivals. When we have been at the ſame table at cards, ſhe has made it remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole aſſembly that her eyes and her diſcourſe have been induſtriouſly kept from me; and ſuch has been her cruelty, that when I have deſired the honour of walking with her the next morning, ſhe has anſwered with a ſignificant ſneer, ſhe was very ſorry ſhe ſhould not have my company, for ſhe intended to ride. With all this, who could imagine that I was the happy man! and yet, as I ſpared no pains nor coſt in the enquiry, I can venture to pronounce that no other perſon whatever ſhared her favours with me.

To overcome my inveterate preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt the conjugal ſtate, ſo long deſpiſed, inſulted, and injured by me, was the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: but as the thorough detection of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and folly of every degree of gallantry had by no means extinguiſhed my unalterable love for the ſex, I found upon mature reflection, that marriage was my only reſource, and that I ſhould run no great riſk in exchanging the real for the imaginary pains of love.</p>
               <p>Having taken this reſolution. I ſtept into the ridotto, fixed my eyes upon a very engaging fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and immediately advertiſed for the young lady in blue and ſilver, requiring only a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of her good-humour. I went to the coffee-houſe, received a letter for A.

               <head>STORY of AGAMUS.</head>
               <p>TO indulge that reſtleſs impatience, which every man feels to relate incidents by which the paſſions have been greatly effected, and communicate ideas that have been forcibly impreſſed, I have given you ſome account of my life, which, without farther apology or introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may, perhaps, be favourably received in your Book.</p>
               <p>My mother died when I was very young; and my father, who was a naval commander, and had, therefore, no opportunity to ſuperintend my conduct, placed me at a grammar ſchool, and afterwards removed me to the univerſity. At ſchool the number of boys was ſo great, that to regulate our morals was impoſſible; and at the univerſity even my learning contributed to the diſſoluteneſs of my manners. As I was an only child, my father had always allowed me more money than I knew how to lay out, otherwiſe than in the gratification of my vices: I had ſometimes, indeed, been reſtrained by a general ſenſe of right and wrong; but I now oppoſed the remonſtrances of conſcience by the cavils of ſophiſtry; and having learned of ſome celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted philoſophers as well ancient as modern, to prove that nothing is good but pleaſure, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a rake upon principle.</p>
               <p>My father died in the ſame year with Queen Anne, a few months before I became of age, and left me a very conſiderable fortune in the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:046224_0099_1020FDCC39325580"/>
funds. I immediately quitted the univerſity and came to London, which I conſidered as the great mart of pleaſure; and as I could afford to deal largely, I wiſely determined not to endanger my capital. I projected a ſcheme of life that was moſt agreeable to my temper, which was rather ſedate than volatile, and regulated my expences with the oeconomy of a philoſopher. I found that my favorite appetites might be gratified with greater convenience and leſs ſcandal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in proportion as my life was more private: inſtead therefore, of incumbering myſelf with a family, I took the firſt floor of a houſe which was let into lod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace of geldings at a livery ſtable. I conſtantly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the theatres, and found my principles confirmed by almoſt every piece that was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, particularly my reſolution never to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In comedy, indeed, the action terminated in marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it was generally the marriage of a rake, who gave up his liberty with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the only expedient to recover a fortune —and the huſband and wife of the drama were wretches whoſe example juſtified this reluctance, and appeared to be exh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bited for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to warn mankind, that whatever may be preſumed by thoſe whom indigence has made deſperate, to marry is to forfeit the quiet, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and felicity of life.</p>
               <p>In this courſe I had continued twenty years, without having impaired my conſtitution, leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my fortune, or incumbered myſelf with an illegitimate offspring; when a girl about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, was hired as a chambermaid by the perſon who kept the houſe in which I lodged: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beauty of the health and ſimplicity in this young

creature, had ſuch an effect upon my imagination that I practiſed every art to debauch her, and at length ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>I found it convenient for her to continue in the houſe, and therefore, made no propoſal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving her into lodgings, but after a few months ſhe found herſelf with child, a diſcovery which interrupted the indolence of my ſenſuality, and made me repent my indiſcretion: however, as I would not incur my own cenſure by ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or inhumanity, I provided her a lodging and attendants, and ſhe was at length delivered of a daughter. The child I regarded as a new incumbrance; for though I did not conſider myſelf as under parental or conjugal obligations, yet I could not think myſelf at liberty wholly to abandon the mother or the infant. To the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, indeed, I had ſtill ſome degree of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though I ſhould have been heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent never to have ſeen her again, if I could at once have been freed from any farther trouble about her; but as ſomething was to be done, I was willing to keep her within my reach, at leaſt till ſhe could be ſubſervient to my pleaſure no longer: the child, however, I would have ſent away; but ſhe intreated me to let her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle it, with an importunity which I could not reſiſt. After much thinking, I placed her in a little ſhop in the ſuburbs, which I furniſhed, at the expence of about twenty pounds, with chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlery-ware, commodities of which ſhe had ſome knowledge, as her father was a petty ſhop-keeper in the country: ſhe reported that her huſband, had been killed in an engagement at ſea, and that his pay, which ſhe had been empowered to receive by his will, and purchaſed her ſtock. I now thought I had diſcharged every obligation,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:046224_0101_1020FDD102AA4BF8"/>
as I had enabled her to ſubſiſt, at leaſt as well as ſhe could have done by her labour in the ſtation in which I found her; and as often as I had an inclination to ſee her, I ſent for her to a bagnio.</p>
               <p>But theſe interviews did not produce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which I expected: her affection for me was too tender and delicate; ſhe often wept in ſpite of all her efforts againſt it, and could not forbear telling me ſtories of her little girl with the fond prolixity of a mother, when I wiſhed to regard her only as a miſtreſs. Theſe incidents at once touched me with a compunction, and quenched the appetite which I had intended to gratify; my viſits, therefore became leſs frequent; but ſhe never ſent after me when I was abſent, nor reproached me, otherwiſe than by tears of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs when ſhe ſaw me again.</p>
               <p>After the firſt year I wholly neglected her; and having heard nothing of her during the winter, I went to ſpend the ſummer in the country. When I returned, I was prompted rather by curioſity than deſire to make ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after her; and ſoon learnt that ſhe had died ſome months before of the ſmall-pox, that the goods had been ſeized for rent, and the child taken by the pariſh. At this account, ſo ſudden and unexpected, I was ſenſibly touched; and at firſt conceived a deſign to reſcue the child from the hands of a pariſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urſe, and make ſome little proviſion for it when it ſhould be grown up: but this was delayed from day to day; ſuch was the ſupineneſs of my diſpoſition, till the event was remembered with leſs and leſs ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and at length I congratulated myſelf upon my deliverance from an engagement which I had always conſidered as reſembling in ſome degree the ſhackles of matrimony. I reſolved
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:046224_0102_1020FDD3E01EAFD0"/>
to incur the ſame embarraſſment no more, and contented myſelf with ſtrolling from one proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to another, of whom I have ſeen many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations periſh; and the new faces which I once ſought among the maſks in the pit, I found with leſs trouble at Cuper's, Vauxhall, Ranelagh, and innumerable other places of public enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, which have appeared during the laſt twenty years of my life.</p>
               <p>A few weeks ago I celebrated my ſixtieth birth-day with ſome friends at a tavern; and as I was returning to my lodgings, I ſaw a hackney coach ſtop at the door of a houſe which I knew to be of ill repute, though it was private and of the claſs. Juſt as I came up a girl ſtepped out of it, who appeared, by the imperfect glimpſe I caught of her as ſhe paſſed, to be very young, and extremely beautiful. As I was warm with wine, I followed her in without heſitation, and was delighted to find her equally charming upon a nearer view. I detained the coach, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that we ſhould go to Haddock's: ſhe heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with ſome appearance of unwillingneſs and confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at length conſented: ſhe ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more free, and I was not leſs pleaſed with her converſation than her perſon I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſhe had a ſoftneſs and modeſty, in her manners, which is quickly worn off by habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proſtitution.</p>
               <p>We had drank a bottle of French wine, and were preparing to go to bed, when, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable confuſion and aſtoniſhment, I diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a mark by which I knew her to be my child: for I remembered that the poor girl, whom I ſo cruelly ſeduced and neglected, had once told me with tears in her eyes, that ſhe had imprinted the two letters of my name under her little NAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>h I had not been familiar, and, therefore, felt all its force. The poor wretch, whom I was about to hire for the gratification of a brutal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, perceived my diſorder with ſurprize and concern; ſhe enquired with an officious ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what ſudden illneſs had ſeized me; ſhe took my hand, preſſed it, and looked eagerly in my face, ſtill inquiſitive what could be done to relieve me. I remained ſome time torpid: but was ſoon rouzed by the reflection, that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the careſſes of my child, whom I had abandoned to the loweſt infamy, to be the ſlave of drunkeneſs and luſt, and whom I had led to the brink of inceſt, I ſuddenly ſtarted up; firſt held her at a diſtance; then catching her in my arms, ſtrove to ſpeak, but burſt into tears. I ſaw that ſhe was confounded and terrified; and as ſoon as I could recover my ſpeech, I put an end to her doubts by revealing the ſecret.</p>
               <p>If it is impoſſible to expreſs the effect it had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſtood motionleſs a few minutes; then claſped her hands together, and looked up in an agony, which not to have ſeen is not to conceive. The tears at length ſtarted from her eyes; ſhe recollected herſelf, called me father, threw herſelf upon her knees embracing mine, and plunging a new dagger in my heart by aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my bleſſing.</p>
               <p>We ſat up together the remainder of the night, which I ſpent in liſtening to a ſtory that I may, perhaps, hereafter communicate; and the next day I took lodgings for her about ſix miles from town. I viſit her every day with emotions to which my heart has till now been a
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:046224_0104_1020FDDA460002C0"/>
ſtranger, and which are every day more frequent and more ſtrong. I propoſe to retire with her into ſome remote part of the country, and to atone for the paſt by the future: but alas! of the future a few years only can remain; and of the paſt not a moment can return. What atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can I make to thoſe upon whoſe daughters I have contributed to perpetrate that calamity, from which by miracle I have reſcued my own; How can I bear the reflection, that though for my own child I had hitherto expreſſed leſs kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than brutes for their young; yet perhaps, every other whom I either hired or ſeduced to proſtitution, had been gazed at in the ardor of parental affection, till tears have ſtarted to the eye: had been catched to the boſom with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in the prattling ſimplicity of infancy; had been watched in ſickneſs with anxiety that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſleep; had been fed by the toil of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious poverty, and reared to maturity with hope and fear. What a monſter is he, by whom theſe fears are verified, and this hope deceived! And yet, ſo dreadful is the force of habitual guilt, I ſometimes regret the reſtraint which is come upon me; I wiſh to ſink again into the ſlumber from which I have been rouzed, and to repeat the crimes which I abhor. My heart is this moment burſting for utterance: but I want words. Farewell.</p>
