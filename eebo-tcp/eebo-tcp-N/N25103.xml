            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ORATION.</head>
            <p>AFTER the peace of ſeventeen hundred and ſixty-three, the Britiſh miniſtry propoſed to raiſe a revenue by act of Parliament, from their American colonies. The ſum, which, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they determined to raiſe, was indeed ſmall, and not equal to the hazard of a revolution, or the expence of a war; but the people of America ſaw that a violation of principle ought to be reſiſted in the firſt inſtance, and at all hazards; and that, if they once yielded to extortion, there would be no end of demands; and if they once abandoned their right of ſelf-government, there would be no reſtraint on oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Reſiſtance, war, and a revolution enſued. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence countenanced the American cauſe, raiſed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033269_0003_0FF6B2AD2F321B88"/>up to us allies among the rivals and enemies of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the colonies were acknowledged free and independent States.</p>
            <p>But as waves long agitated by the wind do not ſubſide at the moment of the calm, the rancorous paſſions excited by the revolution war were not ſoothed by the peace of 1783; but reciprocally ſtirred in the boſom of Britain and America. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed enmity, a delay of juſtice, and alternate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, were the conſequences. The treaty of peace was not executed on either ſide. <hi>They</hi> complained that they were not permitted to recover their debts. <hi>We,</hi> that we were not permitted to occupy our poſts. Theſe, ſtill maintained by Britiſh garriſons, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the ſale and ſettlement of an extenſive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and if they did not excite and countenance, at leaſt diſabled us from ſuppreſſing, a pernicious and expenſive Indian war.</p>
            <p>During all this time, America regarded France with a gratitude and affection approaching enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. France, next to the courage and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the American people, was regarded as an inſtrument under God of ſecuring American inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. Yet France herſelf never pretended that ſhe engaged in our conteſt from any affection for liberty, or for the United States; but from hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility to Britain and a deſire to weaken this ancient
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033269_0004_0FF6B2AF8C848F30"/>enemy, by depriving her of the ample ſource of commerce and wealth which the American colonies furniſhed.</p>
            <p>It is thus that the Almighty in whoſe hands are the hearts of kings and of all men, ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts their worſt paſſion; into inſtruments of uſeful purpoſes. The luſt of Henry VIII. was made an inſtrument of the reformation in England; and the enmity of France againſt Britain was made an inſtrument of American independence.</p>
            <p>The theories of philoſophy and the practical leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the American revolution kindled a fire of liberty in France which ſoon blazed into a flame and conſumed the fabric of her former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>America viewed the commencement of the French revolution with ſympathy and hope, and its progreſs with exultation and triumph. The cauſe of France was conſidered as the cauſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty—as our cauſe. We excuſed her outrages, we deplored her defeats, we rejoiced in her victories, as if they were all our own. She needed not, ſhe declared that ſhe did not deſire the aid of our arms. But we made every exertion to ſupply her and her colonies with proviſions, in the moſt ſeaſonable and efficacious manner. We received her citizens with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033269_0005_0FF6B2B138F9A5C8"/>every mark of hoſpitality. Our government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and firſt of all the nations of the earth, acknowledged her as a Republic, and defying all chance of counter-revolution and the riſk of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh reſentment, paid to the agents of this republic, at a time of urgent neceſſity, and before it was due, every dollar of our debt to the king. France can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge the people of America with want of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, nor the government of America with want of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Yet though the American government went to the utmoſt extent of duty, by a punctual and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous performance of her treaties and obligations, as France declared it to be her wiſh, America knew it to be her intereſt, by not overſtepping the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of duty, to preſerve herſelf from war. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in the European war would have been but as a drop in the bucket, and her entering into it on the ſide of France, would have increaſed her debt, ruined her trade, and made her an uſeleſs ally, and an impoveriſhed and burdened nation. She could aid France better by neutrality than by being a party in the war.—Our government, therefore, and with profeſſions of approbation from France, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on a ſtrict and impartial neutrality, and, while conſiſtently with neutrality, ſhe honeſtly and uſefully ſerved France, adhered to this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with unimpeachable ſincerity and perſeverance.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033269_0006_0FF6B2B369DF6BE0"/>Ample proof has been made of this by Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his letter for the recall of Mr. Genet.</p>
            <p>But the profeſſions and the purpoſes of France did not agree. Mr. Genet, the very miniſter, who on his arrival at Philadelphia, publicly declared, that it was not the wiſh nor intereſt of France that America ſhould engage in the war, afterwards pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed inſtructions given him by the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before his departure from France, enjoining him to endeavour to engage America in the war againſt Britain. The inflexible prudence of the Preſident precluded all hope of Mr. Genet's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with the government, in this ſubject of his inſtructions. He had recourſe, therefore, to other means. He fitted out privateers in our ports, he commiſſioned and engaged our citizens to enter on board thoſe privateers. Britiſh ſhips were taken within our juriſdiction, and ſold in our ports. Clubs or ſocieties were, under his ſuggeſtions, formed throughout the continent; to hang on the ſkirts of government, cenſure all its meaſures and weaken its authority, by rendering it ſuſpected, and to rouſe the paſſions of the people, and prepare them for a ſubmiſſion and even ardent devotion to the will of France. The inevitable tendency of the meaſures of Mr. Genet to embroil us with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, engage us in the war, and thus make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on France, is clearly expoſed by Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033269_0007_0FF6B2B61BEB81B8"/>in the letter already referred to.—The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Mr. Genet were purſued though leſs openly with not leſs perſeverance by his ſucceſſors: and it has been the conſtant object of the miniſters of France to give to that government an influence in this country, by dividing the people from our adminiſtration, and turning the efforts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the efforts of the executive to ſubject our public counſels to the will of France, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain among the people an hoſtile diſpoſition to Britain, and, by gradual and indirect means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel our government into open war with that nation.</p>
            <p>Though the prudent and active ſpirit of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident preſerved us from the full effect of thoſe inſidious machinations—an open war with Britain, and a conſequent dependence on France; yet thoſe machinations and the intemperate partiality and zeal for France manifeſted by the people, and by a ſtrong party in Congreſs, could not fail to draw on us the ſuſpicion of Britain, that we could not long reſiſt thoſe inducements to war, and ſhould very ſoon be actually engaged in it. France had, with reſpect to our trading ſhips, very early in the war, caſt off any regard to the treaty of commerce between her and America. Britain had no commercial treaty with us, and was bound to us in this reſpect, only by the general law of nations. Even this law both nations ſoon ceaſed to regard.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033269_0008_0FF6B2B85BD5B3B0"/>France ſet, and Britain followed the example, of making unjuſtifiable ſpoliations of our trade. What will not men do, when they have power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out immediate controul! The ſpoliations of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had amounted to a vaſt ſum, and threatened the ruin of our commerce; when meaſures were propoſed by thoſe called the friends of France in Congreſs to check thoſe ſpoliations. An embargo was adopted, and afterwards (at the requeſt of the French miniſter, who wanted to ſend ſupplies to their Weſt India iſlands) was taken off. Commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regulations, a ſuſpenſion of commerce with Britain, and a ſequeſtration of Britiſh debts were propoſed. Thoſe members of Congreſs, who had approved the neutral meaſures of the Preſident, and were deſirous of preſerving the United States in peace, conſidered thoſe meaſures as neceſſarily tending to war with Britain, and ſome as being in fact a cauſe of it. The Preſident ſeemed to have viewed them in the ſame light, and determined firſt to try whether a negociation would not obtain juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The friends of the meaſures thus prevented declaimed againſt a negociation under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, loudly extolled the force and ſpirit of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, reprobated the baſeneſs of national ſubmiſſion to injuſtice, and declared, that there was no proſpect of ſucceſs in negociation unſupported by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vigorous meaſures. Thoſe of the ſame party in the Senate reprobated the appointment of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033269_0009_0FF6B2BA33607358"/>negociator. And pains were taken, that both he and the negociation ſhould be conſidered as odious and unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>All prophets, like Jonah, are angry, if their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy be not accompliſhed; and their endeavours are ſeldom wanting to promote its accompliſhment. The proſpect of a negociation with Britain ſeemed fatal to the hope of France and her agents here, of involving us in the war. Thoſe in Congreſs whoſe propoſitions were thereby prevented, felt the chagrin of diſappointment. Thus a vaſt intereſt was eſtabliſhed in the United States againſt any treaty whatever with Britain. Even before the treaty was known, it was attacked by conjecture. No ſooner was it known, than town-meetings aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the moſt tumultuous manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out argument or deliberation condemned it. It was cenſured for faults which had no exiſtence, and evils created by imagination. The treaty was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in every ſtage, and even after it became a law a ſtrong party in the Houſe of Repreſentatives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defeat it. But it triumphed over all oppoſition, the poſts were ſurrendered, our claims for ſpoliations were put in an equitable mode of adjuſtment. And great progreſs has, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, been made in adjuſting and paying them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:033269_0010_0FF6B2BCED2213C0"/>
For a long time after the treaty was ratified and publiſhed, France made little if any objections to it; and if ſhe made any they were ſuggeſted to her by her partizans among ourſelves. Had they been ſilent, ſo would France have been. But it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if the prophecies of menace and reſentment uttered by the partizans of France here were not fulfilled, they would loſe all credit and conſequence; our government would triumph; thoſe popular leaders would ſink into inſignificance; the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of France on this country would ceaſe; our government would be reſtored to its confidence and authority; and the United States become really independent.</p>
            <p>Inſtigated therefore by their party here, and to preſerve its hold on the people of this country, and keep them dependent, by weakening the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a ſeparation of the people from it, the French government at laſt complained that our treaty with Britain was injurious to France; of themſelves took upon them to new-model their treaty with us; and proceeded to new and exorbitant ſpoliations on our commerce.</p>
            <p>That their objections to the Britiſh treaty, and all their objections to the conduct of our government were but pretexts, and that the true motive of their reſentment was to maintain their influence in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033269_0011_0FF6B2BF1D8B89A0"/>this country to uſe the people againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, and thereby ſubject both to the will of France; muſt be evident to every candid and intelligent man, who reads the French objections to the Britiſh treaty, and to other parts of the conduct of our adminiſtration, as ſtated in Mr. Adet's letter to our ſecretary of ſtate; and compares it with that plain and ſatisfactory anſwer to all thoſe objections in the letter of the ſecretary. It muſt be ſtill more evident from the critical time which Mr. Adet choſe to ſtate thoſe objections, and from his publiſhing them to the people juſt before the election of Electors of a Preſident of the United States, when one of the candidates for that ſtation was ſuppoſed to be devoted to the intereſts of France, and was zealouſly ſupported by all their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans and agents in this country.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who do not read, and to thoſe who read without thinking, all argument on this head is vain. But to thoſe who have conſidered the treaty, the objections, and the anſwers, I may ſafely appeal. And I challenge any man, to point out any part of the Britiſh treaty which is injurious to France, or which gives to Britain any advantage, which as an independent and neutral nation, we had not a right to give. If this be the caſe, and that it is the caſe has been often proved, and may be confidently believed, they muſt have a wretched opinion of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033269_0012_0FF6B2C15012CAB8"/>principles, moderation, and integrity of the French government, who can think the Britiſh treaty a cauſe of war by France againſt America. What! are we a ſovereign and independent nation, and have we not a right to make ſuch contracts as we pleaſe, harmleſs to other nations? are we yet in a ſtate of infancy, and our acts to be conſidered void, and grounds of chaſtiſement, unleſs approved by our guardians? Did we emancipate ourſelves from the dominion of Britain, only to ſubject ourſelves to the dominion of France? Are the United States independent, if they dare not make ſuch treaties as they pleaſe, conſiſtent with prior engagements, and the general law of nations? And is the ſpirit, of 1776 ſo completely extinguiſhed in the American breaſt, that we ſhall now tamely ſubmit to encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which then we reſiſted and repelled? Tame conceſſions to unjuſt demands, like the beginnings of ſtrife, are, as the letting out of water: the dam once broken, an irreſiſtable flood will ruſh in, and overwhelm us.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the making of the Britiſh treaty a cauſe of war by France againſt America, a violation of it, or a refuſal to comply with it, would clearly have been a cauſe of war by Britain againſt Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Britain had her complaints as well as we, and having propoſed a reaſonable accommodation, if we refuſed to comply with it, had a right to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033269_0013_0FF6B2C381488978"/>force to compel us. This right would have been the ſame, if no treaty had been made, but merely a demand and refuſal to pay Britiſh debts. We have not to conſider now, only whether the Britiſh treaty be the cauſe of the reſentment and aggreſſions of France; but alſo, what would have been our condition if that treaty had not been made, or being made, had been broken, or not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. We ſhould then, probably, have had an Indian war on our frontiers, and a war with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at ſea. It is not hard to determine whether that, or our preſent ſtate, with all we can fear from France, be the greater evil. Suppoſing an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our country from either, France could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed raiſe, but probably could not tranſport a greater army than Britain. But ſuppoſing, as perhaps is the caſe, an invaſion not probable, and only a ſea war; there is no compariſon between the naval power of Britain and that of France, perhaps and that of the world: and our danger would be in proportion to the power of our enemy. If we have incurred therefore a danger, by making the Britiſh treaty, we have thereby eſcaped a far greater danger; an Indian war, and a ſea war with the greateſt naval power in the world.</p>
            <p>But there is another difference between the two caſes, a difference which by all who believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard a divine Providence will never be loſt ſight of.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033269_0014_0FF6B2C52A684ED8"/>In our diſpute with France we are contending for principle, for juſtice, and for our independent rights, and reſiſting oppreſſion and unjuſt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. In the diſpute to have been feared with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if we refuſed a peaceable accommodation, we ſhould have had to contend for injuſtice and iniquity. In our diſpute with France, we have a a good cauſe; in that with Britain, we ſhould have had a bad cauſe. Courage, and, if we can truſt in Providence, ſucceſs, is in proportion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But though the Britiſh treaty furniſhed no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it was uſed as a pretext, for drawing on us the anger and vengeance of France. This ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was thought neceſſary, to give conſequence to their party, and maintain their hold on the people againſt the government of America. It was the only remaining mean of preventing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete emancipation of the United States from the yoke of foreign influence.</p>
            <p>At an important time to influence the election of a Preſident of the United States, Mr. Adet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced not only to the government, but to the people, the ſuſpenſion of his diplomatic powers in this country, accompanied with vehement but ſilly and groundleſs complaints againſt the government of the United States. This menace failing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033269_0015_0FF6B2C80D285110"/>the intended effect, the election of Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon as Preſident, was ſoon followed by the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt injuries to our trade, the capture of our veſſels, on the moſt frivolous and unjuſtifiable pretexts; till the damages have amounted, it has been ſaid, to thirty million of dollars. Payment was alſo refuſed of a large debt contracted by the agents of France for proviſions furniſhed on the credit of that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And it became the avowed object of France to compel the United States to an implicit ſubmiſſion to her will, or to ruin them.</p>
            <p>To all theſe invaſions of our rights, depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our property, machinations againſt our peace and independence, and intrigues to draw us into the war, the French government had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by our miniſter in France, a weak zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, ſubſervient to their ambition and inſolence. He foſtered their hope that the people of the United States were ready to make a common cauſe with France, and would cheerfully ſubmit to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of their rights or ſpoliations of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that would contribute to the ſucceſs of that cauſe. He neglected, in ſpite of the poſitive and repeated inſtructions of the Preſident, effectually to remonſtrate againſt the violations of our treaty and neutral rights, committed on our commerce by the French ſhips of war and privateers. He neglected alſo, contrary to expreſs inſtructions, to give to the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033269_0016_0FF6B2CA3A41DD38"/>French government the neceſſary explanations of our treaty with Britain, and point out the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions on which the prejudice of France againſt it, and the conduct of our government generally were founded. And he not only encouraged but ſtrongly recommended a loan of money, by the United States to France, which would have been a plain breach of neutrality, and an open taking part in the war, and, of courſe, a cauſe of war againſt us by all the enemies of France. By ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations in the French funds, he purchaſed a princely palace in the vicinity of Paris. His houſe was a reſort for all diſcontented Americans, where they were inſtructed by him not in reſpect, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection of their own government. At his table he read and miſrepreſented our treaty with Britain. In his houſe he entertained the profligate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Paine, while he wrote his ſcandalous letter to General Waſhington, and had it recited to him as it was compoſed, for his amuſement.—And, at a public entertainment, he retired, while the health of the Preſident was drank, and immediately after returned. When ſuch was the treacherous conduct of our miniſter, no wonder that the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment broke through all reſtraints of decency or juſtice to us, no wonder that the Preſident recalled him, and no wonder that the Directory parted with him with regret.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:033269_0017_0FF6B2CC6FF8BB30"/>
As the French government were thus ſeduced to a falſe confidence in the baſeneſs and depravity of the American ſpirit; neither need we wonder that the American people were ſo long deluded by a falſe opinion of the virtue of France, and have only renounced that opinion, when it becomes too plain to be denied, that the French government have abandoned all regard to God, to government, to juſtice, or to decency. Vaſt and inceſſant pains have been taken throughout this country, to miſlead the underſtanding and the judgment of the people. Pamphlets and newſpapers have been continually iſſuing from the preſs, for the avowed purpoſe of deſtroying all truſt in God, and all confidence in our government. No public character, not even the virtue of a Waſhington, nor religion itſelf, has eſcaped abuſe and defamation. Every act of the government has been cenſured and miſrepreſented and even the motives and intentions of public offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have been perverted and miſtated. Every thing done by our government has been repreſented as conſtantly wrong, every thing done againſt us by the French, or any other government under their influence, as conſtantly right; till we have ſeemed more willing to obey a mandate of the French Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, than a ſolemn act of our own adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Thoſe notoriouſly falſe ſtatements of public tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions have been ſupported by many who having
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033269_0018_0FF66B96D09D0188"/>more concern in the adminiſtration, or being near the ſource of information might have known (if in fact they did not know) better. Many of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Aſſembly and members of Congreſs not only in converſations but in letters have taken the utmoſt pains to diſſeminate ſuſpicions and ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the moſt reſpectable officers and neceſſary meaſures of the adminiſtration; and have rendered it impoſſible for the citizens to know the truth, or to form a right judgment of men or things. Hence the opinions and duties of the citizens were perverted. And, as the nature of man is prone to believe ſlander, the authors of thoſe miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations became popular in proportion to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, and influenced the opinions and elections of the people.</p>
            <p>Of all whom I have had an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, the member of Congreſs from the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtrict has been the moſt buſy and miſchievous. With a reputation for candour, patriotiſm and truth, which gave to all his ſtatements the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of authenticity, his letters have filled the country with falſe opinions of the acts and officers of government, and falſe vindications of every thing done againſt it. The falſehood and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of many of his repreſentations have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and, if he have any value of reputation, he will now ceaſe to promote diſaffection to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033269_0019_0FF6B2D1584A9508"/>adminiſtration of public authority; or if he ſhould perſiſt, the credit of his reports has ſo much fallen, that they will be leſs injurious. But hitherto they have had a pernicious influence on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conduct of the people of this country. He has publiſhed them in newſpapers. He has ſent under cover to poſtmaſters, whom he knew diſpoſed to be organs of the propagation of his opinions, his letters to his correſpondents open, for the purpoſe of being read and publiſhed by thoſe poſtmaſters. His letters have been very frequent, and his correſpondents often of a ſort not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualified to detect or correct the error and poiſon conveyed in them. The late meſſage of the Preſident has been a complete confutation of ſome of the moſt malignant parts of them. It becomes every man to aid in expoſing them, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the people who have been miſled by them, to a right judgment and conduct, and preſerve the country from the dangerous effects of their deluſion.</p>
            <p>While the people of America were thus miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by our miniſter in France, and miſled by the partizans of France here, and while prejudice and falſe opinions of the American government were thus induſtriouſly ſuggeſted and cultivated, both there and here; we need not recur to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh treaty, nor to any conduct of our adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the cauſes of the French aggreſſions on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033269_0020_0FF6B2D309A1BA90"/>America, for they may be accounted for from the nature of man and the general principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the French government.</p>
            <p>Power without reſtraint or accountability ſeldom fails to be abuſed in the hands of men. The French had triumphed over all their enemies and were elat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with victory. It was the intereſt of thoſe who poſſeſſed the powers of government to keep the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion embroiled, in order to maintain their ſtation and influence. Early in the French revolution they publicly declared that they were ready to unite with a party in any nation to change the form of their government. And this, whatever they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards profeſs, they inceſſantly purſued, wherever they had opportunity. It was indifferent to them whether the government which they aſſiſted the diſaffected to deſtroy was a monarchy or a republic, arbitrary or free. The point with them was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and ſupport a party, promote confuſion, and ſo acquire influence, predominancy, and plunder. Flanders, Holland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Venice, are ample proofs of this ſpirit. The plunder of the church, the baniſhment and murder of their fellow citizens, the perpetual deſtruction and ſucceſſion of parties, and above all the contempt and extinction of all principles of morality, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and religion, ſhew, that we need not look beyond their own character, for cauſes of miſchief
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033269_0021_0FF6B2D4C67BF920"/>from the French government. Can we expect juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from men who deny it to each other? Will thoſe reſpect the rights of man, who contemn the rights of God? Can we expect any decency or right from men with power in their hands, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a God and a future ſtate?</p>
            <p>It is not therefore in the Britiſh treaty, nor in any part of the conduct of our own government, but in the character of the French government, and in our own diviſions excited by the ſlander and abuſe of our public officers, and meaſures, that we are to look for the cauſes of the French aggreſſions. A love of plunder and univerſal domination is plainly ſeen in all the conduct of the French go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And the influence they had acquired here, and the fatal diviſion between the people and the government, which they and their partizans had ſo inceſſantly and ſucceſsfully promoted; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to be weak, becauſe divided, and therefore defenceleſs, and an eaſy prey. An houſe divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand. The French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might therefore freely indulge their paſſion for plunder and power, unrelentingly perſiſt in their violation of our rights, and ſpoliation of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and ſet our government at defiance; ſince they had a party among ourſelves of ſtrength and diſpoſition competent to defeat every purpoſe of the government, and render all its meaſures odious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:033269_0022_0FF6B2D774EA4F78"/>
Confident therefore in theſe means of defeating any exertion for maintaining our national ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and determined to reduce us to a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and dependence, when a miniſter was ſent to Paris, who really would obſerve the inſtructions of the Preſident, and would not ſubmit to be a tool of the Directory; they refuſed to receive him and even threatened him with impriſonment, unleſs he left their territory. He accordingly retired to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and waited for inſtructions from the Preſident, to direct his future conduct.</p>
            <p>To have a juſt feeling of this groſs indignity, let us ſuppoſe that the Britiſh court had thus rejected Mr. Jay, obſtinately rejected all communication of complaints for the injuries done us, and told him he muſt leave the country or perhaps go to priſon: What would have been the indignation of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca! And how would the cry of war have reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all the partiſans of France, even from all ſpirited Americans! And, was not the rejection of Mr. Pinckney by the French, a greater indignity? Is not indignity from a friend whom we have loved, and praiſed, more grievous, than like treatment from a man whom we have hated and abuſed?</p>
            <p>Yet the American government did not reſent this indignity, but refrained from hoſtility; and the preſent Preſident determined to make one effort
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033269_0023_0FF6B2D9A5824B80"/>more for reconciliation. And, to give it more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, appointed three Envoys to the French Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, to endeavour to obtain juſtice and peace, by ſtipulating for compenſation for paſt, and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt future injuries; in a new treaty ſettling all the diſputed conſtructions of the former, and fixing the terms of our future intercourſe with France.</p>
            <p>It has been admitted by the greateſt ſlanderers of the Preſident, and even contrary to their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſuſpicions and reports, that the inſtructions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Preſident to his Envoys have been the moſt liberal and candid, that could have been juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable. —They authorized the Envoys, if this were deſired by the French, to modify the commercial treaty with France, according to the principles of the Britiſh treaty; to give up our claim for enemies property captured in veſſels of the United States; to ſtipulate for our accepting ſecurities payable at a future time, inſtead of money, for our claims for depredations on our commerce; and even not to inſiſt on ſatisfaction of our claims as an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of the propoſed treaty.</p>
            <p>With full powers and ſuch liberal inſtructions, the envoys arrived in Paris on the 4th of October laſt, and the day following announced their arrival and their miſſion to the miniſter of foreign affairs.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033269_0024_0FF6B2DBD8B09E20"/>His ſecretary gave information, that the Directory were exaſperated at Parts of the Preſident's ſpeech, that the negotiation would be conducted under the direction of this miniſter, and they would have no audience of the Directory till it was finiſhed. Two weeks after their arrival, authorized and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged agents of this miniſter commenced conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, preparatory to the negotiation. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by ſtating the pride of the Directory, their great offence at certain parts of the Preſident's ſpeech, and the humiliating apologies, diſavowals, repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and explanations, which would be required from the envoys. Theſe however, they fairly avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be only pretexts for the purpoſe of obtaining, what was their real object, and without which, the envoys were told, that they could expect no treaty nor even a reception, nor permiſſion to remain in Paris; money! that with or without theſe apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, &amp;c. money muſt be given. They muſt, in the firſt place, give to the miniſter about 223,000 dollars, to be employed by him in gaining the good will of the Directory. They muſt advance to the French government a ſum equal to all the American claims againſt France, and the French government would then pay the claimants, and they lay out the money again in ſupplies to the French colonies. They muſt purchaſe from the French government Dutch debts to the amount of about ſix millions of dollars, as ſometimes ſtated, and twelve million of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033269_0025_0FF6B2DD927D17E0"/>dollars as ſtated at other times, paying twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the pound, when in the market they were hardly worth ten. All this was to be done without any aſſurance, that a negotiation would be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, without any ſtatement of terms, and perhaps without even a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities. Theſe terms the envoys poſitively rejected. Argument and menace were exerted in vain, to produce a compliance.—The wrath and power of the French government was ſet forth in ſtrong terms. It was ſtated that the preſent Directors would probably not be long in power, and a temporary compliance might prevent a war. That we had to treat with men who diſregarded the juſtice of our claims, and the reaſoning with which we ſupported them: that they diſregarded their own colonies, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves as invulnerable with reſpect to us; that we would acquire an intereſt among them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a judicious application of money; that nothing was to be obtained there without money; and that all the neighbouring ſtates had, in like manner, been obliged to purchaſe peace. That if we did not, they would confiſcate our property, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo our veſſels and ravage our coaſts; that we might look for the fate of Venice, to be parcelled out, and bartered away; or at leaſt have the form of our government changed, as that of Hamburgh and Switzerland would ſoon be; or partake of a like ruin as was hanging over Portugal and England.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033269_0026_0FF6B2DFC7B4F238"/>That France had lent us money, and we ought to ſhew the ſame friendſhip. That they had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the United States, that if Mr. Burr and Mr. Madiſon had conſtituted the miſſion, the differences would have been accommodated. That the miniſter was preparing a memorial, to be ſent out to the United States, complaining of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, as being unfriendly to an accommodation with France. That they had a party in America ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their intereſt; and that the diplomatic ſkill of France, and the means which ſhe poſſeſſes in our country, are ſufficient to enable her, with the French party in America, to throw the blame of the rupture of the negotiations on the federaliſts.</p>
            <p>To theſe propoſals the Envoys replied, that, tho' ſenſible of the power of France, they could never conſent to purchaſe peace by a ſurrender of their national independence. That ſubmiſſion to claims not founded in right, inſtead of procuring ſolid peace, would only invite a repetition of demands without end. That they expected to receive, and were prepared, in the ampleſt manner, to give juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and would make any reaſonable ſacrifice for the ſake of peace. That they were anxious to avoid war; but if war forced itſelf upon them, the United States had nothing left, but to exert their means of ſelf-defence; and that thoſe means were ſufficient to preſerve them from ſubjection to any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033269_0027_0FF6B2E279226378"/>That while we were ſtruggling for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we had ſolicited from France a loan of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as a favour, had not extorted it by threats or injuries, nor exacted it as a condition of doing juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or forbearing hoſtility; and that France had lent it in the time of our diſtreſs, of her own choice, and in order to maim and depreſs a rival nation. That France now ſtood in no need of money for her own defence, and wanted it only to extend her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts over other nations.—And that our lending it to France, while engaged in war for that purpoſe, was becoming parties in the war; and taking part in the war under the coercion of France was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our independence. That it would not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy for the miniſter to perſuade the people of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, that the ſtatements made by their Envoys are untrue; at any rate he might be aſſured, that the fear of cenſure would not induce them to deſerve it. They would act according to their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and truſted they ſhould be ſupported by the great body of candid and honeſt men. And that France miſcalculated on the parties in America; for the extreme injuſtice offered to our country would unite every man againſt her.</p>
            <p>The lateſt diſpatches received from our Envoys, dated 8th January laſt, announce new meaſures tending to the utter deſtruction of our trade, and inform us, that after a ſtay of three months there,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033269_0028_0FF6B2E4ADFC4338"/>unnoticed and unacknowledged, they have no hope of being received, or of accompliſhing the object of their miſſion. All this the Preſident has announced to Congreſs, with a declaration, that no proſpect remains of accommodating our differences with France, without a ſurrender of the eſſential princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our independence.</p>
            <p>The criſis to which the United States are now brought, is one of the moſt extraordinary to be found in the hiſtory of nations. A ſovereign ſtate conſcious of no offence is cauſeleſsly attacked by a proud and potent nation, and on pretexts as various as they are groundleſs, and every day ſhifting and multiplying, is ſpoiled of property to a vaſt amount, and threatened with the utter extinction of her trade and her means of defence. Deſirous to avoid war, and to live on good terms with her ſpoiler, ſhe ſends to him meſſengers of peace, to diſcuſs the cauſes and effects of her ſufferings, and even to forgive all that is paſt, on condition that ſhe may live ſecurely in future. Theſe meſſengers, the ſpoiler firſt refuſes to hear, drives from him, and threatens with impriſonment.—They are ſent back. They are ſtill not ſuffered to unfold their complaints, or the powers of their miſſion. Frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous grounds of complaint againſt the ſuffering ſtate are fabricated. Submiſſions are required, on purpoſe to mark their degradation, and ſhew how
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033269_0029_0FF6B2E66D7158B8"/>far the ſpoiler might proceed in his plunder and demands. Thoſe ſubmiſſions are acknowledged to be mere pretexts for exacting further enormous ſums of money, as bribes or loans, to men who profeſſed no regard to juſtice, and might ſoon be out of authority. When all theſe terms were to be complied with, it was poſſible the meſſengers might be admitted to ſtate their complaints, and propoſe terms of redreſs; but in the mean time the ſpoiler would proceed in his acts of violence.</p>
            <p>That when the colonies ſent petitions for redreſs to Britain, they were received contemptuouſly, was not matter of great wonder; for they were held as in a ſtate of rebellion. But that when one ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſtate, having received unexampled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked injuries from another, has ſent ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to diſcuſs the grounds of injury, and means of redreſs, thoſe ambaſſadors are treated contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and diſmiſſed unheard; and are moreover told, that if ever they be heard, it ſhall be after a ſurrender of national dignity, independence, and ſelf-government, and a great increaſe of their paſt damage, is a degree of inſolence, and a contempt of juſtice, rarely experienced in the annals of the world. The nation that can impoſe ſuch terms has no principle to reſtrain it. The nation that can ſubmit to them is prepared for all oppreſſion.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033269_0030_0FF6B2E8A35735F0"/>Force only can decide between them; or the one muſt be a tyrant and the other a ſlave.</p>
            <p>The diſpatches are in the hands of every one, and no honeſt American but muſt burn with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at their inſolent demand of conceſſions for the Preſident's ſpeech. Shall they impudently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere in the diſcretionary adminiſtration of our government, not affecting them, and we not ſpeak with reſentment! Shall we pave the way to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation by a diſavowal of truth, and a profeſſion of falſehood! O! if they had found the envoys baſe enough to ſubmit to theſe terms, there would have been no humiliation ſo great that would not have been required of them.</p>
            <p>But theſe were but pretexts. The real prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary was money. Money in bribes and in gifts under the name of loans. For a loan from a weaker to a more powerful government is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name for a gift or tribute; eſpecially when the government requiring the money is avowed to have no regard to juſtice, is publicly compared to the Indians and Algerines, and declared like them to <hi>ſell</hi> peace and forbearance of their cruel aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. With ſuch a government having made one conceſſion, would there have been any end of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, while we had any thing to give? Indeed, at once they avow, that their expectations are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033269_0031_0FF6B2EB5A4E7388"/>to our ability to pay. The firſt conceſſion was putting our necks under their feet. And true intereſt, as well as true dignity, required that we ſhould ſtop at the point of right.</p>
            <p>But would it not have been better to have made this conceſſion? By no means. When a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſavows any regard to juſtice, declares that nothing is to be obtained from it without money; not pretending any claim of right, like Indians and Algerines, ſets out on the principle of general plunder and exaction; and fairly owns that her demands will be meaſured by our means of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them; we can never hope, by any conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to ſtop exaction, while we have any thing to give: eſpecially when the men whom we ſhould now glut with our tribute might be out of power in a few weeks, and a new ſet not leſs ravenous and more hungry than they, on new pretences, and with the ſame terrors, might demand new ſupplies. Our envoys had no aſſurance, if all the demands were complied with, how the money could be diſpoſed of, or what terms, or whether any terms of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation would be accorded to them. Nor, if they had received ſuch aſſurance, could any confidence be placed in it: for whenever in mutual tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the baſis of right, juſtice, and mutual intereſt is departed from, all confidence is gone; the party exacting what is not founded on this baſis, becomes
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033269_0032_0FF6B2ED9BEE92E0"/>a knave, and if he have power, a tyrant; and the party yielding, lays himſelf at his feet, and muſt ſubmit to whatever, is required of him. Beſides, no conceſſion from us can ſave us from her aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, while ſhe is at war with England. For it is the ruin of England that ſhe ſeeks, and her plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us is one of her means of accompliſhing that main object. And if we make the conceſſions required, while Britain is at war with France, we ſhall certainly draw on ourſelves a war with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>But ſtill would it not be better for us, by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, to avoid a war with France?</p>
            <p>What thoſe men mean who, ſpeaking of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation with reſpect to France, talk of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war, or of keeping out of war, I have never been able to comprehend, unleſs they mean, that we ought to permit France in peace, to take all our ſeamen, our ſhips, and our property by piece meal; unmoleſted in peace, to reduce us to a ſtate of ſtarving beggars; and then, when we have no means of defence, if ſhe think proper, to come in peace and cut our throats, parcel out our lands among her ſoldiers, and give up our wives and children to their luſts. This ſeems to be the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling peace of thoſe men. No reſiſtance, unleſs our territory be invaded. Let France go on and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033269_0033_0FF6B2EF5DD38F20"/>take our ſhips, our ſeamen, and our wealth; it is true, that will deprive us of all means of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſtop our agriculture, manufactures, and arts; but then we ſhall be at peace. If, indeed, France ever invade our country, then we ſhall go to war; and if then we be incapable of defence, and can procure neither arms, cloathing, nor proviſions, we may conſole ourſelves with the reflection, that we have ſacrificed all theſe to peace; and in peace ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our lives, property, liberty, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the French, and again ſit down under the bleſſings of a colonial government.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay France is too good for us to fear any ſuch fate from her. Is not this the fate that all the ſtates which ſhe has curſed with her protection or invaſion have experienced? Has ſhe not in all of them ſtirred up troubles, diſcontents, commotions, ſeditions, and inſurrections, and, under the pretence of aiding, or ſuppreſſing, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the inſurgents, reduced them to implicit ſubjection to her will. What are Spain, Holland, the Italian kingdoms and republics, Switzerland, Rome, Flanders, and great part of Germany, but colonies or dominions of France, plundered of their wealth and reduced to poverty? What is Venice, a neutral nation over-run by the arms of France, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under her protection, and promiſed a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic form of government, incited to commotion
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033269_0034_0FF6B2F20FF7FB70"/>reduced to the condition of a conquered country, plundered of her fleet and wealth, eraſed from the liſt of nations, and bartered to the Emperor. France was not too good to do all this to Venice: and this is the nation with whoſe fate we are now threatened by France.</p>
            <p>France has long been carrying on war againſt us, in the ſafeſt and moſt effectual way for her, and the moſt deſtructive to us; a war on her ſide, and peace on ours. It is now upwards of five years ſince ſhe began it.—From ſlender beginnings, ſhe has proceeded to extravagant degrees of ſpolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, extended the extravagance of her pretexts and plunder, according to the degree of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. The government remonſtrated; but the French government knew they dared not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. They had a party among ourſelves ſtrong enough to defeat all the energy of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they might ſafely proceed to any meaſure of oppreſſion. In this party they yet confide; and in this confidence threaten us not only with further plunder, but with ruin. And unleſs we ſhew them by an open and unanimous approbation of the paſt, and confidence in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct of our adminiſtration; that we are determined to ſupport our government in a juſt reſentment, they will proceed in their ſpoliation, extending the extravagance of their pretences and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033269_0035_0FF6B2F440769B48"/>their violence, as we extend our patience; till they diſable us from all means of defence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to abſolute poverty, dependence, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>This is the only kind of war that France can carry on againſt us, with any proſpect of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing her object, and ſubjecting us to her will. While ſhe continues this war, and we continue our deluſive peace, our ruin is as certain, as will be our ſecurity, if we now fix our foot and ſay, <hi>We will yield no more.</hi> Here we take our ſtand, and from this moment we will repel all aggreſſions. We will no longer ſeek ſhelter under the influence of a foreign government, but under the parental guardianſhip of our own. And the authority of our own government we will maintain, or periſh with it.</p>
            <p>But is there any hope, that we ſhall ſucceed in our reſiſtance? Whether there be or not, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can hardly be worſe. For, under the laſt decree of France, hardly any of our ſhips will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape condemnation, if they chooſe to take them; and their diſpoſition to take them we cannot doubt. And as their reſentment is violent againſt Britain, and our deſtruction would injure that nation, we can hardly doubt that after rendering us defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they will ſeek to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033269_0036_0FF6B2F695DB7198"/>
But there is hope that reſiſtance will be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and obtain us peace, at leaſt, if not juſtice. France has now nothing to fear, while we acquieſce in her violence; but if we reſiſt we may repel, and even revenge, if not remedy it. While we can maintain a tolerable portion of ſhipping and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, we can obtain ſuch ſupplies, as will enable us to ſupport ourſelves againſt an invaſion, if it ſhould be attempted.—But we are at ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from France, and ſuch is the crippled ſtate of her navy, that it is not likely that ſhe will attempt an invaſion of us, while ſhe is at war with Britain, or if ſhe do attempt it, it is not likely that it can be ſucceſsful. If there be a proſpect of an European peace, France muſt depend, for her future great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on her manufactures, commerce, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Theſe only can make her a rival to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And, to ſupport theſe, ſhe muſt have a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign market. America is one of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant markets in the world for European manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. If the French government find, that they can no longer maintain their influence here, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion or party among the people againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and find, that the people unite with the government in juſt reſentment againſt them for their cruel and unprovoked aggreſſions; they muſt have loſt all prudence, if they do not ſee that a continuance of injury will rivet indelible preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt them in the American mind, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033269_0037_0FF6B2F846B4DF88"/>diſappoint all hope of ſecuring any tolerable ſhare of trade with us; and they muſt have loſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the future glory of their nation, and all reſentment againſt Britain, if they do not change their conduct towards us, and, endeavour to conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate our affections.</p>
            <p>On theſe grounds, it appears that France has long been carrying on an inſidious and deſtructive war againſt us; that ſhe will continue this kind of war, in proportion to our patience and ſubmiſſion, until ſhe has firſt diſabled, and then ruined and ſubjected us; that there is no other way of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an end to this war, peace, and juſtice, but by reſiſtance; and that a ſtate of reſiſtance to ſuch war is more advantageous to us, than ſubmiſſion, and will be effectual to procure us peace, juſtice, and national independence.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the duty of the government, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered all reaſonable terms, and exhauſted all means of reconciliation, to prepare the nation for a ſtate of ſelf-defence; and to convince France, that we will no longer ſubmit to unjuſt depredations, and violent invaſions of our rights of property and ſovereignty. War is a dreadful calamity. But in ſelf-defence, it becomes a duty both for nations and individuals. And a government, which ſuffers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther government unjuſtly and without reſiſtance, to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033269_0038_0FF6B2FAF3CFFE08"/>exhauſt it by plunder, and render it defenceleſs, thereby to ruin and enſlave it, is like a man who quietly ſuffers a robber to tie his hands and bleed him to death, thereby to ſeize his property.</p>
            <p>The people alſo have duties to perform. When an independent and free nation has its ſovereign rights attacked, and violated by another nation; it is a call of Providence to all the citizens to ſtand forth, and defend the cauſe of truth and national liberty. Union in reſiſtance becomes as much a duty in all the citizens, as it is the duty of all the members of a family to unite in defence of the houſe againſt midnight aſſaſſins or incendiaries. And in the diſcharge of this duty, to which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calls them, they ought to look up with holy confidence to the protection of that Providence which calls them out to trial, and to the ſtrength of the Lord of Hoſts, who calls them to battle. His providence and ſtrength America hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore experienced: and the Lord, which delivered us out of the paw of the lion, will deliver us out of the hand of the Philiſtine.</p>
            <p>To a truſt in God we ought to unite confidence in thoſe men whom Providence hath called to rule over us. We ſee that the conduct of the Preſident and his council has been virtuous, liberal and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; that he has done every thing practicable
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033269_0039_0FF6B2FD2BB83708"/>to avoid war; and that war is brought and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on us, by the malice and injuſtice of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thoſe ſlanders with which baſe men have obſcured the light, truth, and wiſdom of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have been chaſed away like miſts before the ſun. Let us return therefore from our error. Let us reſtore to our adminiſtration that confidence which never ought to have been withdrawn. And as our enemies have taken advantage of our jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and ſuſpicions of our government, and made the diviſions ariſing from them, grounds of their preſumptuous hopes of deſtroying us; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this cauſe of danger, if we would avoid the danger itſelf. Let us ſhew, that the people and the government are of one heart and one mind. United we ſtand: divided we fall.</p>
            <p>As, to remove danger, we muſt remove diviſions, jealouſies and ſuſpicions, ſo to remove theſe, we muſt ſilence ſlanderers, and ſet our faces againſt them. We have ſeen the ſad effects, and the groſs miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of thoſe lying newſpapers, lying pamphlets, lying letters, and lying converſations, with which the country has been filled. It is no longer a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to trifle with public opinion or popular paſſion; leſt God give us up to ſtrong deluſion, and ſuffer us to fall into deſtruction. Let us turn a deaf ear to thoſe lying prophets. Let us withdraw from them all belief, all aid, and all countenance. They
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033269_0040_0FF6B2FF60DA56E0"/>are vipers in our boſom, vultures preying on our bowels, and fatal inſtruments of the malicious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of our enemies. No good man, with a juſt regard to his own reputation, will any longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or countenance them, for, by doing ſo, he gives them confidence, and enables them to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous. Silence thoſe ſlanderers, and we ſhall be as happy as we are free, as united as we are happy, and as formidable as we are united.</p>
            <p>Finally, in order to remove the danger thereby threatened, it is our duty to endeavour to remove that impreſſion, which our diviſions have made on the French government. As they reſt their hopes of injuring us on the belief that there is a party among ourſelves devoted to their will; let us ſhew them that there is no ſuch party. Let us unite in one band of unity among ourſelves, and confidence in our adminiſtration; and, to teſtify this union and confidence to the world, let us unanimouſly ſign an inſtrument, expreſſing to our government our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the rectitude of its meaſures, our firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, for the ſupport of our independence from a foreign yoke, on this as on a former occaſion; and, for this ſupport, now as then, pledging to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our ſacred honour.</p>
