            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.</head>
            <p>THE Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, the repreſentation from the General Court of the Commonwealth of Maſſachuſetts, on the ſubjects of the Cod and Whale Fiſheries, together with the ſeveral papers accompanying it, has had the fame under conſideration, and thereupon makes the following—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>REPORT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE repreſentation ſets forth that, before the late way, about four thouſand ſeamen, and twenty-four thouſand tons of ſhipping were annually employed, from that State, in the whale fiſhery, the produce whereof was about three hundred and fifty thouſand pounds lawful money a year.</p>
            <p>That, previous to the ſame period, the cod fiſhery of that State, employed four thouſand men, and twenty-eight thouſand tons of ſhipping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and produced about two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds a year.</p>
            <p>That theſe branches of buſineſs, annihilated during the war, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in ſome degree, recovered ſince: but that they labour under many and heavy embarraſſments, which, if not removed, or leſſened, will render the fiſheries every year leſs extenſive and important.</p>
            <p>That theſe embarraſſments are, heavy duties on their produce abroad, and bounties on that of their competitors: and duties at home on ſeveral articles, particularly uſed in the fiſheries.</p>
            <p>And it aſks that the duties be taken off; that bounties be given to the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and the national influence be uſed abroad for obtaining better markets for their produce.</p>
            <p>The cod and whale fiſheries, carried on by different perſons, from different ports, in different veſſels, in different ſeas, and ſeeking different markets, agree in one circumſtance, in being as unprofitable to the adventurer, as important to the public. A ſuccinct view of their riſe, progreſs, and preſent ſtate, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nations, may enable us to note the circumſtances which have attended their proſperity, and their decline, to judge of the embarraſſments, which are ſaid to oppreſs ours; to ſee whether they depend on our own will, and may, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be remedied immediately by ourſelves, or, whether, depending on the will of others, they are without the reach of remedy, from us, either directly or indirectly.</p>
            <p>Their hiſtory, being as unconnected as their practice, they ſhall be ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered.</p>
            <p>Within twenty years after the ſuppoſed diſcovery of Newfoundland by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, we find that the abundance of fiſh on its banks, had already drawn the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the people of Europe. For, as early as 1517, or 1519, we are told of fifty ſhips being ſeen there at one time. The firſt adventurers in that fiſhery, were
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023911_0003_0FC28DE7CD5256E0"/>
the Biſcayans of Spain, the Baſques and Bas-Bretons of France, all united anciently in language, and ſtill in habits and in extreme poverty. The laſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance enabled them long to retain a conſiderable ſhare of the fiſhery. In 1577, the French had one hundred and fifty veſſels there; the Spaniards had ſtill one hundred; and the Portugueſe fifty, when the Engliſh had only fifteen. The Spaniards and Portugueſe ſeem, at length, to have retired ſilently, the French and Engliſh claiming the fiſhery excluſively, as an appurtenance to their adjacent colonies, and the profits being too ſmall for nations ſurcharged with the precious metals proceeding from their mines.</p>
            <p>Without materials to trace the intermediate progreſs, we only know that ſo late as 1744, the French employed there five hundred and ſixty-four ſhips, and twenty ſeven thouſand five hundred ſeamen, and took one million two hundred and forty ſix thouſand kentals of fiſh, which was three times the extent to which England and her colonies together carried this fiſhery at that time.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh, in the beginning of the ſeventeenth century, had employed, generally, about one hundred and fifty veſſels in the Newfoundland fiſhery. About 1670, we find them reduced to eighty, and one hundred, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of New-England beginning now to ſupplant them. A little before this, the Britiſh parliament, perceiving that their citizens were unable to ſubſiſt on the ſcanty profits which ſufficed for their poorer competitors, endeavoured to give them ſome advantage by prohibiting the importation of foreign fiſh: and, at the cloſe of the century, they formed ſome regulations for their government and protection: and remitted to them ſome duties. A ſucceſsful war enabled them in 1713 to force from the French, a ceſſion of the iſland of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Under theſe encouragements, the Engliſh and American fiſheries began to thrive. In 1731, we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Engliſh take two hundred thouſand kentals of fiſh, and the Americans two hundred and thirty thouſand, beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe fiſh not fit for European markets. They continue to gain ground, and the French to loſe it, inſomuch, that about 1755, they are ſaid to have been on a par: and, in 1768, the French have only two hundred and fifty-nine veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of twenty-four thouſand four hundred and twenty tons, nine thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred and twenty-two ſeamen, taking two hundred thouſand kentals, while America alone, for ſome three or four years before that, and ſo on to the commencement of the late war, employed ſix hundred and ſixty-five veſſels, of twenty-five thouſand ſix hundred and fifty tons, and four thouſand four hundred and five ſeamne, and took from three hundred and fifty thouſand, to upwards of four hundred thouſand kentals of fiſh, and England a ſtill greater quantity, five hundred and twenty-ſix thouſand kentals, as is ſaid.</p>
            <p>Spain had formally relinquiſhed her pretenſions to a participation in theſe fiſheries, at the cloſe of the preceding war: and, at the end of this, the adjacent continent and iſlands, being divided between the United States, the Engliſh and French (for the laſt retained two ſmall iſlands merely for this object) the right of fiſhing was appropriated to them alſo.</p>
            <p>France, ſenſible of the neceſſity of balancing the power of England on the water, and therefore, of improving every reſource for raiſing ſeamen, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her fiſhermen could not maintain their competition without ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic patronage, adopted the experiment of bounties on her own fiſh, and duties on that of foreign nations brought into her markets. But notwithſtanding this, her fiſheries dwindle, from a change taken place, inſenſibly, in the character of her navigation, which, from being the moſt economical, is now become the moſt expenſive. In 1786, ſhe is ſaid to have employed but ſeven thouſand men in this fiſhery, and to have taken four hundred and twenty-ſix thouſand kentals; and in 1787, but ſix thouſand men, and one hundred and twenty-eight
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023911_0004_0FC28DF69F8FC1F8"/>
thouſand kentals. She ſeems not yet ſenſible that the unthriftineſs of her fiſheries proceeds from the want of economy, and not the want of markets; and that the encouragement of our fiſhery abridges that of a rival nation, whoſe power on the ocean has long threatened the loſs of all balance on that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The plan of the Engliſh government, ſince the peace, has been to prohibit all foreign fiſh in their markets, and they have given from eighteen to fifty pounds ſterling, on every fiſhing veſſel complying with certain conditions. This policy is ſaid to have been ſo far ſucceſsful as to have raiſed the number of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men employed in that buſineſs in 1786, to fourteen thouſand, and the quantity of fiſh taken, to ſeven hundred and thirty-two thouſand kentals. The table No. 1, hereto annexed, will preſent to the eye, this hiſtory more in detail.</p>
            <p>The fiſheries of the United States, annihilated during the war; their veſſels, utenſils, and fiſhermen deſtroyed; their markets in the Mediterranean and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh America loſt, and their produce dutied in thoſe of France, their competitors enabled by bounties to meet and under ſell them at the few markets remaining open, without any public aid, and indeed, paying aids to the public: ſuch were the hopeleſs auſpices, under which this important buſineſs was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Yet it was reſumed, and, aided by the mere force of natural advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they employed, during the years 1786,—7,—8,—9, on an average, five hundred thirty-nine veſſels, of nineteen thouſand one hundred eighty five tons, three thouſand two hundred eighty-ſeven ſeamen, and took two hundred fifty thouſand ſix hundred fifty kentals of fiſh: (ſee No. 2) and an official paper (No. 3) ſhews that, in the laſt of thoſe years, our exportation amounted to three hundred ſeventy-five thouſand and twenty kentals, and thirty thouſand four hundred ſixty-one barrels, deduction made of three thouſand ſeven hundred one kentals, and ſix thouſand three hundred forty three barrels of foreign fiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and re-exported. (See No. 4.) Still, however, the calculations in (No. 5) which accompany the repreſentation, ſhew, that the profits of the ſales in the years 1787,—8, were too ſmall to afford a living to the fiſherman, and on thoſe of 1789, there was ſuch a loſs as to withdraw thirty-three veſſels, of the town of Marblehead, alone, from the further purſuit of this buſineſs: And the apprehenſion is, that, without ſome public aid, thoſe ſtill remaining will continue to withdraw, and this whole commerce be engroſſed by a ſingle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This rapid view of the cod-fiſhery, enables us to diſcern under what policy it has flouriſhed or declined in the hands of other nations, and to mark the fact, that it is too poor a buſineſs to be left to itſelf, even with the nation the moſt advantageouſly ſituated.</p>
            <p>It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which oppoſe us in this conteſt.</p>
            <p>Our advantages are—</p>
            <p n="1">1. The neighbourhood of the great fiſheries, which permits our fiſhermen to bring home their fiſh to be ſalted by their wives and children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſhore fiſheries, ſo near at hand as to enable the veſſels to run into port in a ſtorm, and ſo leſſen the riſk, for which diſtant nations muſt pay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The winter fiſheries, which, like houſhold manufactures, employ por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time which would otherwiſe be uſeleſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſmallneſs of the veſſels, which the ſhortneſs of the voyage enables us to employ, and which, conſequently, require but a ſmall capital.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023911_0005_0FC28DF80C690850"/>5. The cheapneſs of our veſſels, which do not coſt above the half of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fir veſſels, computing price and duration.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Their excellence as ſea boats, which decreaſes the riſk, and quickens the returns.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſuperiority of our mariners in ſkill, activity, enterprize, ſobriety and order.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The cheapneſs of proviſions.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The cheapneſs of caſks, which, of itſelf, is ſaid to be equal to an extra profit of fifteen per cent.</p>
            <p>Theſe advantages are of ſuch force, that, while experience has proved that no other nation can make a mercantile profit on the Newfoundland fiſhery, nor can ſupport it without national aid, we can make a living profit, if vent for our fiſh can be procured.</p>
            <p>Of the diſadvantages oppoſed to us, thoſe which depend on ourſelves, are—</p>
            <p>Tonnage, and naval duties on the veſſels employed in the fiſhery.</p>
            <p>Impoſt duties on ſalt, on tea, rum, ſugar, molaſſes, hooks, lines and leads, duck, cordage and cables, iron, hemp and twine. Uſed in the fiſhery.</p>
            <p>Courſe woollens worn by the fiſhermen; and the poll-tax levied by the State on their perſons. The ſtatement, No. 6, ſhews the amount of theſe, excluſive of the State tax, and drawback on the fiſh exported, to be 5.25 dollars per man, or 57.75 dollars per veſſel of ſixty-five tons. When a buſineſs is ſo nearly in equilibrio, that one can hardly diſcern whether the profit be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it, or not, ſmaller ſums than theſe ſuffice to turn the ſcale againſt it. To theſe diſadvantages, add ineffectual duties on the importation of foreign fiſh. In juſtification of theſe laſt, it is urged that the foreign fiſh received, is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the produce of agriculture. To which it may be anſwered, that the thing given, is more merchantable than that received in exchange, and that agriculture has too many markets to be allowed to take away thoſe of the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries. It will reſt, therefore, with the wiſdom of the legiſlature, to decide whether prohibition ſhould not be oppoſed to prohibition, and high duty to high duty, on the fiſh of other nations: Whether any, and which of the naval and other duties, may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fiſherman in the form of a drawback or bounty; and whether the loſs of markets abroad may not, in ſome degree, be compenſated by creating markets at home; to which might contribute the conſtituting fiſh a part of the military ration, in ſtations, not too diſtant from navigation, a part of the neceſſary ſea ſtores of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and the encouraging private individuals to let the fiſherman ſhare with the cultivator, in furniſhing the ſupplies of the table. A habit introduced from motives of patriotiſm, would ſoon be followed, from motives of taſte: And who will undertake to fix limits to this demand, if it can be once excited, with a nation which doubles, and will long continue to double at very ſhort periods?</p>
            <p>Of the diſadvantages, which depend on others, are—

            </p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe will find its place more aptly, after a review of the condition of our whale fiſhery, ſhall have led us to the ſame point. To this branch of the ſubject, therefore, we will now proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:023911_0006_0FC28DF904FC17B0"/>The whale fiſhery was firſt brought into notice of the ſouthern nations of Europe, in the fifteenth century, by the ſame Biſcayans and Baſques, who led the way to the fiſhery of Newfoundland. They began it on their own coaſts, but ſoon found that the principal reſidence of the whale, was in the northern ſeas, into which, therefore, they purſued him. In 1578, they employed twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five ſhips in that buſineſs; the Dutch and Hamburghers took it up after this, and about the middle of the ſeventeenth century, the former employed about two hundred ſhips, and the latter three hundred and fifty.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh endeavoured alſo to participate of it. In 1672, <note n="‖" place="bottom">25. Car. II. c. 7.</note> they offered to their own fiſhermen a bounty of ſix ſhillings a ton, on the oil they ſhould bring home, and inſtituted at different times, different excluſive companies, all of which failed of ſucceſs. They raiſed their bounty in 1733 <note n="§" place="bottom">6. G. II. c. 33.</note>, to twenty ſhillings a ton on the admeaſurement of the veſſel. In 1740, to thirty ſhillings, with a privilege to the fiſherman againſt being impreſſed. The Baſque-fiſhery, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by poverty alone, had maintained but a feeble exiſtence, before compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors, aided by the bounties of their nation, and was, in fine, annihilated by the war of 1745, at the cloſe of which, the Engliſh bounty was raiſed to forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. From this epoch, their whale fiſhery went on between the limits of twenty-eight and ſixty-ſeven veſſels, till the commencement of the laſt war.</p>
            <p>The Dutch in the mean time, had declined gradually to about one hundred and thirty ſhips, and have ſince that fallen down to leſs than half that number: ſo that their fiſhery, notwithſtanding a bounty of thirty florins a man, as well as that of Hamburgh, is now nearly out of competition.</p>
            <p>In 1715, the Americans began their whale fiſhery. They were led to it at firſt by the whales which preſented themſelves on their coaſts. They attacked them there in ſmall veſſels of forty tons. As the whale, being infeſted, retired from the coaſt, they followed him farther and farther into the ocean, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their veſſels, with their adventures, to ſixty, one hundred, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tons. Having extended their purſuit to the Weſtern Iſlands, they fell in, accidently, with the ſpermacaeti whale, of a different ſpecies from that of Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which alone had been hitherto known in commerce; more fierce and active, and whoſe oil and head-matter was found to be more valuable, as it might be uſed in the interior of houſes without offending the ſmell. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction now firſt aroſe between the northern and ſouthern fiſheries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the object of the former being the Greenland whale, which frequents the northern coaſts and ſeas of Europe and America, that of the latter being the ſpermacaeti whale, which was found in the ſouthern ſeas, from the Weſtern Iſlands and coaſt of Africa to that of Brazil, and ſtill on to the Falkland Iſlands. Here again, within ſoundings, on the coaſt of Brazil, they found a third ſpecies of whale, which they called the black, or Brazil whale, ſmaller than the Greenland, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtill leſs valuable oil, fit only for ſummer uſe, as it becomes opaque at fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty degrees of Farenheit's thermometer, while that of the ſpermacaeti whale is limped to forty-one, and of the Greenland whale to thirty-ſix, of the ſame ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer. It is only worth taking therefore, when it falls in the way of the fiſhermen, but not worth ſeeking, except when they have failed of ſucceſs againſt the ſpermacaeti whale, in which caſe this kind, eaſily found and taken, ſerves to moderate their loſs.</p>
            <p>In 1771, the Americans had one hundred and eighty-three veſſels, of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand eight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern fiſhery, and one hundred and twenty-one veſſels, of fourteen thouſand and twenty tons, in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023911_0007_0FC28DFA8C06D798"/>
ſouthern, navigated by four thouſand and fifty-nine men. At the beginning of the late war, they had one hundred and ſeventy-ſeven veſſels in the northern, and one hundred and thirty-two in the ſouthern fiſhery.</p>
            <p>At that period, our fiſhery being ſuſpended, the Engliſh ſeized the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of puſhing theirs. They gave additional bounties of five hundred, four hundred, three hundred, two hundred, one hundred pounds ſterling, annually, to the five ſhips, which ſhould take the greateſt quantities of oil. The effect of which was ſuch, as, by the year 1786, to double the quantity of common oil neceſſary for their own conſumption. Finding, on a review of the ſubject, at that time, that their bounties had coſt the government thirteen pounds ten ſhillings ſterling a man annually, or ſixty per cent. on the cargoes, a part of which went conſequently to eaſe the purchaſes of this article made by foreign nations, they reduced the northern bounty from forty to thirty ſhillings the ton of admeaſurement.</p>
            <p>They had ſome little time before turned their attention to the ſouthern fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, had given very great bounties in it, <note n="†" place="bottom">26 G. III. c. 50.</note> and had invited the fiſhermen of the United States, to conduct their enterprizes. Under their guidance, and with ſuch encouragement, this fiſhery, which had only begun with them in 1784 or 1785, was riſing into value. In 1788, they increaſed <note n="*" place="bottom">28 G. III. c. 20.</note> their bounties, and the temptations to our fiſhermen, under the general deſcription of <hi>foreigners who had been employed in the whale-fiſhery,</hi> to paſs over with their families and veſſels to the Britiſh dominions either in America or Europe, but preferably to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The effect of theſe meaſures had been prepared by our whale oils becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject, in their market, to the foreign duty of eighteen pounds five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſterling the ton, which, being more than equal to the price of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oil, operated as a prohibition on that, and gave to their own ſpermacaeti oil a preferance over ours to that amount. The particulars of this hiſtory are preſented to the eye, more in detail, in the table No. 7.</p>
            <p>The fiſhermen of the United States, left without reſource by the loſs of their market, began to think of accepting the Britiſh invitation, and of removing— ſome to Nova-Scotia, preferring ſmaller advantages in the neighbourhood of their ancient country and friends, others to Great-Britain, poſtponing country and friends to high premiums.</p>
            <p>The government of France could not be inattentive to theſe proceedings. They ſaw the danger of letting four or five thouſand ſeamen, of the beſt in the world, be transferred to the marine ſtrength of another nation, and carry over with them an art, which they poſſeſſed almoſt excluſively. To give time for a counter plan, the Marquis de la Fayette, the valuable friend and citizen of this, as well as that country, wrote to a gentleman in Boſton to diſſuade the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from accepting the Britiſh propoſals and to aſſure them that their friends in France would endeavour to do ſomething for them. A veſſel was then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Halifax, at Nantucket, to take off thoſe who had propoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. Two families had gone aboard, and others were going. In this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the letter arriving, ſuſpended their deſigns. Not another went aboard, and the veſſel returned to Halifax with only the two families.</p>
            <p>The plan adopted by the French miniſtry, very different from that of the firſt mover, was to give a counter invitation to the Nantucket men to remove and ſettle in Dunkirk, offering them a bounty of fifty livres (between nine and ten dollars) a ton on the admeaſurement of the veſſels they ſhould equip for the whale fiſhery, with ſome other advantages. Nine families only, of thirty-three
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023911_0008_0FC28DFCA61AC6A8"/>
perſons, accepted this invitation. This was in 1785. In 1786, the miniſtry were led to ſee, that their invitation would produce but little effect, and that the true means of preventing the emigration of our fiſhermen to the Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, would be to enable them ſtill to follow their calling from their native country, by giving them a new market for their oils, inſtead of the old one they had loſt. The duties were, therefore, abated on American whale oil immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and a further abatement promiſed by the letter, No. 8, and in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1787, the arret, No. 9, was paſſed.</p>
            <p>The rival fiſhermen immediately endeavoured to turn this meaſure to their own advantage, by pouring their whale oils into the markets of France, where they were enabled, by the great premiums received from their government, perhaps too by extraordinary indemnifications, to underſell both the French and American fiſhermen. To repel this meaſure, France ſhut her ports to all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign fiſh oils whatever, by the arret No. 10. The Britiſh whale fiſhery fell, in conſequence, the enſuing year, from two hundred and twenty-two to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-eight ſhips. But this general excluſion had palſied our fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alſo. On the ſeventh of December, 1788, therefore, by the arret No. 11, the ports of France, ſtill remaining ſhut to all other nations, were again opened to the produce of the whale fiſheries of the United States; continuing, however, their endeavours to recover a ſhare in this fiſhery themſelves, by the aid of our fiſhermen. In 1784,—5,—6, they had had four ſhips; in 1787, three; in 1788, ſeventeen in the two fiſheries, of four thouſand five hundred ton. Theſe coſt them in bounty, two hundred and twenty-five thouſand livres, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided on one thouſand five hundred and fifty tons of oil, the quantity they took, amounted to one hundred and forty-five livres (near twenty-ſeven dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) the ton; and on about one hundred natives on board the ſeventeen ſhips, (for there were one hundred and fifty Americans engaged by the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age) came to two thouſand two hundred and fifty livres, or about four hundred and ſixteen dollars and two-thirds a man.</p>
            <p>We have had during the years 1787, 1788, 1789, on an average, ninety-one veſſels, of five thouſand eight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern, and thirty-one, of four thouſand three hundred and ninety tons, in the ſouthern fiſhery. See No. 12.</p>
            <p>Theſe details will enable Congreſs to ſee with what a competition we have to ſtruggle for the continuance of this fiſhery, not to ſay it's increaſe. Againſt prohibitory duties in one country, and bounties to the adventurers in both of thoſe which are contending with each other for the ſame object, ours have no auxiliaries but poverty and rigorous economy. The buſineſs, unaided, is a wretched one. The Dutch have peculiar advantages for the northern fiſhery, as being within ſix or eight days ſail of the grounds, as navigating with more economy than any other nation in Europe, their ſeamen content with lower wages, and their merchants with lower profits. Yet the memorial No. 13, from a committee of the whale merchants to the States General of Holland in the year 1775, ſtates that fourteen millions of guilders, equal to five millions ſix hundred thouſand dollars, had been loſt in that fiſhery in forty-ſeven years, being about one hundred and twenty thouſand dollars a year. The States General thereupon gave a bounty of thirty guilders a man to the fiſhermen. A perſon intimately acquainted with the Britiſh whale fiſhery, and whoſe information merits confidence, has given aſſurance that the ſhips employed in their northern fiſhery in 1788, ſunk eight hundred pounds each on an average, more than the amount of the produce and bounties. An Engliſh ſhip of three hundred tons and forty-two ſeamen in this fiſhery generally brings home, after a four months voyage, twenty-five ton of oil, worth four hundred and thirty-ſeven pounds ten ſhillings ſterling; but the wages of the officers and ſeamen will be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023911_0009_0FC28DFD823BB760"/>
four hundred pounds, there remain but thirty-ſeven pounds ten ſhillings, not worth taking into account towards the outfit and merchants profit. Theſe then muſt be paid by the government; and it is on this idea that the Britiſh bounty is calculated.</p>
            <p>Our veſſels for the northern fiſhery average ſixty-four tons, and coſt when built, fitted out, and victualled for their firſt voyage, about three thouſand dollars. They have taken on an average the three laſt years, according to the ſtatement No. 12, eighteen tons of oil, worth, at our market, nine hundred dollars, which are to pay all expences, and ſubſiſt the fiſherman and merchant. Our veſſels for the ſouthern fiſhery average one hundred and forty tons, and coſt, when built, fitted out, and victualled, for their firſt voyage, about ſix thouſand five hundred dollars. They have taken on an average the three laſt years, according to the ſame ſtatement, thirty-two tons of oil, each worth at our market three thouſand two hundred dollars, which are, in like manner, to pay all expences and ſubſiſt the owners and navigators. Theſe expences are great, as the voyages are generally of twelve months duration. No hope can ariſe of their condition being bettered by an augmentation of the price of oil. This is kept down by the competition of the vegetable oils, which anſwer the ſame purpoſes, not quite ſo well, but well enough to become preferable, were the price to be raiſed, and ſo well indeed as to be more generally uſed than the fiſh oils for lighting houſes and cities.</p>
            <p>The American whale fiſhery is principally followed by the inhabitants of the iſland of Nantucket, a ſand bar of about fifteen miles long and three broad, capable of maintaining by its agriculture about twenty families: but it employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe fiſheries before the war, between five and ſix thouſand men and boys; and in the only harbour it poſſeſſes, it had one hundred and forty veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, one hundred and thirty-two of which were of the larger kind, as being employed in the ſouthern fiſhery. In agriculture then, they have no reſource, and, if that of their fiſhery cannot be purſued from their own habitations, it is natural they ſhould ſeek others from which it can be followed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably thoſe where they will find a sameneſs of language, religion, laws, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and kindred. A foreign emiſſary has lately been among them, for the purpoſe of renewing the invitations to a change of ſituation. But attached to their native country, they prefer continuing in it, if their continuance there can be made ſupportable.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the queſtion, what relief does the condition of this fiſhery require?</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A remiſſion of duties on the articles uſed for their calling.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to ſeek a competition with them in or from our ports.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Free markets abroad.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The remiſſion of duties will ſtand on nearly the ſame ground with that to the cod fiſhermen.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. The only nation whoſe oil is brought hither for competition with our own, makes ours pay a duty of about eighty-two dollars the ton, in their ports. Theirs is brought here too, to be re-ſhipped fraudulently under our flag into ports where it could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered by ours, if we mean to preſerve our own admiſſion into them. The</p>
            <p n="3">3d, And principal object, is to find markets for the vent of oil.</p>
            <p>Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Pruſſia, Ruſſia, the Hanſe towns, ſupply themſelves and ſomething more. Spain and Italy receive ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from England, and need the leſs as their ſkies are clearer. France is the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023911_0010_0FC28E0A70C50410"/>
only country which can take our ſurplus, and they take principally of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oil; as the habit is but commencing with them of aſcribing a juſt value to that of the ſpermacaeti whale. Some of this, however, finds its vent there. There was, indeed, a particular intereſt perpetually ſoliciting the excluſion of our oils from their markets. The late government there ſaw well, that what we ſhould loſe thereby, would be gained by others, not by themſelves. And we are to hope that the preſent government, as wiſe and friendly, will alſo view us, not as rivals, but as co-operators againſt a common rival. Friendly arrangements with them, and accommodation to mutual intereſt, rendered eaſier by friendly diſpoſitions exiſting on both ſides, may long ſecure to us this important reſource for our ſeamen. Nor is it the intereſt of the fiſherman alone, which calls for the cultivation of friendly arrangements with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides five-eighths of our whale oil, and two-thirds of our ſalted fiſh, they take from us one-fourth of our tobacco, three-fourths of our live ſtock (No. 14.) a conſiderable and growing portion of our rice, great ſupplies oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally of other grain; in 1789, which, indeed, was extraordinary, four millions of buſhels of wheat, and upwards of a million of buſbels of rye and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley (No. 15.) and nearly the whole carried in our own veſſels (No. 16.) They are a free market now, and will in time be a valuable one for our ſhips and ſhip-timber, potaſh and peltry.</p>
            <p>England is the market for the greater part of our ſpermacaeti oil. They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on all our oils, a duty of eighteen pounds five ſhillings ſterling the ton, which, as to the common kind, is a prohibition, as has been before obſerved, and as to that of the ſpermacaeti, gives a preference of theirs over ours to that amount, ſo as to leave in the end, but a ſcanty benefit to the fiſherman; and not long ſince, by a change of conſtruction, without any change of the law, it was made to exclude our oils from their ports, when carried in our own veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. On ſome change of circumſtance, it was conſtrued back again to the reception of our oils, on paying always, however the ſame duty of eighteen pounds five ſhillings. This ſerves to ſhew that the tenure by which we hold the admiſſion of this commodity in their markets, is as precarious as it is hard. Nor can it be announced, that there is any diſpoſition on their part, to arrange this or any other commercial matter, to mutual convenience. The exparte regulations which they have begun for mounting their navigation on the ruins of ours, can only be oppoſed by counter regulations on our part. And the loſs of ſeamen, the natural conſequence of loſt and obſtructed markets for our fiſh and oil, calls in the firſt place, for ſerious and timely attention. It will be too late when the ſeaman ſhall have changed his vocation, or gone over to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſt. If we cannot recover and ſecure for him theſe important branches of employment, it behoves us to replace them by others equivalent. We have three nurſeries for forming ſeamen;—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our coaſting trade, already on a ſafe footing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our fiſheries, which in ſpite of natural advantages, give juſt cauſe of anxiety.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our carrying trade, the only reſource of indemnification for what we loſe in the other. The produce of the United States, which is carried to foreign markets, is extremely bulky. That part of it now in the hands of foreigners, and which we may reſume into our own, without touching the rights of thoſe nations who have met us in fair arrangements by treaty, or the intereſts of thoſe, who, by their voluntary regulations, have paid ſo juſt and liberal a reſpect to our intereſts, as being meaſured back to them again, places both parties on as good ground, perhaps, as treaties could place them: the proportion, I ſay, of our carrying trade, which may be reſumed without affecting either of theſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nations, will find conſtant employment for ten thouſand ſeamen, be worth two millions of dollars annually, will go on augmenting with the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023911_0011_0FC28E0E09A22FC0"/>
of the United States, ſecure to us a full indemnification for the ſeamen we loſs, and be taken wholly from thoſe who force us to this act of ſelf-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, in navigation.</p>
            <p>Hence too would follow that their Newfoundland ſhips, not receiving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions from us in their bottoms, nor permitted (by a law of their own) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in ours, muſt draw their ſubſiſtence from Europe, which would encreaſe that part of their expences in the proportion of four to ſeven, and ſo far oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as a duty towards reſtoring the level between them and us. The tables No. 2, and 12, will ſhow the quantity of tonnage, and conſequently the maſs of ſeamen whoſe intereſts are in diſtreſs; and No. 17, the materials for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification.</p>
            <p>If regulations, exactly the counterpart of thoſe eſtabliſhed againſt us, would be ineffectual from a difference of circumſtances, other regulations equivalent can give no reaſonable ground of complaint to any nation. Admitting their right of keeping their markets to themſelves, ours cannot be denied of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out carrying trade to ourſelves. And if there be any thing unfriendly in this, it was in the firſt example.</p>
            <p>The loſs of ſeamen unnoticed, would be followed by other loſſes in a long train. If we have no ſeamen, our ſhips will be uſeleſs, conſequently our ſhip-timber, iron and hemp; our ſhip-building will be at an end, ſhip carpenters go over to other nations, our young men have no call to the ſea, our produce carried in foreign bottoms, be ſaddled with war-freight and inſurance in times of war; and the hiſtory of the laſt one hundred years, ſhews that the nation which is our carrier has three years of war for every four years of peace. (No. 18) We loſe, during the ſame periods, the carriage for belligerant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which the neutrality of our flag would render an incalculable ſource of profit; we loſe at this moment the carriage of our own produce to the annual amount of two millions of dollars, which in the poſſible progreſs of the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may extend to five or ſix millions, the worth of the whole, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the proportion of the increaſe of our numbers. It is eaſier as well as better, to ſtop this train at its entrance, than when it ſhall have ruined or baniſhed whole claſſes of uſeful and induſtrious citizens.</p>
            <p>It will doubtleſs be thought expedient that the reſumption ſuggeſted ſhould take effect ſo gradually as not to endanger the loſs of produce for the want of tranſportation; but that, in order to create tranſportation, the whole plan ſhould be developed, and made known at once, that the individuals who may be diſpoſed to lay themſelves out for the carrying buſineſs may make their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations on a full view of all circumſtances.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the hiſtorical view we have taken of theſe fiſheries proves they are ſo poor in themſelves as to come to nothing with diſtant nations, who do not ſupport them from their treaſury. We have ſeen that the advantages of our poſition place our fiſheries on a ground ſomewhat higher, ſuch as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our treaſury from the neceſſity of giving them ſupport, but not to permit it to draw ſupport from them, nor to diſpenſe the government from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of effectuating free markets for them, that for the great proportion of our ſalted fiſh, for our common oil, and a part of our ſpermacaeti oil, markets may perhaps, be preſerved by friendly arrangements towards thoſe nations whoſe arrangements are friendly to us, and the reſidue be compenſated by giving to the ſeamen thrown out of buſineſs the certainty of employment in another branch of which we have the ſole diſpoſal.</p>

            <p>WE the ſubſcribers, being a Committee appointed by the owners of fiſhing veſſels, in the town of Marblehead, to take into conſideration the many griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and burdens the cod fiſhery now labours under, and to make a ſtatement of them; which ſtatement ſo made, to be handed to Col. Glover, by him to be laid before the Committee of the General Court, appointed to conſider the ſame, do report the ſaid ſtatement as follows, viz.
<list>
                  <item>1. Impoſt duties on ſalt.</item>
                  <item>2. duties and exciſe on rum, ſugar and molaſſes.</item>
                  <item>3. on hooks, lines and leads.</item>
                  <item>4. on coarſe woollens.</item>
                  <item>5. on duck, cordage and cables.</item>
                  <item>6. on hemp, iron and twine.</item>
                  <item>7. Tonnage and naval duties.</item>
                  <item>8. The ineffectual duties on foreign fiſh.</item>
                  <item>9. The duties our fiſheries pay at foreign markets, while the fiſheries of France and England receive large privileges and bounties from their governments.</item>
                  <item>10. The heavy poll-tax laid on the fiſhermen.</item>
                  <item>11. Exciſe on New-England rum.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It appears to the committee from an exact inveſtigation, that the earnings and expences of the fiſhing ſchooners of this town, for the years 1787,—8,—9, were to the earnings of each ſchooner, viz.
<list>
                  <label>For the year 1787,</label>
                  <item>£. 145</item>
                  <label>For the year 1788,</label>
                  <item>137</item>
                  <label>For the year 1789,</label>
                  <item>82</item>
                  <label>And that the annual average expences of theſe veſſels, incluſive of inſurance,</label>
                  <item>124</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It alſo appears, that the number of ſchooners employed in the grand bank fiſhery for the year 1789, were one hundred and twenty-four, nineteen of which were property of perſons not belonging to the town, and of which number thirty-three ſail have been taken out of the fiſhery from the declenſion of the buſineſs, excluſive of the aforementioned diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:023911_0016_0FC28E2CD0096860"/>That the bounty granted to the fiſhery by Congreſs, as a compenſation for the duty on ſalt, this Committee humbly conceive will not operate to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo effectually, as if paid direct into the hands of the owners of the veſſels, inſtead of the ſhippers of the fiſh.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS it is the intention of the King to favor, as much as poſſible, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the United States, I have the honor to communicate to you the meaſures that have been taken on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>By a letter of the 9th January, 1784, to the Marquis de la Fayette, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that inſtead of two free ports promiſed by the treaty with the United States, the King had determined to grant them four, which has been done; and I promiſed him that I would direct my attention to the cuſtom-houſes and duties which are prejudicial to commerce, obſerving however that this object demanded long inveſtigations, which are not yet compleated. By another letter I informed him, that his Majeſty had ſuppreſſed the duties upon the exportation of brandy, and I expected this ſuppreſſion would be uſeful to the American commerce; I likewiſe promiſed him that the duties of the King and the admiralty, payable by an American veſſel on her arrival in a French port, ſhould be diminiſhed and reduced to a ſingle duty, and regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of maſts and draught of water, and not by the uncertain eſtimation of meaſurement. This reduction requires a perfect knowledge of all the duties paid in our ports; and as they are of various kinds, the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I have ordered to be made are not ready.</p>
            <p>You know, ſir, that the King has appointed a Committee for the particular purpoſe of examining our commercial connections with the United States, and that the Marquis de la Fayette has preſented a project conformable to the ideas contained in your letter to the Count de Vergennes; but you will conſider how imprudent it would be to hazard by a change of ſyſtem, the product of a branch of revenue which amounts to twenty-eight millions, upon an article which is not of the firſt neceſſity—after a long diſcuſſion of every means that can be at preſent adopted to encourage the importation of American tobacco, it has been reſolved not to break the agreement made with Mr. Morris, but that after the expiration of this contract, no ſimilar one ſhall be made, and that in the mean while, the farmers general ſhould be obliged to purchaſe, annually, about fifteen thouſand hogſheads of American tobacco imported directly from the United States, in French or American veſſels at the ſame price, on the ſame conditions which have been ſtipulated by the contract with Mr. Morris.</p>
            <p>You will remember, ſir, that before a regulation could be made in favor of the importation of whale oil, the Marquis de la Fayette had taken a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular arrangement with Mr. Sangrain for the ſale of this article, to the amount of eight hundred thouſand livres, and that I had granted him paſſports in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render this firſt importation, free from all duties whatſoever. The ſame Mr. Sangrain, afterwards made an agreement with ſome merchants of Boſton, to the yearly amount of four hundred thouſand livres, to laſt during ſix years, for which his Majeſty has granted the ſame favors which are enjoyed by the Hanſe Towns.</p>
            <p>This matter having been lately more extenſively examined, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to whom the Committee communicated their wiſh, agreeable to the Marquis de la Fayette's demand and your opinion, entirely to aboliſh all duties upon oil, have found that at preſent, they could not conſent to it, on account of the engagements made with other powers. All that could be done was to grant, during ten years, to the whale oil, ſpermacaeti, and whatever is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023911_0019_0FC28E3442DDA868"/>
within theſe denominations, imported from the United States in French or American veſſels, the ſame favors, the ſame diminution of duties which the Hanſe Towns enjoy.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty hopes that the commercial connections between the United States and France, will become ſo conſiderable as to engage him to continue the effect of this proviſional determination; and as it has been obſerved by the Committee, that a great duty of fabrication has been hitherto paid upon the moſt favored whale oil, and even upon the national, his Majeſty conſents to aboliſh the duty of fabrication with reſpect to the whale oil and ſpermacaeti, directly imported from the United States in French or American bottoms, ſo that this oil and ſpermacaeti ſhall not pay, during ten years, any other duty but ſeven livres ten ſols, and ten ſols per livre; this laſt augmentation of ten ſols per livre, ſhall ceaſe in 1790.</p>
            <p>It has alſo been determined that particular informations be taken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſumption of Carolina rice in France, and that means be deviſed to encourage the importation of this article.</p>
            <p>Repreſentations having been made concerning the conſiderable duties laid upon the importation of pot-aſh and pearl-aſh, alſo upon beaver-ſkins and hair and raw leather, his Majeſty has ſuppreſſed all duties whatſoever upon thoſe articles, if imported of the growth of the United States in French or Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican veſſels. He is likewiſe deſirous of encouraging every article of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can fur.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty has moreover conſented to aboliſh all duties upon maſts, yards, keels for ſhips, red cedar, green oak, and in a word, all kinds of wood fit for ſhip-building imported from the United States in French or American veſſels.</p>
            <p>The Committee having likewiſe repreſented, that there was a duty of five per cent. on the purchaſe of foreign built ſhips, and that this duty was preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the ſale of American veſſels, his Majeſty has been pleaſed to exempt from all duties, the purchaſe of ſhips which ſhall be proved to be built in the United States.</p>
            <p>Great duties having formerly been laid upon all ſhrubs, trees and ſeed, his Majeſty has aboliſhed theſe duties, when the above articles ſhall be imported in French or American veſſels.</p>
            <p>It having been repreſented that the ſtate of Virginia had ordered the arms for her militia to be made in France, an order is paſſed, that the prohibitions which hitherto have prevented the exportation of arms and gunpowder, as well as the duties laid upon theſe articles when exported by permiſſion, ſhall be aboliſhed; and that whenever the United States ſhall think it expedient to export from France, arms, guns and gunpowder, they ſhall have full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, provided theſe articles are exported in French or American veſſels, and they ſhall be liable only to a very ſmall duty, in order to facilitate the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of exports.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, his Majeſty has received with the ſame favor, the applications made to the Committee for the ſuppreſſion of the heavy duties actually paid upon books and papers of all kinds: the King aboliſhes all theſe duties when the above articles ſhall be exported to the United States in French or American veſſels.</p>
            <p>It is with great pleaſure, ſir, that I inform you of the diſpoſitions of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; they are a new teſtimony of his great deſire to eſtabliſh the moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate commercial connection between the two nations, and of the favorable
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023911_0020_0FC28E3E733469E8"/>
attention he will always pay to any propoſal made in the name of the United States of America.</p>

               <hi>N. B.</hi> About one quarter of the ſpermacaeti is head-matter, one quarter of which was exported to Great-Britain, the remainder manufactured into can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. The ſpermacaeti oil, previous to the revolution, was moſtly exported to Great-Britain. The average price in that market for five years previous to the war, about forty pounds ſterling for the ſpermacaeti oil, and fifty pounds for head. The whale oil was formerly about one half exported to the French and Engliſh Weſt-India iſlands, the other half ſold in the United States. The average price of this oil, about ſeventy dollars per ton. A whale producing one hundred and twenty barrels whale oil, will generally produce two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds bone, which was chiefly exported to Great-Britain, the price about half a dollar per pound: a whale producing fifty to ſixty barrels, will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce neareſt ten pounds of bone to a barrel of oil.—The average price of oil for three years paſt, as follows, viz.

            <head>—No. XIII.— Extract from a Memorial preſented to the States General in <hi>1775,</hi> by a Committee of the Merchants engaged in the Whale Fiſhery.</head>
            <p>THE whale fiſhery is of great importance to Holland, as the produce yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſea may properly be conſidered as our country produce, which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh employ for thouſands of hands; all the apparatus being made, and the veſſels fitted out in our own country.</p>
            <list>
               <label>A new veſſel from 110 to 116 feet, including anchors, cables, rigging, &amp;c. coſt from</label>

            <p>From theſe outfits the country evidently derives real advantages, whereas thoſe immediately concerned riſque their property, as has formerly been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that during a period of forty-ſeven years, fourteen millions have been loſt in this traffick, beſides the loſs ariſing from the decreaſe of capital.</p>
            <p>The inſtances which have proved profitable to the owners are but few; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er loſſes are to be apprehended from the preſent high prices of all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and materials. To clear the expences of a voyage, each veſſel muſt at leaſt bring a return of fifteen thouſand guilders, excluſive of one thouſand guilders for inſurance, beſides the yearly decreaſe of capital, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated on an average, at thirty thouſand guilders for every veſſel completely equipped, making the ſum of three million eight hundred and ſeventy thouſand guilders for one hundred and twenty-nine veſſels which have been fitted out this preſent year, and which muſt each fetch out of the ſea twenty tons of net goods to clear themſelves. The proſpect of doing this is very unfavorable, as all our neighbours uſe greater exertions in that trade than ever; to which they are encouraged by the aid of their reſpective governments, in particular the Britiſh, who allow forty ſhillings ſterling per ton to each veſſel which is employed in the whale fiſhery; by which means the number of their whaling veſſels have, ſince the year 1749, (when the bounty was granted) increaſed from two to one hundred and nine veſſels, which in the ſpring 1775, ſailed from England and Scotland, meaſuring in the whole thirty-three thouſand three hundred and eighteen tons, and amounting, at forty ſhillings per ton, to ſixty-ſix thouſand ſix hundred and thirty-ſix pounds, equal to ſeven hundred and thirty-two thouſand nine hundred and ninety-ſix guilders, which amounts upon an average to ſix thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty-five guilders for each veſſel.</p>
            <p>The fiſheries in Sweden and Denmark have alſo received additional ſtrength from the encouragements offered by their governments, without which they would have but little inducement to that trade; ſo that inſtead of Holland for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly exceeding all the other nations together in the whale fiſhery, <hi>they</hi> at preſent exceed the Dutch by one third in the number of veſſels—nay, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land alone now ſends out nearly as many veſſels as Holland.</p>
            <p>Another obſtacle preſents itſelf with regard to the whale-bone trade. Of this article Holland formerly ſhipped five-eighth parts to Great-Britain, of which ſale we are now deprived, on account of the high duty impoſed on all foreign whale-bone imported into that kingdom, and which may be conſidered as an additional premium on the fiſhery of that nation, amounting commonly to fifty guilders per one hundred weight. Our exportation of whale oil is alſo on the decline. Hamburgh and Bremen receive great ſupplies, partly from their own fiſheries and partly from England and Ruſſia, ſo as to be able to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023911_0026_0FC28E548CB4D2A8"/>
furniſh the greateſt part of Germany with that article. France and Spain are moſtly ſupplied from England; and as it has been always computed, that three-fourths of the product of our fiſheries are exported, the competition of thoſe and other rival nations will ſcarcely leave a foreign market for us: our own provinces and the river Rhine, will be our limits.</p>
            <p>Another diſadvantage ought not to paſs unnoticed, which is, that the prices of the produce of the fiſheries are conſiderably reduced; the whale-bone of the lateſt voyage having already been ſold as low as ninety guilders or leſs, which gives a loſs. Oil may alſo in caſe of a ſucceſsful ſeaſon, fall from ſixty to forty guilders per twelve ſtekan (ſixty-three gallons); and in that caſe, veſſels that return with one half or two thirds of their cargo, muſt ſink money.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt material circumſtances that impede the progreſs of our fiſheries. The effect of the premium granted by the Britiſh parliament has already been ſeverely felt by our Greenland fleets, having, ſince that period, decreaſed one third in number.</p>
