            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Indeed all <hi>Christians</hi> have alwayes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this Acknowledgment, long before, as well as ever since the Dayes of <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer Lives, and that He shall stand at the Latter Day upon the Earth; and though Worms Destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh I shall see God.</hi> And even in that <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> which the Jews themselves at this Day embrace, their Eleventh Fundamental Article is, the <hi>Eternal Judgment.</hi>

                  <p>To what the <hi>People</hi> of God, have thus Received as the <hi>Faith delivered unto the Saints,</hi> they have had the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of God, most abundantly given their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Testimony.

insisted on. Very many of the <hi>Sermons</hi> Preached by our Lord Jesus Christ, and all the <hi>Letters</hi> written by His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, do set the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> before our Eyes. Yea, not only the <hi>Approach,</hi> but also the <hi>Process</hi> of this wonderful <hi>Day,</hi> is diverse times Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in these <hi>Lively Oracles.</hi> The Holy Spirit of God, hath Chosen to make one of the Last Clauses in the Bible, an Admonition unto us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about; the very last Lines of the last Advice we have had from Heaven, are to this purpose, <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ will shortly come to Judge the World.</hi> And with the <hi>Assertions</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> concerning this matter, the Apostle in a certain place tells us, the <hi>Accusings</hi> and the <hi>Excusings</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> do join their Testimony thereunto. The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of Conscience upon the Sinner is, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it; <hi>Futuri Judic Prejudicium;</hi> a presage of a future Judgment.

FIRST. A dolorous Exclamation, with the dismal season of it.</p>
                  <p>The out cry here, is like that of drowning Marriners, or routed Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY. The matter of the Exclamation thus amazing, which causes all the great Hectors, and Herods, and <hi>Belshazzars</hi> of the World, to tremble.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is not, <hi>Behold, the Judge Cometh!</hi>—but,—the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, the Delight of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Tis good Advice, Are you Ready! <hi>Dr. Usher</hi> used to say unto some Persons of Quality. <hi>Madam, Be ready, Be ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIRDLY. A Command unto all, Especially the Virgins, <hi>Go out to meet Aim.</hi> Even Hypocrites count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a fair way to meet the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Of old, Marriage was at <hi>Midnight,</hi> to show the <hi>Modesty</hi> of Marriage. You are by Ministers now <hi>Contracted,</hi> and are to be by Angels at last <hi>Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> unto Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Ten <hi>Virgins</hi> are professors of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000614_0084_0FA9AB7732ECAAB8"/>
Sorts. A <hi>Wise</hi> Virgin is a Soul that takes the seasons of Grace, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Beauty of Jesus Christ. A <hi>Foolish,</hi> is one, that regards not the Word of God. <hi>Midnight,</hi> is the End of the World, before the Morning of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> The Cry is an <hi>Angelical Voice:</hi> as soon as the Clock strikes Twelve, then the Angel sets his <hi>Trumpet</hi> to his mouth, and proclameth so.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apantesis,</hi>—the Meeting here Expressed, is the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> when the Earth and Sea too shall yield their <hi>Dead;</hi> and the very Entrails of the Fishes shall be raked by the Trident of the <hi>Archangel.</hi> Never was there such a Terror as then will be! But the Saints are then led unto the <hi>Nuptial</hi> in the New Jerusalem.</p>
