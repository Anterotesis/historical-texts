            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS ON THE PROPOSED PLAN OF AN EMISSION OF PAPER.</head>
            <p>HOW long a conſtitution, under which we enjoy equal rights, may endure, it is not for ſhort-ſighted mortals to predict. In the annals of the world there are few inſtances, where a direct attack has been made by any part of the citizens of a free ſtate, againſt the liberty of the reſt. It has ever been the practice of thoſe, who meditated its deſtruction, to avert ſuſpicion from themſelves, by warning the people of danger from others. Thus it is that a people are ſometimes precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated into that ſtate of anarchy and confuſion, which is moſt favourable to inſidious deſigns.</p>
            <p>Although the frequent proſtitution of profeſſions renders it almoſt diſgraceful to uſe them, I muſt aſſure you, that from the moment I began ſeriouſly to reflect, your happineſs has been dear to my heart. At the hazard of my peace and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, without the leaſt hope of reward, and with the certain proſpect of provoking the malice of weak and wicked minds, I have for many years devoted my attention to the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. On this head however I ſhould have maintained a becoming ſilence, had not certain ungenerous remarks been thrown out in a place where it was impoſſible for me, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manner, to expoſe them. Beſides theſe there is a recent publication, in which my real name has been uſed with an unwarrantable freedom; but this I conſider as the effuſion of habitual inſolence, not meriting a more particular notice. A ſufficient anſwer may be collected from the following remarks.</p>
            <p>When a diſagreement takes place between the two branches of the legiſlature, on a queſtion involving with it other queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſtill greater moment, every freeman in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is concerned in its deciſion. The freedom of the preſs has been indirectly attacked by men who ſhould guard it with the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020403_0003_0FAF021F6A000F58"/>
fondeſt care. It has been repeatedly aſſerted, that the officers of government have exerted their influence, acquired through public money, in oppoſing the wiſhes of the people, and that therefore they have merited puniſhment from the repreſentatives of the people. An aſſertion repeatedly made is generally the reſult of reflection. The purpoſe of this is to wound the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſome, reſtrain others by their fears, and bind the reſt by their intereſts. The ſpirit of a genuine republican muſt revolt at the idea. What? Shall he, who in ſome reſpects, is conſtituted the guardian of your rights, be himſelf debarred the common right of ſpeaking his opinions? Does his ſituation ſeparate his intereſts from thoſe of the people, or render him leſs capable than the moſt illiterate demagogue of deciding on queſtions of policy?</p>
            <p>Thus far is premiſed to remove unreaſonable prejudice. The author has been charged with adhering to the ſenate, courting their favour, and repoſing a faith in their deciſions. The truth is, on the matureſt deliberation, he thinks them juſtifiable in rejecting the bill for an emiſſion of paper, and it is partly his intention to adduce ſome arguments in their vindication.</p>
            <p>When a man coolly and deliberately acts againſt his intereſt, there is a preſumption, that he conceives himſelf in the right. It cannot eſcape your penetration, that if a ſervant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were capable of ſacrificing on the altar of ambition his opinion, his conſcience and his duty, he would, with every appearance of the moſt fervent zeal, eſpouſe the cauſe of thoſe who might moſt effectually requite his endeavours.</p>
            <p>The ſenate having rejected the propoſed plan of an emiſſion upon loan, the houſe of delegates declines all overtures of a conference, and determines to cloſe the ſeſſion without making any proviſion for the neceſſary ſupplies. In an addreſs to the people they ſtate the diſagreement, and urge many arguments in ſupport of their own ſyſtem. They tell them an appeal is made by both branches of the legiſlature, that the opinion of the people only can decide, and that both branches will be equally bound by inſtructions. The ſenate makes no direct addreſs; but as they conceive their fellow-citizens entitled to know the principles of their conduct, the meſſages reſpecting the money bill are publiſhed by their direction. In one of theſe is a declaration, that they make no appeal; and they ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the inconveniencies which they apprehend may flow from the precedent. The houſe of delegates adjourns to the 20th of March, and the ſenate to the 20th of April.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:020403_0004_0FAF022017296D98"/>This brief narrative ſuggeſts a variety of points, a thorough diſcuſſion whereof is abſolutely neceſſary, before you can pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently take any ſtep on this peculiar great occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place it is proper to decide, whether an appeal is made by both branches, and your inſtructions requeſted by each. Whatever might <hi>poſſibly</hi> be implied from the ſenate's firſt meſſage, their ſubſequent expreſs declaration, publiſhed at the ſame time, muſt render void that implication. This conſtruction is conformable to a known maxim of law and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe—<hi>Expreſſum facit ceſſare tacitum</hi>; that is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a liberal tranſlation, <hi>poſitive words ſet aſide that which without them would be implied.</hi> I conceive, that nothing can be fairly conſtrued into an appeal to the people, except an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſoliciting their inſtructions in the moſt plain unequivocal terms.</p>
            <p>But it is inſiſted by a crowd of writers, that although the ſenate make no direct application, if the people ſhall think proper to inſtruct, the ſenate is conſtitutionally bound to obey.</p>
            <p>This ſecond point muſt be determined on a view of the conſtitution and the declaration of rights. To me this point alſo is abundantly clear, from the ſingle conſideration, that the conſtitution creates two diſtinct branches only; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that nor the declaration any where intimates, that the people at large are immediately a part of the legiſlature. Had the reſpectable framers intended, that whenever a bill propoſed by one is rejected by the other, the people may afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it to be paſſed into a law, they would have ſaid ſo in plain poſitive terms; but then they would have rendered of no avail the inſtitution of the two branches. The ſenate would have been calculated for little more than to produce delays, and to afford occaſions for inflaming the paſſions, and diſturbing the public quiet. There would not have been two diſtinct regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branches to decide, but two diſtinct branches to propoſe. A bill propoſed by either would be a law, not being diſſented to by the other, or, in caſe of a diſſent, the people would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a third or a ſingle branch occaſionally. No buſineſs would be ſettled in the appointed legiſlature, unleſs the two branches agreed. Had the framers entertained ſuch ideas, they would unqueſtionably have preſcribed the manner of collecting the peoples deciſion.</p>
            <p>I believe there never exiſted a government, in which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every freeman had a ſuffrage in framing laws, the queſtion was decided by a majority of ſingle voices. In the pureſt democracies, the people have voted by claſſes, tribes or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020403_0005_0FAF0220D0220CF8"/>
companies, into which they were diſtributed, agreeably to ſome rational principle. I pretend to no great hiſtorical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches. I conceive that many ages have elapſed ſince any civilized nation, ſtate, or even ſingle independent city, has placed the power of legiſlation in the people at large; and I think, that no virtuous citizen, who is acquainted with the hiſtory of ancient democracies, would wiſh this power amongſt us to reſide <hi>conſtantly</hi> in the people. In abſtract theory, ſuch a legiſlation appears conſonant to their natural rights; but the ſhocking inconveniencies attendant on the mode, have long ſince occaſioned mankind to renounce it. It was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only for ſmall cities in their beginnings; and he that wiſhes for it in a ſtate of equal extent and population to ours, muſt either be a political madman, or, under the convenient cloak of public good, he veils the moſt dark and traitorous intent.</p>
            <p>Let us examine the true import of the fourth article of the declaration of rights; for on that article, if on any, is founded the doctrine that both branches of the legiſlature are bound to obey the inſtructions of the people, and that by ſo doing, they act agreeably to the conſtitution. The article ſpeaks ſo plain a language it will be difficult for any expoſition to render it more intelligible:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That all perſons inveſted with the legiſlative or executive powers of government are the truſtees of the public, and as ſuch accountable for their conduct; wherefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly endangered, and all other means of redreſs are ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old or eſtabliſh a new government; the doctrine of non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt arbitrary power and oppreſſion, is abſurd, ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, and deſtructive of the good and happineſs of mankind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the period has actually arrived, when it is neceſſary for the people to interpoſe, they ſhould act in a way very different from that of commanding the ſenate's aſſent to a bill, which, on the matureſt deliberation, they have unanimouſly rejected. Such an interference of the people might only prevent, for a ſeaſon, that, which without many ſubſequent interferences, would be likely to take place; and the danger threatened from the corruption of their truſtees would probably continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. The truth is, that from the obvious meaning of the fourth article, and upon every ſound principle of government, the interference of the people is a reſumption of all delegated powers; the whole frame is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolved; and it becomes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020403_0006_0FAF0221A40DD008"/>
their buſineſs either to reform its errors and abuſes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it again in force, or to adopt an entire new ſyſtem. If experience hath evinced two diſtinct legiſlative branches to be inconvenient, they will probably aboliſh that which is not of their immediate appointment. But to ſay, that the ſenate ſhall ſtill ſubſiſt, and enjoy their powers and privileges uninterrupted, and that notwithſtanding they ſhall be obliged to give their aſſent, which, after a full interchange of ſentiment with the delegates, they have unanimouſly declined, ſeems uttering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradictions to be ſaying, that a thing is ſo, and is not ſo, in the ſame ſentence.</p>
            <p>This fourth article was unneceſſary, as indeed are many others. It affords a ſtriking leſſon to legiſlators never to uſe ſentences or words without neceſſity or meaning. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurely foreſeen, that an article aſſerting only a natural right, could by any poſſibility be conſtrued into a poſitive inſtitution. I have on many occaſions lamented, that the convention in compoſing a declaration did not content themſelves with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſing generally the law, and laying down certain maxims of government for the conduct of future legiſlatures. Inſtead of that they have thrown together natural rights, principles of government, and particular proviſions of the common law. Had this and the firſt article been omitted, there would have been no ſentence or word in the whole declaration or the form of government, countenancing the doctrine in queſtion; and yet the rights of the people would have been preciſely as they are. With reſpect to the fifth article, which ſpeaks of the people's right to participate in the legiſlature, that article is manifeſtly oppoſed to the doctrine; becauſe it explains the right into a right of immediate repreſentation, and frequent elections.</p>
            <p>When the happineſs of the people, the true end of all ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and government, cannot be preſerved on account of ſome original fault in the conſtitution, or when the truſtees betray their ſacred charge, and the people are rouſed by a ſenſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries no longer to be borne, the indelible rights of nature authoriſe them to enforce that redreſs to which all conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means are incom<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>nt. This is the principle of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh revolution in 1008. This is the principle of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in America, which every good man ſtill flatters himſelf will be deemed the moſt important era in the hiſtory of the world. It would be ſlaviſh to imagine, that without the firſt and fourth articles, or even with one directly repugnant, the people might not annul a compact intended for their good,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020403_0007_0FAF02228FC1E3C8"/>
when experience evinces the framers of that compact to have been miſtaken; or that a mode of government which ſuited its framers, might not be changed by their poſterity.</p>
            <p>But whether a right be inherent in the people, and whether this be a proper occaſion for uſing it, are two diſtinct queſtions. Has ten years experience demonſtrated the ſenate to be either a dangerous or uſeleſs body? Has the rejection of the paper ſyſtem perverted the ends of its appointment, or expoſed your liberties to danger? The warmeſt advocates for the meaſure ſurely will not maintain the affirmative of theſe queſtions to be a ſelf-evident poſition. Let them remember, that the attempt to introduce <hi>this very ſcheme</hi> miſcarried two years ſucceſſively, and yet the people murmured not. In the third year the houſe of delegates were induced to adopt it. The ſenate unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly diſſented. The people ſtill made no complaints. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had the conduct of the ſenate excited their diſpleaſure, it might have been eaſily manifeſted in the late election. In this election the gentlemen moſt diſtinguiſhed for oppoſition to paper, were honoured with almoſt every ſuffrage. It will be ſtrange indeed, if you can now be perſuaded, that the new ſenate has perverted the ends of government by declining an expedient rejected by the old, and by two ſucceſſive houſes of delegates.</p>
            <p>The mode of appointing your ſenate is eſteemed by wiſe men the moſt admirable inſtitution in all the United States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I make no doubt, that in Europe it has done honour to American genius. The ſenate of Maryland has been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually acquiring the eſteem and confidence of the people, whilſt other ſenates have fallen in repute. The difference ariſes from the different modes of election. It is not a man's popularity in a ſingle county or diſtrict, it is his general good character, and his real dignity and importance, that confer on him this honour. The ſuffrage of the electors is a tribute paid to worth. The arts of intrigue, and even the magic powers of eloquence, ſhould theſe be eſſayed, will probably be found unavailing.</p>
            <p>In ſpite of theſe circumſtances attempts are made to excite your ſuſpicions of the ſenate. You are told, that in this ſelect body prevails a baneful ariſtocratic ſpirit. Enemy as I am to arbitrary ſway <hi>of every kind,</hi> I was at firſt ſtartled at the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. But as this was a weighty charge, I thought ſome proof ſhould be required ſuperior to the bare aſſertion of any man. An ariſtocracy is properly when <hi>the ſovereign power of a ſtate reſides in a permanent body of men diſtinct from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> At preſent the ſenate is not that permanent body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020403_0008_0FAF02232A778178"/>
it is appointed once in five years, and the ſupreme power reſides not in it to ſo great an extent as in the houſe of dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. Neither of them alone can paſs a law. If an ariſtocracy be the government of a few, <hi>uncontroled and unchecked by any other power,</hi> an ariſtocratic ſpirit muſt mean a diſpoſition to bring about ſuch a government. In what inſtance has even a ſingle ſenator evinced an inclination to confine the powers of legiſlation to the ſenate, or to change that branch into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent hereditary body. I now aſk, whether the addreſs of your delegates be not an attempt to have their own propoſition paſſed into a law, without the conſent of the ſenate. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to reflect ſoberly, whether this conduct of the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates does not tend indirectly to confer on them alone the power of making laws.</p>
            <p>I am thoroughly, and upon the beſt grounds, perſuaded, that no man in the ſenate conceives himſelf at liberty to diſregard the wants, wiſhes, or ſentiments of the people. He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly apprized, that the inſtitution was not intended to cloathe individuals with honour merely for their own gratification; but, like every other part of the conſtitution, to conſult the general good. There may be a variety of inſtances where this general good is promoted by gratifying the inclination of the people. But is there a man ſo loſt to common ſenſe as not to foreſee, that if the people ſhall take upon themſelves to decide nice queſtions of policy by a majority of voices, they may frequently be wrought upon to chooſe things which will injure them the moſt. I repeat that their will, provided they perſiſt long enough to purſue effectual meaſures, muſt ſtand for a law. But on what ground can a man who breathes the true ſpirit of patriotiſm, perſuade them to exerciſe their will on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion? Can he ſeriouſly believe them better qualified than the ſenate to decide on the expediency of an emiſſion? It is not ſufficient to ſay, they beſt know their own wants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is only a begging of the queſtion, which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an emiſſion would ſupply thoſe wants. Behold the glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monſtrous abſurdity. The people do not immediately chooſe the ſenate. They appoint their moſt intelligent men to chooſe for them; and their electors make the moſt diligent inquiry into every corner of the ſtate. Well, the ſenate, after all, is ignorant of the true intereſts of the ſtate; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral body of the people, from which they were ſelected, is to ſupply their wants, and enlighten their underſtandings.</p>
            <p>If any man ſays the ſenate are intereſted, or otherwiſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, let us have an opportunity to decide on his teſtimony; for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020403_0009_0FAF0223DFE97EA0"/>
confident aſſertions, and noiſy declamation, will, I truſt, at laſt, ſtand for nought.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid the compariſon is not proper between the people and the ſenate; that the people are called to decide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their immediate repreſentatives and the ſenate, on a queſtion, the right deciſion of which is eſſential to your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and that, until this deciſion, all operations of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature will be ſuſpended. In the ſame way might any other rejected bill be brought before the people. It is indeed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for every projector to eſteem his own <hi>ſyſtem</hi> of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. In a conteſt between the two branches, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the propoſed manner, is it at all probable, that the queſtion will come fairly before the people? The number of delegates exceeds that of the ſenate in a ratio of five for one. This circumſtance could not fail to operate, if even the arts of popularity were laid aſide, the inhabitants of each county aſſembled, the merits fairly diſcuſſed, and inſtructions ſigned only at that, or a ſubſequent meeting of the ſame kind. The delegates being far more intimately connected with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, it muſt be a plain queſtion indeed, which the people will decide in favour of the ſenate. Would to Heaven my countrymen could ſee the buſineſs in a true light. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives appeal to them for inſtructions—So far I ſhould have no objection, if their repreſentatives were themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined. But theſe inſtructions are to govern the ſenate, and at the ſame time to be dictated by the delegates. In this kind of ſervice the <note n="*" place="bottom">My readers will underſtand, that whenever I ſpeak of the people, I mean a majority of the great body of our citizens.</note> people are not volunteers, and they feel not enough to ſtimulate them to a voluntary exertion. Can the interpoſition of the people thus obtained, be termed an interference, dictated by a ſenſe of wrongs, a defence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rights, and a promotion of the true ends of government? Can a man wiſh the free unbiaſſed ſentiments of the people to prevail, when he exerts every nerve to obtain their deciſion before each ſide of the queſtion can be fairly examined? A draught of inſtructions is circulated before the cloſe of the ſeſſion. Its preamble aſſerts the appeal of the ſenate, and the people are preſſed to ſubſcribe before they can poſſibly examine the allegation, or hear the ſenate's reaſons.</p>
            <p>Is this ſuch a mode as naturally ſuggeſted itſelf to men anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the purſuit of truth? Were theſe inſtructions in other reſpects conſtitutional, they would be void on one certain
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020403_0010_0FAF0224A13EF4B0"/>
ground. Had the ſenate, being at a loſs how to decide, really appealed to the people, inſtructions would be ſtrictly proper; but the perſonal influence of any member or either branch, would even in that caſe have been extremely improper.</p>
            <p>Were I an advocate for the principle, I ſhould be puzzled reſpecting the true manner of communicating the ſenſe of the people. Are inſtructions to be ſigned only at public meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Is there to be one meeting only? Is that meeting to take place at each county court-houſe, or in each hundred? Is one general form to be purſued? Or may each man chooſe his own form? By whom are the ſeveral papers to be collected in each county or diſtrict? With whom ſhall they all be lodged? What ſhall be deemed a ſufficient authentication? On a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of forgery, how ſhall the fact be aſcertained, or the crime puniſhed? A thouſand ſuch queſtions may be aſked, and the ingenuity of many gentlemen might be ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuitable proviſions. But as to theſe queſtions no anſwer is found in the conſtitution, the concluſion is obvious, that its framers had no idea of the thing, conſiſtent with the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar adminiſtration of the government by <hi>them</hi> deviſed. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that whenever the great body of the people ſhall declare their will (in whatever way it be done) this declaration, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the fourth article of the declaration, and the unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights of nature, ought to be law; but then the whole frame of the government is either diſſolved or ſuſpended. I mean not, that any act of violence committed by only a part, and obſtructing the exerciſe of a conſtitutional authority, would amount to this diſſolution or ſuſpenſion. I mean ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference as is mentioned in that article. I contend that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plain import of the words, the authors had not in contemplation an interference, without a total diſſolution or a ſuſpenſion, until it could be reformed, and again declared in force.</p>
            <p>Had the conſtitution made expreſs proviſion, and preſcribed the manner in which inſtructions ſhould be given, ſo as to bind both branches of the legiſlature, the people ought never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to be extremely ſparing in the exerciſe. Were the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt motives of the ſenate apparent; if by their conduct your liberties were manifeſtly endangered; if proving falſe to their truſt, they ſacrificed the pubic good to their own private views—it would be proper to teach them their duty, and at the ſame time to addreſs them in the terms of a ſevere repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And further, as the people are to exerciſe the right, the people only ſhould determine on the occaſion. I repeat
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020403_0011_0FAF0226EEEF6568"/>
again and again, that with or without a conſtitutional proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the people ought unqueſtionably to interfere on occaſions like theſe. The difference between me and my adverſaries is, whether an interference will not aboliſh or ſuſpend the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional legiſlature; and whether this be a proper ſeaſon for an interference. The doctrines imputed to me by ſcribblers, I deteſt as much as I do all inſolence, domineering, ſedition, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and calumny.</p>
            <p>I ſhould imagine any prudent, cautious, diſintereſted citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, who has a valuable ſtake in the community, whoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is intimately connected with the public proſperity, who wiſhes no change in a government under which none hold ſuperior rights, who would hazard all, and could gain nothing by a new revolution—I ſhould imagine that ſuch a man, let his opinion reſpecting an emiſſion be what it may, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by no ſolicitation to ſubſcribe. The point was ſimply, whether bills of credit ſhould be emitted on loan. The houſe of delegates was divided. A member whoſe reputation is not limited to theſe ſtates, who, ſometime ago, poſſeſſed your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unbounded confidence, and to whom nothing had ſince been imputed, this gentleman, with about two fifths of the houſe, was ſtedfaſtly oppoſed to the plan. The ſenate were unanimous. But what again is the ſenate? It is a ſelect body of men of enlarged minds, and unblemiſhed characters, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no intereſt whatever diſtinct from yours, bearing with you a full proportion of burthens, and out of the ſenate-houſe at their own homes, to all intents and purpoſes, compoſing a part of the people. If theſe fifteen men can harbour a deſign of erecting an arbitrary power on the ruins of the conſtitution, of enjoying their dignities for life, and bequeathing them to their iſſue, they have conceived ideas of which I did not think the brain of man ſuſceptible. Suppoſe the laſt convention had conferred the whole legiſlative authority on the ſenate, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed fifteen men ſenators for life, and rendered the office hereditary. Is it poſſible ſuch an odious eſtabliſhment could have ſubſiſted even unto this day. No ſenator under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent form can meditate an extenſion of his authority, and no rational being, on a moment's reflection, can retain his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, unleſs jealouſy of your truſtees be like the jealouſy of love, excited without cauſe, and ſubſiſting on idle fancies. If a ſenator were really capable of ſuch deſigns, he would become a much fitter object of deriſion, than of any well grounded apprehenſion. Happy will it be for you, my countrymen, if that conſtitution which perhaps owes its exiſtence, and has
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020403_0012_0FAF02282B047768"/>
done honour to men, who no longer view it with a parent's eye, ſhall withſtand this powerful attack. Oh! liſten to a man who defies the tongue of envy and detraction to fix one improper motive for this addreſs, who has long been a faithful guardian to that conſtitution, and feels for it more than a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's love. Be aſſured, if it muſt receive a deadly wound, the fatal blow will be dealt by yourſelves, or your immediate repreſentatives. Far from me be the wiſh of narrowing the powers of the popular branch of the legiſlature. The defect of human policy, ariſing from human nature, is ſuch, that in inſtituting the frame of a government, it is impoſſible to guard againſt dangers on one ſide, without being expoſed on another. Were every thing ſubmitted to my diſcretion, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſolemnly I would not abridge the eſtabliſhed power of your delegates. my only wiſh and aim is to protect that ſacred palladium of your rights, which you have ſworn to defend, againſt all open and ſecret combinations. Permit not either branch, <hi>by any method,</hi> to exerciſe the office of both. The very uſe and intent of one is to check any unadviſed haſty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, or intemperate ſallies of the other more numerous aſſembly. Think not, that a prediliction for the former has blinded my underſtanding. I further declare, that if it were left to me to aboliſh one or the other, I would by all means preſerve the houſe of delegates. There is nothing more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to my ſoul than the idea of a proud, worthleſs, tyrannical order of nobility, like the ſenate of Venice. But, although this government may hereafter poſſibly degenerate into an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary one, there is no reaſon to dread, that it will become an ariſtocracy erected by the ſenate.</p>
            <p>If it be the meaning of the fourth article, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall act as an umpire, wherefore is it, that in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a diſſent the bill is not laid before them? To this may be ſaid, they are called upon only with reſpect to bills of the laſt importance. The conſtitution however creates no diſtinction. The conſtitution contains no proviſion in any caſe.</p>
            <p>An idea has been ſtarted, that both branches are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as agents of the people, and the conſtitution a letter of inſtructions; that as it was impoſſible for the principal to foreſee the neceſſity of an emiſſion at this time, he may now give additional inſtructions. There is a diſpoſition in mankind to be impoſed on by ſimilitudes. They captivate the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are much better received than ſolid argument. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold another ſimilitude.—</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:020403_0013_0FAF02291CC26188"/>There are fifty perſons, the far greater part having no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or experience in trade, who agree to join ſt<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>, and commence merchants. In a little time they find it extremely inconvenient for ſo large a company to tranſact their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. They enter into articles to be binding until at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meetings of the company a majority ſhall vote for diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the partnerſhip. By the principal clauſe in the indenture, the buſineſs for a limited time is committed to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of only two, without any proviſo, that if theſe two ſhould differ reſpecting a propoſition made by either, the matter ſhall be referred to the company.

The other merchant, a cautious, calculating man, conſiders it as a mere chimera. The firſt thereupon calls a meeting of the company, produces his calculations, diſplays his brilliant proſpects, and actually brings over a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority. His aſſociate continues fixed. His judgment is not convinced, and he adheres to his opinion. Should the law authoriſe the majority, notwithſtanding their agreement, to diſplace their agents, and ſhould they take the management into their own hands, they are again in the ſituation which induced them to chooſe managers. Again they perceive the neceſſity of appointing; and it is not improbable, that they will truſt the whole concern to him who has impreſſed an high opinion of his talents.</p>
            <p>The meaning of this allegory is to guard you againſt ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Let us trace the conſequences of the doctrine, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the expreſs proviſions of the conſtitution, the people, without violating or ſuſpending, may control a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated power. If it be good with regard to the legiſlature, it muſt likewiſe be good with reſpect to the executive and judiciary.</p>
            <p>A citizen levies conſtructive war againſt the ſtate. He is thereon indicted in the general court, arraigned, takes his trial, and is found guilty by the unanimous ſuffrage of twelve men, the petit jury. This man is a favourite of the people. His friends make ſtrenuous exertions, and a great majority of the people are induced to ſign a declaration of their will, and an order, that he be diſcharged. There is no doubt the priſoner will eſcape puniſhment, provided the people ſhall enforce their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020403_0014_0FAF0229DB395858"/>
mandate. But will any man pretend, that, it authoriſes the judge legally and conſtitutionally to pronounce the diſcharge? And yet the court may be conſidered the agent of the people, deriving authority like every other department of government, immediately or ultimately from the people.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe now the addreſs to ſucceed, and in ten countries a greater number to have ſigned the inſtructions for an emiſſion, than have either ſigned againſt it, or declined ſigning at all <note n="*" place="bottom">It ſurely will not be maintained, that any writing can be juſtly ſtyled the declaration of a county's ſenſe, unleſs more than one half of the voters, or of the freemen, ſhall have ſigned it. If it can, where ſhall the line be drawn? Or what prevents a paper ſigned by a dozen, when there is no counter paper, from being ſtyled inſtructions?</note>. The ſenate taking the conſtitution for their guide, and finding it no where expreſſed, that in any caſe they ſhall be bound to paſs laws againſt their own opinion, ſtill viewing the ſyſtem as injurious to our affairs, eſteeming it their inviolable duty to preſerve the conſtitution unimpaired, and thinking too, that the free unbiaſſed opinion has not been obtained, will moſt probably continue firm in rejecting the bill. The houſe of delegates will then moſt probably decline for a ſeaſon all further intercourſe. The people then, or a part of them in behalf of the reſt, miſtaking the firmneſs of virtue for an obſtinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their rights, will perhaps repair to the capital, and <hi>in thunder</hi> pronounce their will. If then the ſenate, ſtill holding themſelves bound by ſuperior obligations, and manifeſting a zeal for their country's <hi>permanent</hi> happineſs, ſhall diſdain to aſſent to that which their judgments diſapprove, and thereby eſtabliſh a precedent, leaving to their ſucceſſors little more than a name, and ſhall either inſtantly adjourn, or relinquiſh their ſeats, this poſture of affairs will, in all human probability, be conſtrued a diſſolution of government. Immediately may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue ſcenes, the bare contemplation of which muſt touch the ſtuoteſt heart, not intereſted to produce them. But paſſing over theſe ſcenes of diſcord, riot, violence, and perhaps blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, let us calmly conſider what beſt can posſſibly happen. On a reſignation of the ſenate, provided ſuch a meaſure would not be conſtrued void on the principle of dureſſe, there can be no ſenate under the preſent form until the year 1791. In ſuch a caſe the houſe of delegates may do one of two things. They may proceed, on the pretext of neceſſity, to exerciſe alone the powers of legiſlation, or they may addreſs their conſtituents
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020403_0015_0FAF022AAC0C7D40"/>
to elect a convention. The latter being more ſafe and decent, will probably be adopted. Alas, my beloved countrymen, we ſhall be fortunate indeed, if the convention will recogniſe the preſent conſtitution, reforming only a few errors and abuſes, and rendering it from this convulſion more ſtable than before, or if a new conſtitution from its aſhes ſhall ariſe ſuperior to the preſent! The members of a convention will be compoſed principally of the preſent delegates, irritated and inflamed as they are againſt the ſenate.</p>
            <p>You will be told, that this is an attempt, by alarming your fears, to intimidate you from doing that which is right. To him who attentively, and with a proper frame of mind, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the conduct and addreſs of your delegates, the meſſages of the ſenate and the aforegoing remarks, the condition of our affairs will appear critical and alarming. If I know my own heart, although I were thoroughly convinced, that bills of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit would produce the promiſed effects, I would ſtedfaſtly ſet my face againſt this mode of effecting the plan. Nothing ſhort of a conviction, that on the ſcheme depended your ſafety and happineſs, would reconcile me to the idea. At the ſame time were I certain that the people, left to themſelves, would feel the want of an emiſſion, and without it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I would renounce my opinion, and reprobate the man who could hold out againſt the free voice of the people, his maſters.</p>
            <p>When I conſider, that independent of impelling the people, like a blind machine, to break down the fixed barriers of the conſtitution, the ſcheme for an emiſſion is pregnant with a thouſand ills, I regret the poor extent of my powers. I wiſh for immediate inſpiration. When indeed alone, and in my ſtudy, I contemplate on all theſe things, my whole frame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes agitated and convulſed. I feel as it were the reſiſtleſs impulſe of an inviſible agent.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED now to offer ſome remarks on the nature of the plan.—After the meſſages of the ſenate, and another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent publication, it is perhaps unneceſſary to advance any thing further on bills of credit. There are however ſome things which either eſcaped that honourable body, and the ingenious Commentator on that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> man Mr. Necker, or did not ſtrike them ſo forcibly as they do me. The conduct of the advocates for an emiſſion, in the firſt inſtance, affords a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020403_0016_0FAF022B77858FE0"/>
that the paper will depreciate. Not a man who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes inſtructions, at the ſame time obliges himſelf to receive it as ſpecie. If he did, I would then remind him of the red money, founded on real public property to an amount far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the ſum emitted, on private ſubſcriptions to four times that amount, on a conſiderable tax payable in the bills, on the ſolemn aſſociation of a great part of the people, and on their authority exerciſed in the appointment of committees. It came out too at a time when the extreme ſcarcity of a medium was univerſally acknowledged. It is ſuppoſed, that the critical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of that emiſſion conſtitutes a material difference between the red money and the emiſſion now propoſed. With reſpect to the doubtful iſſue of the war, you well remember, that red mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney funds, every particle of your property, your liberty, and perhaps your lives, depended on the ſame event. The red mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was, beſides, the only immediate reſource left to this ſtate for feeding the army.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of this money might convince you, that the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for bills of credit is paſt. There was a time, when, in all reſpects, they were equal to caſh. But we ought rather to be ſurpriſed at the circumſtance, than from it to expect they will be ſo again.</p>
            <p>Conſider, I beſeech you, the true nature of bills of credit. They are promiſſory notes, for ſums of money payable at a diſtant day. What then ſhall give them value equal to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſums of ready money? A kind of popular illuſion, an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on univerſally, or very generally, prevailing, that they will anſwer all the purpoſes of ſpecie, will give them this value as effectually as if there were a ſum of money depoſited in places convenient to every perſon for exchanging on demand. Under ſuch an opinion, no man would heſitate to take them from another.</p>
            <p>This opinion, having exiſted before the war, was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loſt by the continental bills. Every attempt to reſtore it has miſcarried. I will not ſay, that no man poſſeſſes a faith in bills of credit; but I remark, that a very great part of the people do not. There exiſts not then this popular illuſion, or opinion. It is indeed extraordinary to contend that it does, when ſo many reprobate the very name of paper money.</p>
            <p>Opinion is the ſupport of almoſt every ſpecies of legal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. When the people in a county believe, that the ſheriff has power to do every act enjoined, this belief confers the power in reality. When they want this belief, he is no more than a common man. In like manner, bills of credit not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020403_0017_0FAF022C0FE78C68"/>
from their nature ready caſh, if the people do not think them ſo, there is nothing which can make them ſo.</p>
            <p>The loudeſt clamours for an emiſſion afford no proof of the opinion's exiſtence. That clamour may be raiſed, becauſe men conceive that an emiſſion would diminiſh the tax; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe debtors may entertain the idea either of diſcharging their debts with facility, or of ſtaying the importunity of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors; becauſe the more paper is ſcattered abroad, the better chance have public debtors of every kind; becauſe there are abundant ſubjects of ſpeculation, which render it profitable to borrow paper at par, and exchange it at diſcount; becauſe thoughtleſs improvident men are ever prone to prefer preſent eaſe to the greateſt diſtant good.</p>
            <p>The ſticklers for paper appeal to the recent experience of ſiſter ſtates. A perſon from Philadelphia has lately aſſured the inhabitants of this city, that in Philadelphia he generally agrees to take half caſh, half paper, and contrives pretty well to get rid of the paper. The ſtipulation of half and half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates a difference, which indeed the houſe of delegates diſcovered to be ten per cent. I flatter myſelf I ſhall explain why it maintains ſo high a value, without anſwering the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of its emiſſion.</p>
            <p>In Pennſylvania the ſum emitted is moderate. It is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the public in ſo many ways, that there is a continual demand, and numerous competitors. It changes from its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal nature of promiſſory notes, becomes an article of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and its value depends on principles ſimilar to thoſe of merchandiſe in general. Attend to every circumſtance. It is the doctrine of ſome men who pretend to reaſon on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that if there he a demand, or ſeveral demands, exceeding the amount of an emiſſion, the value of the paper muſt be equal to that of ſpecie, and a dollar of the one will be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a dollar of the other. Here is plain proof to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and unerring principle might have convinced them without the experiment.</p>
            <p>So long as paper will not anſwer every purpoſe of ſpecie, ſo long will a ſilver dollar be worth more than a paper dollar, redeemable at a diſtant day. In Pennſylvania, paper can pay all taxes and duties. A man owes taxes, and has nothing but ſpecie; there is no inducement for him to exchange it, unleſs for ſo doing he be allowed a premium. As, however, there are numbers in the ſame ſituation, he cannot make his own terms. Hence it is, that he is obliged to give £.90 in coin for £.100 in paper. At this price have the demands fixed
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020403_0018_0FAF022E90138E08"/>
the paper. There is a general demand, calling for a greater ſum than is in the hands of the people; and, beſides this, there are ſeveral other demands. Superadded to this conſideration, almoſt the whole of each demand centers in Philadelphia, and very little of the paper finds its way out of the city. Advert now to the main reaſon aſſigned for iſſuing paper.—It is to increaſe, throughout the ſtate, the circulating medium. No man in Philadelphia pretends to aſſert, that the circulating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is at all increaſed by the emiſſion of the bills of credit, or promiſſory notes. The paper only conſtitutes an additional article of merchandiſe, which indeed is ſometimes bartered for other commodities. Shopkeepers advertiſe, they will take paper as ſpecie for their commodities. This they may well do, for the ſake of a more rapid ſale, and from having imperceptibly raiſed their prices. They know the amount of the emiſſion, of the ta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, and of the duties; and the demand created by the uſes, cannot fail to enable them to diſpoſe of their paper at a diſcount, for which their amends a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap>ple.</p>
            <p>Now for the operation and effect.—The people can pay any given tax with greater facility; but then this tax being ſo much the leſs productive, there is a neceſſity for ſupplying the defect by additional taxes. The people in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> therefore are not benefited by the facility, and thoſe obliged to pay ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, are more burthened than the reſt. The benefit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a claſs, for whoſe benefit the government was under no obligation to deviſe ſyſtems and plans.</p>
            <p>I have that ſkill in paper (and I pretend to no more than is poſſeſſed by a thouſand others) that, let we know the amount, funds, period of redemption, uſes and demands, and, from ſure principles, I can calculate pretty nearly the value at which it will be at different ſtages. If the ſum, not very large, be redeemable within ten years, without having created uſes and demands, I then calculate the value of a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of hand, paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the end of ten years, without intereſt. Suppoſe the uſe of money for one year to be worth twelve per cent. <hi>and no doubts entertained of the redemption,</hi> £.100 will be then worth about £.45.</p>
            <p>If there be any immediate uſes, the value then depends on them. The period of redemption, and the funds, are out of the queſtion. They become ſtrictly an article of merchandiſe. Are matters on ſuch a footing, that the holders of the paper ſhall ſeek purchaſers, or thoſe wanting paper ſhall ſeek ſellers? On this queſtion much depends. In Philadelphia the holders advertiſe, and the uſes immediately bring them purchaſers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:020403_0019_0FAF022FA6D34908"/>Let us examine the plan of our delegates.—£.250,000 to be emitted on loan, and, as I apprehend, £ 100,000 to be laid out in purchaſes of one kind or another.</p>
            <p>I take it as a ſettled point, I reaſon not with the man who denies it, that, in this ſtate <hi>at leaſt,</hi> opinion does not place paper on a footing with ſpecie. The values at which the emiſſions of 1780 have been held ſince the peace are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and yet many times the amount are receivable by the treaſurer as ſpecie. The value of the projected paper muſt depend on the funds, and a confidence that it will be redeemed, or on immediate uſes. I have fully explained the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There remains ſomething to be ſaid on the ſecond. It is not ſufficient that a demand call for the whole of an article— the demand muſt be general. If one perſon only wants the article, and the quantity he wants exceeds the whole quantity in the ſtate, which is in the hands of one hundred perſons, it is evident that he has them at his mercy. If only one perſon has an article, wanted by one hundred, the quantity, provided it be not very great, is not of much moment. He has them at his mercy, until they are fully ſupplied, and then his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity becomes a drug. But if there be many buyers and many ſellers, and the former have more than is wanted by the latter, it is a drug in the beginning.</p>
            <p>For the propoſed paper of Maryland there is propoſed only one general demand, and that is to be created by taxes of the preſent year. Suppoſe their amount £.150,000, (which by the bye is much greater than can or ought to be laid) this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand will not place the holders of paper in the eligible ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being ſought by the purchaſers. The demand owing to duties is ſmall, and confined to the men beſt acquainted with the myſtery of buying and ſelling. Arrears of taxes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, amount pretty high; but a great part is due from col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, and the reſidue is by no means apportioned amongſt the people. It is chiefly due by men of large unproductive eſtates. With reſpect to arrearages, if paper be equal to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they will remain due after an emiſſion, except only from thoſe who ſhall borrow. Theſe, from the nature of the plan, muſt be few. In ſhort, the arrears will conſtitute only a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular demand, and this will be very ſmall, until a depreciation ſhall enſue.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, therefore, I do not ſay, that I <hi>apprehend</hi> a very conſiderable appreciation. I aſſert poſitively, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in the courſe of ſix months after an emiſſion, would depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate more than thirty-three and one third per cent. and, were

               </gap> depending on the truth of my prediction, I ſhould feel no more concern than if it depended on the old Cheſapeake's keeping to its channel.</p>
            <p>It was reported during the ſeſſion, that the paper at New-York was even by brokers exchanged at two and a half. That brokers could make an advantage demonſtrates, that ſuſpicions were entertained, or, in a place abounding with caſh, there could be no neceſſity for applying to <hi>them.</hi> I have heard the following account of that emiſſion: That parties having run high, there was a kind of compromiſe. In conſideration of the emiſſion's not exceeding a certain ſum, the enemies of the ſcheme agreed to give it ſupport; and attempts to depreciate it were deemed infamous. The premium to brokers was deemed allowable, as a reaſonable ſatisfaction for their trouble. I again go back to the hiſtory of red money. For a ſhort ſeaſon that alſo was even here <hi>ſaid</hi> to paſs as ſpecie; that is, in the few payments and purchaſes made with it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there was no actual diſcount. But, ſo ſoon as without infamy a man might diſtinguiſh, you may remember how ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid the depreciation. Attend to that emiſſion on another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.—It was made receivable at par for all taxes. Wheat and tobacco was alſo receivable, the former at ſeven and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, when the actual value was about five ſhillings. This meaſure ſoon fixed the value of red money at two for one, when, according to the aforeſaid principle of the paper advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, a dollar of it ought to have been worth five ſhillings. If men will not liſten to experience, nor determine upon plain evident principles, it is an error to call them rational animals. With reſpect however to the emiſſion of New-York, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment is not complete. We know not its exact circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Too little time has elapſed, to have the value aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as at Philadelphia, on certain ſolid grounds. I am well aſſured, that at the laſt place the idea of bills of credit ſerving for a circulating medium, or anſwering any valuable purpoſes, is relinquiſhed by its warmeſt friends. And thus, before our emiſſion could take place, will it be alſo at New-York. Why do they not ſpeak of the Rhode-Iſland and the Carolina paper?</p>
            <p>I ſhall make no apology for the liberty I ſhall take with the delegates addreſs. We well know, that the meaſures of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bodies are not the reſult of every individual's wiſdom, unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one mind. On genuine republican principles, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs preſents an invitation to a general diſcuſſion; and this is no time to reſpect <hi>perſons,</hi> or even <hi>bodies.</hi> Should they view it in a different light, and reſent this, or a ſimilar attempt, I
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020403_0021_0FAF02315616F7E0"/>
would ſay, it is that body which acts in the true ſpirit of a corrupt ariſtocracy.</p>
            <p>In their addreſs there are principles either miſapplied, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained ſo as to contradict ſelf-evident poſitions. Say they, <q>in every ſtate there ought to be as much <hi>circulating</hi> money as will repreſent all the property bought and ſold for caſh; and the <hi>current</hi> money of every country ought always to be in proportion to its trade, induſtry, conſumption, alienation and taxes.</q> Do they mean by "repreſent" <hi>purchaſe?</hi> And do they mean the property and labour actually ſold at the ſame inſtant, or in the courſe of a year? Do they mean, that if the property and labour ſold annually in the ſtate, be worth 1,000,000 of money, that there ought to be that million in the ſtate? If they mean the laſt, they are certainly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; becauſe the ſame ſum, in the courſe of a year, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a great variety of offices.</p>
            <p>Were the ſtate of Maryland ſeparated from, and inacceſſible to, the reſt of the world,<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe two quantities are worth about £. <hi>180,000</hi> current money.</note> 1,000lb. of gold, and 20,000lb. of ſilver, would <hi>repreſent</hi> the property and labour bought and ſold, and bear a proportion to the enumerated articles, as fully as if theſe quantities were trebled, ſo as to produce nearly that quantity of money which the delegates think neceſſary to the ſtate, connected with, and acceſſible as it is, to the inhabitants of other countries. If in the ſuppoſed ſeparation, the preſence of 1,000lb. of gold, and 20,000lb. of ſilver, would cauſe a buſhel of wheat to be ſold for two ſhillings and ſix-pence, or about 6 dwt. of ſilver, the augmentation of them to thrice the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity would, in the end, occaſion a buſhel of wheat to be ſold for ſeven ſhillings and ſix-pence, or about 18dwt. of ſilver, provided there were no change in the quantity or demand. So that the quantity of ſpecie would not be material.</p>
            <p>But as Maryland is connected with, and acceſſible to, the inhabitants of other countries, there <hi>will,</hi> without the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of paper, be always as much money as will do the offices mentioned in the addreſs. The influx and reflux of ſpecie depends on as ſure principles as the flowing and ebbing of the ſea.</p>
            <p>In every independent country, not having mines, or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tribute, the quantity of money depends on the balance of trade. If her export of merchandiſe exceed her import, the balance is brought in coin. And this will be done until the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020403_0022_0FAF02322FE63CD0"/>
quantity of caſh, by degrees, raiſing the prices of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, it no longer ſuits her merchants to ſend theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to other countries for the purpoſe of importing for them other commodities. They then remit coin. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus commodities now lying on hand, and the quantity of caſh being leſſened by theſe remittances, they again fall to that price which will enable merchants to export them on better terms than ſpecie. Again the hard metals flow into the country; and again their reflux is infallibly brought about.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a complicated ſubject, and requires fuller explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Confuſed writers have perplexed themſelves, and rendered it unintelligible to their readers. My poſition is not that prices are <hi>conſtantly</hi> proportioned to the quantity of circulating coin, and that a ſudden influx of coin would <hi>inſtantly</hi> raiſe prices, or a ſudden export occaſion an <hi>immediate</hi> fall. I mean, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and permanent augmentation, or a conſiderable diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and none brought in its room, will, in a moderate ſpace of time, produce a riſe or fall of thoſe commodities which are in conſtant and general demand, allowing for accidental plenty or ſcarcity. Particular articles may riſe even on a diminution of coin, or fall on an augmentation, the demand for theſe depending on faſhion, whim or fancy. To a clear head, the whole doctrine of demand is eaſily unfolded, and I hope my principle is now fully comprehended.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On this principle, when coin is ſent out becauſe the prices of commodities will not allow an export, notwithſtanding they abound as much as uſual, the quantity in other countries not being increaſed, and the demand there continuing as it was, there is a preſumption that the ſtate has more than its proper ſhare of ſpecie. But if all the ſurplus commodities be exported, and they are inſufficient to pay for the merchandiſe brought in their ſtead, the balance muſt be remitted in coin, or remain a debt to a foreign country. The latter was preciſely our caſe before the war. We imported from Great-Britain more than our to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and ſometimes wheat, and the little foreign trade allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, would pay for. Hence aroſe the <hi>"old diſtreſſing"</hi> debt to Britiſh ſubjects. The commerce of this country was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged principally by their factors. Theſe did not make ample remittances. For a great part of their goods they took bonds; and without the revolution, the reſult muſt have been the veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great part of our real property in Britiſh merchants.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of America during her vaſſallage, and indeed of moſt dependent colonies, is different from that of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020403_0023_0FAF0232DD2ED728"/>
nations. This country was, in a manner, inacceſſible to all but one people. The principle, that in every country there <hi>will</hi> be as much circulating caſh as will repreſent the labour and property ſold, &amp;c. is meant only for an independent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Not having peruſed all the books on this ſubject, I am not certain that ſome of my ideas are not entirely new. They ought not ſurely, on that account, to be deemed leſs juſt; and I hope, that my labours will throw a ray of light on a ſubject hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deemed obſcure and impenetrable.</p>
            <p>Wherefore bills of credit, bearing no intereſt, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at a far diſtant period, ſhould, in America alone, have been on a footing with ſolid coin, has never yet been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explained.</p>
            <p>Under the circumſtances of America before the war, the prices of her commodities were much higher than might have been expected from the quantity of her circulating caſh. Theſe prices were adjuſted on the principle of affording a reaſonable profit to the merchant who purchaſed the ſurplus for exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The fact was, there was a kind of barter between America and her parent country, ſo far as that ſurplus extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a credit was given for the balance. Theſe colonies, having no mines, and their trade nearly confined to Great-Britain, it was impracticable to obtain the quantity of caſh required by their domeſtic concerns, which would bear the due proportion to the property and labour <hi>to be</hi> bought and ſold, and afford means of improving new plantations. Prices were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated to a great degree by our intercourſe with Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Here then was the true neceſſity of falling on ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient <hi>"for melting down ſolid property."</hi> We could nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute banks for want of coin. If they had been inſtituted, the coin would have been drawn out by factors to make remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and the banks would have broken almoſt as ſoon as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. Under theſe circumſtances, with the addition that ſpeculation on government ſecurities had never yet been thought of, bills of credit, after a few bungling eſſays, ſucceeded to a charm. Specie not being wanted for exportation, the factors having regulated their operations on a different plan, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic purpoſes conſtituting almoſt the entire uſe for a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating medium, the opinion of the people was eaſily obtained; and as no ſuſpicions of the public faith had been created by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions of public engagements, there was a mutual tacit con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent that the paper of each colony ſhould be received by its neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:020403_0024_0FAF0233DB0CE958"/>We are now, from the ſignal interpoſition of Heaven, a free independent people. We are on a footing with other nations, and ſpecie will find its level amongſt us as with them. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going into the idle diſquiſition of the exact proportion of circulating caſh, ſo as to preſerve any given prices of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and labour bought and ſold, I do confidently pronounce, that without impolitic forcing meaſures during peace, we ſhall find a <note n="*" place="bottom">Extravagant imports muſt indeed diminiſh for a time the circulating coin; but as theſe cannot be kept up, the evil ſoon regulates itſelf.</note> ſufficient quantity for trade, conſumption, alienation and taxes.

But as the queſtion is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a bank, I proceed not on that fruitful, perplexing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining ſubject.</p>
            <p>If there be a man incapable of perceiving the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a time when opinion was in favour of bills, and times of a general diſtruſt; between times of vaſſallage, with a ſevere reſtriction of our trade, and a period when we have taken our juſt ſtation, and our commerce courted by the world; between the infancy and ripe age <note n="†" place="bottom">A country cannot be called young, when there are daily emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations, which would perhaps be facilitated by an unuſual abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of caſh.</note> of a country—if he cannot make theſe plain diſtinctions, I could almoſt ſay, that a falſe pride, a defect of underſtanding, the dictates of intereſt, or an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing private influence, has induced him obſtinately to maintain opinions condemned by a vaſt majority of the beſt characters <note n="‡" place="bottom">It is remarkable, that the ſaviour of his country has never yet been quoted on this ſubject. Although upon his reſignation he was determined to keep aloof from public affairs, he has lately interpoſed, with ſucceſs, againſt an attempt to emit paper in his native ſtate.</note> in the union.</p>
            <p>The addreſs ſtates the amount of ſpecie before the war at about £.200,000, and that if even this ſum be now circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating amongſt us, fifteen millions of property can pay only £.200,000. To the man who conſiders the efficacy of a briſk circulation, and the energy of a faithful adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, this ſtatement appears extraordinary indeed. In France one third of their ninety millions ſterling of caſh, is paid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for taxes and duties; but the amount of ſums paid from one to another, in the courſe of a year, amongſt twenty-odd
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020403_0025_0FAF02344FA3D478"/>
millions of ſouls, is not to be reckoned. When £.200,000 are paid for debts to-day, what prevents it from being paid for other debts to-morrow? It is not annihilated by the firſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is not like a ſoldier's ration, which, if it does its office to-day, is for ever gone, and another ration muſt be provided for to-morrow. Let juſtice take its courſe, or fall upon ſome rational expedient for ſatisfying both creditor and debtor. Let us on every occaſion reſpect the public faith, and, without purſuing any <hi>other extraordinary</hi> meaſures, you would find, that in the courſe of one year £.100,000 might pay debts to the amount of more than a million.</p>
            <p>The paper is, it ſeems, deviſed as a medium of taxes, and government is to furniſh you with ſomething, wherewithal to pay itſelf. There is a novelty in the idea of a creditor's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the debtor by a new loan to pay his debt, and of a right medium of taxes diſtinct from a medium of commerce or exchange. It may be prudent for a creditor ſometimes to venture a little further, in order that by aiding his debtor to execute a well laid ſcheme, he may ſecure his whole debt. There is nothing like this promiſed by the bill, and the reverſe would moſt probably take place. "But the people, at preſent unable to pay ſcarcely anything, will be put into a condition to pay a tax of thirty ſhillings in the hundred pounds." No ſuch thing. It is clear, that the paper would not be lent from the treaſury to one man in a hundred. Of the firſt £.100,000, 11,000 is deſtined to Baltimore county. No perſon can take leſs than £.50, and ſuppoſe none to take more. The fifties in 11,000 are only 220, and in that county there cannot be fewer than 4400 men chargeable with the tax. On theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions then, only one man in twenty can borrow from the public. Suppoſe no perſon to borrow leſs than £.500, and only one in 200 can be a borrower. I think in the preſent ſtate of credit, few will borrow for the ſake of adminiſtering to the neceſſities of their neighbours. From all this, the plan appears inadequate to the purpoſe of furniſhing the people with the means of diſcharging the tax.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, the medium being ſupplied, the people may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it with their produce. Should the paper be really caſh, the difficulty of procuring that, and of procuring ſpecie, will be equal. An idea has been propagated, that ſpecie has, all at once, vaniſhed from the land. That is impoſſible; becauſe there has been very little export of caſh ſince the very late period, when a man could procure a reaſonable quantity for anything he had to ſell. Take notice that I admit, only for
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020403_0026_0FAF0236F6647BF8"/>
the ſake of argument, that merchantable commodities or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions brought to any market in the ſtate, do not command ſpecie at this moment. I admit freely, that the artificial ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of caſh, has lately and ſuddenly increaſed. The expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the probability, or even the mere poſſibility, of an emiſſion, has determined moſt men not to part with a ſingle ſhilling of caſh which they can conſiſtently preſerve. Each expects to receive no more, and therefore, if he can avoid it, he will pay none. Let the paper ſyſtem be fairly abandoned. Let the legiſlature inſpire a confidence, that contracts ſhall be enforced, and the true medium which improvident laws have confined to private coffers, and perhaps reburied in the earth, will again circulate, and do its office.</p>
            <p>I have been always ſurpriſed, when men of intelligence have inferred the actual ſcarcity of coin from the low prices of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, ſtock, &amp;c. taken in execution. The demand for theſe things is much leſs than it was before the war; and as the quantity at market has increaſed, it has followed from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable principles of demand, that the prices are greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The abundant articles of a gainful ſpeculation have abſorbed all the ſpare caſh; and leſſened the demand for thoſe things in which ſavings of money were formerly inveſted. To them too is owing that high premium for the uſe of money, which, after all, has been much oftener talked of than really given.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of ſpeculation, however, has occaſioned another concluſion equally falſe. From the avidity with which a ſmall claſs of men has purchaſed up public ſecurities, is inferred a confidence in government. It is pleaſant to infer this from a man's purchaſing at four, ſix, and eight for one, when it is evident that he purchaſes with a view of diſpoſing of them in a ſhort time to advantage. His reliance on the public faith would indeed be effectually proved, if he purchaſed at par, or hoarded them as ſolid coin.</p>
            <p>The moſt plauſible argument for an emiſſion, is the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered, if we had caſh, of ſinking our ſhare of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental domeſtic debt with far leſs than the ſum due to credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <q>Final ſettlements may be procured at ſix or eight for one. Should they not be obtained with bills of credit, theſe bills will nevertheleſs procure flour and tobacco. And as ſpecie is not in the ſtate, theſe articles are to be ſent out, and the ſtate becomes a merchant.</q> Let us examine freely this whole proceſs.</p>
            <p>How long will it be before the paper can be ſtruck and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued? How long after that before it can be returned by way of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020403_0027_0FAF023859183990"/>
taxes? How much time will be conſumed in procuring tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co (I will not aſk the price) ſhipping it, and bringing back coin in its ſtead? Do you ſuppoſe that the ſtate will trade to advantage? In whom ſhall it confide? The other ſtates being competitors, is it not probable the price of ſecurities will be advanced before this proceſs can furniſh the caſh? I put theſe queries to evince the ſuperiority of the plan mentioned by the ſenate. To the plan, however, of an emiſſion to be exchanged immediately for ſecurities at a reaſonable rate, it has been deemed ſufficient to object the benefit which would accrue to ADVENTURERS. But it would ſeem, that the delegates plan would not be leſs favourable to adventurers. They are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers chiefly from whom ſecurities can <hi>now</hi> be obtained. The addreſs ſays, that the propoſed paper can depreciate only a trifle, and intimates, that the ſenate's would depreciate to a great degree. Surely, the more valuable the paper, exchanged for ſecurities at a given rate, the more benefit will be derived to adventurers. I will not be underſtood to advocate the ſcheme hinted at by the ſenate. I diſdain all ſpecies of deception. I reprobate all kinds of paper; and, if I can ſuggeſt a more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible mode of obtaining <hi>facilities,</hi> this laſt argument in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour muſt fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>The addreſs compliments you on your <hi>"ſolid property,"</hi> and aſſerts the difficulty of diſcharging the tax to be owing more to the want of a medium, than to your embarraſſed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>We may account much better for the default in collections, than from the inability of the people. Does the middling and moſt valuable claſs of citizens complain of the tax? Are <hi>they</hi> incapable of paying? Are <hi>they</hi> in arrears? If they are, is the fault imputable to <hi>them?</hi> Suppoſe an induſtrious planter poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of 300 acres of tolerable land, 4 or 5 working hands, and ſtock, &amp;c. in proportion. This property is perhaps aſſeſſed to £.700. Suppoſe the produce he raiſes for ſale to bring only £.140. A tax of 20<hi>ſ</hi> in the £.100 requires £.7, the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of his income. The calculation is eaſy and plain. Conſider now the caſe of the poor, in whoſe favour we have heard ſuch moving declamation. To men of very minute ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals it makes ſcarcely a palpable difference, whether taxes be high or low, receivable in paper, or in coin only. But now turn to men of overgrown property, with their thouſands of acres, and hundreds of ſlaves. On theſe taxation is heavy; becauſe their annual incomes, in proportion, are ſmall. But who is there that pities a man for owing £.100, when the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020403_0028_0FAF02394573A140"/>
debt ariſes merely from his poſſeſſing perhaps 15,000? After all this mighty buſtle then for the poor, the clamour is, in truth, raiſed for the rich. Theſe are the men who have ſet the pernicious example of with-holding the tax. Theſe are the men who declaim againſt heavy impoſitions, the want of a medium, and the neceſſity of poſtponing collections. It is <hi>their</hi> pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence, which even without their intending it, may have prevented men both able and well-inclined from paying their public dues, and prevented money, after being paid, from coming to the treaſury.</p>
            <p>That you may not ſuppoſe I affect ſuperior wiſdom on all "political and conſtitutional queſtions," I acknowledge that the original hint of the plan I mean to propoſe was borrowed from a member of the legiſlature. And that the whole of my reaſoning may be more candidly received, I further acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that moſt of my ideas are borrowed—not indeed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from books. Theſe too often contain the wild dreams of viſionary projectors, or of men attached to a fine ſpun theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I would be aſhamed to quote any writer beyond the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic on a ſubject relative to bills of credit; becauſe thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can reaſon only on ſpeculation; and becauſe, in America, we have experience to give every obſerving man more real knowledge than could poſſibly have been poſſeſſed by ſuch a man as Sir James Stewart. Not that I deſpiſe his book. It is a repoſitory of much uſeful knowledge; and where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines himſelf to facts or principles eſtabliſhed by experience, his work is extremely valuable. I take particular notice of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious writer, becauſe his volumes have been produced on account of his authority. Neither he nor Ariſtides, nor any other man, ſhould have any influence to which his reaſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced do not entitle him.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that in Europe almoſt any ſums may be borrowed on ample ſecurity. The intereſt is from two and an half to five per cent. Neither congreſs, nor any individual ſtate, could perhaps borrow even £.1,000 upon any terms, on the faith of government <hi>generally</hi> pledged. But ſuppoſe the paper ſcheme entirely diſcarded, and an act of aſſembly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a tax of 6/3 in the £.100 for ten years, for the ſole and expreſs purpoſe of procuring a loan, and authority given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſons to negotiate it in Europe, the principal payable one tenth annually, and an intereſt in the mean time, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight per cent. Such a ſcheme has been tried by no ſtate in the union. I have no doubt that this high intereſt, and this abundant ſecurity, would tempt monied men in Europe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020403_0029_0FAF023992588C68"/>
and that, by this expedient, we might procure caſh far more ſpeedily than under the paper ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>In Europe money is frequently inveſted in public funds, for the ſake of ſecurity, and for eſtabliſhing a ſure annual income, without trouble or diminution of the capital. Some of the perſons who thus lay out their money, have no thought, at the time, of ever receiving back the principal; but they have it in their power at any time to receive it by ſelling out. Such is one great advantage that a well ordered government enjoys by having inſpired a confidence in the public. It is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable at this period, that men could be found willing to lend us on any reaſonable terms, without a ſtipulation of receiving the principal at a fixed time. I therefore propoſe to borrow two hundred thouſand pounds for ten years. A tax of ſix ſhillings and three-pence in the £.100, on 11,000,000 of property, gives the groſs ſum of £.34,375. Suppoſe it to produce, in ten years, only enough to diſcharge the equivalent of a tenth of the principal annually, with the intereſt accruing, until the whole be paid, and the expence of the negotiation. On this plan we borrow immediately £.200,000; and that ſum laid out in continental ſecurities would purchaſe, at five for one, to the amount of £.1,000,000, which is conſiderably more than our balance of the continental domeſtic debt, at preſent bearing intereſt. It is incumbent on me to explain how the contract is to be made.</p>
            <p>Should we agree to pay actually a tenth of the principal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and the whole intereſt due at the end of the year, our payments would be made in the following manner: In the firſt year we ſhould have to pay £.20,000 of the principal, with the intereſt on the whole, which at eight per cent. would be £.16,000.—Total 36,000. In the ſecond year £.20,000 more of the principal, and the intereſt on the remaining £.180,000, which would be £.14,400—Total £.34,400 Let us ſtate every payment.—</p>

            <p>Should we calculate on compound intereſt, the difference would not be ſo great, although ſtill very conſiderable.

The attempt to injure my reputation excites no reſentment. I pity the ſlave to malignant paſſions. Were the attack even ſuch as to endanger my good name, recrimination would at beſt be a paltry mode of defence.</p>

            <p>Were the hint adopted, I might ſuggeſt other things in the draught of the bill.

            <p>To men of ſelfiſh contracted minds, who meaſure not on the large ſcale of general good, the profit to be gained by an emiſſion on loan, may be very alluring. The translator of Mr. Necker on bank-notes, has demonſtrated, that the gain never could be made. Suppoſe it ſhould; the burthen of contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much to the public revenue muſt fall heavily ſomewhere.

If an equal moderate tax cannot be paid, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſomething more than ſound to prove, that an unequal one, without loſs or deduction, will come into the treaſury. The fact is, that public debtors already conſtitute a numerous and powerful body; and it cannot be good policy to augment it. Theſe debtors have either had value from the public, or eſcaped burthens borne by the reſt. Their debts are juſt, and ought to be paid. By increaſing their number, is there no cauſe to apprehend a pernicious combination? Should the thought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſuggeſt itſelf, that the beſt ſtep for a public debtor is to procure a ſeat in the great public councils, you will run the hazard either of having your burthens greatly increaſed, or of a public bankruptcy, the ruin of your creditors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions in the ſtate, and ultimately the deſtruction of your freedom.</p>

            <p>The idea of private oeconomy and frugality extricating us from all embarraſſments, has been ridiculed. It has been <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly</hi> ſaid, that a free government cannot prevent men from ſpending their money, or living as they pleaſe. It is true, that government cannot limit the number of diſhes at a man's table, the quantity of madeira, to be conſumed in a year, or the kind and number of his carriages. But when men, having by a thoughtleſs profuſion incurred heavy debts, are obliged to retrench, and begin ſeriouſly to reform, the legiſlature may certainly forbear to furniſh them with the means of continuing their extravagance, enhancing their debt, and only poſtponing their evil day. Would not, I pray you, an emiſſion operate in this way for the borrowers? Would it not again hurry men into their wild ill concerted ſchemes? But government can go further than a mere forbearance. It can encourage home ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures. It can either prohibit certain importations, or lay ſuch a duty as would anſwer three good ends, an increaſe of its revenue, a diminution of imports, and a diſcouragement of luxury. The force of prejudice, and the magic of declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be great indeed, to prevent men from ſeeing theſe glaring truths!</p>
            <p>Suppoſe our imports from every part to be only £.800,000, and our exports to every part to be equal. Suppoſe too our embarraſſed circumſtances, aided by the prudence of our legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, to leſſen the importation of merchandiſe a fortieth part, This gives us an annual balance of £.20,000. The diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of a twentieth gives us £.40,000, and of a tenth £.80,000. The whole balance would be brought in ſolid coin, provided we did not remit commodities to pay old debts. But from our ſituation theſe debts muſt be ſlowly paid, and it is proper to adopt ſome fair mode of compoſition, or inſtallment <note n="*" place="bottom">This might be termed a violation of paſt contracts, if cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors were not univerſally conſenting to the meaſure.</note>. I will ſuppoſe wiſe meaſures to be purſued, ſo as to leſſen our imports a twentieth. This might produce in our favour a balance of £.10,000 in coin, and 30,000 to be applied in diſcharge of thoſe debts.

Of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence there will be a conſtant drain of our hard caſh. At the period aſſigned for redeeming the paper, we ſhall find money far more rare, and the people labouring under a debt far hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than that which is ſaid already to bear them down.

            <p>The emiſſion would afford the ſtrong body of public debtors ſuch an acceſſion of influence, as, if they pleaſed, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a combination not to be withſtood. £.250,000 divided into five hundreds, might poſſibly give 500 new debtors.

            <p>The addreſs ſays nothing of the two and a half impoſt, as a productive fund in eaſe of the aſſeſſment.

This ought undoubtedly to have leſſened their eſtimate of an aſſeſſed rate, about 6/8 in the £.100.</p>
            <p>I come now to the account of the continental debts.<note n="*" place="bottom">If gentlemen are poſſeſſed of any means to correct my ſtate of the debt, let them do it. When wrong, I ever wiſh that I may be ſet right</note> On the firſt of January, 1783, the foreign debt, according to the publiſhed eſtimate of congreſs, was 7,885,085 dollars. It has not ſince been increaſed, except by arrears of intereſt, and ſome loans, which have been applied to pay off the old intereſt, and maintain miniſters and agents. Suppoſe it to be now raiſed to 10,000,000 dollars, bearing an intereſt of five per cent. Our tenth of that ſum is only 1,000,000, equal to £.375,000, the intereſt of which is only £.18,750: So that the addreſs has erred in ſtating the intereſt of the foreign debt to be 1,723,626 dollars; becauſe that is an intereſt at five per cent. on the enormous ſum of 34, 472,520 dollars. Congreſs however is under an obligation to pay a part of the principal of the foreign debt at this time. Hence it is, that for the year 1786, they have called on the ſtates for a ſum, not to be paid every year. And hence it is, moſt probably, that the addreſs has ſo materially miſtated the annual intereſt of the foreign debt. There is indeed a great difficulty in compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the exact ſtate of continental affairs. Since the year 1783, there has been no ſtatement from congreſs that has
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020403_0037_0FAF0241DC224540"/>
been, at the ſame time, full, explicit, intelligible and clear. It is no wonder that new requiſitions, balances of the old, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt now due, intereſts annually ariſing, a million of figures, and references to ſtatements not at hand, ſhould perplex an ordinary brain, and produce miſtakes. But a common man, without a full comprehenſion of the ſubject, would not have undertaken to publiſh for the information of others. From the whole body of the delegates, in an appeal to their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, nothing but accuracy and preciſion ought to be expected; and a conſiderable time actually elapſed before I ever thought of queſtioning their ſtatements and calculations. That I was wrong in taking any thing upon truſt, I hope already appears.</p>
            <p>I will now preſent you a more complete general view of your affairs, than any you have yet ſeen. My groundwork for the ſtate of the continental debt, is the eſtimate of 1783, which I am well aſſured is the groundwork that has ever ſince ſerved congreſs itſelf.</p>
            <p>The continental debt ariſes in a great meaſure from a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance with their requiſitions. Suppoſe the whole debt to be 50,000,000 of dollars, and that although a ſtate has not complied fully with theſe requiſitions, it has complied in as great a proportion as the reſt. Now theſe fifty millions are apportioned. Surely a ſtate cannot owe its quota of the debt, and its balance of requiſitions at the ſame time. Congreſs, however, being diſappointed in one year, in the next year makes a new requiſition, and calls for the balance of ſome former demand, in order to prevent the accumulation of her principal debt, and to comply with her poſitive engagements. Could congreſs think proper, and could all its creditors agree, to convert the whole debt into a principal, bearing intereſt, and would the ſtates obey their juſt requiſitions in providing permanent funds, the burthen would every year be equal, their affairs ſimplified, and errors not likely to be made. But of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>The foreign debt paying intereſt, I have before ſtated in 1783 to be 7,885,085 dollars.</p>
            <p>The intereſt of which, partly at four, and the reſt at five per cent. is 369,038 dollars. Our tenth <note n="*" place="bottom">I am aſſured, that our quota is nearer an eleventh than a tenth. This makes an important difference. Congreſs in the requiſition for permanent funds, made it ſomething leſs than <hi>2/21,</hi> which in £. <hi>100,000</hi> would ſave us above £. <hi>5000.</hi>
               </note> thereof (diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing petty fractions, as I ſhall continue to do) is 36,903— equal to £.13,838 12 6.</p>

            <p>To raiſe this laſt ſum, ſuppoſe a recourſe to the old mode of aſſeſſment. Seven ſhillings and ſix-pence in the £.100 on 11 millions of property, gives £.41,250 groſs, which ſurely might produce more than £.37,000 net. The two rates of 6/3 and 7/6, with the 2/6 impoſed by the conſolidating act, make 16/3. And this, upon the plaineſt calculation, is the whole burthen neceſſary to be borne along with the 2½ per cent. for your whole continental and domeſtic debt, and the liberal ſupport of government. To this add 3/9 for county charges, which you are ſenſible ought to be leſs than at preſent. And your whole burthen is juſt twenty ſhillings annually for every £.100. From this 2/6 are to be ſhortly deducted, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020403_0041_0FAF0245235F9678"/>
6/3 more are to ceaſe at the end of ten years, and then the rate will be only 11/3.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe my ſcheme for a loan rejected, you have then to provide for an annual intereſt of £.60,000, until we can ſink the principal. In that caſe twelve ſhillings, inſtead of the 6/3, would be required. And then your whole contribution (excluſive of the 2½ duty) to congreſs, the ſtate and the county, would be 25/9 until the deduction of the 2/6, which would reduce it to 23/3. But inaſmuch as property is undervalued in aſſeſſments, perhaps the real value of £.100 would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute only fifteen ſhillings.</p>

They may reſt aſſured, that one of the firſt wiſhes of my ſoul, is to live in amity with all.—Let that be the principle of all! May the ſufferings of their country awaken a true zeal, and uniting in her cauſe, they will bid fair at laſt to coaleſce in brotherly love.</p>
