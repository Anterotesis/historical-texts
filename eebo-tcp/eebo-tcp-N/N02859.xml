            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was with no ſmall Difficulty that the Author's Youth and Modeſty were prevail'd on to let him appear a Preacher in our public Lecture, and afterwards to give us a Copy of his Diſcourſe, at the Deſire of divers, Miniſters and Others, who heard it. But as we quickly found him a Workman that needs not to be aſhamed before his Brethren; our Satisfaction was the greater to ſee him pitching upon ſo noble a <hi>Subject,</hi> and treating it with ſo much ſtrength and clearneſs as the judicious Reader will perceive in the following Compoſure.</p>
            <p>A Subject which ſecures to God his great Deſign in the Work of fallen Man's Redemption by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is evidently ſo laid out as that the Glory of the whole ſhould return to Him the bleſſed Ordainer, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer and Applier. A Subject which enters deep into practical Religion; without the Belief of which, <hi>that</hi> muſt ſoon die in the hearts and lives of Men.</p>
            <p>For in proportion to the ſenſe we have of our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Sovereign GOD, for all the good we want, will be our Value for Him, our Application to Him, our Truſt in Him, our Fear to offend Him, and our Care to pleaſe Him; as likewiſe our Gratitude &amp; Love, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Praiſe, upon our ſenſible Experience of his free Benefits.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, It is the very <hi>Soul of Piety</hi> to apprehend and own, That all our Springs are in Him; the Springs of our preſent Grace and Comfort, and of our future Glory and Bleſſedneſs; and that they all intirely flow thro' <hi>CHRIST</hi> by the efficacious Influence of the <hi>HOLY SPIRIT.</hi> By <hi>theſe things</hi> Saints <hi>live, and in all theſe things is the Life of our Spirits.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003415_0004_0FF8389D0DC95BA0"/>Such Doctrines as theſe, which by humbling the Minds of Men, prepare them for the Exaltations of GOD, He has ſignally own'd and proſper'd in the reformed World, and in our Land eſpecially in the Days of our Fore-fathers; and we hope they will never grow unfaſhionable among us: For, we are well aſſured, if thoſe which we call the <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> ever come to be contemn'd or diſreliſhed, vital Piety will proportionably languiſh and wear away; as theſe Doctrines always ſink in the Eſteem of Men, upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of ſerious Religion.</p>
            <p>We cannot therefore but expreſs our Joy and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the great Head of the Church is pleas'd ſtill to raiſe up from among the Children of his People, for the Supply of His Churches, thoſe who aſſert &amp; maintain theſe Evangelical Principles; and that our Churches, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Degeneracies) have ſtill a high Value for ſuch Principles, and for thoſe who publickly own and teach them.</p>
            <p>And as we cannot but wiſh and pray that the <hi>College</hi> in the neighbouring Colony, (as well as our own,) may be a fruitful Mother of many ſuch Sons as the Author, by the Bleſſing of Heaven on the Care of their preſent worthy <hi>Rector;</hi> ſo we heartily rejoyce in the ſpecial Favour of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in beſtowing ſuch a rich Gift on the happy Church of <hi>Northampton,</hi> which has for ſo many Luſtres of Years flouriſhed under the Influence of ſuch pious Doctrines, taught them in the excellent Miniſtry of their late venerable Paſtor, whoſe Gifts &amp; Spirit, we hope will long live &amp; ſhine in this his Grandſon, to the End that they may abound yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there in all the lovely fruits of Evangelical Humility and Thankfulneſs, to the Glory of GOD.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOSE Chriſtians to whom the Apoſtle directed this Epiſtle, dwelt in a Part of the World where human Wiſdom was in great Repute; as the Apoſtle obſerves in the 22. Verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>The Greeks ſeek after Wiſdom. Corinth</hi> was not far from <hi>Athens,</hi> that had been for many Ages the moſt famous Seat of Philoſophy and Learning in the World.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle therefore obſerves to them how that God by the Goſpel deſtroyed, and <hi>brought to nought,</hi> their human Wiſdom. The Learned Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and their great Philoſophers, by all their Wiſdom did not know God, they were not able to find out the Truth in divine Things. But after they had done their utmoſt to no Effect, it
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003415_0005_0FF838A02684DED0"/>
pleaſed God at length, to reveal himſelf by the Goſpel which they accounted Fooliſhneſs: He <hi>choſe the fooliſh things of the World, to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and the baſe things of the world, and things that are deſpiſed, yea and things which are not; to bring to nought the things that are.</hi> And the Apoſtle informs them why he thus did, in the Verſe of the Text, <hi>That no Fleſh ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his Preſence</hi> &amp;c. —</p>
            <p>In which Words may be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What God aims at in the Diſpoſition of things in the Affair of Redemption, viz. that Man ſhould not glory in himſelf, but alone in God; <hi>That no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence, — that according as it is written he that glories let him glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How this End is attained in the Work of Redemption, viz. by that abſolute and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Dependance which Men have upon God in that Work, for all their Good. Inaſmuch as,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> All the Good that they have is in and through Chriſt; He <hi>is made unto us Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> All the Good of the fallen and redeemed Creature is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe four things, and can't be better diſtributed than into them; but Chriſt is each of them to us, and we have none of them any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in him. <hi>He is made of God unto us Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>: In him are all the proper Good, and true Excellency of the Underſtanding. Wiſdom was a thing that the Greeks admired; but Chriſt is the true Light of the World, 'tis through him alone that true Wiſdom is imparted to the Mind. 'Tis in and by Chriſt that we have <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>: 'Tis by being in him that we are juſtified, have our
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003415_0005_0FF838A02684DED0"/>
Sins pardoned, and are received as righteous into God's Favour. 'Tis by Chriſt that we have <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>: We have in him true Excellency of Heart, as well as of Underſtanding; and He is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us inherent as well as imputed Righteouſneſs. 'Tis by Chriſt that we have <hi>Redemption,</hi> or the actual Deliverance from all Miſery, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of all Happineſs and Glory. Thus we have all our Good by Chriſt who is God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Inſtance wherein our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God for all our Good appears, is this, That 'tis God that has given us Chriſt, that we might have theſe Benefits through him; he <hi>of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis <hi>of him</hi> that we are <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and come to have an Intereſt in him, and ſo do receive thoſe Bleſſings which he is made unto us. 'Tis God that gives us Faith whereby we cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So that in this Verſe is ſhewn our Dependance on each Perſon in the Trinity for all our Good. We are dependent on Chriſt the Son of God, as he is our <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> We are dependent on the Father, who has given us Chriſt, &amp; made him to be theſe things to us. We are dependent on the Holy Ghoſt, for 'tis <hi>of him that we are in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; 'tis the Spirit of God that gives Faith in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we receive him, and cloſe with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> GOD is glorified in the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this, that there appears in it ſo abſolute and univerſal a Dependance of the Redeemed on him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003415_0006_0FF838A2EA018A40"/>Here I propoſe to ſhew, 1. That there is an abſolute &amp; univerſal Dependance of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on God for all their Good. And 2. That God hereby is exalted and glorified in the Work of Redemption.</p>
            <p n="1">I. There is an abſolute and univerſal Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Redeemed on God. The Nature and Contrivance of our Redemption is ſuch, that the Redeemed are in every thing directly, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and intirely dependent on God: They are dependent on him for all, and are dependent on him every Way.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Ways wherein the Dependance of one Being may be upon another for its Good, and wherein the Redeemed of Jeſus Chriſt depend on God for all their Good, are theſe, viz. That they have all their Good <hi>of</hi> him, and that they have all <hi>through</hi> him, and that they have all <hi>in</hi> him: That he be the Cauſe and Original whence all their Good comes, therein it is <hi>of</hi> him; and that he be the Medium by which it is obtained and conveyed, therein they have it <hi>through</hi> him; and that he be that Good it ſelf that is given and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, therein it is <hi>in</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe that are redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt do in all theſe Reſpects very directly and entirely depend on God for their all.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Redeemed have all their Good <hi>of</hi> God. God is the great Author of it; He is the firſt Cauſe of it, and not only ſo but he is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper Cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>of</hi> God that we have our Redeemer. 'Tis God that has provided a Saviour for us. Jeſus Chriſt is not only of God in his Perſon, as he is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003415_0006_0FF838A2EA018A40"/>
the only begotten Son of God; but he is from God as we are concerned in him, and in his Office of Mediator; He is the Gift of God to us: God choſe and anointed him, appointed him his Work, and ſent him into the World.</p>
            <p>And as it is God that gives, ſo 'tis God that accepts the Saviour. As it is God that provides and gives the Redeemer to buy Salvation for us, ſo it is <hi>of</hi> God that that Salvation is bought: He gives the Purchaſer, and he affords the thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed.</p>
            <p>'Tis of God that Chriſt becomes ours, that we are brought to him, and are united to him: 'Tis of God that we receive Faith to cloſe with him, that we may have an Intereſt in him. Eph. 2.8. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved, through Faith; and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God.</hi> 'Tis of God that we actually do receive all the Benefits that Chriſt has purchaſed. 'Tis God that pardons and juſtifies, and delivers from going down to Hell, and 'tis his Favour that the Redeemed are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into, and are made the Objects of, when they are juſtified. So it is God that delivers from the Dominion of Sin, and cleanſes us from our Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and changes us from our Deformity. 'Tis of God that the Redeemed do receive all their true Excellency, Wiſdom and Holineſs; and that two Ways, viz. as the Holy Ghoſt by whom theſe things are immediately wrought is from God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from him, and is ſent by him; and alſo as the Holy Ghoſt himſelf is God, by whoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Indwelling, the Knowledge of God and divine things, and a holy Diſpoſition, &amp; all Grace are confer'd and upheld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003415_0007_0FF838A55F946578"/>And tho' Means are made Uſe of in conferring Grace on Men's Souls, yet 'tis of God that we have theſe Means of Grace, and 'tis God that makes them effectual. 'Tis of God that we have the holy Scriptures; they are the Word of God. 'Tis of God that we have Ordinances, and their Efficacy depends on the immediate Influence of the Spirit of God. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſent of God, and all their Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of him. 2 Cor. 4.7. <hi>We have this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earthen Veſſels, that the Excellency of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be of God and not of us.</hi> Their Succeſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely and abſolutely on the immediate Bleſſing and Influence of God.</p>
            <p>The Redeemed have all,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God. It was of meer Grace that God gave us his only begotten Son. The Grace is great in proportion to the Dignity and Excellency of what is given: The Gift was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely precious, becauſe it was of a Perſon infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy, a Perſon of infinite Glory: and alſo becauſe it was of a Perſon infinitely near and dear to God. The Grace is great in proportion to the Benefit we have given us in him: The Benefit is doubly infinite in that in him we have Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from an infinite, becauſe an eternal Miſery, and do alſo receive eternal Joy and Glory. The Grace in beſtowing this Gift is great in proportion to our Unworthineſs to whom it is given; inſtead of deſerving ſuch a Gift, we merited infinitely ill of God's Hands. The Grace is great according to the Manner of giving, or in proportion to the Humiliation &amp; Expence of the Method &amp; Means by which Way is made for our having of the Gift. He gave him to us dwelling amongſt us; he gave
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003415_0007_0FF838A55F946578"/>
him to us incarnate, or in our own Nature; he gave him to us in our Nature, in the like Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which we have it in our fallen State, and which in us do accompany, and are occaſion'd by, the ſinful Corruption of our Nature. He gave him to us in a low and afflicted State; and not only ſo but he gave him to us ſlain that he might be a Feaſt for our Souls.</p>
            <p>The Grace of God in beſtowing this Gift is moſt free. It was what God was under no Obligation to beſtow: He might have rejected fallen Man, as he did the fallen Angels. It was what we never did any thing to merit: 'Twas given while we were yet Enemies, and before we had ſo much as repented. It was from the Love of God that ſaw no Excellency in us to attract it; and it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Expectation of ever being requited for it.</p>
            <p>And 'tis from meer Grace that the Benefits of Chriſt are applied to ſuch and ſuch particular Perſons. Thoſe that are called and ſanctified are to attribute it alone to the good Pleaſure of God's Goodneſs, by which they are diſtinguiſhed. He is ſovereign and hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</p>
            <p>Man hath now a greater Dependance on the Grace of God than he had before the Fall. He depends on the free Goodneſs of God for much more than he did then: Then he depended on God's Goodneſs for conferring the Reward of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience; for God was not obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and beſtow that Reward: But now we are dependent on the Grace of God for much more: We ſtand in need of Grace, not only to beſtow Glory upon us, but to deliver us from Hell and eternal Wrath. Under the firſt Covenant we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003415_0008_0FF838A958EAD478"/>
on God's Goodneſs to give us the Reward of Righteouſneſs; and ſo we do now. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but we ſtand in need of God's free &amp; ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace to give us that Righteouſneſs; and yet not only ſo, but we ſtand in need of his Grace to pardon our Sin, and releaſe us from the Guilt and infinite Demerit of it.</p>
            <p>And as we are dependent on the Goodneſs of God for more now than under the firſt Covenant, ſo we are dependent on a much greater, more free and wonderful Goodneſs. We are now more dependent on God's arbitrary and ſovereign good Pleaſure. We were in our firſt Eſtate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on God for Holineſs: We had our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs from him; but then Holineſs was not beſtow'd in ſuch a Way of ſovereign good Pleaſure as it is now. Man was created ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it become God to create holy all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures he created: It would have been a Diſparagement to the Holineſs of God's Nature, if he had made an intelligent Creature unholy. But now when Man is made holy, it is from meer and arbitrary Grace; God may for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Holineſs to the fallen Creature if he pleaſes, without any Diſparagement to any of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>And we are not only indeed more dependent on the Grace of God, but our Dependance is much more conſpicuous, becauſe our own Inſufficiency and Helpleſneſs in our ſelves is much more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in our fallen and undone State, than it was before we were either ſinful or miſerable. We are more apparently dependent on God for Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe we are firſt ſinful, and utterly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and afterward holy: So the Production of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003415_0008_0FF838A958EAD478"/>
the Effect is ſenſible, and its Derivation from God more obvious. If Man was ever holy and always was ſo, it would not be ſo apparent, that he had not Holineſs neceſſarily, as an inſeperable Qualification of human Nature. So we are more apparently dependent on free Grace for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, for we are firſt juſtly the Objects of his Diſpleaſure, and afterwards are received into Favour. We are more apparently dependent on God for Happineſs, being firſt miſerable, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards happy. 'Tis more apparently free and without Merit in us, becauſe we are actually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of Excellency to merit, if there could be any ſuch thing as Merit in Creature Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And we are not only without any true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, but are full of, and wholly defiled with, that which is infinitely odious. All our Good is more apparently from God, becauſe we are firſt naked and wholly without any Good, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enriched with all Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We receive all of the <hi>Power</hi> of God. Man's Redemption is often ſpoken of as a Work of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power as well as Grace. The great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God appears in bringing a Sinner from his low State, from the depths of Sin and Miſery, to ſuch an exalted State of Holineſs and Happineſs. Eph. 1.19. <hi>And what is the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty Power</hi> —.</p>
            <p>We are dependent on God's Power through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Step of our Redemption. We are dependent on the Power of God to convert us, &amp; give Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; the new Nature. 'Tis a Work of Creation: <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>We are created in Chriſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003415_0009_0FF838AC593CDC78"/>
Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.10. The fallen Creature can't at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to true Holineſs, but by being created again. Eph. 4.24. <hi>And that ye put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteouſneſs, and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 'Tis a raiſing from the Dead. Coloſ. 2.12, 13. — <hi>Wherein alſo ye are riſen with him, through the Faith of the Operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> Yea, 'tis a more glorious Work of Power than meer Creation, or raiſing a dead Body to Life, in that the Effect attained is greater and more excellent. That holy &amp; happy Being, and ſpiritual Life which is reach'd in the Work of Converſion, is a far greater, and more glorious Effect, than meer Being &amp; Life. And the State from whence the Change is made, of ſuch a Death in Sin, and total Corruption of Nature, &amp; depth of Miſery, is far more remote from the State at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, than meer Death of Non-entity.</p>
            <p>'Tis by God's Power alſo that we are preſerved in a State of Grace. 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> As Grace is at firſt from God, ſo 'tis continually from him, and is maintained by him, as much as Light in the Atmoſphere is all Day long from the Sun, as well as at firſt Dawning, or at Sun-riſing.</p>
            <p>Men are dependent on the Power of God, for every Exerciſe of Grace, and for carrying on the Work of Grace in the Heart, for the ſubduing of Sin and Corruption, &amp; increaſing holy Principles, and enabling to bring forth Fruit in good Works, and at laſt bringing Grace to it's Perfection, in making the Soul compleatly amiable in Chriſt's glorious Likeneſs, and filling of it with a ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy &amp; Bleſſedneſs; and for the raiſing of the Body to Life, and to ſuch a perfect State, that it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003415_0009_0FF838AC593CDC78"/>
ſhall be ſuitable for an Habitation and Organ for a Soul ſo perfected and bleſſed. Theſe are the moſt glorious Effects of the Power of God, that are ſeen in the Series of God's Acts with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Creatures.</p>
            <p>Man was dependent on the Power of God in his firſt Eſtate, but he is more dependent on his Power now; he needs God's Power to do more things for him, and depends on a more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Exerciſe of his Power. It was an Effect of the Power of God to make Man holy at the firſt; but more remarkably ſo now, becauſe there is a great deal of Oppoſition and Difficulty in the Way. 'Tis a more glorious Effect of Power to make that holy that was ſo depraved and under the Dominion of Sin, than to confer Holineſs on that which before had nothing of the contrary. 'Tis a more glorious Work of Power to reſcue a Soul out of the Hands of the Devil, and from the Powers of Darkneſs, and to bring it into a State of Salvation, than to confer Holineſs where there was no Prepoſſeſſion or Oppoſition. Luke 11.21, 22. <hi>When a ſtrong Man armed keepeth his Palace his Goods are in Peace; but when a ſtronger than he ſhall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh from him all his Armour wherein he truſted and divideth his Spoils.</hi> So 'tis a more glorious Work of Power to uphold a Soul in a State of Grace and Holineſs, and to carry it on till it is brought to Glory, when there is ſo much Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Heart, reſiſting, and Satan with all his Might oppoſing, than it would have been to have kept Man from falling at firſt, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had nothing in Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003415_0010_0FF838AE79612DB0"/>Thus we have ſhewn how the Redeemed are dependent on God for all their Good as they have all <hi>of</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are alſo dependent on God for all, as they have all <hi>through</hi> him. 'Tis God that is the Medium of it, as well as the Author and Fountain of it. All that we have, Wiſdom, and the Pardon of Sin, Deliverance from Hell, Acceptance into God's Favour, Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, true Comfort and Happineſs, eternal Life and Glory, we have from God by a Mediator; and this Mediator is God; which Mediator we have an abſolute Dependance upon, as He <hi>through</hi> whom we receive all. So that here is another Way wherein we have our Dependance on God for all Good. God not only gives us the Mediator, and accepts his Mediation, and of his Power &amp; Grace beſtows the things purchaſed by the Mediator, but he is the Mediator.</p>
            <p>Our Bleſſings are what we have by Purchaſe; and the Purchaſe is made of God, the Bleſſings are purchaſed of him, and God gives the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer; and not only ſo but God is the Purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Yea God is both the Purchaſer &amp; the Price; for Chriſt, who is God purchaſed theſe Bleſſings for us, by offering up himſelf as the Price of our Salvation. He purchaſed eternal Life by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf. Heb. 7.27. <hi>He offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And 9.26. <hi>He hath appeared to take away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi> Indeed it was the human Nature that was offer'd; but it was the ſame Perſon with the divine, and therefore was an infinite Price: it was looked upon as if God had been offered in Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003415_0010_0FF838AE79612DB0"/>As we thus have our Good <hi>through</hi> God, we have a Dependance on God in a Reſpect that Man in his firſt Eſtate had not. Man was to have eternal Life then through his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; ſo that he had partly a Dependance upon what was in himſelf; for we have a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon that <hi>through</hi> which we have our Good, as well as that <hi>from</hi> which we have it: and though Man's Righteouſneſs that he then depended on was indeed from God, yet it was his own, it was inherent in himſelf; ſo that his Dependance was not ſo immediately on God. But now the Righteouſneſs that we are Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on is not in our ſelves, but in God. We are ſaved through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: he <hi>is made unto us Righteouſneſs</hi>; and therefore is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of, Jer. 23.6. under that Name of <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> In that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we are juſtified by is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, it is the Righteouſneſs of God. 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>That we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in Redemption, we han't only all things <hi>of</hi> God, but <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through</hi> him, 1 Cor. 8.6. <hi>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Redeemed have all their Good <hi>in</hi> God. We not only have it <hi>of</hi> him and <hi>through</hi> him, but it conſiſts <hi>in</hi> him; he <hi>is</hi> all our Good.</p>
            <p>The Good of the Redeemed is either objective or inherent. By their objective Good I mean, that extrinſick Object, in the Poſſeſſion and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of which they are happy. Their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003415_0011_0FF838B02FC44D50"/>
Good is that Excellency or Pleaſure which is in the Soul it ſelf. With Reſpect to both of which the Redeemed have all their Good in God, or which is the ſame thing, God himſelf is all their Good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Redeemed have all their <hi>objective</hi> Good in God. God himſelf is the great Good which they are brought to the Poſſeſſion and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of by Redemption. He is the higheſt Good, &amp; the Sum of all that Good which Chriſt purchaſed. God is the Inheritance of the Saints; he is the Portion of their Souls. God is their Wealth and Treaſure, their Food, their Life, their dwelling Place, their Ornament and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, and their everlaſting Honour and Glory. They have none in Heaven but God; he is the great Good which the Redeemed are received to at Death, and which they are to riſe to at the End of the World. The <hi>Lord God</hi> He is the Light of the heavenly Jeruſalem; and is the <hi>River of the Water of Life</hi> that runs, and <hi>the Tree of Life that grows, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> The glorious Excellencies and Beauty of God will be what will for ever entertain the Minds of the Saints, and the Love of God will be their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Feaſt. The Redeemed will indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy other things; they will enjoy the Angels, and will enjoy one another: but that which they ſhall enjoy in the Angels, or each other, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe whatſoever, that will yield them Delight and Happineſs, will be what will be ſeen of God in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Redeemed have all their <hi>inherent</hi> Good in God. Inherent Good is twofold; 'tis either <hi>Excellency</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> Theſe the Redeemed not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003415_0011_0FF838B02FC44D50"/>
only derive from God, as cauſed by him, but have them in him. They have ſpiritual Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Joy by a kind of Participation of God. They are made excellent by a Communication of God's Excellency: God puts his own Beauty, i. e. his beautiful Likeneſs upon their Souls: They are made <hi>Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> or moral Image of God, 2 Pet. 1.4. They are holy by being made Partakers of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. The Saints are beautiful and bleſſed by a Communication of God's Holineſs and Joy as the Moon and Planets are bright by the Sun's Light. The Saint hath ſpiritual Joy and Pleaſure by a kind of Effuſion of God on the Soul. In theſe things the Redeemed have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; that is, they partake with him and of him.</p>
            <p>The Saints have both their ſpiritual Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Bleſſedneſs by the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God, and his Dwelling in them. They are not only cauſed by the Holy Ghoſt, but are in the Holy Ghoſt as their Principle. The Holy Spirit becoming an Inhabitant, is a vital Principle in the Soul: He acting in, upon and with the Soul, becomes a Fountain of true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Joy, as a Spring is of Water, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion and Diffuſion of it ſelf. John 4.14. <hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up into everlaſting Life.</hi> Compared with Chap. 7.38, 39. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water; but this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> The Sum of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003415_0012_0FF838B2B69CE948"/>
what Chriſt has purchaſed for us, is that Spring of Water ſpoken of in the former of thoſe Places, and thoſe Rivers of living Water ſpoken of in the latter. And the Sum of the Bleſſings, which the Redeemed ſhall receive in Heaven, is that <hi>River of Water of Life, that proceeds from the Throne of God and the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 22.1. Which doubtleſs ſignifies the ſame with thoſe <hi>Rivers of living Water,</hi> explain'd John 7.38, 39. which is elſewhere called the <hi>River of God's Pleaſures.</hi> Herein conſiſts the Fulneſs of Good, which the Saints receive of Chriſt. 'Tis by partaking of the Holy Spirit, that they have Communion with Chriſt in his Fulneſs. God hath given the Spirit, not by Meaſure unto Him; and they do receive of his Fulneſs, and Grace for Grace. This is the Sum of the Saints Inheritance: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that little of the Holy Ghoſt which Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have in this World, is ſaid to be <hi>the Earneſt of their Inheritance,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given us the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> And Ver. 5. <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who alſo hath given unto us the Earneſt of the Spirit.</hi> And Eph. 1.13, 14. <hi>Ye were ſealed with that Holy Spirit of Promiſe, which is the Earneſt of our Inheritance, until the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>Good Things</hi> are ſpoken of in Scripture as the ſame; as if the Spirit of God communicated to the Soul, comprized all good Things, Mat. 7.11. <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give good Things to them that ask him.</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> it is, Chap. 11.11. <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> This is the Sum of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003415_0012_0FF838B2B69CE948"/>
Bleſſings that Chriſt died to procure, and that are the Subject of Goſpel-Promiſes. Gal. 3.13, 14. <hi>He was made a Curſe for us, that we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith.</hi> The Spirit of God is the great Promiſe of the Father, Luke 24.49. <hi>Behold I ſend the Promiſe of my Father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.</hi> The Spirit of God therefore is called <hi>the Spirit of Promiſe</hi>; Eph. 1.13. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Thing Chriſt received, and had given into his Hand, as ſoon as he had finiſhed the Work of our Redemption, to beſtow on all that he had redeemed; Acts 2.33. <hi>Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this, which ye both ſee and hear.</hi> So that all the Holineſs and Happineſs of the Redeemed is <hi>in</hi> God. 'Tis in the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, indwelling and acting of the Spirit of God. Holineſs and Happineſs is in the Fruit, here and hereafter, becauſe <hi>God dwells in</hi> them, <hi>and they in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus 'tis God that has given us the Redeemer, and 'tis of him that our Good is purchaſed: So 'tis God that is the Redeemer, and the Price: and 'tis God alſo that is the Good purchaſed. So that all that we have is <hi>of</hi> God, and <hi>through</hi> him, and <hi>in</hi> him, Rom. 11.36. <hi>For</hi> of <hi>him, and</hi> through <hi>him, and to him,</hi> or <hi>in him</hi> are all things: The ſame in the Greek, that is here rendred <hi>to him,</hi> is render'd <hi>in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6.</p>
            <p n="2">II. God is glorified in the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this Means, viz. By there being ſo great and univerſal a Dependance of the Redeemed on him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003415_0013_0FF838B547130CE8"/>1. Man hath ſo much the greater Occaſion and Obligation to take notice and acknowledge God's Perfections and All-ſufficiency. The greater the Creatures Dependance is on God's Perfections, and the greater Concern he has with them, ſo much the greater Occaſion has he to take notice of them. So much the greater Concern any one has with and Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Power and Grace of God, ſo much the greater Occaſion has he to take notice of that Power and Grace. So much the greater and more immediate Dependance there is on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Holineſs, ſo much the greater Occaſion to take notice of and acknowledge that. So much the greater and more abſolute Dependance we have on the divine Perfections, as belonging to the ſeveral Perſons of the Trinity, ſo much the greater Occaſion have we to obſerve and own the divine Glory of each of them. That which we are moſt concerned with, is ſurely moſt in the Way of our Obſervation and Notice; and this kind of Concern with any thing, viz. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, does eſpecially tend to commend and oblige the Attention and Obſervation. Thoſe Things that we are not much Dependent upon, 'tis eaſy to neglect; but we can ſcarce do any other than mind that which we have a great Dependance on. By Reaſon of our ſo great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God, and his Perfections, and in ſo many Reſpects; He and his Glory are the more directly ſet in our View, which Way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we turn our Eyes.</p>
            <p>We have the greater Occaſion to take notice of God's All-ſufficiency, when all our Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is thus every Way of him. We have the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003415_0013_0FF838B547130CE8"/>
more Occaſion to contemplate him as an infinite Good, and as the Fountain of all Good. Such a Dependance on God <hi>demonſtrates</hi> God's All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. So much as the Dependance of the Creature is on God, ſo much the greater does the Creatures Emptineſs in himſelf appear to be: and ſo much the greater the Creatures Emptineſs, ſo much the greater muſt the Fulneſs of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, who ſupplies him. Our having all <hi>of</hi> God, ſhews the Fulneſs of his Power and Grace: Our having all <hi>through</hi> him, ſhews the Fulneſs of his Merit and Worthineſs; and our having all <hi>in</hi> him demonſtrates his Fulneſs of Beauty, Love and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And the Redeemed by Reaſon of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Dependance on God, han't only ſo much the greater Occaſion, but Obligation to contemplate and acknowledge the Glory and Fulneſs of God. How unreaſonable &amp; ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould we be, if we did not acknowledge that Sufficiency and Glory, that we do abſolutely, immediately and univerſally depend upon?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby is demonſtrated how great God's Glory is conſidered comparatively, or as compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Creatures. By the Creatures being thus wholly and univerſally dependent on God, it appears that the Creature is nothing, and that God is all. Hereby it appears that God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above us; that God's Strength, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Holineſs are infinitely greater than ours. However great and glorious the Creature apprehends God to be, yet if he be not ſenſible of the difference between God and him, ſo as to ſee that God's Glory is great compared with his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003415_0014_0FF838B7DD5AF420"/>
own, he will not be diſpoſed to give God the Glory due to his Name. If the Creature in any Reſpects ſets himſelf upon a Level with God, or exalts himſelf to any Competition with him, however he may apprehend that great Honour and profound Reſpect may belong to God from thoſe that are more inferiour, and at a greater Diſtance, will not be ſo ſenſible of it's being due from him. So much the more Men exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo much the leſs will they ſurely be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to exalt God. 'Tis certainly a Thing that God aims at in the Diſpoſition of Things in the Affair of Redemption, (if we allow the Scriptures to be a Revelation of God's Mind) that God ſhould appear full, and Man in himſelf empty, that God ſhould appear all, and Man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 'Tis God's declared Deſign that others ſhould not <hi>glory in his Preſence,</hi> which implies that 'tis his Deſign to advance his own compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Glory. So much the more Man <hi>glories in God's Preſence,</hi> ſo much the leſs Glory is aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By it's being thus ordered, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould have ſo abſolute and univerſal a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God, Proviſion is made that God ſhould have our whole Souls, and ſhould be the Object of our undivided Reſpect. If we had our Dependance partly on God, and partly on ſomething elſe, Man's Reſpect would be divided to thoſe different Things on which he had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance. Thus it would be if we depended on God only for a Part of our Good, and on our ſelves, or ſome other Being, for another Part; Or if we had our Good only <hi>from</hi> God, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003415_0014_0FF838B7DD5AF420"/>
               <hi>through</hi> another that was not God, and <hi>in</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe diſtinct from both, our Hearts would be divided between the Good it ſelf, and him <hi>from</hi> whom, and him <hi>through</hi> whom we received it. But now there is no Occaſion for this, God being not only he <hi>from</hi> or <hi>of</hi> whom we have all Good, but alſo <hi>through</hi> whom, and one that is that Good it ſelf, that we have from him, and through him. So that whatſoever there is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract our Reſpect, the Tendency is ſtill directly towards God, all unites in him as the Center.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We may here obſerve the marvellous Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in the Work of Redemption. God hath made Man's Emptineſs and Miſery, his low, loſt and ruin'd State into which he is ſunk by the Fall, an Occaſion of the greater Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Glory, as in other Ways ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this, that there is now a much more univerſal and apparent Dependance of Man on God. Though God be pleaſed to lift Man out of that diſmal Abyſs of Sin and Woe into which he was fallen, and exceedingly to exalt him in Excellency and Honour, and to an high Pitch of Glory and Bleſſedneſs, yet the Creature hath nothing in any Reſpect to glory of; all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evidently belongs to God, all is in a meer, and moſt abſolute and divine Dependance on the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And each Perſon of the Trinity is equally glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in this Work: There is an abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the Creature on every one for all: All is <hi>of</hi> the Father, all <hi>through</hi> the Son, and all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003415_0015_0FF838B96B1CE168"/>
                  <hi>in</hi> the Holy Ghoſt. Thus God appears in the Work of Redemption, as <hi>all in all.</hi> 'Tis fit that he that <hi>is, and there is none elſe,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt, the all and the only, in this Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence thoſe Doctrines and Schemes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity that are in any Reſpect oppoſite to ſuch an abſolute, &amp; univerſal Dependance on God, do derogate from God's Glory, and thwart the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Contrivance for our Redemption. Thoſe Schemes that put the Creature in God's ſtead, in any of the mentioned Reſpects, that exalt Man into the Place of either Father, Son, or Holy Ghoſt, in any thing pertaining to our Redemption; that however they may allow of a Dependance of the Redeemed on God, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Dependance that is ſo abſolute and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; that own an intire Dependance on God for ſome things, but not for others; that own that we depend on God for the Gift and Acceptance of a Redeemer, but deny ſo abſolute a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him for the obtaining of an Intereſt in the Redeemer; that own an abſolute Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Father for giving his Son, and on the Son for working out Redemption, but not ſo entire a Dependance on the Holy Ghoſt for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, &amp; a being in Chriſt, &amp; ſo coming to a 'Title to his Benefits; that own a Dependance on God for means of Grace, but not abſolutely for the Benefit and Succeſs of thoſe Means; that own a partial Dependance on the Power of God, for the obtaining &amp; exerciſing Holineſs, but not a meer Dependance on the arbitrary &amp; ſovereign Grace of God; that own a Dependance on the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003415_0015_0FF838B96B1CE168"/>
free Grace of God for a Reception into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſo far that it is without any proper Merit, but not as it is without being attracted, or moved with any Excellency; that own a partial Dependance on Chriſt, as he through whom we have Life, as having purchaſed new Terms of Life, but ſtill hold that the Righteouſneſs through which we have Life is inherent in our ſelves, as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Covenant: and whatever other Way any Scheme is inconſiſtent with our entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God for all, and in each of thoſe Ways, of having all <hi>of</hi> him, <hi>through</hi> him, and <hi>in</hi> him, it is repugnant to the Deſign and Tenor of the Goſpel, and robs it of that which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts its Luſtre and Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence we may learn a Reaſon why Faith is that by which we come to have an Intereſt in this Redemption; for there is included in the Nature of Faith, a Senſibleneſs, and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of this abſolute Dependence on God in this Affair. 'Tis very fit that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all, in order to their having the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this Redemption, that they ſhould be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, &amp; acknowledge the Dependance on God for it. 'Tis by this Means that God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to glorify himſelf in Redemption, &amp; 'tis fit that God ſhould at leaſt have this Glory of thoſe that are the Subjects of this Redemption; and have the Benefit of it.</p>
               <p>Faith is a Senſibleneſs of what is real in the Work of Redemption; &amp; as we do really whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend on God, ſo the Soul that believes doth entirely depend on God for all Salvation, in its own Senſe, &amp; Act. Faith abaſes Men, &amp; exalts
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003415_0016_0FF838BB8EBC4EF0"/>
God, it gives all the Glory of Redemption to God alone. I is neceſſary in order to ſaving Faith, that Man ſhould be emptied of himſelf, that he ſhould be ſenſible that he is <hi>wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is a great Ingredient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of true Faith: He that truly receives Redemption receives it <hi>as a little Child,</hi> Mark 10.15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little Child, he ſhall not enter therein.</hi> 'Tis the Delight of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul to abaſe it ſelf and exalt God alone: that is the Language of it, Pſal. 115.1. <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but to thy Name give Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and aſcribe to him all the Glory of Redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increaſe in, a Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of our great Dependance on God, to have our Eye to him alone, to mortify a ſelf-dependent, and ſelf-righteous Diſpoſition. Man is naturally exceeding Prone to be exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and depending on his own Power or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as tho' he were he from whom he muſt expect Happineſs, and to have Reſpect to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments aliene from God and his Spirit, as thoſe in which Happineſs is to be found.</p>
               <p>And this Doctrine ſhould teach us to exalt God alone as by Truſt &amp; Reliance, ſo by Praiſe. <hi>Let him that glories glory in the Lord.</hi> Hath any Man Hope that he is converted, and ſanctified, and that his Mind is endowed with true Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and ſpiritual Beauty, and his Sins forgiven, and he received into God's Favour, and exalted to the Honour and Bleſſedneſs of being his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003415_0016_0FF838BB8EBC4EF0"/>
Child, and an Heir of eternal Life; let him give God all the Glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worſt of Men in this World, or the Miſerableſt of the damned in Hell. Hath any Man much Comfort &amp; ſtrong Hope of eternal Life, let not his Hope lift him up, but diſpoſe him the more to abaſe himſelf, and reflect on his own exceeding Unworthineſs of ſuch a Favour, and to exalt God alone. Is any Man eminent in Holineſs, and abundant in good Words, let him take nothing of the Glory of it to himſelf, but aſcribe it to him whoſe <hi>Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we are, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto Good Works.</hi>
