            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that may afford entertainment to my courteous reader.</p>
            <p>My father dying when I was young, my mother put me apprentice to learn the trace or occupation of a carpenter. On the other ſide of the road, oppoſite to the houſe where I lived there dwelt a tailor, who had an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice named <hi>William White,</hi> with whom I was very intimate, during the time of his apprenticeſhip, but he was out of his time and went to ſea ſome time before I was free, being about three years older than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>White, as I before obſerved, went to ſea ſometime before I was free, but he did not return, nor do I remember that I ever ſaw or
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:045870_0004_10207588B9BCB360"/>
heard of him afterwards, till I found him among the pirates.</p>
            <p>From my youth I had an almoſt irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſire for undertaking a voyage to ſea, which I reſolved at all events to gratify, as ſoon as I obtained a right to diſpoſe of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In eſtabliſhing this reſolution, a love of novelty, joined to a ſecret delight I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in hearing ſailors relate the curioſities they met with in their voyages, doubtleſs had a great effect, and the older I grew the impreſſion became the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>But however ſtrong my deſire was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſea, a ſenſe of the duty I owed my ſurviving parent, ſo far overballanced my inclination, as to occaſion me to form a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination not to gratify it untill I ſhould be of age, unleſs I could gain her conſent. The propenſity however was ſo ſtrong as to induce me at the age of ſeventeen, to apply to my mother and requeſt liberty to go <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> voyage to ſea. My mother was very uneaſy at the requeſt, and uſed every art of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that maternal tenderneſs could dictate, to induce me to relinquiſh the deſign. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſome ſurpriſe that I ſhould entertain any idea of following the ſea, as it was a life moſt evidently attended with innumerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and dangers: urging, as a particular reaſon for her diſapprobation of the meaſure, the melancholly fate of my father, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeafaring man, was taken by a French
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:045870_0005_1020758A450677F0"/>
frigate, on a voyage homeward bound, and carried into Martinico, a number of years before, where he underwent all the hardſhips of a cloſe and cruel confinement, and altho' ultimately redeemed, with many others, was ſuppoſed to be moſt inhumanly poiſoned by the French, on board the cartel, as they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally died on their paſſage home.</p>
            <p>However ſtrong an argument this might have appeared to my mother it failed of its deſired effect upon me, it only lulled my deſire for a while, but by no means eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: I waited however with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of impatience about two years longer, when I again aſked leave to go a voyage to the Weſtindies, and my mother finding my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution unabated, concluded ſhe could as well part with me then as when I became of age, after which ſhe imagined ſhe ſhould not be able to detain me. Upon the whole ſhe told me ſhe was unwilling I ſhould go to the Weſtindies, but that the ſloop Dolphin, capt. Haſkell was then in the harbor, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out for a fiſhing voyage, and if I would go with him ſhe would give her conſent; to this propoſal I readily aſſented.</p>
            <p>I accordingly ſhipped on board the ſloop, and had a tolerable paſſage to the fiſhing ground; but ſoon after our arrival there, we were ſurprized by the appearance of a ſhip, which from external ſigns we ſuſpected to be a pirate. We were not by any means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:045870_0006_1020758D190C2F88"/>
to oppoſe ſo formidable an enemy, and ſhe was ſo cloſe upon us before we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her as to render it impoſſible for us to eſcape by running away, we were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged to abide our fate peaceably let the conſequence be what it would.</p>
            <p>The pirate ſoon came up and ſent a boat on board our ſloop, demanding who we were, and where we were bound; to which our captain gave a direct anſwer. By this boat's crew we learned, that the noted pirate capt. Phillips commanded their ſhip. This intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence it will readily be conceived, gave us great uneaſineſs, moſt of our crew being quite young, and having often heard of the cruelties committed by that execrable pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which made us dread to fall into his hands.</p>
            <p>The pirate's boat ſoon boarded us again, demanding the name of every hand on board: In this boat came <hi>White</hi> the tailor, with whom I had been acquainted during his apprenticeſhip, as beforementioned. I was greatly ſurprized to find him employed in ſo criminal a courſe of life, though I ſaid nothing of the matter to him. On the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the pirate's boat with a liſt of our names, White, as I was afterwards inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, acquainted Philips of his knowledge of me, informing him, that if he could engage me in his ſervice, he would gain a good ſtout reſolute fellow, every way he ſuppoſed, ſuch a hand as he wanted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:045870_0007_102075918647C5D8"/>
On receiving this information, as he ſtood in need of a hand, and found we had no property he wanted on board, he ſent his boat once more with orders to capt. Haſkell, to ſend me on board his ſhip and the reſt of the crew with the ſloop, may go free. My worthy commander, with much viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in his countenance, took me aſide, and informed me of Phillips's orders, adding, that although it would be exceedingly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and painful to him to let me go, yet as we were entirely in the power of a bloody mercileſs ruffian, and no hopes of eſcape but by giving me up, I believe, ſays he, you muſt go and try your fortune with them.</p>
            <p>The thought of being ſacrificed as it were to procure liberty for the reſt of the crew, opperated greatly upon my ſpirits, and the firſt concluſion I drew up was, that I would not on any conditions agree to go on board the pirate. I therefore told my captain that I had ever been faithful to his intereſt and commands, that I had always wiſhed to do my duty punctually and well, but that I was determined not to go on board the pirate let the conſequence be what it would. Our converſation ended here, for that time, and the boat returned without me.</p>
            <p>Phillips was greatly incenſed when the boat returned without me, and ſent again, with orders to bring me either dead or alive. My capt. took me aſide again, and told me the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:045870_0008_10207594591ED110"/>
pirate's reſolution and meſſage, adding that he believed I ſhould do well to go with them, for if I refuſed to go, and made reſiſtance, it would be inevitable death to me, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to our whole crew: He urged further, that my ſubmitting would prove the certain releaſe of the reſt of the crew, and there would at leaſt be a probability of my making an eſcape from them at ſometime or other: But if I could not find a way to eſcape, it was not impoſſible but Phillips might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge me, for he had ſent word that if I would agree to ſerve him faithfully for two months, he would then ſet me at liberty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe only who have been in ſimilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances can form an adequate idea of the diſtreſs I experienced at this time. If I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſed to join the pirates, inſtant death ſtared me and my comrades in the face, if I conſented to go with them I expected to be maſſacred for refuſing to ſign their pirat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical articles, which I had fully determined never to do, though I ſhould be put to the extremity of torture for refuſal. Into ſo critical a ſituation had my bad fortune plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me, that inevitable deſtruction ſeemed to ſtare me in the face from every quarter.</p>
            <p>I took the matter however into ſerious conſideration, and after the moſt mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, determined, to venture myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, rather than bring the vengeance of the pirates on my comrades; I therefore
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:045870_0009_1020759725E40AF0"/>
went with them, ſeemingly contented, and the capt. renewing his promiſe to ſet me at liberty in two months, I engaged to ſerve him to the beſt of my abilities during <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> term. I was likewiſe agreeably diſappointed in their not urging ſo ſtrenuouſly as I expected the thing I moſt of all dreaded, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ſigning of their articles. To induce me to join them they uſed more arguments of a perſuaſive than a compulſory nature, judging I ſuppoſe, that youth would be more eaſily enticed than compelled to join in ſharing their ill-gotten gain.</p>
            <p>When I firſt went aboard of the pirate their crew conſiſted of ten men, including their captain, and the whole of them I think, as ſtout, daring, hardy looking fellows as ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I ſaw together. As I was then the only hand aboard who had not ſubſcribed their articles, the capt. aſſigned me to the helm, where I kept my ſtation during the greateſt part of the time I ſtayed with them.</p>
            <p>No captures of any conſequence were made during the firſt two months: Some ſmall veſſels were taken, but their lading was too inconſiderable to ſatisfy the inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition of the pirates.</p>
            <p>The period being now arrived, when I had a right, according to agreement, to demand my liberty, I thought it a proper ſeaſon at leaſt to remind the capt. of the manumiſſion he had engaged me. For this purpoſe I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:045870_0010_10207598AE518370"/>
went to him, and in language the leaſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive I could frame, reminded him of his promiſe, and requeſted him to fulfil it. Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips in tollerable good humour, replied, that we had done but little buſineſs ſince I came aboard; that he could not well ſpare me yet, but if I would ſtay with him three months longer, he would then ſet me at liberty UPON HIS HONOR, and I was obliged quietly to ſubmit, comply with his demands, and truſt to his honor, though it turned out in the end that it did but mock me.</p>
            <p>Nothing of any importance occurred dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this three months. Some few ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were taken and plundered; their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes were of no great value and their hands were diſmiſſed with their veſſels, except two or three robuſt, ſtout looking men whom Phillips picked from among them and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſign his articles.</p>
            <p>When the three months were expired, I went to the capt. and once more reminded him of the expiration of my ſervitude, and handſomely requeſted him to ſet me aſhore according to his promiſe, that I might go to my mother, who had not heard from me ſince my firſt capt. returned from his fiſhing voyage.</p>
            <p>Set you at liberty, damn you; you ſhall be ſet at liberty when I damn'd and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore replied Phillips; in a rage more compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible with the diabolical diſpoſition of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:045870_0011_1020759A40A540B0"/>
fiend than a being endowed with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſoul, ſuſceptible of human ſenſations.</p>
            <p>It is evident, and experience daily evinces, that perſons, by habituating themſelves to any particular vice, become ſo familiarized thereto, as to be unable to diſtinguiſh it from a real virtue; and in ſuch caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ceaſes to alarm the underſtanding and ſuffers the culprit to purſue it to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. This was undoubtedly the caſe with capt. Phillips, who was not addicted to one particular vice, but to every vice.</p>
            <p>Having now loſt all hope and probability of being liberated, there was no alternative more eligible for me than to ſuſtain my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude with as much patience, reſolution and fortitude as poſſible. Although the capt. had aſſerted that I ſhould not be ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty till he was damned, I was ſtill in hopes that we might be taken by ſome veſſel, or that we might take more priſoners, who, in concert with myſelf, might be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſome plan whereby we might take the ſhip, and thereby incapacitate Philips to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether I ſhould obtain my freedom before he received his final doom, or not.</p>
            <p>As we were ſailing, one day, we came within view of a fine merchant veſſel, the appearance of which pleaſed the capt. much, who ſwore by heaven he would have it. Accordingly I was ordered to bear off for her as direct as poſſible. Phillips being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:045870_0012_1020759D19C62118"/>
anxious for taking this veſſel, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deck with his glaſs in his hand, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her the greateſt part of the day, and damning me becauſe, as he ſaid, I did not ſteer ſo well as I might.</p>
            <p>Eleven holes he cut through my hat and the ſkin of my head, without the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, with his broad ſword. But the merchantman being lightly built and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely rigged, left ſight of us before night. Phillips exclaiming in a horrid rage, that the loſs of that fine ſhip was all my damned do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, adding that he wanted the damned thing juſt long enough to ſail to hell in.</p>
            <p>We had ſundry priſoners on board, French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and negroes; we had alſo an American with whom I had been intimately acquainted when young, and whom the pirates could neither perſuade nor compel to ſign their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Thus fortune had ſent me one friend with whom I could ſympathize under my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſupportable calamities; though our ſympathy was chiefly confined to looks and private geſtures, for we durſt not complain in the hearing of the crew.</p>
            <p>About the end of the ſeventh month from my entering on board, we took a merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man belonging to Boſton, capt. Harridon commander, a young man only twenty two years of age. The father of this young man was a merchant in Boſton, and had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this ſon the education requiſite for a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:045870_0013_102075A3C2F55AD0"/>
and ſent him to the Weſtindies, capt. of this veſſel, in which he was returning home when we took him.</p>
            <p>All except Harridon, James Cheeſeman a ſhip carpenter, and a Spaniſh indian, who was taken with Harridon, my friend whom I mentioned above, and myſelf, had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſign the pirates articles. We had been enjoined to ſign them but had utterly refuſed, chooſing rather to be killed by the villains, than to be taken, condemned and executed, for being their aſſociates. But I ſuppoſe they thought we might be ſerviceable to them and therefore deemed it beſt not to diſpatch us yet.</p>
            <p>One day we took a large veſſel, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable trouble in chacing, but found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on board worthy the attention of the pirates, except their proviſions and water, which being in ſome want of, Phillips ſtript them of it entirely, took out one or two of their hands, and then let them go.</p>
            <p>Some of the pirates having been ſent on board Harridon's veſſel, there remained only ſix of the old pirates on board, beſides thoſe who had been forced to ſign their articles, and as there were five of us who wiſhed to eſcape from them, we began to think and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſuggeſt ſomething about trying ſome ſcheme to effect that purpoſe. There was no time that we could confer together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcovered, except in the dead of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:045870_0014_102075A54BC3DB28"/>
the night, and even then we durſt not be all together, and conſequently could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty, ſucceed in forming any regular plan to effect our eſcape.</p>
            <p>One day we came in ſight of a merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which Phillips imagining would prove a valuable prize gave orders for chacing. His orders were put in execution immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the merchantman being lightly built, and a prime ſailer, we chaced her three days before we were able to capture them. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made what diſpoſition he pleaſed of the hands &amp;c. he found on board the new prize, Phillips ordered one Fern, a daring reſolute fellow of the old pirate crew, to go on board of her, and take command, taking ſome of the old crew along with him.</p>
            <p>Phillips had now become ſo exceedingly arbitrary as to be hated by his own crew, but they ſtood in ſuch dread of him that they durſt no more contradict his orders than they durſt to die. Soon after night came on, Fern propoſed to the pirates with him, that as they were now in poſſeſſion of a fine veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, every way fitted for a cruiſer, and as good a ſailor as Phillips's if they would join him he would put out his lights, and ſteering by the light of the old pirate, make their eſcape from the tyranny of Phillips, and ſet up for themſelves. The crew accordingly joined, and they began to execute their plan, but Phillips ſuſpecting their deſign, on finding
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:045870_0015_102075A6D44986F8"/>
they darkened their ſhip, put out his own light and endeavoured to follow them; in which deſign he ſucceeded ſo well as to be in ſight of them next morning. We continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to chace the new pirate till the third day before we came up with her, when a fierce engagement enſued, but Fern ſoon finding himſelf overpowered, and no hope of eſcape, ſent word to Phillips, that if he would grant him a pardon he would ſtrike to him, and once more ſerve him faithfully, but if not they would all fight till they died; Phillips immediately complied with their demand, and ſent orders for Fern to come on board his ſhip, which he did, and Phillips, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his engagement to pardon, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ran his ſword through his body, and then blew his brains out with his piſtol, and thus glutted his own vengeance, and ridded us of a deſperate enemy.</p>
            <p>I mentioned before that there were five of us who had not ſigned the pirate's articles, and as Phillips by killing Fern had left but five of the old pirate crew alive, we began to conceive it a proper opportunity to make our eſcape. We were however exceedingly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and had not yet had an opportunity to communicate our plans to my Newengland friend beforementioned, yet conſcience made the pirates ſuſpicious of ſomething of the kind being in agitation, and from the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent murderous proceedure of Phillips we
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:045870_0016_102075A85C546930"/>
had reaſon to apprehend they had in reality diſcovered our intentions.</p>
            <p>My friend the American before mentioned being on board the veſſel lately taken from Capt. Harridon, Phillips ordered out a boat and went on board, where he accuſed him with joining in a plot, aſſiſted by me, to kill him and all his crew, and take the veſſel. My friend ſolemnly denied the accuſation and declared he knew nothing of ſuch a plan, which was, in fact the caſe, for I afterwards learned that there had nothing been ſaid to him about it. This reply, however true, did not mitigate the captain's paſſion, in the leaſt, for he damned him, ſwore he would ſend him to hell, and inſtantly ran him through the body with his ſword, in ſuch a manner that he twiſted the point of it off, leaving it in his backbone.</p>
            <p>My friend, I ſuppoſe, not being conſcious of having received his death wound, ſtill denied the charge, and with great earneſtneſs begged that his life might be ſpared, but the capt. whoſe inſatiable thirſt for flaughter was not ſufficiently gorged, damned him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his piſtol and ſhot him through the head, exclaiming, I have ſent one of the dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ils to hell and where is Fillmore, he ſhall go next. I was then ordered to go aboard Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridon's veſſel.</p>
            <p>My long familiarity with, &amp; conſtant appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of death, rendered its near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:045870_0017_102075AEF34F5870"/>
leſs terrifying than formerly; but I did not receive this meſſage without heart-rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſations and thrilling emotions of trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and fear. But Phillips was complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpotic, and there was no ſuch thing as evading his commands: I therefore drew up a reſolution that if I found he was bent on my death I would ſell my life as dear as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and endeavor to kill him firſt. With this reſolution, and as much fortitude as I could muſter, I went on board to Phillips, and ſtood by a handſpeak that lay upon the deck, Phillips charged me as he had done my friend with contriving to betray him and take the ſhip. The accuſation was true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but I concluded a lie was warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that caſe, and conſequently replied that I knew nothing of any conſpiracy either againſt him or his crew. I had prepared myſelf to make reſiſtance in caſe he offered any abuſe, but he had a piſtol concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his coat, which he preſented to my breaſt and ſnapped it before I had time to make any evaſion; but happily for me, it miſſed fire. He drew it back, cocked and preſented it again, but I ſtruck it aſide with my hand, ſo that it went off by my ſide without doing any injury.</p>
            <p>I thought of knocking out his brains with the handſpeak that lay near me, but I knew it would be inſtant death for me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded, if he would leave me, I
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:045870_0018_102075B07B20AC48"/>
would not meddle with him at that junctur<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> He then ſwung his ſword over my hea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> damned me and bid me go about my buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, adding, that he only did that to try me Theſe laſt words raiſed my ſpirits one degre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> higher than they had been before; for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I thought that ſnapping a loaded piſto<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at a man's breaſt, was an harſh mode of trial, and ſuch an one as I had by no means been accuſtomed to before. I ſtooped to take up the handſpeak, thinking to try him with the but end of that, but upon mature conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concluded to let the matter reſt a little longer, and watch for a more convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to reſent the injury. The piſtol miſſing fire when ſnapped at my breaſt, and then going off by my ſide, was a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to me that providence had interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed graciouſly in my preſervation, that our final deliverance from the barbarity of the ſavage Phillips, and his abandoned banditti, might be the more ſpeedily effected.</p>
            <p>A few weeks now enſued which were ſpent in tolerable good humour and peace among all hands on board, and myſelf and friends put on the ſemblance of content as much as poſſible, though we were inceſſantly ſeeking opportunities to confer with each other upon ſome mode of eſcape; but no proper oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity occurred, nor indeed were our meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures properly concerted as yet.</p>
            <p>Again we were called upon to ſign their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:045870_0019_102075B209247FF8"/>
flagitious articles, and become willing mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the piratical band, with menaces of immediate death in caſe we ſtill refuſed; but we had heard their threats too often to be frightened into a compliance by them now.</p>
            <p>A ſhort time after this, being about nine months after I was taken, and about two from the time we fell in with and made a prize of the the veſſel, board of which Harriſon was taken, the crew, in commemmoration of ſome ſignal advantage, which they had obtained, had a grand carouſe; eating, drinking, and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day in ſuch diverſions as their groſs inclinations required. A favorable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity now ſeemed to offer to extricate us from our ſuffering, and we determined to improve it if poſſible. Cheeſeman was ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by Phillips, to bring ſome tools on deck and do ſomething towards repairing the ſhip, early next morning, and the maſter was ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to take an obſervation next day at noon to find out where we were. Thus far prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence ſeemed to favor our deſign and we felt firm in the determination of executing of it next day.</p>
            <p>It was late in the evening before the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates retired to reſt, and White and one more of the o'd pirates got into the cabooſe, as drunk as beaſts and lay down before the ire. A favorable opportunity now ſeemed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> offer for us to improve in confering upon ſome means for our eſcape. We got togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:045870_0020_102075B3C981DA68"/>
held a conſultation and concluded to riſk our lives in trying to work our deliverance, concluding that we had better die in ſo juſt a cauſe, than ſhare the fate of our late New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>england friend, which we had no doubt would ſoon overtake us, if we perſiſted in our determination never to ſign their articles or ſhare in their unlawful gain.</p>
            <p>When I mention that we had determined on an immediate execution of our deſign, I would inform the reader that there were but three of us, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Cheeſeman, myſelf and the Spaniſh indian before mentioned, for poor Harridon declared that his heart was broken, his reſolution and courage gone by a ſeries of ill-uſuage, and that he durſt not engage to aſſiſt but would not diſcover our plot: thus there remained only three of us to engage the whole crew, and the indian we felt rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dubious about, though we gained a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him from his having firmly refuſed ſeveral times, though threatened with imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death, to ſubſcribe the pirating articles. However I muſt do him the honor to ſay he was true to his truſt, and had it not have been for him our plot would moſt probably have failed in the execution.</p>
            <p>Cheeſeman, the indian and myſelf got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and agreed that Cheeſeman ſhould leave his broad ax on the main deck when he had done uſing of it, and when I ſaw Cheeſman make ready to graſp the maſter, I was to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:045870_0021_102075BA65474238"/>
catch it up and make the beſt uſe of it I could, cutting and flaſhing all that offered to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me, while the indian was to ſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to help as occaſion may require. And each one of us in the mean time was to do every thing he could think of to forward the deſign.</p>
            <p>Our plan being thus concerted, I went down into the cabooſe where White and John Roſe Archer, a deſperate fellow who had been taken in one of the prizes, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately joined the pirates, laid on the floor, as before mentioned, drunk as beaſts. I took fire and burnt theſe two villains in the feet, while they lay ſenſeleſs, ſo badly as to render them unable to be upon deck next day. There were only four left now of the old pirate gang, and five who had joined them ſince, beſides the two who I had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incapable of injuring us.</p>
            <p>We were up early in the morning and Cheeſeman uſed the broad ax and left it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. It was very late in the morning and the pirates were none of them up, and we were afraid they would not ariſe until too late to take an obſervation, and our plan of conſequence muſt fall through. To prevent this, about ten o'clock I went to the cabbin door and told the captain the ſun was almoſt up to the meridian. Damn you, ſaid he, it is none of your buſineſs. This was all the thanks I got, and indeed all I expected for
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:045870_0022_102075BBEE0D7978"/>
my ſervice. However, it anſwered the end deſigned, for the captain, boatſwain, quarter maſter and maſter came upon deck a little after eleven o'clock. Enquiry was made for White and Archer and their burns im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to accident. Harradon was nearly dead with fear and the indian became near as white as any of us. Phillips took notice of Harradon's paleneſs, and I cloaked the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by informing him that Harridon had been ſick all night, and I believed a dram would help him: Phillips told me to go to his caſe and get a bottle of brandy which I did, and we all drank heartily except the indian who refuſed to taſte a drop, tho' ſomething apt to drink at other times.</p>
            <p>The important criſis now drew near when three of us were to attack the whole crew; the maſter prepared to take his obſervation, and Cheeſeman was walking the deck with a hammar in his hand. The quartermaſter was in the cabbin drawing out ſome leaden ſlugs for a muſket, and the Spaniſh indian ſtood by the cabbin door. The captain and boatſwain ſtood by the mainmaſt, talking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome matters, and I ſtood partly behind them, whirling the axe round with my foot, till my knees fairly ſmote together.</p>
            <p>The maſter being buſied, I ſaw Cheeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man make the motion to heave him over, and I at that inſtant, ſplit the boatſwain's head in twain with the broad ax, and dropped him
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:045870_0023_102075BD7657B288"/>
upon the deck to welter in his gore. Before the capt. had time to put himſelf into a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of defence, I gave him a ſtroke with the head of my ax which partly ſtunned him; at the ſame time Cheeſeman diſpatched the maſter overboard, and then came to my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and gave the capt. a blow with his hammer on the back ſide of his head, which put an immediate end to his mortal exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The quartermaſter hearing the buſtle, came running out of the cabbin with his hand up to ſtrike Cheeſeman with his hammer, and would probably have killed him, had not the indian catched him by the elbow, as he was bringing the hammer down, and there held him, untill I came up and gave him a blow upon the back ſide of his head, cutting his wig and neck almoſt off, ſo that his head hung down before him.</p>
            <p>We had now diſpatched all the old pirates except White, and demanded a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the veſſel, which was granted, and thoſe poor frenchmen and negroes came to us, fell down, and imbraced our legs and feet, begging for their lives.</p>
            <p>White, Archer, and one more of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were tried, condemned and executed in Boſton, the three other pirates were ſent to England with the veſſel, with whom my friend Cheeſeman and the indian went like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whom government liberally rewarded for their ſervices, and gave Cheeſeman an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:045870_0024_102075BF03ED8610"/>
birth in one the king's ſhipyards: the three pirates who went home with the veſſel, were hung at execution dock, and the veſſel made a prize of by government.</p>
            <p>I never ſaw any of the human ſpecie more ſpiteful and malicious than White was, from the time he was taken till he was executed. I believe he would have killed me any time in that interval had it been in his power.</p>
            <p>The honorable Court which condemned the pirates gave me captain Phillips gun, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hilted ſword, ſilver ſhoe and knee buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, a curious tobaccobox, and two gold rings that the pirate capt. Philips uſed to wear.</p>

At this time ſome of the pirates were on deck, and one of them aſked leave to fire another gun, which being granted, he would not ſwab the gun out nor have the vent ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but put in the cartridge, and ſtood di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect before the muzzle to ram it down, by which means the cartridge took fire, and blew him into pieces; it is ſuppoſed he did this purpoſely in order to eſcape the puniſhment which he knew muſt be his lot in caſe he was carried into the harbor.</p>
