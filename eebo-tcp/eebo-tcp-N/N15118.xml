            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PHILADELPHIA SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING AGRICULTURE.</head>
            <p>THE very imperfect state of AMERICAN Husbandry in general, compared with that of some countries in Europe, is too well known to be controverted.</p>
            <p>It was a conviction of our great inferiority, in this respect, which gave rise to the present Society, formed after the example of institutions in Europe, whose laudable endeavours to promote the Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture of their several countries, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the happiest effects. And here it may be observed that, the difficulties those societies had originally to overcome, were much greater than what we shall have to contend with: they found Husbandry, generally, in a rude and unprofitable state, and had to recommend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements from single instances of more skilful and fortunate management, until the whole, from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019193_0003_0FAA5F66909C0F58"/>
the force of imitation, gradually became more perfect.—But we, instead of solitary examples of extraordinary and successful conduct amongst our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, may have the established practice of entire nations to hold up, as an encouragement, which we purpose to lay before the public, from time to time.</p>
            <p>The Husbandry of this country, and of England, were fifty years ago both imperfect, and perhaps nearly alike;—here it has ever since remained nearly stationary, there it has been continually advancing:—A short parallel, drawn between them in their present state, will shew how far they are now apart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>American Method:</hi>—Unproductive fallows pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede crops; after crops, the land is generally given up for a number of years to weeds and poor natural grasses, until it shall come into heart again; the husbandman, in the mean while, employing his labours upon his other fields in succession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>English Method,</hi> with variations arising from soils and circumstances:—A field, when broken up, is manured with all the husbandman's force,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019193_0004_0FAA5F6977893D48"/>
and what is called a fallow crop taken off, that is such a crop as requires the frequent use of the plough or the hoe, as in turnips, potatoes, beans, &amp;c. the land is then laid down in some kind of grain and clover, the last continuing sometimes two or three years, which is succeeded by wheat upon a single ploughing.—This course, or rotation of crops, is then renewed in the same order, the land never being idle or resting, as it is called.</p>
            <p>This new practice is allowed to possess many advantages over the old, which is almost entirely renounced in England, but retained in America.</p>
            <p>The manures used in the first instance, are applied to produce the best possible effect;—they go to benefit the whole course, be it for four or five years.—</p>
            <p>The land is made perfectly mellow, and clean before it is laid down to grass, or sowed with grain; it being an established maxim, never to do either, until the earth is well pulverised, and its natural weeds, and those arising from the dung, fully extirpated by repeated plowings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:019193_0005_0FAA5F6A5F9D0C50"/>The land is neither hardened by rest, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted by rank weeds, which impoverish as much as a crop.</p>
            <p>A greater abundance of grass, and other food for cattle, is obtained; more stock maintained, more dung made, and the whole products much greater.</p>
            <p>The labour in such a course or rotation, though it requires considerable accuracy, does not follow so close, is not so hurried, and upon the whole not so great as in the former management.</p>
            <p>And lastly; less land may be employed in culture.—</p>
            <p>In this system, we shall remark that, wheat for instance, is produced on the same field but once during the whole course; but, skilful farmers so distribute their business, as to have one of their fields every year in wheat, and so of the other articles of crop—and of clover, which is supposed to last two years, of consequence two fields.</p>
            <p>As more of art and contrivance, suggested by necessity and long experience, is manifested in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019193_0006_0FAA5F6C1540D778"/>
rural affairs of that country, than in our own,—it should not surprise us that the management of their farm-yards is orderly and systematic; to which are owing such prodigious accumulations of manures, as will enable the farmer in England to prosecute, to much greater extent and effect, his mode of Husbandry, than what can be attempted in America, until his oeconomy in this important article shall, by degrees, be introduced amongst us.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiss to lay down in a few words, the general principles of this management, which will be found as widely different from ours, as is the system of cropping.</p>
            <p>The barn, cattle-houses, sheds, stacks, &amp;c. are so disposed round the farm-yard, as to afford the best winter shelter for live stock.</p>
            <p>No cattle are suffered to run out between No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember and May, but are all shut up and fed in the farm-yard—foddering in the fields occasioning great waste; and dung not lying there in sufficient heaps to produce fermentation, being thought of little account in manuring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:019193_0007_0FAA5F6C89DDA280"/>To the farm-yard is brought, the whole straw of the farm, sometimes leaves, fern, &amp;c.—to be trampled on and converted into manure.</p>
            <p>The yard is often bottomed with a layer of the richest earths that can be found, which is thrown up in the Spring, and mixed with the dung.</p>
            <p>Societies abroad have proceeded by occasional communications of improved methods, and by honorary premiums given for experiments made. It is the design of this Society to tread in their steps; and they hope, they address themselves to a people sufficiently liberal to reject no practice they shall recommend, merely because it is new, or runs counter to former habits and prejudices;— they freely invite communications, upon all subjects comprehended within their extensive plan, and hope from their example to promote lesser institutions, of a similar nature, in different parts of the country amongst neighbours, each one exciting a spirit of improvement within its proper sphere.</p>
            <p>

The Society believing that very important advantages would be derived from the general use of oxen, instead of horses, in husbandry and other services; and being desirous of facilitating their introduction into all these states; persuaded also, that the comparative value of oxen and cows must very much depend on the qualities of their sires and dams; and that by a careful attention to the subject, an improved breed may be obtained: They propose a gold medal for the best essay, founded in experience, on the breeding, feeding and management of cattle, for the purpose of rendering them most profitable for the dairy and for beef, and most docile and useful for the draught; and for the next best a silver medal: to be produced by the first of January 178<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

many instances, in which it appeared, not only that oxen would plough as much ground as an equal number of horses; but also travel as fast with a <hi>loaded</hi> carriage; particularly when, instead of yokes and bows, they were geared in horse-harness, with such variations as were necessary to adapt it to their different shape. To ascertain the powers of oxen in these particulars, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining them, the society deem matters of very great moment; and are therefore induced to offer a gold medal for the best set of experiments undertaken with that view; and for the next best, a silver medal. In relating these experiments, it will be proper to describe the age and size of the oxen, their plight, the kinds and quantities of their food, the occasions, manner and expence of shoeing them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in travelling, the kinds of carriages used and weight of their loads, the seasons of the year, and the length and quality of the roads; and in ploughing, the size and fashion of the plough, the quality of the soil, the depth of the furrows, and the quantities ploughed; and in every operation, the time expended, and number and sorts of hands employed in performing it; with any other circumstances which may more fully elucidate the subject. These experiments
