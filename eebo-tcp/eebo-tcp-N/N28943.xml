            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO celebrate the annual return of those days, which have been distinguished by events important to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the people, is a custom which has prevailed among all civilized nations. In conformity to this long-established, this salutary institution, it becomes Americans to commemorate the auspicious day on which the political ties, that had connected their country with Great-Britain, were dissolved; and on which America "assumed her separate and equal station among the powers of the earth." Amid the vast variety of events recorded in the history of nations, none can be found more deserving of celebration, none that can more justly challenge the gratitude of a people, than the establishment of our country's independence. The day, on which the States of United America rose from the humble condition of British colonies to the rank of an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nation, will be as memorable, as it was extraordinary in the annals of the world. Its memorial will be cherished while freedom shall have votaries—It is stamped in characters never to be obliterated from the records of fame.</p>
            <p>Americans, the celebration of the birth-day of your empire is dictated no less by wisdom than by gratitude. By its observance you make an annual sacrifice at the shrine of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; you make a solemn declaration that you venerate and sacredly adhere to those glorious principles, which conducted your country to independence; and you pledge yourselves never to surrender <hi>that</hi> independence, but with your lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:038585_0004_10129D342379D920"/>Those noble, those sublime principles, which led to the establishment of our national independence, swayed in the bosoms of our famed forefathers. An ardent, an invincible attachment to liberty formed a distinguishing trait in their character. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by the lawless hand of power of those rights, which they claimed from the Sovereign of the universe, they fled from the sword of persecution in their native land to the then uncultivated and inhospitable shores of America. Animated by the noblest motives, which can impel man to action, they encountered with cheerfulness the perils of the ocean; they set at defiance the pains of hunger, nakedness, and disease; they regarded death itself with every species of torture, which the ingenuity of savages could invent, as far less terrible than slavery. After suffering innumerable toils and incredible hardships, those illustrious emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants converted the wilds and mountains of America into the favorite residence of freedom.</p>
            <p>For a long series of years from the time in which our country had arrived at such a degree of importance, as to attract the attention of the British government, she was regarded in no other light than as an instrument of commerce. The laws which were made, and the restrictions which were imposed upon her, were all of a commercial nature; the inconveniences, which resulted from them, were small and were felt without a murmur. Americans bowed to them with the same submissive reverence, as children to the commands of a parent. While Great-Britain exercised her supremacy in regulating the commerce of our country; while she contented herself with a monopoly of our trade, and made no attempt to draw from us a revenue, our situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was prosperous and flourishing; and the commerce, power, and grandeur of Britain rapidly increased. Had this enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commercial policy been pursued, America might long have continued an appendage of the British empire.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the conclusion of a war, the most glorious to the arms of England of any to be found in her his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038585_0005_10129D383A8C9238"/>
a war, in which the formidable powers of France and Spain were humbled and compelled to form an inglorious peace, the scene was changed—a new system was prepared for the government of our country. At this period of prosperity, when Britain had subdued the natural rivals of her grandeur and had reached the highest point of greatness, a deliberate plan was concerted to reduce the inhabitants of America to a state of slavery. As Americans had shared in the toils and dangers of the war against France and Spain; as they had shed their blood for the aggrandisement of England, and had contributed to the success of her arms; they expected to enjoy, in common with the rest of the empire, the blessings of peace and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of victory. But they were not long permitted to indulge this pleasing expectation. The folly and barbarity of Britain soon presented to them the melancholy alternative of slavery or death. From this unfortunate aera the affairs of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came distracted; the spirit of wisdom, offended at her conduct abandoned her councils; and the sun of her glory, declining from its meridian, appeared to hasten to its sitting.</p>
            <p>In an hour of infatuation, a corrupt ministry, in order to relieve Great-Britain from the oppressive weight of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense national debt—to support her towering greatness, which excited the envy and alarmed the fears of Europe—and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply her future extravagance and profusion—conceived the unjust, impolitic, and ruinous scheme of raising a revenue from America. The British parliament asserted the unreasonable, the unfounded claim of imposing taxes on Americans without their consent. The first exercise of this pretended right appeared in the memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able stamp act. This tax was imposed on our countrymen by an assembly of men, in which they were not, and from their local situation could not be represented. The people of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca knew it to be a principle of the English constitution, the priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges and advantages of which they claimed as their birth-right, that the property of no man should be taken from him without his consent, or that of his representatives. Nay more, they knew
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038585_0006_10129D39CF9AF308"/>
it to be a principle founded on the eternal, the immutable laws of nature and of justice. They foresaw that if this claim of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, unlimited in its extent and endless in its duration, were acquiesced in, they would be slaves; they would become pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners on the bounty of the British parliament for all that they possessed. Not content with imposing on Americans this unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable tax, the parliament asserted their supremacy in the most unqualified terms, and declared that they had a right to bind them in all cases whatsoever. These claims at once so unjust, so unconstitutional, and so utterly subversive of liberty, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignantly rejected by three millions of freemen, who were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to sacrifice their lives, rather than to exhibit a tame, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile submission.</p>
            <p>The people of Great-Britain, listening to the persuasive voice of interest, and impressed with a belief, that in proportion as their brethren on this side the Atlantic should be loaded with taxes, they should be eased of their burden, were pleased with the iniquitous scheme of the ministry; and warmly advocated the doctrine of parliamentary omnipotence. Americans stated their rights and the violations of them, and remonstrated in the moderate, but dignified and determined language of freemen. Britons regarded the remonstrances of oppressed freedom, as the dictates of a daring spirit of rebellion. They did not reflect that the principles, which actuated our countrymen, had always been considered as sacred by their ancestors—They did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that they were the same principles, which once inspired the illustrious HAMBDEN and those glorious patrons of freedom, who dared to oppose the arbitrary impositions of the house of Stuart.</p>
            <p>The King, misguided by men, who did not merit his confidence, and indulging a wish, so congenial to the nature of royalty, for arbitrary power, approved the ministerial expedient and the proceedings of parliament. He, who should have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the violated rights of his people, gave his sanction to their subversion. He was deaf to the united voices of reason, justice,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038585_0007_10129D3CD86B7318"/>
and humanity, pleading in behalf of his much injured subjects in America.</p>
            <p>When the inhabitants of our country perceived, that the King had united with an unprincipled ministry to reduce them to slavery, they no longer viewed him as their rightful sovereign; they justly considered themselves as released from their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the crown. Allegiance was the price of protection; when the King, far from protecting, attempted to degrade them to a state of vassalage, their allegiance was at an end.</p>
            <p>Appealing to heaven for the rectitude of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the justice of their cause, the representatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of America, agreeably to the wishes of their constituents, on the <hi>FOURTH DAY OF JULY</hi> 1776, declared the United colonies to be free, sovereign, and independent states.</p>
            <p>Americans, let us contemplate the noble, the glorious spectacle, which our country presented to the world, on the day which we are now assembled to commemorate. Such an ardent love of liberty, such a degree of patriotism and determined bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very no nation ever exhibited.</p>
            <p>At the time when our national existence commenced, the military prowess of Great-Britain was the subject of praise and admiration in every quarter of the globe; she was by far the most formidable power in the world. Queen of the sea, her mighty fleets were triumphantly wafted over every part of the widely expanded ocean; she possessed troops well disciplined, and second to none on earth in bravery; she threatened, to destroy the balance of power, which European sovereigns had long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to maintain, and on the preservation of which their possessions depended. The most powerful Kings felt their thrones insecure and dreaded the exertion of her arms; the nations of Europe trembled at the mention of her name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038585_0008_10129D3EB632ADF8"/>Great-Britain thus formidable was obstinately determined to subdue our country. Already had her hostile fleets filled our ports &amp; her hostile armies had spread desolation on our shores. At this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a people, almost unknown to civilized nations, was seen to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the arbitrary claims, and to bid defiance to the mighty strength of Britain. That an infant nation "with scarcely a weapon to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack," unsupported by any alliance, without government, without funds, who beheld in her troops valor without discipline, should dare to contend with that gigantic power, the thunder of whose arms shook the remotest corners of the earth, could not fail to excite the greatest astonishment. The fortitude and determined spirit of our countrymen were admired, but their cause was regarded as desperate. Buoyed above the terror of death, the attention of Americans was directed solely to the freedom of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. All the jarring, unsocial, selfish passions of the heart gave place to the purest patriotism. They resigned their property with cheerfulness, and determined to sacrifice their lives for the liberty of their native land. They declared that if their houses should be consumed, and their property wrested from them by the hand of tyranny, they could retire to the wilderness and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the luxury of being free; if death should be their fate, in death they should obtain that liberty, which in life they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to possess. The diversified history of the world will be in vain consulted, to find a nation exhibiting such a degree of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otism and possessing such high-toned heroism. Three millions of men, high-minded men, swearing on the altar of freedom to preserve inviolate those rights and privileges, which they inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their fathers, and to transmit them unimpaired to their posterity, or perish in the glorious attempt, is the most august, the most sublime scene, that human imagination can suggest. Thousands, whose bosoms on the birth-day of our empire glowed with the purest flame of patriotism, have fallen martyrs in the cause of liberty and their country—they have sealed their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with their blood—and have been translated to their native skies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:038585_0009_10129D44133F1BD8"/>Americans, it is our pride, our boast to say, these were our fathers. Let us imitate their illustrious example, for by it they have taught us the important lesson of republican virtue. They have taught us that property, nay life itself, should be cheerfully resigned, when the welfare of our country demands it.</p>
            <p>Humanity forbids a recital of the various acts of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty practised by Great-Britain during our revolutionary war. It will be sufficient to observe, that with the aid of her mercenary troops and the savages of the wilderness, she was unable to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our countrymen, whose fortitude and bravery erected eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal monuments to their fame. The laurels, which Britain had acquired in former wars, and which promised to flourish in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual verdure, now withered on her temples. After an ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual struggle of seven years, after wasting the treasures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusely lavishing the blood of the people, she was compelled to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the States of America to be free, sovereign, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</p>
            <p>Our glorious revolutionary war was succeeded by an advantageous peace. At this time we had but the shadow of a national government. Our confederation was merely a system of recommendation. It was formed at a period of distress and danger, when our enemies were in the bosom of our country and our houses were in flames. Its framers built a visionary fabric on the fallacious idea of public virtue. Accustomed in the dark and gloomy moments of the war, to see the people obeying the recommendations of Congress, as if they had been laws, they were led to believe, that Americans had only to be informed of their duty, to do it. But experience has taught us that recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a miserable substitute for law. The States had been unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the war by a sense of common danger; fear had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the place of a coercive power in the confederation. But when peace returned and danger disappeared, a consciousness of security loosened the bands of union, and the advice of Congress lost its wonted influence.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038585_0010_10129D45A5CBB860"/>For a season the friends of our liberty and independence imagined, that they had fondly anticipated halcyon days, scenes of happiness which were never to be realised in our country; much did they fear that we never should enjoy those blessings, which our revolution seemed to promise. The war had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the morals of our citizens. Love of country was no longer the ruling passion; the desire of private gain had supplanted the spirit of public good; and a disposition every where appeared to sacrifice the interest of the community at the shrine of avarice. Our commerce was at its lowest ebb, our money had vanished, lands had depreciated, private confidence, the friend of industry, had ceased to exist, and industry itself had almost disappeared, because it had little hope of reward for its toils. Our credit and respectability as a nation were lost. Debts, which were the price of our independence, and for the payment of which the faith of our country had been repeatedly pledged, remained undischarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and without any suitable provision for their payment. There is no symptom of national disorder and insignificance, no indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of impending ruin, which did not form a part of our public calamities. The confederation had in vain attempted to raise us from our distressed and prostrate situation; it was too feeble to afford relief.</p>
            <p>In the midst of the deepest gloom, when our political horison was darkened by the thickest clouds of public misfortune, the day-star of our happy constitution arose to illuminate and conduct our country to respectability and happiness. To form a perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the common defence, and to secure the blessings of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty were the grand objects, for the attainment of which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of America ordained their national Government. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthy of our illustrious revolution; worthy of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, that august assembly of patriots who formed; and of the people who adopted it. Its framers <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> wisdom from the experience of other ages and of other countries. In theory it is unrivalled, in practice its theory is completely justified.

No sooner did this government commence its operations, than the clouds of adversity were dissipated, like mist, before the glorious luminary of Heaven. Under its auspicious influence America has progressed more in happiness in the course of a few years, than other nations have in centuries. To a person, who contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the flourishing state of our country, she will appear like an ancient nation advanced to perfection by prosperous enterprise, successful industry, and a long course of fortunate events. To our unequalled constitution she is indebted for her safety, her prosperity, and her fame. It is equally the interest and duty of Americans to preserve and perpetuate this pledge of the future happiness and grandeur of their empire.</p>
            <p>It is no less the fate of nations, than of individuals, to have a portion of alloy mingled with their purest happiness— Their brightest sunshine of prosperity will always be attended by its cloud. While on this auspicious anniversary we congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late each other on the flourishing situation of our country, we experience a degree of regret arising from the reflection, that the pleasing prospect may soon be darkened, and our fondest expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions blasted. That our glorious constitution is assailed by very formidable enemies, both foreign and domestic, is a truth of a serious and an alarming nature. Can it be doubted whether any foreign power wishes to see our government destroyed, and us a divided, debased, and degraded nation? Let the history of our country for a few years past be consulted, and it will furnish the most irresistible evidence of the fact. The rising greatness of America is viewed with jealousy and fear by other nations. France, wishing to sit as empress of the world, has been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly jealous, and particularly hostile to our country. She has in various instances attacked our sovereignty, insulted the people in the person of our President, plundered our commerce, impris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and murdered our citizens, rejected our ministers of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and attempted to degrade us from the rank of freemen to the base condition of tributary vassals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:038585_0012_10129D4BB9CBF1B8"/>America has nothing to fear from the arms, but every thing from the arts and influence of foreign nations. Foreign influence is "the destroying angel of republics;" those of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and of modern times have fallen before it. France has boasted much of her diplomatic skill, and her influence has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preceded her arms in those countries, which she has conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In order to establish it, she has overleaped the barriers of creation; barriers, which nature seems to have formed for the security and repose of nations. In vain did the towering Alps oppose to her their frowning precipices, their stupendous rocks, and eternal wilds. Italy felt her influence, and mourned the loss of its liberty and independence. In vain does the vast Atlantic roll its mighty waters between our country and France. We feel the effects of her baneful influence, and unless we are inspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a spirit of wisdom and of vigilance, America will fall a victim to her system of delusion.</p>
            <p>Our country nourishes in her bosom a faction, coexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive with our empire, protected by and devoted to the interest of France, which plots the destruction of our national government, and would rejoice to see it prostrate. It is unquestionably true, that factions ever have and ever will exist under free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There is no danger of their destroying liberty, unless they are aided by a foreign power. But when they are taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of a foreign nation, become obedient to its will, and are wielded as an instrument, by which to destroy the government of a people, they are truly formidable. If we turn our eyes to those countries of Europe, which have been conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by France, we shall find that she had in all of them factions, by which her principles were disseminated, her destructive influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was extended, and with whose cooperation their deluded inhabitants were deprived of their constitutions, their liberties, and independence.</p>
            <p>The faction in our country wears a most threatening aspect; it is the more dangerous, because it veils its hostile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038585_0013_10129D4FCB2E1368"/>
beneath the garb of patriotism. It is composed in part of those persons who were the early enemies of our national gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and warmly opposed its adoption. They are embitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hatred in proportion as it has been fortunate in its operations. Such is their vanity, that they would see their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in chains at the feet of a foreign power, rather than their inauspicious predictions respecting it should be disappointed. But men under the influence of a wicked ambition form the largest part of this faction. They hate the wisest and most salutary measures merely because they have no hand in framing them. Destitute of those talents, by which alone ambition can be gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or destitute of that integrity, which is essential to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of a good ruler, they seek for employments in vain. Sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for offices, which they are destined never to enjoy, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among the people, uttering the most malicious slanders res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the constituted authorities of their country. The profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate are the natural enemies of good government, and of course join the standard of the faction. This party is the organ by which France expresses her sentiments and her wishes, it is the instrument, with which she expects to destroy our government.</p>
            <p>In order to excite the sympathy and to interest the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Americans in behalf of France, the Gallic faction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that liberty has always been the object of that nation, since the commencement of her revolution. But her conduct for years has proved the falsity of their assertion. When she had repelled her enemies, established her independence on the firmest basis, and had adopted such a form of government as she thought proper, she proudly rejected terms of peace, which were highly advantageous. She disclaimed every idea of conquest, yet for a long time conquest has been her object. She denied the right of one nation to interfere in the affairs of another; yet there is scarcely a nation, whose affairs she has not attempted to govern, and in whose councils she has not endeavored to gain an ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy. That neither good faith, nor justice, nor moderation can secure a people against her hostile attempts is proved by her
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038585_0014_10129D515CA9D848"/>
treatment of our country. Every person of reflection, who has attended to the conduct of France for a few years past, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the ambitious projects of Lewis XIVth. have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in that country; or rather, he will perceive the gigantic schemes of that aspiring monarch dwindle to insignificance, when compared with those of his republican successors.</p>
            <p>The French party in our country, as in every other which France has subdued, has endeavored to render our rulers objects of jealousy, and to withdraw from them the confidence of the nation.</p>
            <p>All governments must be maintained by force or by the confidence of the people. Public confidence is the main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which supports the glorious fabric of our American govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; destroy this, and the tottering edifice must fall to the ground, and our liberties must perish beneath its ruins. Sensible of this, France and her partisans in our country, have with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasing efforts struggled to infuse into the people a spirit of illib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral distrust, and to withdraw entirely their confidence from their rulers. They hope in this way to destroy a government, which they cannot subvert by force. It will be remembered, that the silent, unsuspected stream in secret undermines and prostrates on the ground the mighty oak, which the tempest, that shakes the earth and the heavens, would have assailed in vain. They do not make use of force to overthrow our government; but they employ the more dangerous, because the more deceptive, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of jealousy. This spirit must not be indulged, for it des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troys the basis on which elective governments are founded. The slightest degree of reflection will convince us, that the principles, which taught our countrymen to be jealous of an hereditary monarch, an hereditary body of nobles, and a house of commons not appointed, nor controlable by them, ought not to be extended to rulers of their own choice. There is no government, whose very structure affords such liberal grounds of confidence as our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038585_0015_10129D5430472D38"/>
own. In the first magistrate of our union we do not behold a sceptered tyrant with the imperial diadem glittering on his brow, adorned with all the splendid attributes of royalty, taking the government of our country, as his inheritance. He is not protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from disgrace and punishment by the ridiculous supposition that he can do no wrong, and by considering his person as sacred and inviolable. The people are not liable to be oppressed by the knavery or folly of an hereditary body of opulent nobles, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a branch of their legislature; nor by representatives, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for such a length of time, as to forget their duty to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents. Our rulers are all chosen by ourselves as often as is consistent with the welfare of the nation. It will be our own fault, if we do not have men, to fill our public offices, distinguished for their wisdom, integrity, and patriotism. Our chief magistrate, and all our rulers, are liable to impeachment, removal from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and punishment for any crimes of which they may be guilty. Their interest is so blended with that of the people, that they can make no laws to oppress them, which will not equally injure themselves—They are in fact part of the people, and must parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate, in common with the rest of the community, in all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and disadvantages resulting from the laws they make. A government, thus constructed, is entitled to all the confidence, which any human government can merit.</p>
            <p>The conduct of our administration has been dictated by the profoundest wisdom and the most penetrating foresight. While almost every other nation has been involved in the present des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive European war, ours has been preserved from it by an enlightened policy, and has flourished beyond all former example. The partisans of France conspired to slander our administration, and talked much of the folly and ruin of its measures. But the voice of experience, the oracle of truth, has answered and refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:038585_0016_10129D55E8E76B98"/>Americans, in the fates of those unhappy nations, which France has subdued, we read an awful but instructive lesson. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and duty alike require that we should profit by their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Their melancholy history informs us, that their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amities were owing to French influence; whose approach to a country, like the portentous approach of a comet, foretells war, pestilence, and death. If by means of this destructive influence, we are induced to withdraw our confidence from those faithful rulers, whose eulogy is written in the happiness of their country, we shall experience its malignant effects in the destruction of our constitution, our morals, our religion, our liberty &amp; independence.</p>
            <p>This glorious anniversary forcibly recalls to our minds the virtues and atchievements of our fathers; we feel a patriotic pride in their contemplation. Animated by their illustrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let us, in our turn, swear on the altar of freedom, that we will never behold our native country, degraded to a state of sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the arms or the influence of any foreign power; let us prove to the world that the same spirit, which inspired our fathers and impelled them to assert our independence, survives in the bosoms of their sons to defend it. Relying on the assistance of that Almighty Being, who holds the fates of empires in his hands, let us nobly resolve to use every exertion, and to make every sacrifice in favor of our country—let it be the first wish of our hearts, that the liberty, independence, and happiness of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica may be perpetual.</p>
