            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to your Requeſt, I have herewith ſent you an Account of what GOD has done for my Soul ſince I left <hi>England.</hi>— The ſole Motive (if my Heart doth not deceive me) which induced me to leave my native Country was a full Conviction that it was the Divine Will I ſhould. What Reaſons I can urge for this Perſuaſion, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to mention, becauſe few in this Caſe would judge impartially, and what ſeems a Reaſon to me, may not be deemed ſo by another. Let it ſuffice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that after earneſt Prayer for a Year and a half, that if the Deſign was not of GOD, it might come to nought, tho' ſtrongly ſollicited to act in a contrary Manner, I found myſelf as eagerly bent on going abroad as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004631_0003_100DB1BFD0CAFB10"/>Accordingly, <hi>Wedneſday December</hi> 28, 1737, after having continued inſtant in Prayer with my Friends at Mr. <hi>J. H</hi>'s, and afterwards receiving the Holy Sacrament at St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s, being recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Grace of GOD by a great Number of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian Brethren at the Rev. Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s, I ſet out at Night for <hi>Deptford</hi> in a Coach, accompanied by four Friends, and got there at Ten. Here a Widow Woman gladly received us in her Houſe; and many of my Friends gave me the meeting, who came on Foot from <hi>London,</hi> with intent to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the Ship; and with them I took a little bodily Refreſhment; ſpent two or three Hours in particular Interceſſion for our Friends and Enemies, and all Mankind; ſung Pſalms and Hymns and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs, and then betook ourſelves to Reſt, and <hi>the LORD made us to dwell in Safety.</hi> [<hi>Oh who can expreſs the unſpeakable Joy of religious Friends?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Dec.</hi> 29. Roſe early in the Morning, and continued inſtant in Interceſſion, chanting and ſinging of Pſalms with my Friends till Nine, at which our Hearts were much rejoiced. After this we went in queſt of our Ship, but finding ſhe was fallen down to <hi>Purfleet,</hi> and was not to remove to <hi>Graveſend</hi> for ſome Time, we returned to <hi>Deptford</hi> praiſing GOD, and praying for a Bleſſing on our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Voyage. <hi>The LORD perform all our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiion</hi>!</p>

               </gap> returned to <hi>Deptford</hi> with my friends, we dined comfortably together, joined in a Pſalm, read
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004631_0003_100DB1BFD0CAFB10"/>
the Leſſons for the Day, and concluded with Prayer. Some were then obliged to depart for <hi>London.</hi> After they were gone, I continued with the reſt in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interceſſion for near two Hours, and then GOD was pleaſed to comfort my Heart. <hi>If parting from a few earthly Friends for a Seaſon be ſo grievous, How will the Wicked bear to be parted from GOD and good Men for all Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened providentially that a Lecture was to be preached that Evening at <hi>Deptford,</hi> and ſeveral importuned me to preach it. At firſt I was fearful (O me of little Faith) having no Notes: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (having got the Conſent of the Miniſter) I went up, depending on the Promiſe, <hi>Lo I am with you always even unto the End of the World</hi>; and was enabled to preach to a large Congregation without the leaſt Heſitation. <hi>Did any one yet ever truſt in the LORD and was forſaken?</hi> What gave me a great Comfort, and made me more thankful, was, that the Opportunity, I believe, was granted, in anſwer to Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, Dec.</hi> 30. Went with our Baggage and nine or ten Friends in a <hi>Graveſend</hi> Boat to <hi>Purfleet,</hi> where the <hi>Whitaker</hi> was fallen down. Spent the Time we were on the Water in ſinging Pſalms and particular Interceſſion; and came on board about Ten in the Morning.</p>
            <p>I ſpoke ſome few Things to my new Charge, ſpent the Remainder of the Day on Shore with my Friends, in ſinging Pſalms, Prayer, and exhorting
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004631_0004_100DB1C16ECB2428"/>
one another to Love and good Works: Returned at Night to our Ship, and lay with my Friend <hi>H.</hi> upon the Ground in a Matreſs, in the great Cabbin: And GOD was pleaſed to give me a Proof that he was with me in the Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Dec.</hi> 31. Began this Morning to have publick Prayers on open Deck, at which the Officer and Soldiers attended with Decency and Reverence. After Prayer I enlarged a little on thoſe Words of St. <hi>Paul, I am determined to know nothing among you ſave JESUS CHRIST and him crucified,</hi> told them how my future Conduct would be; made ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of my hearty Love and ſincere Affection for their Souls; and then diſmiſſed them, I believe ſomewhat moved. <hi>Oh, that I may have Grace to act ſuitably to this Profeſſion!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To-day alſo I began to viſit the Sick, and took that Opportunity of diſcourſing on the Uncertainty of Life, and the Certainty of a future Judgment, to thoſe around me; and GOD was pleaſed not to let my Words fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>About Twelve, I went and paid my Friends a Viſit, who were on Shore, and ſpent two or three delightful Hours in praiſing and bleſſing GOD.</p>
            <p>Soon came another Friend with two honeſt Men from <hi>Graveſend,</hi> deſiring me in the Name of the Miniſter to come and preach to them the following Lord's Day: At firſt I was unwilling to leave my own Flock in the Ship, but my Friends Reaſonings overbalanced mine, and I went on board, read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004631_0004_100DB1C16ECB2428"/>
Prayers, viſited the Sick, gave the Soldiers an Exhortation, (at which the Solders were ſurpriſingly affected); and then took Boat with them for <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</hi> My Heart was much enlarged in Interceſſion. The Evening was exceeding calm, the Sky clear, and all Things conſpired to praiſe that glorious and lofty One that inhabits Eternity, who <hi>ſtretcheth forth the Heavens like a Curtain, and holdeth the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Seven at Night, GOD brought us ſafe to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where Mr. <hi>H.</hi> received both me and my Friends moſt courteouſly, and loaded us with many Benefits: <hi>The good LORD have Mercy on him in that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſpent the Evening very agreeably in Prayer, and Singing, and then betook ourſelves to Sleep, having before exhorted one another to prepare our Spices and Ointments of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and to reſt on the approaching Sabbath according to the Commandment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, January</hi> 1. Bleſſed be GOD for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Beginning of a new Year! for it has been a Day of fat Things: We roſe in the Morning, and retired to an adjacent. Hill with my Friends to Prayer; and afterwards were moſt agreeably ſurpriſed with the Coming of ſeveral more <hi>London</hi> Friends (whom I love as my own Soul), who came all Night on the Water to ſee me.</p>
            <p>About Ten we went to Church, where I preach'd; and the Curate was ſo kind, at our Requeſt, as to give us the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004631_0005_100DB1C4AB9107C8"/>In the Afternoon I preached again to a more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Congregation than in the Morning: And being to ſtay there but one Lord's Day, I was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preach and read Prayers a third Time, at Six in the Evening. It was a Thing I found entirely new; but upon the Curate's readily complying to lend the Pulpit, and my Friends and the People's Importunity, I looked upon it as a Call of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and accordingly read Prayers and preached to a very thronged Auditory; and this I did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Notes, having brought but two written Sermons with me. <hi>Oh! who can expreſs the loving Kindneſs of the LORD, or ſhew forth all his Praiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 2. 1737. 8. Sat up 'till Twelve at Night, to take leave of ſome of my Friends, whoſe Buſineſs obliged them to be at <hi>London</hi> the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then, after three or four Hours Reſt, roſe and walked to <hi>Greenhith</hi> with the Remainder of my Friends, intending to take a Boat there, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Charge at <hi>Purfleet.</hi> But juſt as we were entring the Boat, providentially came a Boy, telling us, the <hi>Whitaker</hi> was falling down to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ready to ſail, if not actually under Sail; we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately haſted back from whence we came, and went on our Way rejoicing.</p>
            <p>About Eleven we reached <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and happily found the Ship was not to ſail till the morrow. This put Gladneſs into my Heart, as it gave me an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſettling ſome Affairs of Conſequence, and converſing a little longer with my dear Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004631_0005_100DB1C4AB9107C8"/>About Twelve o'Clock I went on board, leaving my Friends to dine on Shore: And as I went along, GOD was pleaſed to ſhew me he had given a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to my Diſcourſes; the People ſeemed greatly alarmed, and wiſhed me heartily a good Voyage, and the very Sailors were ſurpriſingly affectionate. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD for ſetting his Seal to my unworthy Miniſtry!</hi> Spent the Remainder of the Day in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Things on board, viſiting the Sick, teaching the Children, and reading Prayers, and Preaching. <hi>All Love, all Glory be to GOD through CHRIST!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening I went on Shore again to my Friends, pray'd, ſung Pſalms, and expounded (I think) a Chapter out of the holy Scriptures to them, and was not a little comforted. <hi>Praiſe the LORD, O my Soul!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 3. Went on board, read Prayers and Preached, viſited the Sick, and then took a final Leave, as I thought, of my Friends. Spent the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon in writing Letters, and putting Things in Order. And (what I eſteemed a great Bleſſing) tho' I had been uſed to ſo large a Sphere of Action, yet my Change of Life gave me not the leaſt Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but my Heart was refreſhed with Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of Glory.</p>
            <p>This Evening began to read Prayers between Decks, judging it would be too cold above.</p>
            <p>At Night I went, according to Cuſtom, on Shore to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where I was agreeably ſurpriſed by ſeeing my Friends. I took leave of them in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004631_0006_100DB1C6C55D7190"/>
Morning once more, the Weather preventing their going to <hi>London.</hi> Here alſo Mr. <hi>C. W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W. H.</hi> gave me the meeting, with whom we pray'd, ſung Pſalms, commended one another to GOD, and parted the next Morning like Chriſtian Brethren.</p>
            <p> 
               <hi>Wedneſday, Jan.</hi> 4. Came on board at Ten in the Morning; but could not have publick Prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soldiers were engaged with their Officer: But I viſited the Sick, and perceived the Soldiers were attentive to hear me, when I applied myſelf to thoſe around the ſick Perſons. I alſo diſtributed amongſt the Sick of my <hi>London</hi> Friends kind Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, to convince them I had a Love for, and to gain an Acceſs to their Souls. I viſited the Sick, read Prayers, and preached <hi>extempore</hi> (as I conſtantly do Morning and Evening) and went with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in the Evening on Shore to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded for Friends, expounded a Chapter, and went to Bed, with <hi>that Peace of Mind which paſſeth all Underſtanding. Oh that the ſenſual, careleſs, half Chriſtian could but know the Comforts of Religion!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

This Day GOD was with me of a Truth: I was refreſhed in Spirit, by hearing from ſome <hi>London</hi> Friends, and receiving ſome kind Preſents from Perſons I could never have thought of; was aſſiſted much in writing Letters; came on board, read Prayers, and preached; viſited the Sick, and had GOD with me all Day long: Begun to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe ſix or ſeven of the young Soldiers on open Deck. I was ſurpriſed they would ſubmit to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004631_0006_100DB1C6C55D7190"/>
but GOD has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands.</p>
            <p>Great Civility was ſhewn me on board by the Officers; and Capt. <hi>W.</hi> ſent his Boat to fetch me to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> whither I went; having viſited the Sick, read Prayers, and preached on Deck.</p>
            <p>When on Shore, I wrote ſeveral Letters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a Chapter to a Room full of People. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſed the Children of the Houſe, and three of my own Companions, and then went to Bed, full of <hi>Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Health of Body, I could perceive, increaſed, and my Soul was much refreſhed. I now began once more to feel the Comforts of a retired Life, and bleſſed GOD from my Heart, that he had called me whither I was going.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, Jan.</hi> 6. About Nine I came on board, read Prayers, and preached between Decks; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſung a Pſalm, as he generally does. In the mean while, the Ship looſed from <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſailed by Twelve o'Clock to the <hi>Nore.</hi> We had a very briſk Gale of Wind.</p>
            <p>GOD gave me great Comfort, and I went between Decks, and ſate down on the Ground, and read <hi>Arndt</hi>'s <hi>True Chriſtianity</hi>: And part of the Time I ſtood upon Deck, and admired the Wonders of GOD in the Deep.</p>
            <p>Three or four were added to-day to my Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens, ſome of whom I had great Hopes of Read Prayers, preached upon Deck near the Stern, (having no Place for Retirement;) talked to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004631_0007_100DB1C89FD811B0"/>
Sailors on the Fore-Caſtle; wrote my Journal; and climb'd up into my Cabbin to Bed, where my Friend <hi>H.</hi> and I ſay as comfortably as on a Bed of State.</p>
            <p>Some of the Paſſengers, amongſt whom was Mr. <hi>H.</hi> began now to be ſick: But I felt very little of it; on the contrary GOD enabled me to rejoice with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Joy; my Heart was warmed by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sailors, and I was ſo lifted even above myſelf, that I could have <hi>watched unto Prayer</hi> and Praiſe all Night.</p>
            <p>I found that above an Hundred, excluſive of the Ship's Company, were on board; <hi>GOD grant that not one of them may periſh through my Neglect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Jan.</hi> 7. Breakfaſted with ſome of the Gentlemen in the Great Cabbin, who were very civil, and let me put in a Word for GOD.</p>
            <p>Read publick Prayers, and began to expound the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer</hi> to the Soldiers, by way of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and GOD enabled me to do it with Power. After that I inſtructed my Catechumens, who now amounted to twelve or thirteen. <hi>GOD made them Soldiers of</hi> CHRIST <hi>as well as of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had an Hour's Converſation with a Gentleman on board, on our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Neceſſity of our New Birth in CHRIST JESUS, and hope it was not unpleaſant to him.</p>
            <p>To-day obtained what I prayed for, <hi>viz.</hi> a Place to retire into: For Captain <hi>W.</hi> on my bare menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning my Want of ſuch a thing, offered me the free Uſe of his own Cabbin, a Place very commodious for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004631_0007_100DB1C89FD811B0"/>Catechiſed thoſe who went with me on open Deck, for Example to others, and found they improved. Captain <hi>W.</hi> the two Cadets, and Serieants, ſat very ſerious and attentive. But when the Captain of the Soldiers came, my Heart ſunk a little (tho' without any Reaſon;) however I did not leave off. <hi>O Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thou art my Siſter!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Read publick Prayers, and finiſhed my Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> to the Soldiers, at which they attended very orderly. At Night I and my five Companions went upon Deck, and interceded and ſung Pſalms, by which my Heart was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. The Weather was very cold, and the Wind magnified that GOD, <hi>at whoſe Word the ſtormy Wind ariſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I fulfilled my Promiſe to the LORD'S Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and while the Winds and Storms were blowing over me, I made earneſt Supplications to GOD for them.</p>
            <p>The Ship continued at the <hi>Nore</hi> all this Day; but I hope we made ſome Advances towards Eternity.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Wind blew very freſh indeed; and had our Ship been in the <hi>Downs,</hi> we ſhould have been in great Danger. <hi>How wiſely doth GOD provide for us!</hi> Moſt People began now to be Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, particularly <hi>J.D.</hi> one of my Companions was grievouſly afflicted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, Jan.</hi> 8. My Friend <hi>H.</hi> and I have great Reaſon to be thankful to GOD; for we ſlept as well as we could deſire, though the Wind blew very hard,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004631_0008_100DB1CAB4D62B38"/>
 and the Sailors were very buſy in taking care of the Ship, which by the Morning had dragged her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor two Miles.</p>
            <p>Went early and viſited the Sea-ſick Soldiers and their Families between Decks, gave them ſome Sage-Tea and Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and excited them all to Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Repentance, out of Gratitude for their Preſervation from the laſt Night's Storm; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned publick Thanks at Morning Prayers.</p>
            <p>Thought much of my dear <hi>London</hi> Friends; tho' abſent in Body, was preſent in Spirit in ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; and interceded for them and all Mankind moſt ſervently. Read publick Prayers and preached twice to the Soldiers: and read Prayers once in the Great Cabbin to the Officers, at their Requeſt, which I liked very well: Catechiſed my own Companions, but had not Time to catechiſe the Soldiers, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of attending the Sick.</p>
            <p>To-day being the firſt LORD's Day I have ſpent this long time in ſo private a manner, I could not avoid reflecting on the following Lines:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>I ſigh whene'er my muſing Thoughts</l>
               <l>Thoſe happy Days preſent,</l>
               <l>When I with Troops of pious Friends</l>
               <l>Thy Temple did frequent;</l>
               <l>When I advanc'd with Songs of Praiſe,</l>
               <l>My ſolemn Vows to pay,</l>
               <l>And led the joyful ſacred Throng</l>
               <l>That kept the Feſtal Day.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004631_0008_100DB1CAB4D62B38"/>
But I conſidered it was the Divine Will that placed me here, and therefore I rejoiced. <hi>He is unworthy the Name of a Chriſtian, who is not as willing to hide himſelf when GOD commands, as to act in a publick Capacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Began now to live a little by Rule, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the Interiors of thoſe that came with me; which I found a moſt uſeful Exerciſe both for them and me. Continued all this Day at the <hi>Nore,</hi> being quite becalmed; and at Night had a moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interceſſion for all Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 9. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> began to learn <hi>Latin.</hi> Had near twenty Catechumens with my own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who I believe made ſome Advances.</p>
            <p>Weighed from the <hi>Nore,</hi> and ſailed before the Wind in Company with ſeveral others, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us on ſo briſkly, that we anchor'd before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> about One. Here I enjoyed a wiſhed for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of writing to ſome of my <hi>London</hi> Friends, and found my Heart greatly enlarged towards them.</p>
            <p>After Dinner having ſome Neceſſaries to buy, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and I went on Shore to <hi>Margate.</hi> The Wind blew very freſh, and <hi>the Sea raged horribly, but He that dwelleth on high was mightier,</hi> and kept us from the leaſt Fright, and filled me with great Joy, and brought us ſafe on Shore. We had the moſt abandoned Man with us I ever ſaw, who came out of an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ship: He had ſo much of the Devil in him, that the very Boat Men, profane as they were, abhorr'd him. From whence I infer, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004631_0009_100DB1CD27097050"/>
was the Devil himſelf to appear as he is, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sinners could not but deteſt him.</p>
            <p>This Afternoon I began to feel the Power of Faith more than ever I did before, and to find that as the Day, ſo will our Strength be. When I went into the Boat the Sea run dangerouſly high; but I could boldly ſay:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>GOD is our Refuge in Diſtreſs,</l>
               <l>A preſent Help when Dangers preſs;</l>
               <l>In Him undaunted we'll confide,</l>
               <l>Tho' Earth were from her Center toſs'd,</l>
               <l>And Mountains in the Ocean loſt,</l>
               <l>Torn piecemeal by the roaring Tide.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>About Five we got ſafe to <hi>Margate,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a little bodily Refreſhment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended our ſelves to GOD in Prayer, we went about the Town to buy the Things we came for. The Generality of the People we met with were civilized and teachable.</p>
            <p>After we had done our ſecular Buſineſs, we paid the Curate a Viſit, the Miniſter being at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> He received us moſt courteouſly: Our Converſation was ſuch as tended to the Uſe of Edifying; it ran chiefly upon the great Importance of the Miniſterial Function; the Neceſſity of Preaching up the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the New Birth; and the Neceſſity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Viſiting from Houſe to Houſe.</p>
            <p>About Ten we left him, greatly refreſhed in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and thankful to GOD for exciting Perſons every where to entertain us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004631_0009_100DB1CD27097050"/>On the Morrow I ſent him Mr. <hi>Law's Serious Call</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Perfection,</hi> with ſome other Books; and alſo a few Catechiſms and Sermons to ſome other ſerious People, whom Providence put in our Way. Now <hi>Thanks be to GOD,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>which always cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the Savour of his Knowledge to us in every Place!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 10. About Four this Morning, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and I aroſe, intending to go on board immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; but the Wind blew ſo very violent, that by the Advice of the Boat-Men we deferred going on board 'till Daylight; and therefore after we had kneeled on the Shore, and prayed for ourſelves and others, we went back to the Inn; and took that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of writing to a Friend, or two.</p>
            <p>About Seven we took Boat and praiſed and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed GOD to ſee the Floods clap their Hands. About Eight we came on board, and found we had great Reaſon to be thankful that we were on Shore laſt Night: The Sailors told us that the Lightning ſhone on the Sea all Night; and that the Storm was very great, and the Ship's Long-Boat was loſt.</p>
            <p>I read publick Prayers, returned publick Thanks for our Deliverance, and expounded by Way of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Second Article of the <hi>Creed,</hi> which I began Yeſterday. Did the ſame after Evening Prayers. Spent the Remainder of the Day in writing Letters; and have not enjoy'd a more calm delightful Frame of Mind a long Time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:004631_0010_100DB1CEE05D8D90"/> The Sick encreaſed on my Hands, but were very thankful for furniſhing them with Sage-Tea, Sugar, Broth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the Sight of ſo many Objects of Pity, I was ſenſibly touched with a fellow feeling of their Miſeries. I could not but tranſverſe the <hi>Prodigal's</hi> Complaint, <hi>How many of my Father's Children are ready to periſh with Hunger, whilſt I have enough and to ſpare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had a moſt comfortable Senſe of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with me in many Particulars: And in the Evening, joined in Interceſſion with my other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions on Deck, in Behalf of abſent Friends and all Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, Jan.</hi> 11. Weighed from <hi>Margate</hi> Road, and caſt Anchor in the <hi>Downs,</hi> the Ship ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt pleaſantly before the Wind. Wrote ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters whilſt the Ship was under Sail. Had my Spirits mightily refreſhed upon our Arrival in the <hi>Downs,</hi> by hearing from two or three Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at <hi>London;</hi> and was deſirous to bleſs GOD for a providential Opportunity that was offered of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a whole Packet to them and ſome other Friends, to acquaint them how lovingly the LORD had dealt with me. <hi>O that the Mercies beſtowed on me, may through the Thankſgiving of many redound to the Glory of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had no publick Prayers this Morning, being much hurried in writing Letters to go by Poſt; and when I went to read, the Soldiers were engaged in their military Affairs upon Deck, ſo that I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004631_0010_100DB1CEE05D8D90"/>
thing but viſit the Sick. I fear I did fooliſhly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Father, forgive me for thy dear Son's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Went on in explaining the Creed after Evening Prayers, and was enabled to talk of the Crucifixion of our LORD: I believe it pricked them to the Heart. <hi>O that I could hear them cry out, What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the Comfort to hear good was done among the Soldiers; and the Captain was pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Approbation of my Conduct. <hi>GOD grant I may with a ſingle Eye ſeek to pleaſe the Captain of my Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Evening Prayers and viſiting the Sick, went aſhore with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to <hi>Deal</hi>; and was ſo highly delighted with a Proſpect of the <hi>Downs,</hi> that we expreſſed our Thankfulneſs in ſinging of Pſalms all the Way. The Boat-Men I believe wondered at it at firſt; but they were not aſhamed to <hi>blaſpheme,</hi> and I thought had no Reaſon to be aſhamed to <hi>praiſe</hi> GOD. I had the Satisfaction before we got to <hi>Deal,</hi> to hear one of them join ſeriouſly with us; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſurpriſing Alteration in their Behaviour always after, <hi>Bleſſed be GOD</hi>!</p>
            <p>About Five we got to <hi>Deal,</hi> and not knowing a ſingle Perſon, went (as at <hi>Margate</hi>) to pay my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the two Miniſters of the Place: But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither of them at Home, ſpent the Remainder of the Evening with my Friend <hi>H.</hi> very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in religious Talk, Family Prayer, interceding for abſent Friends and all Mankind, and writing to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004631_0011_100DB1D0F2098A30"/>
Chriſtian Brethren. And even here GOD did not leave my Miniſtry without a Witneſs; for he was pleaſed to impreſs ſomething I ſaid on a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Heart, that providentially came in, and joined with us in Family Prayer: for which we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to thank him. <hi>Behold how great a Fire this little Spark kindled before we left</hi> Deal!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Jan.</hi> 12. Spent moſt of the Morning in writing Letters: Went about Eleven on board<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was highly delighted with the Proſpect on the <hi>Downs,</hi> which was exceeding calm; and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beautiful Ships which were riding here added to the Proſpect. <hi>O that Men who occupy their Buſineſs in the great Waters, would (ſince they cannot but ſee) admire GOD's Wonders in the Deep!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Read Prayers and went on explaining the <hi>Creed</hi> to the Soldiers; viſited and prayed with the Sick; and began this Afternoon to explain the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> to the Women by themſelves: I find they are in Number about ſixteen; and bleſſed be GOD were much affected. <hi>Proſper thou, O LORD, this Work of my Hands upon me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had ſome religious Talk with the Surgeon of the Soldiers, who ſeems very well diſpoſed. I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (it ever) ſee him idle, and find he has many good Qualities. <hi>GOD grant Chriſtianity may be grafted in him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Evening Prayers and explaining the <hi>Creed,</hi> went again to <hi>Deal</hi> with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to buy ſome Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for our Companions. Spent the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004631_0011_100DB1D0F2098A30"/>
of the Evening in writing Letters, and reading and praying with eight or nine poor People, who came I ſuppoſe at the Report of the other poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to hear me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, Jan.</hi> 13. Remained all Day on Shore, the Weather being too rough to go on board: Was in Care about leaving my Flock ſo long; but hope this ſhort Abſence will make our Meeting more agreeable To-morrow. Had the Pleaſure of joining in publick Workſhip at <hi>Deal,</hi> in a pretty Chapel; which was more agreeable on account of our being confined for ſome Time within the narrow Limits of a Ship.</p>
            <p>Set apart this Day as a Day of Humiliation, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, and Interceſſion for Friends and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and found my Heart greatly enlarged in that divine Exerciſe. <hi>Interceſſion is a glorious Means to ſweeten the Heart!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spent the Remainder of the Day, and ſat up till One in the Morning in writing to Friends.</p>
            <p>Had two or three added to my Company at Night, who ſeemed very attentive, and prayed for me moſt heartily. <hi>The Poor receive the Goſpel.</hi> I diſperſed ſome Books among them, as I ſaw proper: <hi>I hope GOD will give them his Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Expected Letters to night from <hi>London,</hi> but was diſappointed: <hi>GOD enable me in every thing to give Thanks!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fancied myſelf all this Day in my little Cell at <hi>Oxford</hi>: For I have not ſpent ſo many Hours in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004631_0012_100DB1D359A87758"/>
ſweet Retirement ſince I left the Univerſity. The Pleaſure I felt was inexpreſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Jan.</hi> 14. Spent the Morning in writing Letters, and was much pleaſed with the pious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of a poor Woman, who was one of my Auditors laſt Night, and who I believe, has paſſed through the Pangs of the New Birth.</p>
            <p>Haſted on board about Eleven, (the Wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing fair) to take us out of the Channel, and was affectionately received by the People.</p>
            <p>I was greatly delighted to ſee all the Ships ſail together from the <hi>Downs.</hi> Nature, indeed, would have been glad to have ſtaid till the Morrow, that I might have received Letters from my <hi>London</hi> Friends, but God, I conſidered, ordereth all Things for the Good of thoſe that love him, and therefore gave Thanks from my Heart. Examined into the State of my little Ones, (my Friend <hi>H</hi>'s Charge) and had Reaſon to hope well of them.</p>
            <p>Was enlarged in preaching after Prayers to the Soldiers, and ſpent two moſt pleaſant Hours in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD's holy Word. At Night, though it was piercingly cold, we continued inſtant in Interceſſion on Deck; and the Proſpect of a clear Sky, the Stars glittering, and the Moon ſhining bright warmed my Heart, and made me <hi>greatly rejoice in Spirit.</hi> I now began to be more reconciled to a Ship Life; for GOD gave me Health of Body, and without which all is nothing, Content ot Mind. Had near an Hour's Converſation with one who, I hope, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004631_0012_100DB1D359A87758"/>
come an altogether Chriſtian. <hi>Oh that that bleſſed Time would come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, Jan.</hi> 15. GOD gave me and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſweet Sleep. Had near two Hours Retirement in the Captain's round Houſe, and was much delighted with ſinging Pſalms on Deck with my Companions. Read publick Prayers in the Cabbin this Morning, and was much enlarged in preaching to the Soldiers on this Article, <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> In treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, I took Occaſion to ſhew the Nature and Neceſſity of the New Birth; a Subject on which I delight to dwell.</p>
            <p>Catechiſed the Soldiers, and, bleſſed be GOD, find ſome of them improved. Was enlarged again in my Evening Sermon to the Soldiers, and had Prayers a ſecond Time in the great Cabbin, which gave me no ſmall Satisfaction; the Officers, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> willingly comply'd as ſoon as I impoſed it; <hi>GOD be praised!</hi>

            <p>Had great Delight in reading the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, enjoyed an unſpeakable Peace of Mind, and was much comforted in interceding for Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on Deck. The Weather was cold, and the Wind blew very hard; but when the Heart is full of GOD, outward Things affect it little. <hi>Surely my Friends in</hi> England <hi>pray for me; methinks I feel they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Day the Sea was entirely becalmed; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing about us ſeem huſh'd quiet, as though it would remind us of that ſacred Reſt the Day was ſet apart to commemorate. In the Evening the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004631_0013_100DB1D6F1010B40"/>
Wind blew very freſh but being full againſt us, we were obliged to ſail back to the <hi>Downs</hi> (though we had got near fifty Miles) where we arrived about Twelve a Clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 16. After private Prayer, was moſt agreeably entertained with ſome Letters from my <hi>London</hi> Friends, which filled my Soul with unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pleaſure, and cauſed me to ſhed Tears of Joy. <hi>If the Correſpondence of good People is ſo tranſporting here, O! how unſpeakably reviſhing muſt the Perſonal Communion of Saints be hereafter. Haſten, O LORD, that bleſſed Time and let thy Kingdom come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was a little affected by ſeeing a poor Soldier tied Neck and Heels, for ſeveral mutinous Words he had ſpoken. The Captain related the Caſe to me, and ſaid, if I could make him ſenſible of his Crime, I might beg him off. I endeavoured to do it, but, alas, in vain; he continued obſtinate, and thereby hindred my Deſign taking Effect. After this, the Captain order'd him to be tied down between Decks; from whence I took Occaſion, in my Morning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to exhort the Soldiers to obey them That <hi>had the Rule over them,</hi> and to avoid thoſe Sins, that would provoke GOD to command them to be <hi>tied Hand and Foot, and to be caſt into outer Darkneſs, where would be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Twelve, a <hi>Deal</hi> Boat coming along Side, I was minded to go on Shore to anſwer my Letters. The Sea was very boiſterous, but God brought us to Shore rejoicing. <hi>O wherefore did I in the leaſt fear? What am I, when left to myself.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004631_0013_100DB1D6F1010B40"/>It being the 16th Day of the Month, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and I joined in an Hour's Interceſſion and Abſtinence, with all thoſe that meet together to bewail thier own and the Sins of the Nation. About Four, took ſome bodily Refreſhment; and from thence till One in the Morning, continued anſwering my Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, having firſt ſpread their Letters before the LORD in Prayer, and begg'd that I might ſend them Anſwers of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tuesday, Jan.</hi> 17. Was awaken'd with an Alarm, that the Ship was ready to ſail, but found it soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted. Spent an Hour in particular Interceſſion, and the rest of the Morning in writing Letters, and teaching Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Latin. <hi>Oh that I may be made an Inſtrument of breeding him up for GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Came on board about Two in the Afternoon, and found all Things quiet in the Ship, was moſt kindly recieved; and I obſerved the Women were very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive when I proceeded to explain the Catechiſm to them. <hi>May GOD open their Hearts as he did that of</hi> Lydia, <hi>that theſe may give diligent Heed to the Things that are ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was much enlarged in my Evening Diſcourſe, and hope the Word entered into their Hearts. Was kindly invited by the Poſt Maſter of <hi>Deal,</hi> to lye at his Houſe. Gained an Opportunity, by walking at Night on Deck, after Interceſſion, to talk cloſely to the chief Mate, and one of the Serjeants of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and hope my Words were not altogether ſpoken in vain. <hi>O that all Men would come to the

Knowledge of the Truth, and be ſaved!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wednesday, Jan.</hi> 18. Spent all the Morning in Retirement, reading the Scriptures, publick Prayer and preaching; the Weather being extremely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
            <p>Began to live by Rule more than ever; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I find is to be done without it. All that had been ſick being recovered, came to Prayers, for whom I gave Thanks; particularly to them: At the End of my Sermon exhorting them with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Earneſtneſs, to <hi>Sin no more leaſt a worſe Evil ſhould befal them,</hi> and to ſhew forth their Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not only with their Lips, but in their Lives <hi>O that there may be always in them ſuch a Mind!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finiſhed my Exposition on the <hi>Creed.</hi> Read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, and preached as uſual in the Afternoon Catechiſed both my own Companions and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and was pleaſed to ſee many others very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to hear</p>
            <p>Had great Comfort in reading the Scriptures Was afterwards a little inclined to Heavineſs, but drove it off by a long Interceſſion. <hi>Prayer is an Antidote againſt every Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Examination, had Reaſon to hope my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions grew in Grace; <hi>bleſſed be GOD for it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Eleven at Night went and ſat down among the Sailors in the Steerage, and reaſoned with them <hi>about Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and a Judgement to come</hi>; at which ſome of them almoſt <hi>trembled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Jan.</hi> 19. Was much comforted by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004631_0014_100DB1D97A658A08"/>
from my Friends. Began, after Prayers this Morning, to explain the Catechiſm to the Soldiers, and draw proper Inferences by way of Sermon: I find it is much approved of, and, for them, by far the fitteſt Way of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Spent the Afternoon in anſwering Correſpondents; was much aſſiſted in my Evening Expoſition on the Catechiſm; and had great Hopes of two Soldiers becoming Chriſtians indeed. <hi>Would to GOD, all the King's Soldiers were ſuch!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was enabled to compoſe a great Part of a new Sermon this Evening. Enlarged in Interceſſion, and Afterwards much rejoiced by three more Letters, and ſat up till One in the Morning to anſwer them. <hi>Whatſover thou findeſt in thy Hand to do,</hi> ſaith the wiſe Man, <hi>do it with all thy Might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had now ſuch a calm and ſmooth Sea, that all the People every where expreſſed their Admiration of it. <hi>GOD grant that we may in a Calm provide for a Storm, and, like the primitive Chriſtians, when the Churches had Reſt, walk in the Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, and be edified!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, Jan.</hi> 20. Roſe with great Peace of Mind,
ſpent all the Morning in compoſing a Sermon.</p>
            <p>Happily compoſed a Difference between a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and his Wife, who were one of the four Couple I married when firſt I came on board: The Man had reſolved to leave her, but upon my reminding him of his Marriage Vow, and entreating him with Love, he immediately took to her again. <hi>What
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004631_0015_100DB1DB9162F938"/>
may not a Miniſter do through Chriſt, when his Flock love him?</hi> Almoſt finiſhed the Sermon I began Yeſterday, <hi>bleſſed of GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Went on in expounding the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> after Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer; and now began to read the firſt Leſſon, which I purpoſely omitted before, not knowing they would bear it, and willing to imitate <hi>Jacob, who was careful of his little Ones not to over drive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Propoſed to the Captain to read a few Prayers in the Great Cabbin every Night, which he really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, and withal ſaid, he ſhould be glad to hear me preach, whenever I ſhould think proper.</p>
            <p>Was ſurpriſed in the midſt of my Evening's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by the chief Mate, who came and told me, that the Miniſter of <hi>Upper Deal</hi> had ſent a Boat for me, deſiring me immediately to come on Shore. Accordingly, after I had concluded, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and I went and found the Miniſter, which was left to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate, who deſired me, at the Requeſt of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, to preach the <hi>Sunday</hi> following. After this, we retired to our Lodging in <hi>Deal</hi>; and after a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and long Interceſſion, was unſpeakably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the Reception of ſeveral Letters from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, I believe ſincerely fear GOD. At which my Heart was ſo full, that I could not but kneel down, pray, and return Thanks to GOD for them.</p>
            <p>Found the Number of my Hearers greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to-night, and very joyful to ſee me once more on Shore. I ſate up till One in the Morning, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering my Correſpondents, and then laid down,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004631_0015_100DB1DB9162F938"/>
filled with ſuch <hi>Joy as no Man could take from me, nor a Stranger intermeddle with. Oh that all Men knew the Comforts of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Jan.</hi> 21. Spent all the Day in writing Letters, and delightful Converſation with Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Night, the Number of my Hearers was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that the Stairs were full, as well as my Room. I expounded to them the 25th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> at which they were much affected, and ſeemed to love and pray for me moſt earneſtly: <hi>And I deſire to have no greater Portion than the Prayers of the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sate up till One, writing Letters; gave Thanks for the Bleſſing of the Week, and then lay down in Peace, hoping to riſe early the next Morning, more fit for my Maſter's Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, Jan.</hi> 22. About Nine went on board with Capt. <hi>W.</hi> who is always extremely civil. Viſited the Sick, and read Prayers in the Great Cabbin. Read Prayers, and preached my Sermon on <hi>Early Piety,</hi> on open Deck to the Soldiers; the Officers, and other Gentlemen, attending very ſeriouſly. The Weather was very cold, <hi>but Preaching warmed my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Noon went on Shore with Capt. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Dined at the Poſt-Maſter's, who received us hoſpitably. Afternoon preached at <hi>Upper Deal,</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> xxviii. 26. Many ſeemed pricked to the Heart, and ſome ſo quickened, that they expreſſed a Deſire to follow me wherever I ſhould go. <hi>O free Grace in JESUS CHRIST!</hi> I have ſcarce known a

Time I have preached any where, but I have ſeen ſome Effect of my Doctrine. <hi>From the Hearts of the Mighty the Word of the LORD hath not turned back, the Sword of the Spirit returned not empty.</hi> A Proof this, I hope, that the Words are not my own, but that GOD is with me of a Truth: <hi>May I never, by Pride and Vain Glory, provoke him to depart from me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Stayed all Night on Shore, to expound the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and had a large Company to hear me, and ſhould have had ſeven Hundred, as my Hoſteſs told me, would the Houſe have held them: <hi>So ſwiftly run the Word of GOD and prevailed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was again refreſhed by receiving five Letters: Sat up till paſt Ten, to anſwer ſome of them; and then went to Reſt, with comfortable Reflections of GOD's unmerited loving Kindneſs to me.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ten thouſand thouſand precious Gifts</l>
               <l>My pious Thanks employ:</l>
               <l>Nor is the leaſt a thankful Heart</l>
               <l>That taſtes thoſe Gifts with Joy.</l>
               <l>Through all Eternity, to GOD</l>
               <l>My grateful Song I'll raiſe,</l>
               <l>But, Oh! Eternity's too ſhort</l>
               <l>To ſet forth all his Praiſe!</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 23. Was much comforted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving five more Letters; anſwered ſome of them; and about Eleven in the Morning went on board the <hi>Amy,</hi> to pay my Reſpects to Colonel C. and to viſit
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004631_0016_100DB1DE6005E040"/>
the Soldiers, whom I looked upon as Part of my Charge. I was received very civilly by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; went among the Soldiers, enquired into the State of their Souls, gave them a Word or two of Exhortation; promiſed to bring them ſome Books [I ſaw their Wants], and (at the Officer's Requeſt) to come and preach to them, if Opportunity ſhould offer, before we left the <hi>Downs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, I viſited the <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> our other Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Ship, in which were about twelve Soldiers and a Serjeant: they received me kindly. I ſat down and converſed with them; promiſed to ſend them ſome Books, and to come and preach to them alſo, if Providence ſhould permit. The <hi>Downs</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding calm, and the Weather clear, going from Ship to Ship was very pleaſant. <hi>Mine are but little Flocks, O that it may be my heavenly Father's good Pleaſure to give them the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Two went again on board the <hi>Amy,</hi> to dine with the Officers, being kindly invited by them when I was before on board: They all treated me with great Kindneſs, and in the midſt of our Meal was moſt agreeably ſurpriſed by the coming of two <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Friends, who made a Journey from thence <hi>(O unmerited Love)</hi> on purpoſe to ſee me.</p>
            <p>Dinner being ended, I went and diſperſed ſome Books among the Soldiers; took my Leave and haſtened on board my own Ship; read Prayers and preached, and then went on Shore with my Friends, not being a little rejoiced to ſee them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:004631_0017_100DB1E1F2C40478"/> 
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 23. This Night GOD let me ſee greater Things than before, for ſo many came to hear me that the poor Landlady that owned the Houſe where I lodged ſent to her Tenants, beſeeching them to let no more come in for fear the Floor ſhould break under them; and indeed there were ſuch Numbers that I firſt expounded the Creed to about eighty, and then the ſecond Leſſon to as many more; among whom I obſerved there were many of the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>About Eleven they went, and I then rejoiced with my Friends for what GOD had done for my Soul, eat a little Food, interceded for abſent Friends, and all Mankind, and went to Bed about Two in the Morning. <hi>O what ſhall I render unto the LORD for all the Mercies he pours down upon me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 24. Spent all the Morning in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Letters, walking, ſinging of Pſalms, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion all along the Sea Shore, from whence we had a moſt delightful Proſpect of the <hi>Downs,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me and my Friends moſt noble Matter for Praiſe and Thankſgiving. Met with a little Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to day; but I ſhould have wondered indeed, if ſuch an effectual Door had been opened for <hi>preaching Chriſt,</hi> and there had been no Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Nothing has done more Harm to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church than thinking the Examples recorded in the Holy Scriptures, were written only to be read and not imitated by us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:004631_0017_100DB1E1F2C40478"/>More People came to hear me to Night than ever, ſo that I divided them into two Companies again, and providentially from the ſecond Leſſon for the Morning, had a glorious Opportunity for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſolute Unlawfulneſs of running or buying Run Goods, a Sin that doth moſt eaſily beſet the <hi>Deal</hi> People.</p>
            <p>After Expoſition paid Mr. <hi>E.</hi> a Viſit, who moſt kindly entertained us, and offered me his Boat to go or come on Shore when I pleaſed, which would ſave me much Expence. After we returned from his Houſe, we kneeled down on the Sea Shore, and prayed for them that oppoſed themſelves, and then went to Bed, bleſſing and praiſing GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, Jan.</hi> 25. Went on board in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my Friends, intending to read Prayers and preach to the Soldiers, but they were engaged about their own Affairs, and I could not ſtay long.— Had great Civilities ſhewed us by the Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who treated my Friends reſpectfully, and the Captain, upon my Requeſt, pardoned a Woman who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was to have been ſent on Shore.</p>
            <p>After Breakfaſt, return'd on Shore with my Friends, and read Prayers, and preached at <hi>Upper-Deal</hi> to a large Congregation; I was ſurpriſed to ſee ſuch a Number of People, but all <hi>Deal</hi> ſeems to be in a holy Flame, and, was I prepared for it, I ſhould ſee ſtill greater Things than theſe.</p>
            <p>Dined at Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s, a Grocer in <hi>Deal,</hi> with my Friends; we were moſt hoſpitably entertained, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004631_0018_100DB1E43B47DF70"/>
what was far better, had an excellent Opportunity given me of diſcourſing for a conſiderable Time on our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Neceſſity of our New Birth in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Expounded to two Companies again at Night the Epiſtle for the Morning, and the two Leſſons for the Evening, as moſt ſuitable for the Day, and was enabled to do it with Power: More People came to Night than before, ſo that they now did actually put a Prop under the Floor of the Room. Was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably entertained with more Letters, and tho' the Duty of the Day had a little fatigued me, yet GOD ſtrengthened me to ſit up till Three in the Morning, anſwering my Chriſtian Correſpondents. <hi>They that wait upon the LORD ſhall renew their Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Jan.</hi> 26. I had a Viſit paid me by an Anabaptiſt Teacher, who came to diſcourſe with me about the Things that belonged to the Kingdom of GOD. By what I could find he was a ſpiritual Man. I aſked him ſeveral Queſtions about taking the miniſterial Function, without being called as was <hi>Aaron</hi>; but he did not anſwer me to my Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; however, we both agreed in this, That <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was much comforted by the coming of two more Friends from <hi>London,</hi> with whom I took ſweet Comfort, and could not but fancy myſelf once more at <hi>London,</hi> being ſurrounded with religious Intimates.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>In the Afternoon I took my Friends on board, read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers; after this, went on Shore, ſung Pſalms with my Friends, and then expounded to the People, who now encreaſed ſo much that I was obliged to divide them into three Companies, and GOD enabled me to continue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding three Hours without any Intermiſſion, or the leaſt Wearineſs. <hi>Thanks be to GOD for his ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace!

            </p>
            <p>Received three more Letters, and ſat up till One in the Morning to anſwer ſome ſent before, and then went to Bed rejoicing and bleſſing GOD for the great Things he had done for me. But withal deſirous to ſay with the Divine <hi>Herbert,</hi>

               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:004631_0019_100DB1E6A27C6268"/>About Twelve I came on board, being unwilling to be abſent from my proper Charge long together. I was received kindly, viſited the Sick and catechiſed the Soldiers, ſome of whom anſwered moſt aptly, for which I diſtributed amongſt all ſomething I knew would be agreeable. <hi>Oh! that I may catch them by a holy Guile! but that Power belongeth only unto GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Two came a Clergyman on board, from a neighbouring Village to pay me a Viſit, with whom I ſpent an Hour or two agreeably, had Prayers on open Deck, and inforced the Duty of keeping holy the <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> which then came in Courſe to be explained, but was afraid to ſing a Pſalm, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> being at <hi>Deal</hi> with friends. <hi>Where was my Courage then?

            </p>
            <p>At Five returned aſhore with the Clergyman, to whom I promiſed ſome Books for his Pariſhioners. Expounded three Hours to three Companies, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Glad Tidings of great Joy ſent me by four or five Correſpondents, ſat up till One in the Morning anſwering them, and then went to Bed and had a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſſeſſion of my GOD. <hi>And will GOD in very deed, dwell in this Heart of mine? O free Grace in CHRIST! Praiſe the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me praiſe his holy Name!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spent the Morning moſt agreeably in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Interceſſion for all Friends, and all Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> walking on the Sea Shore.</p>
            <p>Dined with Mrs. <hi>St. L.</hi> who hoſpitably entertain'd us. Went about Three in the Afternoon, intending
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004631_0019_100DB1E6A27C6268"/>
to go on board, but could not, which gave me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Uneaſineſs, thinking it by no Means right to leave my Flock ſo long.</p>
            <p>At Night I expounded to three Companies more numerous than before. Received Letters, and ſat up till One in the Morning anſwering them, and went to ſleep in order to fit myſelf for the Duties of the following <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, Jan.</hi> 29. Went on board early in the Morning, read Prayers, and preached to the Soldiers, and viſited the Sick; then return'd on Shore, and, accompanied with a Troop of pious Friends, haſted to <hi>Shroulden</hi> Church, about a Mile and half diſtant from <hi>Deal.</hi> Where I preach'd to a weeping throng'd Congregation, at the Requeſt of the Miniſter, who at my Requeſt, gave me and my Friends the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament. Others ſtaid alſo, to the Number of ſixteen: And (which I never obſerved before) the Clerk pronounced a loud <hi>Amen</hi> to every Perſon that received either Bread or Wine: An excellent Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and worthy in my Opinion to be imitated in all Churches.</p>
            <p>After this, I and my Friends went on our Way rejoicing, and dined comfortably at Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s, and in the Afternoon preach'd at <hi>Upper-Deal.</hi> The Church was quite crowded, and many went away for Want of Room; ſome ſtood on the Leads of the Church on the outſide, and looked in at the Top Windows, and all ſeem'd eager to hear the Word of GOD. I preach'd againſt Worldly-Mindedneſs, and had great
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004631_0020_100DB1E99AA624C0"/>
Reaſon to think GOD gave it his Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The Weather was exceeding pleaſant, and ſeeing the People go in ſuch Flocks over the Fields, put me in mind of our Bleſſed LORD's Words, when he ſaw the People coming in Companies from <hi>Samaria: The Fields are white already to Harveſt.</hi> I then pray'd, that he would be pleaſed to enable me to <hi>gather Wheat into his heavenly Garner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening, ſuch Numbers came to hear me, that I was oblig'd to divide them into four Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and GOD enabled me to expound to them from Six till Ten. Some would have perſuaded me to have diſmiſs'd the laſt Company without Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but I could not bear to let ſo many go empty away. And I find the more we do for GOD, the more we may. My Strength held out ſurpriſingly; I was but little if at all fatigued; or if I had, I ſhould have been ſufficiently recompenſed by ſome Letters, which I received from my dear Friends, which gave me unſpeakable Satisfaction: And after I had peruſed them, I took a little Refreſhment, rejoiced and gave Thanks with my Friends for the Bleſſings of the Day, and went to our reſpective Beds about Twelve at Night. <hi>Oh! Who can expreſs the Loving Kindneſs of the LORD, or ſhew forth all his Praiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 30. At the Requeſt of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the Leave of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (who ſent from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> a moſt obliging Meſſage) I preached again at <hi>Upper-Deal</hi> to as crouded and attentive Audience as I had Yeſterday; and afterwards I and Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004631_0020_100DB1E99AA624C0"/>
waited upon the Rev. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> who read Prayers, and moſt courteouſly invited me to come and ſee him. Our Converſation run chiefly on the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Baptiſing Infants at <hi>Church.</hi> I continued with him about an Hour; and then at his Requeſt viſited a poor Woman of the Pariſh, who was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly troubled in Mind: And GOD was pleaſed to bleſs my Miniſtry to her Comfort. <hi>To him be all the Glory!</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>So poor, ſo frail an Inſtrument,</l>
               <l>If Thou, my GOD, vouchſafe to uſe,</l>
               <l>'Tis Praiſe enough to be employ'd,</l>
               <l>Reward enough if thou excuſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If thou excuſe, then work thy Will,</l>
               <l>By ſo unfit an Inſtrument;</l>
               <l>It will at once thy Goodneſs ſhow,</l>
               <l>And prove thy Pow'r Omnipotent.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Soon after this we went to Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s, where our Friends expected us: But we had not been long there, before the Wind ſhifted about on a ſudden, and a Cry came, <hi>The Wind is fair, prepare yourſelves for Sailing.</hi> I received the News with an humble Joy. But Sorrow, I perceived, filled the Hearts of my dear Friends, who came from <hi>London</hi> to ſee me. We immediately retired, intending to intercede for all Mankind before we parted: But the People were in ſuch a Hurry, for fear the Sea ſhould grow too tempeſtuous to go off, that we were obliged to be very brief. Having therefore recommended ourſelves
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004631_0021_100DB1EB3591BAD8"/>
to GOD, I took my Leave. But Oh, what Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did the <hi>Deal</hi> People expreſs to my unworthy Perſon! for no ſooner were they apprized of the Wind being fair, but they came running in Droves after me to the Sea-Shore, wiſhing me good Luck in the Name of the LORD; and with Tears, and other Expreſſions of Kindneſs, praying for my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and ſafe Return. I was confounded with a Senſe of GOD's Mercies to me.</p>
            <p>The Sea was very boiſterous indeed, and the Waves roſe Mountains high: But GOD was pleaſed to give Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and me an unuſual Degree of Faith, and we went on ſinging Pſalms and praiſing GOD, the Water daſhing in our Faces all the Way. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we were in Jeopardy, <hi>But wherefore ſhould we fear, having ſo many on Shore praying for us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Five we came on board, and were receiv'd with Joy: For the Ship was under Sail, and the People were afraid I ſhould be left behind. As I was going into the great Cabbin, I fell down the Steerage Stairs; but received little or no Hurt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had ſailed for a ſhort Time, the Man of War not moving, we caſt Anchor again. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was ſo ſick by the Ship's Motion after we came on board, that he was obliged to go to Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 31. Spent the Morning in writing Letters, viſiting the Sick, reading Prayers and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Soldiers.</p>
            <p>About Twelve was pleaſingly ſurpriſed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sight of my <hi>London</hi> Friends, who ſtayed at <hi>Deal</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:004631_0021_100DB1EB3591BAD8"/>
all Night, and finding the Ship did not ſail, came with ſome more <hi>Deal</hi> Friends to take me on Shore, that I might bid them once more farewel. I was a little unwilling at firſt, but by their Importunity and affectionate Intreaties they even compelled me. I accordingly went with them, ſinging Pſalms and praiſing GOD all the Way.</p>
            <p>But I had ſcarce been on Shore an Hour before the Man of War gave a Signal for ſailing; and ſo we were obliged to haſten back on board. The People expreſſed much Joy at ſeeing me come to <hi>Deal</hi> again, and accompanied me to the Sea Shore, as before.</p>
            <p>The Weather being fair, we went on board with Pleaſure: The Ship was under Sail, but we met with it, and were received affectionately. <hi>I hope that theſe frequent and ſudden Removes will put me in mind that I have here no continuing City; and ſtir me up to live ſo holily, that was GOD at any time to ſay, This Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee; I might with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſay, Lo I come!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Thing I could not but reflect on Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when I ſaw <hi>Deal</hi> all in a Confuſion when the Wind ſhifted about ſo ſuddenly, ſome crying for one thing, ſome another, but all anxious leaſt their Ship ſhould ſail without them. <hi>Alas! I what Confuſion</hi> (thought I) <hi>will the Inhabitants of the World be in, when in a Moment, in the Twinkling of an Eye, they ſhall hear the Voice of the Archangel and Trump of GOD, crying aloud, Ariſe, ye dead, and come to Judgment!</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:004631_0022_100DB1ED56EE8F48"/>After I was on board, I preached, read Prayers to the Soldiers, viſited the Sick, wrote ſome Letters, and interceded for all Mankind; and retired to Bed about Twelve.</p>
            <p>Our Ship ſailed briſkly for a few Hours; but the Wind ſhifting again, was obliged to return back once more, and we caſt Anchor in the <hi>Downs</hi> about Nine at Night.</p>
            <p>After this, I went chearfully about my Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Buſineſs, viſited the Sick, read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers, anſwered ſome Letters I had received in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Sent ſome Books for the Soldiers on Board the <hi>Lightfoot</hi>; and at Night went on Shore at <hi>Deal</hi> with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> where we were moſt kindly received, and courteouſly entertained and lodged at Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s: <hi>The LORD reward him a thouſand fold!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did nothing that Night, it being late, ſave that I viſited a ſick Perſon at her earneſt Deſire and the Miniſter's Conſent, and talked about half an Hour on the Benefit of Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Anſwered two or three Letters I received after I came on Shore; prayed with ſome well-diſpoſed People that were at Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s, and about Twelve went to Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Feb.</hi> 2. Roſe early in the Morning went on board in Mr. <hi>E</hi>'s Boat, intending to read Prayers and preach to the Soldiers, and then return to <hi>Upper-Deal</hi> to preach there, being aſked to do ſo by the Inhabitants and the Miniſter.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:004631_0022_100DB1ED56EE8F48"/> About Ten o'Clock there ſprung up a pleaſant fair Gale, which carried us from the <hi>Downs</hi> near forty Miles that Day; during which Time I read Prayers, preached to, and catechiſed my Soldiers, wrote ſome Letters, and had an Opportunity of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as we ſailed by <hi>Dover</hi>; for which I was deſirous to bleſs GOD.</p>
            <p>Any one muſt needs think I ſhould have been glad to have heard from Mr. <hi>Weſley,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Friday, Feb.</hi> 3. Let this Day be noted in my Book; for GOD has wrought for us a wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance! About Seven in the Morning, the Men upon Deck not keeping a good Look out, one of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships in ſhifting to the Wind ran near us ſo very briſkly, that had not Capt. <hi>W.</hi> providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially been on Deck, and beſeeching them for GOD's ſake to tack about, both the Ships muſt inevitably have ſplit one againſt another. They were within four Yards of each other. The Captain ſaid he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in ſo great Danger in his Life. GOD ſo
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004631_0023_100DB1EFB98FAFF0"/>
ordered it, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and I knew nothing of it till it was over: But when I was appriſed of it, I endeavoured to excite all to Thankfulneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd publick Thanks at Prayers. Too many ſeem'd to be unſenſible of the Mercy received. But,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Since GOD does thus his wond'rous Love</l>
               <l>Thro' all our Lives extend,</l>
               <l>Thoſe Lives to him let us devote.</l>
               <l>And in his Service ſpend.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Read publick Prayers and preached to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as uſual; explain'd the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> to the Women, exhorted them particularly to be obedient to their own Huſbands, which they had lately been wanting in: And was pleaſed to hear the Captain, as I came on Deck, remind me of the Motion I made to him ſome time ago, about having Prayers daily in the Great Cabbin; and withal deſired that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward I would read Prayers Morning and Evening to them. This I moſt readily conſented to, it being what I had long deſired and prayed for, and what I was juſt then about to propoſe to him again. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I went immediately and acquainted the Lieutenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Captain's Deſire, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun this Night to have full publick Prayers: And at the Requeſt of Capt. <hi>W.</hi> I expounded the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leſſon; and a glorious Leſſon it was. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD! for that I hope we ſhall now begin to live like Chriſtians, and call upon the Name of the LORD daily.</hi> The very Thoughts of GOD's granting me this Petition filled me with Joy.</p>

               <hi>Saturday, Feb.</hi> 4. Began to have Prayers in the Great Cabbin in the Morning; read Prayers and preached twice to the Soldiers as uſual; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the ſecond Leſſon in the Evening to the Gentlemen, after Prayers in the Great Cabbin, which from henceforth I intended, GOD willing, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: Unſpeakable I find is and will be the Benefit of it; for it gives me an Opportunity of ſaying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutary Truths, and affords us Matter for ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Table-talk afterwards.</p>
            <p>Was much pleaſed to ſee our Ship ſail directly before the Wind; was enlarged in Interceſſion; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed three Soldiers with Books, who began to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>day to learn to read: GOD <hi>enable them not only to read, but to do their Duty!</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, Febr.</hi> 5. Joined in Spirit with abſent Friends in holy Ordinances; ſpent ſome Time moſt delightfully in reading the Word of GOD: Read Prayers, and ſome Obſervations on both the Leſſons in the Great Cabbin; and then read Prayers and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded both the Leſſons to the Soldiers. <hi>O that the LORD would open our Underſtandings! for they are but a dead Letter without the Illumination of his Holy Spirit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Read Prayers and preached my Sermon on <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in the Afternoon to the Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Great Cabbin.</p>
            <p>Begun to-night to turn the Obſervations made on

the Leſſons in the Morning into catechiſtical Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and was pleaſed to hear ſome of the Soldiers and my Companions make ſuch apt Anſwers. I find this an excellent Way of Inſtruction: It makes them bring their Bible, and give diligent Heed to the Things that are ſpoken: It teaches them the Scriptures practically, and conſequently will by the Divine Bleſſing make them wiſe unto Salvation. <hi>Thanks be to GOD for putting this into my Heart! By his Aſſiſtance I intend to continue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, Feb.</hi> 6. Had no Prayers in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Decks; but read Prayers in the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, likewiſe did the ſame in the Evening, and expounded the 14th Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the ſecond Leſſon, which containing an Account of St. <hi>John</hi>'s reproving <hi>Herod,</hi> gave me an Opportunity of telling them, that great Men ſhould not be angry if Miniſters ſhould reprove them out of Love; and they ſeemed to aſſent to it.</p>
            <p>Read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers as uſual; interceded warmly for abſent Friends and all Mankind; and went to Bed full of Peace and Joy. <hi>Thanks be to GOD for this unſpeakable Gift</hi>!</p>
            <p>Was pleaſed to ſee Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo active in teaching the Children. He has now many Scholars: <hi>May GOD proſper the Works of his Hands upon him</hi>!</p>
            <p>Had ſuch pleaſant Sailing, that Captain <hi>W.</hi> ſaid he never knew the like before. <hi>What Reaſon have I to be thankful</hi>! <hi>O that my Friends would help me to give Thanks.</hi>

            <p>Being now in the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> the Ship rock'd very much, tho' there was a great Calm: <hi>But if there's a fixed Principle of Grace, a firm Love of GOD rooted in the Heart; what avails all outward Motions?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, Feb.</hi> 8. Had publick Worſhip and expounded as uſual to both my Congregations. Was pleaſed to hear a Gentleman diſcourſe for ſome Time of the utter Inability of any Thing to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py but GOD.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon I preached and read Prayers on open Deck, at the Captain's Deſire, who ordered Chairs to be brought, and Boards put acroſs them for the Soldiers to ſit upon. My Subject was, <hi>the Eternity of Hell Torments</hi>; and I was earneſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of it, being deſirous that none of my dear Hearers ſhould experience them. Praying and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms on open Deck enlarged my Heart.</p>

Twelve at Night a freſh Gale aroſe, which increaſed ſo very much by Four in the Morning, that the Waves raged horribly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and broke in like a River on many of the poor Soldiers who lay near the Main Hatch Way. Friend <hi>H.</hi> and I knew nothing of it, but perceived ourſelves reſtleſs, and could not ſleep at all; he complained of a grievous Head-ach. I aroſe and called upon GOD for myſelf and thoſe that ſailed with me, abſent Friends, and all Mankind. After this I went on Deck; but ſurely a more noble aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sight my Eyes never yet beheld! for the Waves roſe more than Mountains high; and ſometimes came on the Quarter-Deck. I endeavoured all the while to magnify GOD, for thus making his Power to be known: And then creeping on my Knees (for I knew not how to go otherwiſe) I followed my Friend <hi>H.</hi> between Decks, and ſung Pſalms and comforted the poor wet People. After this, I read Prayers in the great Cabbin; but we were obliged to ſit all the while. Then thinking I ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing nothing, I laid myſelf acroſs the Chair reading; but GOD was ſo good, ſo to aſſiſt

me by his Spirit, that tho' Things were tumbling, the Ship rocking, and Perſons falling down unable to ſtand, and ſick about me; yet I never was more chearful in my Life, and was enabled, though in the midſt of Company, to finiſh a Sermon before I went to Bed, which I had begun a few Days before: So greatly was GOD's Strength magnified in my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! <hi>Praiſe the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me praiſe his holy. Name!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, Feb.</hi> 16. Did as uſual in the Ship; only inſtead of Catechiſing, examined into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of my Friend <hi>H</hi>'s Scholars; gave them proper Encouragement, as I ſaw they wanted; and had Hopes ſome of them would become living Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Joined with thoſe at Night, who ſet apart this Day as a Day of Faſting and Humiliation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate the Judgments our National Sins deſerve. <hi>LORD, hear our Prayers, and let our Cry come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, Feb.</hi> 17. Read Prayers, expounded the Leſſons and proceeded on my Explanation of the Catechiſm to the Women: Expounded part of the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> after Evening Prayer, in the Great Cabbin; and intend, after this is done, to go on with <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments. GOD give us all praying, believing, obedient Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Found honeſt Mr. <hi>D.</hi> particularly uſeful to me, I being a little ſick by the late ſhaking of the Ship, and the Heat and Smell of the People between
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004631_0026_100DB1F7500F7340"/>
Decks, who, as yet, have ſcarce Had Time to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves ſince the Storm. <hi>O how ſoon are theſe frail Tabernacles of ours put out of Order! Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the Man who ſerves GOD in his Health, and has nothing to do when Sickneſs ſeizes him but quietly to lye down and die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Feb.</hi> 18. Performed the uſual Duty, and finiſhed the <hi>Lord's Prayer.</hi> Perceived my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diſorders to go off, and was enabled to preach to the Soldiers with more Enlargement than I have been for theſe four Days paſt. The Captain obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me a little diſordered, and gave Mr. <hi>H.</hi> a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial for me: The good LORD note this Favour in his Book.</p>
            <p>After Dinner I grew better and better; was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly delighted by ſitting on Deck, praiſing GOD for the Pleaſantneſs of the Weather, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Life: <hi>Surely he was a righteous Man.</hi> The Account of his Fall made my Heart tremble within me. <hi>But why ſhouldeſt thou be caſt down, O my Soul? Still truſt in GOD: He that has begun will carry on and finiſh the good Work. Even ſo,</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>come quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Weather was exceeding pleaſant all the Day, yet it grew more and more pleaſant in the Evening, and our Ship ſailed at the Rate of nine Miles an Hour, and as ſteady as tho' we were ſitting on Shore. The Night, was exceeding clear, and the Moon and Stars appeared in their greateſt Luſtre; ſo that not having Patience to ſtay below, I went
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004631_0027_100DB1F96171AD10"/>
upon Deck with Friend <hi>H.</hi> and praiſed GOD for his wonderful loving Kindneſs in ſinging Pſalms, and gave Thanks for the Bleſſings, and aſked Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the Offences of the Week, and then had a long Interceſſion. <hi>GOD grant I may learn a Leſſon from this good Providence of GOD, and the nearer I come to my Journey's End, the quicker may my Pace be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worth coming from <hi>England;</hi> to ſee what we have beheld this Day. <hi>GOD be praiſed for all his Mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, Feb.</hi> 19. Slept better to Night than I have a long while; <hi>bleſſed be the Keeper of</hi> Iſrael. Read Prayers in the great Cabbin; was enlarged in expounding both the Leſſons to the Soldiers; and had Prayers, and preached one of the Sermons GOD enabled me to make ſince I came on board, on open Deck in the Afternoon, All the Gentlemen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, Benches were laid for the People, and the Ship ſailed ſmoothly, and the Weather was finer than I can expreſs; ſo that I know not where I have perform'd the Service more comfortably. And indeed, I have been ſo delighted theſe two Days with our pleaſant ſailing, and the Promontaries all around us, that I could not avoid thanking GOD for calling me abroad, and ſtirring up all to praiſe him: <hi>Who by his Strength ſetteth faſt the Mountains, and is girded about with Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe two Days our Ship has ſailed at the Rate of a Hundred and ſixty Miles in twenty-four
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004631_0027_100DB1F96171AD10"/>
Hours, and rode in Triumph directly before the Wind, and caſt Anchor about Two in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'till which Time, I ſat up on purpoſe to give Thanks in <hi>Gibraltar</hi> Haven. <hi>Oh that my Friends would therefore praiſe the LORD for his Goodneſs, and extol him for the wonderful Works he hath done for me, the leaſt of the Sons of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Providence will be pleaſed to diſpoſe of me here, I cannot yet know; but I thought proper to ſend you this Account of my ſhort Voyage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to ſhew you how GOD has heard your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to provoke you to Thankfulneſs, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you to perſevere in praying on my Behalf. If you obſerve (as doubtleſs you may) any thing amiſs or imprudent in my Conduct, I beſeech you, by the Mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, tell me plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for that Cauſe have I been ſo particular: And if you ſhould happen to ſee any Thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable or praiſe-worthy in my Behaviour, Oh, do not think more highly of me than you ought to think; for I am a Worm, and no Man, and deſerve to be the Out-caſt of the People: but <hi>give all Glory to my beſt Maſter, by whoſe free Grace I am what I am.</hi>

            <p>I cannot help tranſcribing the Verſes that follow, as a Concluſion to what I have now ſent you.</p>
