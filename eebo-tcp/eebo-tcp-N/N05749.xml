            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And for my Readers greater Satisfaction I shall also go on, as I did before, to give them, <hi>not my own Expressions,</hi> but those of the <hi>Authors</hi> who lived in the Times they wrote of; excepting now and then a Word or Note of <hi>mine</hi> for <hi>Explanation Sake,</hi> distinguished from <hi>theirs</hi> by being inclosed in such <hi>Marks</hi> as [These].

low hath the Lord brought us. Yet they who survived were not discouraged, but bareing God's Corrections with Humility, and trusting in his Mercies; and considering how after a lower Ebb he had raised up our Neighbours at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> we began again, in <hi>December,</hi> to consult about a fit Place to build a Town upon. <hi>(d)</hi>

The <hi>Committee</hi> meet at <hi>Roxbury:</hi> And upon further Consideration, for [3] Reasons it is concluded we shou'd <hi>not</hi> have a <hi>Town</hi> in the Place aforesaid; (1) Because Men wou'd be forc'd to keep 2 Families; (2) There is no running Water; and if there are any Springs, they won't suffice the Town; (3) The most of the People have built already, and wou'd not be able to build again: So we agree to meet at <hi>Waterton,</hi> this Day sennet, and in the mean Time <hi>other Places</hi> shou'd be viewed. <hi>(w)</hi>

But one of their Company espying <hi>Land</hi> near <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> they made a shift to hoist up Part of their Sail, and by God's special Providence were carried thro' the Rocks to the Shoar: where some got on Land; but some had their Leggs frozen in the Ice, so as they were forced to be cut out. Being now on Shoar they kindle a Fire; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Hatchet, they can get but little Wood, and are forc'd to lie in the open Air all Night, being extreamly cold. In the <hi>Morning</hi> 2 of their Company go towards <hi>Plymouth.</hi> (Supposing it within 7 or 8 <hi>Miles,</hi> where as it is near 50 from them) [and <hi>not</hi> an <hi>English</hi> House nearer] By the Way they meet 2 <hi>Indian Squaws,</hi> who telling their Husbands they had met 2 <hi>Englishmen</hi> that had been Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack't, make after them and bring them back to their <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and entertain them kindly: and one of them [<abbr>viz.</abbr> of the <hi>Indians</hi>] next Day goes with them to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth:</hi> and the other [<hi>Indian</hi>] goes to find out their <hi>Boat</hi>

and the Rest of their Company which are 7 Miles off: and having found them, helps them what he can, returns to his <hi>Wigwam,</hi> fetches a Hatchet, builds them a <hi>Wigwam,</hi> covers it, gets them Wood: (for they were so weak and frozen, as they cou'd not stir) and <hi>Garret</hi> dies about 2 Days after his Landing; and the Ground so frozen as they cou'd not dig his Grave, the <hi>Indian,</hi> with his Hatchet, hews a Hole about half a Yard deep, [puts the] Corps in it, and lays over it a great Heap of Wood to keep it from the Wolves. By this Time the Gov of <hi>Plymouth</hi> sends 3 Men to them with Provisions; who launch'd their Boat, (which the Wind had driven up to high Water Mark) and with a fair Wind get to <hi>Plymouth:</hi> where <hi>another</hi> of their Company <hi>dies,</hi> his Flesh being mortified with the Frost: and the 2 who went towards <hi>Plymouth died</hi> also; <hi>one</hi> of them being not able to get thither, and the <hi>other</hi> had his Foot so frozen as he died of it after.
