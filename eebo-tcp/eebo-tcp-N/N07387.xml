            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>As Liquors tinge the containing Veſſel, the Severity of theſe Mens Complexion gives a Gloom to Religion, which is paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, as wearing a continual Frown, and with Features inflexible to any Sort of Chearfulneſs: And though the Reaſon of Things, the Methods of Providence, the Order of the World, and the Scriptures
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009424_0004_0F743BCE324B4268"/>
themſelves, are unitedly againſt this ſour and ſurly Stoiciſm, yet ſuch is the perverſe Turn of Mind of theſe Men, that inſtead of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold with Rapture on ſuch Methods as are offer'd for their better Information, they have as obſtinately ſet themſelves down to cavil at them, as if inſtead of the utmoſt Benefit, the higheſt Injury had been offer'd, and Outrage committed againſt them.</p>
            <p>MANY, actuated by this perverſe Turn of Mind, in other Reſpects of ſtrong Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have been vainly and impiouſly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to murther their Time in traverſing the Bible merely to pick out Texts and Portions of it in Support of their contracted No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; when, after all, they have done No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their Purpoſe, but like the hungry peeviſh Viper in the Fable, broke their Teeth upon a File that mocked their idle Frenzy.</p>
            <p>THIS fills the Minds of ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them in Society, and who fall into the Snare, with unfavourable Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards their Fellow-Citizens; wrong Ideas of Perſons and Things they are not acquainted with; and uncharitable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of thoſe Actions of which they
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009424_0005_0F743BCEF1715D28"/>
are by no Means competent Judges: It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils into their Minds the utmoſt Violence and Bitterneſs, and eradicates that Charity and Brotherly-love, which is the Ornament and Perfection of Religion, and the moſt indiſpenſable Means for attaining the End of it.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE that excellent Writer, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> obſerves, <q>That it will be hard to determine how many Degrees of Innocency and Good-nature, or of Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Indifferency in Religion, are neceſſary to overbalance the Fury and Miſchiefs of a blind Zeal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BISHOP <hi>Gibſon</hi> alſo, ſpeaking of the fatal Conſequences of <hi>Bigotry,</hi> has this excellent Obſervation;—ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſays, <q>The more they failed in the inward Obedience of the Heart, and the Duties of moral Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, the greater Zeal they ſhew'd for the outward and ritual Parts of the Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>TRUE Devotion languiſhes, while the Mind is divided and taken up with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Debates concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which in themſelves cannot be ſaid to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009424_0006_0F743BCFCDA973A8"/>
be eſſential to Religion, but moſtly prove prejudicial to it, by occaſioning weak Minds to ſet too high a Value on them, and to miſtake the Shadow for the Subſtance.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER Expedients, therefore, can be found to allay theſe Animoſities, which break us into different Factions and Intereſts, cannot but be uſeful to Religion in general, and highly tend to its Reputation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe among Men.</p>
            <p>AND certain I am, that were the Clergy of all Denominations, obliged to preach up the Neceſſity of Brotherly-love, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from uſing Invectives againſt thoſe who differ from them in the ceremonial Forms of Devotion, the Face of Religion, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land, would wear a different Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; nor would Men have leſs Love for each other becauſe of their Difference in the Modes of Worſhip: But while the Churches are daily pronouncing their horrid and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Anathemas againſt thoſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Communities, the deluded Flock, who look on themſelves as of the Houſhold of GOD, are taught to regard and hate thoſe of other Perſuaſions, as of the Houſhold of the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009424_0007_0F743BD16C4F1038"/>THIS is a Fact of the greateſt Notoriety; all Men know it, and none will deny it: Inſtead of multiplying theſe deſirable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, where we may agree in Points of publick Worſhip, that are indifferent in themſelves, we let the Spirit of Contention into thoſe very Methods that are not only foreign to vital Religion, but ſhould in their Nature diſpoſe us to be Friends: This our Anger in our Devotion, is like Poiſon in Perfume, which taints the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, inſtead of chearing and refreſhing them.</p>
            <p>THIS unhappily being the Caſe, I ſhall not wonder if the Attempt I am making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards introducing the Uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick into the Worſhip of thoſe Societies who have hitherto been taught to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as unlawful, and unſcriptural, ſhould be attended with the ſame Oppoſition with the Promulgation of the Goſpel itſelf, and the Promoter of it expoſed to the ſame Bigotry and miſguided Zeal. However, as every well-meant Attempt deſerves Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Encouragement, I ſhall venture to lay my Thoughts on this Subject before the Publick; which, though they may be far ſhort of the End propos'd, may yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009424_0008_0F743BD23A286998"/>
have the Merit of ſuggeſting ſome Hints to others who may be Lovers of the divine Harmony I am contending for, and better qualified to make the Attempt.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus briefly premiſed the fatal Tendency of a blind miſguided Zeal, and ſhewed that it is not only deſtructive of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but a Bar to the Advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World, I ſhall now proceed to note the Origin of Inſtrumental Muſick; the <hi>Lawfulneſs of uſing ſuch in divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> and that it has been held <hi>ſo</hi> by <hi>the far greater Part</hi> of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in all Ages of the World, even down to the preſent Time.</p>
            <p>As the Scriptures are univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be given by the Inſpiration of GOD, the moſt probable Way to ſtrengthen my Argument, and remove the Prejudices of ſuch as are diſpos'd to cavil at the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am recommending, will be to take my Meaſures of it occaſionally, from thoſe who were immediately directed and aſſiſted in it by the HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>AND firſt, with regard to the Origin of Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick, they were
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009424_0009_0F743BD2AFE27410"/>
doubtleſs among the moſt early Inventions of the Sons of Men: <hi>Moſes</hi> particularly tells us, <hi>Geneſis</hi> iv. 21, that <hi>Jubal,</hi> long before the Flood, followed the making ſuch muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruments as were then uſed in the Worſhip of GOD, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Harp</hi> and OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAN, as a Trade: And with regard to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Muſick, we are told, <hi>Job</hi> xxxviii, that when the ALMIGHTY had laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth, <q>the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of GOD ſhouted for Joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"IF, ſays a late Writer, we look back to the Records of Antiquity, we ſhall find that ſome of the oldeſt and moſt exalted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Men, are Songs of Praiſe and Extaſy to their GREAT CREATOR.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething in <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> admirably ſuited to divine Subjects; and it is natural for the Soul, when ſtruck with any Thing ſurprizingly <hi>great, good</hi> or <hi>new,</hi> to break forth, beyond the common Modes of Speech, into the moſt rapturous Turns of Expreſſion; accompanied with correſpondent Attitudes of Body and Modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Voice. Even the untutored Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages around us, furniſh ſtriking Examples of this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009424_0010_0F743BD4DBB3D3D0"/>HENCE it is, that <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Muſick</hi> were originally confined to the immediate Praiſes of the DEITY; and that the beſt and wiſeſt Men of all Ages, have had Recourſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of their Souls before the Almighty LORD of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>'ERE yet Temples were built, perhaps, or fixed Hours of Devotion ſet apart; when the Voice of Conſcience could be heard, and the buſy Scenes of Art had not yet ſeduced away the Attention of Man; the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors of our Race, as they tended their Flocks on from Paſture to Paſture, no Doubt, often felt their Hearts rapt into this Kind of ſacred Extaſy, and poured them forth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated Strains before the LORD.— Whenever they received any ſignal Inſtance of Almighty Goodneſs; whenever any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Effect of Almighty Power ſtruck their Sight, and kindled Admiration; that auſpicious Moment, doubtleſs, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and adored the inviſible Hand from which the Whole proceeded; the Hand that formed the Earth, the Sun and Moon, which they beheld; that hung the Clouds in Air; that charged their Boſoms with Treaſures, and bade them drop down in Fatneſs to rejoice Herb, and Beaſt, and Man.</p>

            <p>BUT among all the Solemnities of this Nature, there is none in Hiſtory ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as that under the Reign of King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> at the Dedication of the Temple to the Worſhip of GOD:—We are told, by an unerring Mouth, that beſides the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of State, and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> all the Elders and Heads of Tribes, with the whole Body of the People rang'd under them, from one End of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the other, were ſummon'd to aſſiſt on this ſolemn Occaſion: When the Ark of the Covenant, containing the two Tables of the Law, was brought and depoſited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wings of the Cherubims, in the holy Place, the great Concert of Praiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:—It was enliven'd with an Hundred

            <p>THE Buſineſs of this mighty Chorus was to extol their MAKER, and to excite the whole Nation, thus aſſembled, to the Praiſe of his never-ceaſing Goodneſs and Mercy: <q>As the Trumpets and Singers were as one, to make one Sound to be heard, in praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thanking the Lord; and when they lift up their Voice with the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Cymbals, and Inſtruments of Muſick, they praiſed the Lord, ſaying, For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever:</q>—On which the Houſe was filled with a Cloud, which evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the DIVINE PRESENCE among them; inſomuch that the Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not being able to bear the <hi>Awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Solemnity,</hi> retir'd into the Court of the Temple.—In the mean While, the People, whoſe Hearts were gradually mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>FROM hence, therefore, it appears, that it does not only betray a Want of Religion, but weak and childiſh Ignorance, not to ſee the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of Inſtrumental Muſick in our Acts of Devotion towards GOD; nor can it be unworthy the Regard and Notice of the higheſt Rank of Mankind, when view'd, as it really is, as a moſt ſublime Acquiſition!</p>

            <p>IT would, I confeſs, be the higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in me here (and it would be paying the Audience but a poor Compliment) to inſinuate, but that the Certainty of hearing a <hi>ſpirited Diſcourſe,</hi> deliver'd with <hi>a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Warmth and Energy,</hi> and <hi>enforced with that Dignity and Solemnity becoming the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Deſk,</hi> has its proper Weight with the Multitude who flock thither; but I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that no Houſe of Worſhip in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> was ever ſo crouded before, except when the inimitable <hi>Whitefield</hi> graced the ſame.</p>
            <p>THE Members of the two <hi>epiſcopal Churches</hi> in this City, ſenſible of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009424_0030_0F743BE425DEB7A8"/>
cited in the preceding Pages, and encouraged by the Certainty of being able to get Organs made here in <hi>as great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> and near <hi>one Half cheaper,</hi> have lately rais'd ſuitable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions among themſelves, with which to erect a very genteel one in their reſpective Churches; and many in the Country are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their laudable Example.</p>
            <p>AND would to GOD, that, diveſted of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prejudice, this amiable Spirit of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>decent Worſhip of</hi> GOD would dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe itſelf among the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> alſo. — What a glorious Appearance would an ORGAN make in ſome of their Churches, eſpecially in this and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cities! Nor would one look out of Character in the meaneſt Building in the Country.—We ſhould not by this deviate more from the Faith of <hi>true Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> than thoſe of our Brethren in <hi>Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>America</hi> do, who have Steeples with Bells to their Churches (where they are of Ability) which are not only uſed at ſtated Times for Worſhip, Times of public Rejoicing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but toll at the Death and Interment not only of their own Members, but Perſons of any other Perſuaſion who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009424_0031_0F743BE4AF089A88"/>
and will go to the Expence of the ſame: The Generality of our Clergy alſo in the <hi>old Countries</hi> wear the ſame decent Badges of Diſtinction (<hi>viz.</hi> the Gown and Band) with the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that the introducing the Uſe of the <hi>Organ</hi> into our Acts of Worſhip, would not bring us one Jot nearer to <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> than we were before, as ſome of our weak but well-meaning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors may be apt to imagine.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the Advantages cited in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Pages, ſuch an Inſtitution would have this good Tendency, that, inſtead of their Members loitering away the bleſſed Sabbath Day at Home, ſequeſtering themſelves from the reſt of Mankind in unſocial Retirements, or <hi>crouding other Houſes of Worſhip,</hi> it would induce them to croud <hi>their own:</hi> — And, till this is taken <hi>into Conſideration,</hi> they have, I fear, very little Grounds to expect their Congregations will either thrive or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe on their Hands.</p>
            <p>INDEED, however it may affect ſome particular Societies, it muſt afford a ſenſible Pleaſure to every generous Mind, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the <hi>narrow Principles of Party,</hi> to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009424_0032_0F743BE71797C3B0"/>
ſee ſuch a laudable Spirit prevail, as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for promoting ſo eſſential a Part of the publick Worſhip of GOD.—<q>How can the moſt harden'd Sinner, ſays Biſhop <hi>Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi>

            <p>THIS is that which makes Heaven itſelf ſo pleaſant a Place to thoſe who dwell therein, becauſe they are always praiſing GOD:—There the celeſtial Choirs pour forth their triumphant Hallelujahs to his adorable Name! They caſt their Crowns at his Feet, ſaying, <q>Worthy art thou, O LORD, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Glory, and Honour, and Power!—</q> There the Cherubims and Seraphims conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually do cry, "Holy, Holy LORD GOD of Sabbath!"—There the glorious Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Apoſtles <hi>praiſe Him:</hi>—There the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009424_0033_0F743BE7E0130F40"/>
goodly Fellowſhip of the Prophets <hi>praiſe Him:</hi>—There the noble Army of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs <hi>praiſe Him:</hi>—There all the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect <hi>praiſe Him continually!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the exalted Strain of Scripture Language in its Deſcriptions of Heaven, when it would awaken our Diligence and engage our Affections in the Purſuit of it.</p>
            <p>BLESSED with ſuch Proſpects, we ought ever to maintain a deep Senſe of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Bounty and Goodneſs, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually acknowledging our Obligations with the utmoſt Gratitude, Sincerity, and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.—To be created with intelligent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Underſtanding; to bear the Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD's Image; and be qualified for the Joys of a bleſſed Immortality, are Goods really ineſtimable, and Privileges above Price! As ſuch, they demand ſuitable Sentiments, and our moſt ſolemn Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>THIS evidently appears to have been the happy Temper of the holy Pſalmiſt, whoſe affectionate Acknowledgments of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty of GOD, in the chearful Celebration of his Praiſe, make up a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Part of his divine and raviſhing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009424_0034_0F743BE8731BFC00"/>
Songs:—How often do we find him exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and diſpoſing himſelf and others to join Voice, Hand and Heart together, in this holy and delightful Employment!—Pſalm xxxiii. 2, 3, <hi>Praiſe the Lord with the Harp; ſing unto him with the Pſaltery, and an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ten Strings: Sing unto him a new Song, play ſkilfully with a loud Voice:</hi>—Pſalm lxvi. 1, 8, <hi>Make a joyful Noiſe unto God, all ye Lands: Oh! bleſs our God, ye People, and make the Voice of his Praiſe to be heard:—</hi> Pſalm lxxi. 22, <hi>I will alſo praiſe thee with the Pſaltery, even thy Truth, O my God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee will I ſing with the Harp, O thou Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of Iſrael:</hi>—Pſalm xcviii. 5, 6, <hi>Sing unto the Lord with the Harp; with the Harp and the Voice of a Pſalm: With Trumpets and Sound of Cornet make a joyful Noiſe before the Lord the King:—</hi>Pſalm cl. 4, <hi>Praiſe him with Organs:—</hi>1 Chron. xvi. 42, <hi>And with muſical Inſtruments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the Powers of Vocal and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſick thus unite in one joint Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, he muſt certainly have a Heart not of Fleſh, but of Marble, inſuſceptible of all tender Impreſſions, who can withſtand their united Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009424_0035_0F743BE944E38E70"/>I AM well aware, that many well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People have been led to decry the Uſe of the <hi>Organ</hi> in divine Worſhip, becauſe the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is not more expreſſive of its Utility: But I think it may be laid down as a fundamental Truth, that the <hi>only Reaſon</hi> why the Uſe of it is not more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is, that it was a Doctrine <hi>ſo well received</hi> by all Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Men, as to render <hi>any Thing</hi> on that Head <hi>intirely unneceſſary:</hi> Thus, ſhould any ſettled <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divine in our Day preſume to take up his own and his Hearers Time in proving the Lawfulneſs of Pſalmody, as a Part of their publick Acts of Worſhip, would not the Hearers very juſtly infer the Preacher was drove to his laſt Shift for Subject-matter?—The Man, ſay they, may with the ſame Face engroſs our Time in proving that the Sun ſhines at Noon-day, or that it is dark at Twelve at Night.</p>
            <p>IN the preceding Pages I have ſhewn, from the Authority of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the divine Approbation of, and even Command for erecting the Temple for public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:—I have ſhewn what a Profuſion of Coſt and Pains was expended in furniſhing it with decent Ornaments, and in erecting
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009424_0036_0F743BE9FB560C58"/>
in it ſuitable Inſtruments of Muſick, with which to aſſiſt in the Worſhip of GOD: And thus much I am warranted to aſſert from the <hi>New,</hi> that, as our LORD and his Apoſtles are often ſaid to have made Uſe of this very Temple for the Performance of divine Service therein, it evidences, to a Demonſtration, his continued Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Place, and of the decent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which it was decorated: Nor will any reaſonable Man preſume to ſay, that the coſtly and magnificent <hi>Organ,</hi> which had been erected therein for divine Worſhip from the moſt early Dedication of that ſacred Edifice to the Service of GOD, had been pulled down on the Approach of the Saviour of the World, or was for ever after ſilent. Had this actually been the Caſe, it would have been too remarkable an Incident to have been paſſed over in Silence by the ſacred Penmen: On the contrary, our Lord's Veneration for it roſe ſo high, as to induce him to whip the Profaners of it hence; in which Act he brings a Quotation from the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to ſhew the original In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of that ſacred Edifice:—<q>It is written, ſays he, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lvi. 7. and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> vii. 11. My Houſe ſhall be called the Houſe of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009424_0037_0F743BEADD203128"/>
Thieves;</q> but we have not the leaſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from hence to infer that he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pull down, deface, alter, or render uſeleſs any the moſt minute Article of its Contents: Nor do we find a ſingle Text in the Whole of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſallowing the Uſe of Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God; which plainly demonſtrates, that ſuch Things were not only continued in Uſe, but were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of and allow'd as heretofore. And this ſeems ſo plainly to be the Caſe, that it might be eſteemed a Reproach to human Reaſon to uſe more Arguments to evince its Utility, ſeeing the univerſal Reception it has met with from all thinking People, in all Ages of the World, and in all Places, manifeſtly evidences, that it is entirely ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, proportionate, and agreeable to the general Conception and Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>I DOUBT not but I ſhall be condemned by ſome of my Readers for having expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed myſelf with too much Warmth on this Subject; and by others for having omitted ſaving many Things which the Authority of Holy Writ gives me a ſufficient Warrant to have urg'd:—As to the firſt, the Inſtances
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009424_0038_0F743BEC63980F80"/>
I daily ſee, or am creditably inform'd of, join'd to the Good-will I bear to Mankind in general, would not permit me to be more cool:—And as to the other, I thought it proper to leave the ſtrongeſt Part of the Argument to the reverend Clergy, who can beſt handle it, and whoſe Province it is:— Certainly there is nothing more demands their preſent Care, or would teſtify their Zeal for the Well-being and Promotion of Religion in the World.</p>
            <p>THE Worſt, however, that can be ſaid of this Attempt is, that it is the Overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Heart ſincere and ardent for the Happineſs of Society in general, and of that of which I am a Member in particular.</p>
