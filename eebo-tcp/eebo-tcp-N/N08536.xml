            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE GROUND AND NATURE OF Chriſtian Redemption.</head>
            <p>THE Fall of man into the life and ſtate of This World, is the Whole Ground of his Redemption; and a Real Birth of CHRIST in the ſoul, is the Whole Nature of it. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince man of his Fall as the Ground of his Redemption, it is not neceſſary to appeal to the hiſtory which Moſes has given of it; becauſe Moſes's hiſtory of the Fall is not the proof of it, and becauſe a meer hiſtorical knowledge of the Fall would not do man any real good. Moſes has recorded the death of the firſt man, and of many of his deſcendents; but the proof that man is Mortal, lies not in Moſes's hiſtory, but in the known nature of man, and the world from which he has his life. Thus, tho' Moſes has recorded the time and manner of the Fall, yet there is no more occaſion to have recourſe to his hiſtory to prove it, than to prove that man is a poor weak, vain, diſtreſſed, corrupt, depraved, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, ſelf-tormenting, periſhing creature; and that the world is a ſad mixture of imaginary
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010918_0003_0F8528F3D9B35880"/>
good, and real evil, a mere ſcene of vanity, vexation, and miſery. This is the known na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition both of man and the world; and every man is in himſelf an irreſiſtible proof that he is in a fallen ſtate. An attempt therefore, to convince man of his Fall, as the Ground of his Redemption, muſt be an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do that which misfortunes, ſickneſs, pain, and the approach of death, have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency to do, to convince him of the Vanity, Poverty, and Miſery of his Life and Condition in this World; and how impoſſible it is, that a GOD, Who has nothing in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but Infinite Goodneſs and Infinite Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould bring forth a race of intelligent creatures, that have neither Natural Goodneſs, nor Natural Happineſfs.</p>
            <p>Man, in his Firſt State, as he came forth from GOD, muſt have been abſolutely free from all Vanity, Want or Diſtreſs, of any kind, from any thing either within or without him: a God-like perfection of Nature, and a painful Diſtreſſed Nature, ſtand in the utmoſt Contrariety to one another. But man has loſt his Firſt Divine Life in GOD: every thing that we know of God, and every thing that we know of man, of his birth, his life, and death, is a continual irreſiſtible proof that man is in a fallen ſtate. The human infant juſt come out of the womb, is a picture of ſuch defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, nakedneſs, weakneſs, and helpleſs diſtreſs, as is not to be found amongſt the home-born animals of this world. The chicken has its birth
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010918_0004_0F8528F4B4C57DB0"/>
from no ſin, and, therefore, comes torth in beauty; it runs and pecks, as ſoon as its ſhell is broken: the calf and the lamb go both to play as foon as the dam is delivered of them; they are pleaſed with themſelves, and pleaſe the eye that beholds their frolick ſtate, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cloathing: whilſt the new-born babe of a woman, that is to have an upright form; that is to view the heavens, and worſhip the GOD that made them; lies, for months, in groſs ignorance, weakneſs, and impurity; as ſad a ſpectacle when he firſt breathes the life of this world, as when in the agonies of death he breathes his laſt. What is all this, but the ſtrongſt proof, that man is the only creature that belongs not to this world, but is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it through ſin, and that, therefore, his birth, in ſuch diſtreſs, bears all theſe marks of ſhame and weakneſs? Had he been originally of this world, this world would have done the higheſt honour to its higheſt creature; and he muſt have begun his life in greater perfection than any other animal, and brought with him a more beautiful cloathing than the fineſt lillies of the field. But when the human infant has at length acquired ſtrength, and begins to act for himſelf, he ſoon becomes a more pitiable object than when crying in the cradle. The ſtrength of his life, is a meer ſtrength of wild paſſions; his reaſon is craft and ſelfiſh ſubtilty; he loves and hates only as fleſh and blood prompt him; and jails and gibbets cannot keep
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010918_0005_0F8528F516B62DB0"/>
him from theft and murder. If he is rich, he is tormented with pride and ambition; if poor with want and diſcontent: be he which he will, ſooner or later, diſordered paſſions, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſts, fruitleſs labour, pains and ſickneſs, will tear him from this world, in ſuch travail as his mother felt, when ſhe brought forth the ſinful animal. Now all this evil and miſery are the natural and neceſſary effect of his birth in the beſtial fleſh and blood of this world; and there is nothing in his natural ſtate, that can put a ſtop to it; he muſt be evil and miſerable as long as he has only the life of this world in him. Therefore, the abſolute certainty of man's Fall, and the abſolute Neceſſity of a New Birth to redeem him, are truths, independentl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y of Scripture, plain to a demonstration.</p>
            <p>No creature can come from the hands of GOD, into a State of any Ignorance of any thing that is proper to be known by it: this is as impoſſible, as for GOD to have an envious or evil will. Now all Right and Natural Knowledge, in whatever creature it is, is Senſible, Intuitive, and its own Evidence; and Opinion Reaſoning, or Doubting, can only then begin, when the creature has loſt its Firſt Right and Natural State, and is got ſomewhere, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſomewhat, that it cannot tell what to make of. Reaſoning, Doubt and Perplexity, in any creature, are the effect of ſome Fall or Departure from its Firſt State of Nature; and ſhew, that it wants, and is ſeeking, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010918_0006_0F8528F5D6D352A0"/>
that belongs to its Nature, but knows how to come at it. The beaſts ſeek not after Truth; a plain proof that it has no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, no Suitableneſs to their Nature, nor ever belonged to them. Man is in queſt of it, in perplexity about it, cannot come at it; takes lies to be Truth, and Truth to be lies: a plain proof, both that he has it not, and yet has had it; was created in it, and for it: for no creature can feek for any thing, but that which has been loſt, and is wanted; nor could man form the leaſt idea of it, but becauſe it has belonged to him and ought to be his.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe man to come into the world, with this Chief difference from other creatures, that he is at a loſs to find out what he is, how he is to live, and what he is to ſeek as his Chief Happineſs; what he is to own of a GOD, of Providence, Religion, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>; ſuppoſe him to have Faculties that put him upon this Search, and no Faculties that can ſatisfy his Inquiry; and what can we ſuppoſe more miſerable in himſelf, and more unworthy of a GOOD CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR? Therefore, if we will not ſuppoſe, that GOD has been good to all creatures, and given every animal its Proper Light of Nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Man; we muſt be forced to own, that man has loſt the True Light and Perfection of his Nature which GOD at firſt gave him.</p>
            <p>GOD is in Himfelf, Infinite Truth, Infinite Goodneſs, and Infinite Happineſs; but man, in his preſent earthly birth and life, has neither
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010918_0007_0F8528F6A8F18D58"/>
Truth, Goodneſs, nor Happineſs: therefore, his Preſent State of Life could not be brought, forth by that GOD, Who is all Truth, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Happineſs. Thus every man, that believes in a Creator Infinitely Perfect, is under a Neceſſity of believing the Whole Ground of CHRISTIAN REDEMPTION, namely, that man has loſt that Perfection of life which he had at firſt from his Creator.</p>
            <p>Had not a Divine Life at firſt been in man, he would be now at the fame diſtance from Truth and Goodneſs, and as incapable of forming the leaſt Thought or Deſire of them, as the beaſts of the field; and would have nothing to do, but to look to himſelf, live to his earthly nature, and make the moſt of this world; for this is all the Wiſdom and Goodneſs that an Earthly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of, whether it be a man, or a fox. The certainty of the fact, of man's Firſt Divine Life is all; nothing more need be enquired after: for on This Ground ſtands all his Comfort; hence it is, that in Faith and Hope he can look up to GOD as his Father, to Heaven as his Native Country, and on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a ſtranger and a pilgrim upon earth.</p>
            <p>For it is a certain truth, that fallen earthly, and corrupt, as human nature is, there is, in the ſoul of every man, the Fire, and Light, and Love of GOD, tho' lodged in a ſtate of hiddenneſs and inactivity, till ſomething human or Divine, Diſtreſs, or Grace, or both, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its life vithin us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010918_0008_0F8528F7782886A0"/>We were no more created to be in the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Burdens, and Anguiſh of this earthly Life, than the Angels were created to be in the Wrath and Darkneſs of Hell. It is as contrary to the Will and Goodneſs of GOD towards us, that we are out of Paradiſe, as it is contrary to The Deſigns and Goodneſs of GOD towards the Angels, that ſome of them are out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven prisoners of darkneſs. How abſurd and even blaſphemous would it be, to ſay, with the Church and the Scriptures, that <q>we are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath, and Born in Sin</q> if we had That Nature, which GOD at firſt gave us? What a reproach upon GOD, to ſay, that this world is a valley of miſery, a ſhadow of death, full of diſorders, ſorrows, and temptations, if This was an Original Creation, or That State of things for which God created us? It is not as conſiſtent with the Goodneſs of GOD, to ſpeak of the miſery and diſorder that Holy Angels find above, and of the Sorrows and Vanity of their Heavenly State, as to ſpeak of the miſery of men and the ſorrows and vanities of this world, if men and the world were in That Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in which GOD at firſt had placed them? If GOD could make any place Poor and Vain, and create any beings into a State of Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, he might do ſo in all Places, and to All Beings.</p>
            <p>The Fall of man, therefore, into the life of this earthly World, is the Sole Ground of his wanting the Redemption which the Goſpel offers. Hence it is, that The Goſpel has only
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010918_0009_0F8528F8C5D6BC58"/>
One ſimple propoſal of Certain Life, or Certain Death, to Man: of Life, if he will take the means of entering into The Kingdom of GOD; of Death, if he chuſes to take up his Reſt in The Kingdom of this World. This is the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Nature and Sole Drift of The Goſpel: it means no more, than making known to man, that this World, and the Life of it, is his Fall and Separation from God and Happineſs both here and hereafter; and that to be ſaved, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to GOD and Happineſs, can only be obtained, by renouncing all Love and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Things of This World. All the Precepts, Threatenings and Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, mean nothing, but to drive All Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs and Carnal Affections out of the ſoul; to call man from the Life, Spirit, and Goods of This World, to a Life of Faith and Hope, and Love, and Defire, of a New Birth from Heaven.</p>
            <p>To embrace The Goſpel, is to enter, with all our hearts, into its terms of dying to All that is Earthly, both within us and without us: and, on the other hand, to place our Faith, and Hope, and Truſt, and Satisfaction, in the Things of this World; is to reject the Goſpel with our whole heart, ſpirit, and ſtrength, as much as any Infidel can do, notwithſtanding we make ever ſo many verbal aſſents to every thing that is recorded in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>This, therefore, is the one, true eſſential Diſtinction, betwen the Chriſtian and the Infidel.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010918_0010_0F8528F8DE4CD600"/>
The Infidel is a man of This World; wholly devoted to it; his hope and Faith are ſet upon it; for where our Heart is, there, and there only, are our hope and Faith: he has only ſuch a Virtue, ſuch a Goodneſs, and ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as entirely ſuits with the intereſts of fleſh and blood, and keeps the ſoul happy in <q>
                  <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of life.</hi>
               </q> This, and this alone, is Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; a Total Separation from GOD, and a Removal of all Faith and Hope from HIM, into the Life of This World. It matters not, whether this Infidel be a Profeſſor of the Goſpel, a Diſciple of Zoroaſter, a Follower of Plato, a Jew, a Turk, or an Oppoſer of the Goſpel Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: this Difference of Opinions or Profeſſions alters not the matter; it is the Love of the World inſtead of GOD, that conſtitutes the Whole Nature of the Infidel.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Chriſtian renounces the world as his Horrid Priſon; he dies to the will of fleſh and blood, becauſe it is Darkneſs, Corruption and Separation from GOD; he turns from all that is earthly, animal, and temporal, and ſtands in a continual Tendency of Faith, and Hope, and Prayer to GOD, to have a better Nature, a better Life and Spirit, born again into him from above.</p>
            <p>Where this Faith is, there is the Chriſtian, <q>
                  <hi>The New Creature in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>born of the Word and Spirit of GOD:</hi>
               </q> neither time nor place, nor any outward condition of birth and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010918_0011_0F8528F996D7EE50"/>
life, can hinder his Entrance into the Kingdom of GOD. But where this Faith is not, there is the True Compleat Infidel, "<hi>The Man of Earth,</hi>" the Unredeemed, the Rejecter of the Goſpel, "<hi>the Son of Perdition,</hi>" that is <q>
                  <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, without</hi> CHRIST, <hi>an Alien from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Covenants of promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the World.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Men are apt to conſider a Worldly Spirit only as an infirmity, or pardonable failure; but it is, indeed, The Great Apoſtaſy from GOD and the Divine Life: it is not a Single Sin, but the Whole Nature of All Sin; that leaves no poſſibility of coming out of our fallen ſtate, till it be totally renounced with all the ſtrength of our hearts.</p>
            <p>Our LORD ſays, <q>
                  <hi>there is but One that is Good and that is GOD.</hi>
               </q> In the ſame ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of expreſſion it muſt be ſaid, "There is but One Life that is Good, and that is THE LIFE OF GOD AND HEAVEN:" Depart, in the leaſt degree, from the Goodneſs of GOD, and you depart into evil; becauſe nothing is good, but His Goodneſs. Chooſe any life, but THE LIFE OF GOD AND HEAVEN, and you chooſe Death; for Death is nothing elſe but the Loſſ of THE LIFE OF GOD. The creatures of this world, have but one life, and one good; and that is the life of this world; eternal beings have but one life, and one good; and that is THE LIFE OF GOD The ſpirit of the ſoul is

in itſelf nothing elſe but a Spirit breathed forth from GOD, that The Life of GOD, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD, The Working of GOD, The Tempers of GOD, might be manifeſted in it. GOD could not create man to have a will of his own, and a life of his own, different from the Life and Will that is in Himſelf: this is more impoſſible than for a good tree to bring forth corrupt fruit. GOD can only delight in His Own Life, His Own Goodneſs, and His Own Perfections; and, therefore, cannot love, or delight, or dwell, in any Creatures, but where His Own Goodneſs and Perfections are to be found: like can only unite with like, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with heaven, and hell with hell; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, THE LIFE OF GOO muſt be the Life of the ſoul, if the ſoul is to unite with GOD. Hence it is, that All the Religion of fallen man, All the Methods of our Redemption, have only this One End, to take from us That Strange and Earthly Life we have gotten by the Fall, and to kindle again THE LIFE OF GOD AND HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN in our ſouls: not to deliver us from that groſs and fordid vice called Covetouſneſs, which Heathens can condemn; but to take The Spirit of This World entirely from us.</p>
            <p>This Spirit is the Whole Nature and Miſery of our Fall; it keeps our ſouls in a ſtate of Death; and, as long as it governs, makes it impoſſible for us to be "<hi>Bom again from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi>" It is the greateſt Blindneſs and Darkneſs of our nature, and keeps us in the groſſeſt Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010918_0013_0F8528FCA33054D0"/>
both of heaven and hell; for tho' they are both of them within us, yet we feel neither, while the Spirit of this World reigns in us. Light, and Truth, and the Goſpel, ſo far as they concern Eternity, are all empty founds to the Worldly Spirit: his own good, and his own evil, govern all his hopes and fears; and, therefore, he can have no religion, or be farther concerned in it, than ſo far as it can be made ſerviceable to the Life of This World: he can know nothing of GOD; for he can know nothing, feel nothing, taſte nothing, delight in nothing, but with earthly ſenſes, and after an earthly manner. <q>
                  <hi>The Natural Man,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Things of</hi> THE SPIRIT OF GOD; <hi>they are fooliſhneſs unto him: he cannot know them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned,</hi>
               </q> that is, they can only be diſcerned by That Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which he hath not: he can only contemplate them, as things foreign to himſelf; as ſo many changeable ideas, which he receives from books, or hearſay, and which become a bad nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his natural tempers: he is proud of his ability to diſcourſe about them, and loſes all Humility, all Love of GOD and man, thro' a vain and haughty contention for them. He ſtands at the ſame diſtance from a living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Truth, as the man, that is born blind, does from a living perception of Light; Light muſt firſt be the birth of his own life, before he can enter into a real knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:010918_0014_0F8528FD75EAB818"/>The meaſure of our Life, is the meaſure of our knowledge; and as the Spirit of our Life worketh, ſo the ſpirit of our underſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth. If our Will worketh with GOD, tho' our natural capacity be ever ſo mean and narrow, we get a real knowledge of GOD, and Heavenly Truths; for every thing muſt feel that, in which it lives. But if our Will worketh with Satan, and The Spirit of This World, let our parts be ever ſo bright, our imaginations ever ſo ſoaring; yet all our Living Knowledge can go no higher or deeper, than the myſteries or iniquity, and the luſts of fleſh and blood. For nothing feels, or taſtes, or underſtands, or likes, or diſlikes, but The Life that is in us: The Spirit that leads our Life, is The Spirit that forms our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The mind is our eye, and all the faculties of the mind fee every thing according to The State the mind is in. If Selfiſh Pride is The Spirit of our Life, every thing is only ſeen, and known, through this glaſs; every thing is dark, ſenſeleſs, and abſurd, to the Proud Man, but that which brings food to This Spirit: he underſtands nothing, feels nothing, taſtes nothing, but as his Pride is made ſenſible of it, or capable of being affected with it. His Working Will, which is The Life of his ſoul liveth and worketh only in the Element of Pride; and, therefore, what ſuits his Pride, is his only good; and what contradicts his Pride, is all the evil that he can feel or know: his wit, his parts,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010918_0015_0F8528FE1A4455B0"/>
his learning, his advancement, his friends, his admirers, his ſucceſſes, his conqueſts, all theſe are the Only God and Heaven, that he has any Living Perception of: he indeed can talk of a Scripture God, a Scripture Chriſt, and Heaven; but theſe are only the ornamental furniture of his brain, whilſt Pride is the God of his heart. We are told that <q>
                  <hi>GOD reſiſteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi>
               </q> This is not to be underſtood, as if GOD by an arbitrary will, only choſe to deal thus with the Proud and Humble man. But the true ground is this: The Reſiſtance is on the Part of man. Pride reſiſteth GOD, it rejecteth Him, it turneth from Him, and chooſeth to worſhip and adore ſomething elſe inſtead of Him: whereas Humility leaveth all for GOD., falls down before him, and opens the whole heart to receive Him. This is the only ſenſe, in which <q>
                  <hi>GOD reſiſteth the proud and giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi>
               </q> And thus it is in the true ground of every Good and Evil that riſes up in us; we have neither Good nor Evil, but as it is the Natural Effect of the working of our Own Will, either with, or againſt God. Conſider the ſtate of him, whoſe Working Will is under the Power of Wrath; he fees and hears, and feels, and underſtands, and talks, wholly from the Light and Senſe of Wrath. All his faculties are only ſo many faculties of Wrath; and he has no ſenſe or knowledge, but what his enlightened Wrath diſcovers to him. Theſe inſtances
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010918_0016_0F8528FED7CE0650"/>
are ſufficient to ſhew, that The State of our Life governs the ſtate of our mind, and forms the degree and manner of our underſtanding and knowledge; and that, therefore, there is no poſſibility of knowing GOD and Divine Truths, till our Life is Divine, and wholly dead to The Life and Sprit of This World.</p>
            <p>The philoſophers of old began all their Virtue, in a total Renunciation of the Spirit of this World. They ſaw, with the eyes of Heaven, that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not more contrary to light, than The Wiſdom of This World was contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Virtue: therefore, they allowed of no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Virtue, but ſo far as a man had overcome himſelf, and The Spirit of This World. This gave a Divine ſolidity to all their inſtructions, and proved them to be maſters of True Wiſdom. But the doctrine of THE CROSS OF CHRIST, the laft, the higheſt, the finiſhing ſtroke given to the Spirit of This World, that ſpeaks more in One Word than all the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of voluminous writers; is yet profeſſed by thoſe, who are in more friendſhip with The World, than was allowed to the diſciples of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, or Epidetus.</p>
            <p>Nay, if thoſe antient ſages were to ſtart up amongſt us with their Divine Wiſdom, they would bid fair to be treated by the Sons of the Goſpel, if not by fome Fathers of the Church, as dreaming enthuſiaſts. But it is a ſtanding truth, that <q>The World can only love its own, and Wiſdom can only be juſtified of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q> The Heaven-born Epictetus told one
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010918_0017_0F8528FFA75BED80"/>
of his ſcholars, that <q>then he might firſt look upon himſelf, as having made ſome true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Virtue, when the World took him for a fool;</q> an oracle like that, which ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>The Wiſdom of This World is Fooliſhneſs with</hi> GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If it be aſked, what is the Apoſtasy of theſe laſt times, or whence is the Degeneracy of the present Chriſtian Church, it is all the progeny of a Worldly Spirit. If here we ſee open wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, there only forms of godlineſs; if here ſuperficial holineſs, political piety, crafty pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there haughty fancity, partial zeal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious orthodoxy: if almoſt every where we find a Jewish blindneſs, and hardneſs of heart; and the Church trading with the Gospel as viſibly as the old Jews bought and fold beaſts in their Temple: all this is only ſo many forms and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fruits, of the Worldly Spirit. This is the great chain with which the Devil enſlaves man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and every ſon of man is held captive in it, till through, and by, THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST he breaks from it. Nothing elſe can deliver him from it: nothing leaves the World, nothing renounces it, nothing can possibly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it, but THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST. Hence it is, that many learned men, with all the rich furniture of their brain, live and die ſlaves to The Spirit of This World; and can only differ from groſs worldlings, as the Scribes and Phariſees differed from publicans and ſinners: it is because THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010918_0018_0F852900700384E8"/>
is not the One Only Thing that is the Deſire of their hearts; and, therefore, their learning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works in and with The Spirit of This World, and becomes itſelf no ſmall part of the <q>Vanity of vanities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Nothing does, or can, keep GOD out of the ſoul, or hinder His Holy Union with it, but its desire turned from him:</q> for with whatever the Will worketh, with that only the ſoulliveth, whether it be GOD or the creature. Whatever the ſoul deſireth, that is the fewel of its fire; and as its fewel is, so is the flame of its Life. A will given up to earthly enjoyments is at graſs with Nebuchadnezzar, and has One Life with the beaſts of the field; for Earthly Deſires keep up the Same Life in a man and an ox. For the one only reaſon, why the animals of this world have no ſenſe or knowledge of GOD, is because they cannot form any other than Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſires, and ſo can only have an Earthly Life: when, therefore, a man wholly turneth his Will to Earthly Deſires, he dies to the excellency of his natural ſtate, and may be ſaid only to live, and move, and have his being in The Life of This World, as the beaſts have. Earthly food, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> only desired, and uſed, for the support of the earthly body, is ſuitable to man's preſent condition, and the order of nature: but when the Deſire and Delight of the ſoul are ſet upon Earthly Things, the humanity is degraded, is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from GOD, and The Life of the Soul is made as earthly and beſtial, as the Life of the body,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010918_0019_0F85290116415B70"/>
for the creature can be neither higher or lower, neither better nor worſe than as its Will work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. What it deſireth, that it taketh; and of that it eateth and liveth : wherever, and in whatever, the Will choſeth to dwell and delight, that becometh the ſoul's Food, its Condition, its Body, its Cloathing, and Habitation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth, or can, go with a man into heaven, nothing followeth him into hell, but that in which the Will dwelt, with which it was fed, nouriſhed, and cloathed, in This Life. Death can make no Alteration of This State of the Will: it only takes off the outward, worldly, covering of fleſh and blood, and forces the ſoul to fee, and feel, and know, what a Life, what a State, Food, Body, and Habitation, its own Working Will has brought forth for it. Is there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, any thing in Life that deſerves a thought, but how to keep this Working of our Will in a Right State; and to get that Purity of Heart, which alone can fee, and know, and find, and poſſeſs GOD? Is there any thing ſo frightful as This Worldly Spirit, which turns the ſoul from GOD; makes it a Houſe of Darkneſs; and feeds it with the Food of Time, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of All the Riches of Eternity?</p>
            <p>Now as the Whole Nature of the Gospel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption means nothing, but the one, true and only poſſible Way, of delivering man from All the Evil of his Fall — a Fall demonſtrable to the ſenſes and understanding of every man, by every height and depth of nature, by every kind of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010918_0020_0F8529021D1C4540"/>
evil ſin and miſery in this world, by every thing he knows of GOD, himſelf, and the world he lives in; Chriſtianity is not only the moſt deſireable thing that the heart of man can think of, but the moſt intelligible, and even ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. It requires not the aid of learning for its ſupport; it ſtands upon a Foundation ſuperiour to Human Learning, and may be the Sure Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of every Plain Man, who has ſenſe enough to know, whether he is happy or unhappy, good or evil. For this natural knowledge, is adhered to, is every man's Sure Guide to that One Salvation preached by the Goſpel; which Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſtands in no more need or Learning and Critical Art now, than it did when CHRIſT was preaching it upon earth. How abſurd would it have been for any Critics in Greek and Hebrew, to have followed Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as neceſſary explainers of their Words, which called for nothing in the hearers, but Penitent Hearts turned to GOD; and declared, that " <hi>They only who, were of GOD, could bear the Word of GOD!</hi>" If none but Learned men have the True Fitneſs to underſtand the Word of Scripture, and the Plain man is to receive it from them; how muſt he know, which are the Scholars that have the Right Knowledge? Whence is he to have his information? For no one need be told, that, ever ſince Learning has born rule in the church, Learned Doctors have contradicted and condemned each other, in every Eſſential Point of the Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010918_0021_0F852902A06C4330"/>
thouſands of Learned men tell the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they are loſt in this or that Church; and thouſands or Learned men tell them, they are loſt if they leave it. If, therefore, Chriſtianity is in the Hands of Scholars, how muſt the Plain man come at it? Muſt he, though unable to underſtand Scripture for want of Learning, tell which Learned man is in the right, and which is not? If ſo, the Unlearned man muſt have far the greateſt Ability, ſince he is to do That for Scholars, which they cannot do for Themſelves.</p>
            <p>But Chriſtian Redemption is GOD's Mercy to All mankind: and every Fallen man, as ſuch, has a Fitneſs of Capacity to lay hold of it. It has no dependence upon times and places, or the ages and ſeveral conditions of the world, or any outward circumſtance of life; as the Firſt man partook of it, ſo muſt the Laſt: the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Linguiſt, the blind, the deaf and dumb, have but One and the Same Common Way of finding Life in it; and he that writes large commentaries upon the Bible, muſt be faved by Something full as different from book know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as he who can neither write nor read.</p>
            <p>For This Salvation, which is GOD's mercy to the Fallen Soul of man, merely as Fallen, muſt be Something that meets every man; and to which every man, as Fallen, has Something that directs him to turn. For as the Fall of man is the Reaſon of his mercy, ſo the Fall muſt be the Guide to it: the Want muſt ſhew the Thing that is wanted. And, therefore,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010918_0022_0F85290355B5C8F8"/>
The Manifeſtation of this One Salvation, of Mercy to man, muſt have a Nature ſuitable, not to this or that great Reader of Hiſtory, or able Critic in Hebrew Roots or Greek Phraſes, but ſuitable to the Common State and Condition of every Son of Adam. It muſt be Something as grounded in human nature, as the Fall itfelf is; which wants no Art to make it known, but to which the Common Nature of man is the Sure and Only Guide, in one man as well as another. Now this Something, which is thus obvious to every man, and which opens The Way to Chriſtian Redemption in every ſoul, is <q>A Senſe of the Vanity and Miſery of this World; and a Prayer of Faith and Hope to GOD, to be raiſed to a Better State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this Senſe, to which every man's own Nature leads him, lies the Whole of man's Salvation; here the Mercy of GOD, and the Miſery of man, are met together; here the Fall and the Redemption kiſs each other. This is the Chriſtianity which is as old as the Fall; which alone faved the Firſt man, and can alone ſave the Laſt. This is it, on which hang all the Law and the Prophets, and which fulfils them both; for they have only this End, to turn man from the Luſts of this Life, to a Deſire and Faith, and Hope of a better. Thus does the Whole of Chriſtian Redemption, conſidered on the part of man, ſtand in the ſame Degree of Nearneſs and Plainneſs to All Mankind: it is as ſimple and plain, as the Feeling our Own
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010918_0023_0F85290771B9D7D8"/>
Evil and Miſery and as natural, as the Deſire of being ſaved and delivered from it.</p>
            <p>This Deſire and Faith and Hope of A NEW LIFE BORN OF GOD, as our only poſſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation, is The Spirit of Prayer, that is as oppoſite to the Spirit of This World as Heaven is to hell: the one goes upwards with the Same Strength as the other goes downwards; the one eſpouſes and unites us to CHRIST and GOD, with the Same Certainty, as the other betrothsand weds us to an Earthly Nature. The Spirit of Prayer is a preſſing forth of this ſoul out of this Earthly Life; it is a ſtretching, with all its Deſire, after THE LIFE OF GOD; it is a leaving, as far as it can, All its Own Spirit, to receive a Spirit from above, to be One Life, One Love, One Spirit, with CHRIST IN GOD. This Prayer, which is an emptying itſelf of all its Own luſts and natural tempers, and an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf for The Light and Love of GOD to enter into it, is the Prayer in "<hi>The Name of</hi> CHRIST," to which nothing is denied: for The Love which GOD bears to the ſoul, His Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Never-ceaſing Deſire to enter into it, to dwell in it, and open The Birth of His Holy WORD and SPIRIT in it, ſtays no longer, than till the heart opens to receive Him. For <q>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing does, or can, keep GOD out of the ſoul, or hinder His Holy Union with it, but the Deſire of the Heart turned from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What, therefore, is ſo neceſſary for man, as, with all his Strength, to turn from every thing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010918_0024_0F85290827A790C8"/>
is not GOD, and His Holy Will; and with All the Deſire, Delight, and Longing of the Heart, to give up himſelf wholly to The Life, Light, and Spirit of God; pleaſed with nothing in This World, but as it gives time, and place and occaſions of doing and being That, which his Heavenly Father would have him to do, and be; ſeeking for no Happineſs from this earthly fallen Life, but That of Overcoming All its Spirit and Tempers?</p>
            <p>To conclude: In the full and true knowledge of The Greatneſs of our Fall, and The Greatneſs of our Redemption, lie all the reaſons of a deep Humility, Penitence and Self-denial; and alſo all the motives and incitements to a moſt hearty, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and total Converſion to GOD: and every one is neceſſarily more or leſs a True Penitent, and more or leſs Truly Converted to GOD, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he is more or leſs deeply or inwardly Senſible of theſe Truths. And till theſe two great Truths have both awakened and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened our minds, all Reformation and pretence to Amendment, is but a dead and ſuperficial thing, a mere garment of hypocriſy, to hide us from ourſelves and others.</p>
            <p>Nothing can truly awaken a ſinner, but a True Senſe of the Deep Poſſeſſion and Power that Sin has in him. When he ſees, that Sin begins with his Being, that it riſes up in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of his Nature, and lives in the Firſt Forms of his Life; and that he lies thus chained and barred up in the very jaws of death and hell, as unable to alter his own State as to create another
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010918_0025_0F852909910EAB30"/>
creature: when, with this knowledge, he ſees that the Free Grace of GOD has provided him a Remedy equal to his Diſtreſs; that he has given him the Holy Blood and Life of JESUS CHRIST, the True Son of GOD, to enter as deep into his Soul as Sin has entered, to change the Firſt Forms and Eſſences of his Life, and bring forth in them a New Birth of a Divine Nature, that is to be an Immortal Image of THE HOLY TRINITY, everlaſtingly ſafe, enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bleſſed, in the Boſom of FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST; when a man once feelſ theſe two Truths, there ſeems to be no more that you need do for him. You can tell him of no Humility and Penitence, and Self-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but what is leſs than his own heart ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts to him: Humility can only be feigned or falſe, before this Conviction: he can now no more take any degree of Good to himſelf, than aſſume any Share in the creation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and all Pride or Self-eſteem of any kind, ſeems to him to contain as great a Lye in it, as if he was to ſay, that he helped to create himſelf.</p>
            <p>You need not tell him, that he muſt turn unto GOD with <q>
                  <hi>all his Strength, all his Heart, all his Soul, and all his Spirit</hi>;</q> for all that he can offer unto GOD, ſeems to him already leſs than the leaſt of His Mercies towards him. He has ſo ſeen The Exceeding Love of GOD in the Manner and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his Redemption, that it would be the greateſt pain to him, to do any thing but upon a motive of Divine Love: as his ſoul has found GOD to be All Love;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010918_0026_0F85290A25908FD8"/>
ſo it has but one Deſire, and that is, to be itſelf All Love of GOD.</p>
            <p>This is the Conviction and Converſion that neceſſarily ariſes from a right underſtanding of theſe Truths: the ſoul is thereby wholly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to GOD; and can like, or love, or do nothing, but what it can, ſome way or other, turn into a Service of love towards Him: but where theſe Truths are not known, or not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; there it is not to be wondered at, if Religion has no Root, that is able to bring forth its proper Fruits. And if the Generality of Chriſtians are a number of dead, ſuperficial, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to the Hiſtory of Scripture doctrines; as unwilling to have the Spirit, as to part with the Form of their Religion, loth to hear of any kind of Self-denial, fond of Worldly Eaſe, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Riches; unwilling to be called to The Perfection of the Goſpel, profeſſing and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing Religion merely as the Faſhion and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the place they are in requires; if ſome reſt in outward Forms, others in a certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy of opinions; if ſome expect to be ſaved by the goodneſs of the Sect they are of, others by a certain change of their outward Behaviour; if ſome content themſelves with a Lukewarm Spirit, and others depend upon Their Own Works; theſe are Deluſions that muſt happen to all, who do not know, in ſome good degree, the true nature of their own Fallen Soul, and what Kind of Regeneration alone can ſave them.</p>
            <p>But all theſe errours, deluſions, and falſe reſts, are cut up by the Root, as ſoon as a man knows
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010918_0027_0F85290AE763E0A8"/>
the True Reaſon and Neceſſity of his wanting ſo Great a Saviour. For he that knows the Eſſences of his Soul to be ſo many Eſſences of Sin, which form Sin as they form his Life; entirely incapable of producing Any Good, till a Birth from GOD has ariſen in them; can neither place his Redemption where it is not, nor ſeek it cooly and negligently where it is.</p>
            <p>For knowing that it is the Hell within his own nature, that only wants to be deſtroyed, he is intent only upon bringing Deſtruction upon That; and this ſecures him from Falſe Religion.</p>
            <p>And knowing that this Inward Hell cannot be deſtroyed, unleſs GOD becomes his REDEEMER, or REGENERATOR, in the Eſſences of his ſoul; this makes him believe all, expect all, and hope all, from his Saviour JESUS CHRIST alone.</p>
            <p>And knowing, that All this Redemption, or Salvation, is to be brought about in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Ground and Depth of his Heart; this makes him always apply to GOD, as the GOD of his Heart; and, therefore, what he offers to GOD is his own Heart; and this keeps him always Spiritually alive, wholly employed and intent upon the True Work of Religion, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preparing his Heart for all the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT upon it. And ſo he is a True Inward Chriſtian, who, as our Bleſſed LORD ſpeaks has, <q>
                  <hi>"The Kingdom of GOD within him,"</hi>
               </q> where the State and Habit of his Heart continually, thankfully <q>WORSHIPS THE FATHER IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH.</q>
