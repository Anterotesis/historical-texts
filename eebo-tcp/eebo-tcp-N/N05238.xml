            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Day after this Diſcourſe was delivered, being at a Houſe where I was told it had given great Offence to ſome of the Profeſſion in Town, I happened to take up a Book, which preſented to me the following Paſſage,
<q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Apology for the Tale of the Tub. <hi>Edit.</hi> 9 <hi>Lond.</hi>
                  </note> Had the Author writ a Book to expoſe the Abuſes in Law, or in Phyſick, he believes the learned Profeſſors in either Faculty, would have been ſo far from reſenting it, as to have given him Thanks for his Pains, eſpecially if he had made an honourable Reſervation for the true Practice of either Science.</q>
Now, tho' I did not write de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly <hi>to expoſe the Abuſes in Phyſick,</hi> yet in what is accidentally hinted on that Subject, I believe it will ſcarcely be denied that I have <hi>made an honourable Reſervation for the true Practice of the Science.</hi> Neither have I ſo much as pretended to be capable of effecting any one Thing but what I have expreſly acknowledged any other duly qualified Phyſician can do likewiſe. To whom then I would deſire to know, can there be given any juſt Cauſe of Offence? The Anſwer muſt be, To none but thoſe who are conſcious of being Quacks, for a Quack, who did not believe himſelf to be one, could not take Offence, becauſe he would think himſelf poſſeſſed of thoſe Qualifications that are ſaid to be neceſſary for a Phyſician, and conſequently not affected by any Thing ſaid againſt Quackery: Nay, I ſhould imagine it would be wrong Policy even in one who know himſelf to be a Quack to take Offence, for that would be pleading guilty.</p>
            <p>HAD I indeed confin'd the Character of a Phyſician to a Graduate, or reſtricted the Method of ſtudying the Science to certain Opportunities, which every one of the Practitioners here may not have enjoy'd, the Caſe would have been different; but whatever may be my Opinion of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006617_0003_102952831FEB2480"/>
I have no where declared it; having only contended in general, that <hi>Phyſick</hi> is a Science founded on juſt and rational Principles, and that the Knowledge of theſe Principles are abſolutely neceſſary to qualify a Man for being a ſafe practical Phyſician. Whoever is poſſeſſed of the neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, let him come by them which Way he will, and whether he has a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploma</hi> or not (for it muſt be owned a <hi>Diploma</hi> is often eaſily and undeſervedly obtained) is to all Intents and Purpoſes, in the Senſe I have uſed the Term, a duly qualified Phyſician: And whoever has them not, be his Pretenſions what they will, is a Quack. 'Tis true, I have hinted, that this Matter is for the moſt Part too ſlightly examined into, and unqualified Perſons too often truſted in <hi>America</hi>; but this is ſo notorious a Truth, that it is almoſt in every Body's Mouth; and I never met with a Practitioner in <hi>America,</hi> even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the loweſt Claſs of them I ever convers'd with, but what would freely own it. At preſent, therefore, ſeeing there is no juſt Cauſe of Offence given, tho' I have been frequently told great Offence has been taken, yet not being certain of it, having only heard it in general without any Names, I muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it either a falſe Rumour, or that thoſe who are offended, did not hear the Diſcourſe, and have had a wrong Repreſentation of the Matter given them, which they will be convinced of upon ſeeing the Piece itſelf.</p>
            <p>BUT as the Manner this Performance came to be uſher'd into the World, was ſomething uncommon in theſe Parts, I muſt beg Leave to be a little more particular concerning it.</p>
            <p>IT is a Thing very well known, that in all Places ſet apart for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Education, publick Orations on phyſical Subjects, as well as on any other Branch of natural Knowledge, are exceeding common. Yet in Reality the Diſcourſe was not originally writ with that View, for I had actually finiſhed what I intended for the Publick on the Subject, before I had any Thoughts of delivering it as a publick Oration. But reflecting there was an Academy newly erected here, and finding the Length of the Diſcourſe would ſuit ſuch a Deſign, I thought there would be nothing amiſs in deſiring the Preſident, if he approv'd of it, to propoſe it to the Truſtees, which was accordingly done and agreed to without any Objection, as I was informed both by the Preſident, and other of the Truſtees. The Novelty of the Thing, however, I underſtand, affords Matter of Sneer to <hi>ſome few,</hi> who, perhaps, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to own the true Motives of their Diſapprobation. But whatever theſe may be, I am quite eaſy under the Conſciouſneſs of having meant well.</p>
            <p>AS ſome late Miſcarriages in Inoculation, tho' but very few, had ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd many People about a Practice, which I was firmly perſuaded in my own Mind, was of the moſt ſalutary Nature, I thought it my Duty to give
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:006617_0004_1029528507A686D0"/>
a State of my Opinion to the Publick, together with the Reaſons of it, in hopes that what had convinced me, might poſſibly convince others: Beſides this, I conceived I had ſomething new and uſeful to offer, at leaſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the common Methods of Management: And ſeeing theſe Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a Diſtemper at preſent in this Place, I cannot think unprejudiced People will judge it unſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>WHAT is interſperſed concerning the Qualifications of a Phyſician, and the Abuſes of the Practice of Phyſick, fell naturally in my Way, and are pointed at no particular Perſon living, as the Diſcourſe itſelf, which is printed <hi>verbatim</hi> as it was delivered, will plainly ſhow, whatever Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations may have been ſpread to the contrary. If theſe Things be true, ſeeing the Welfare of Mankind is concerned in the Diſpute, it could never be wrong to mention them: If any Man thinks them falſe, he has a Right to make it appear, the Preſs is free. For my own Part, I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be open to Conviction, and ready to acknowledge my Error in the ſame publick Way I have committed it, or to give my Reaſons in Reply, if I ſhould not be convinced. This I imagine is the fair Way of ſettling a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that ſo nearly concerns the Publick; for moſt certainly, who is or is not qualified to be entruſted with the Management of the Sick, is a Matter of no ſmall Importance to every Community. Any other Method of condemning what is ſaid relating to that Affair, whether by low invidious Inſinuations, to raiſe Clamour and Prejudice againſt the Author, which is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Gentlemen; or by pretending with an Air of Conſequence and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Abilities, it was not worth While to confute it (a very common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence among weak, conceited Creatures, when they really can ſay nothing to the Purpoſe) I make no Queſtion but every Thing of this Kind would be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen through by ſenſible impartial Men, and attributed to its juſt Cauſe.</p>
            <p>TO conclude; if the Piece has any Merit, it will find Friends in this Place, I make no doubt, as well as elſewhere; and if two or three People were to take it into their Heads, from a high Notion of their Intereſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that what they ſhould be pleaſed to ſay about the Matter, muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its Reception, I fancy they would in the End find themſelves miſtaken: But on the contrary, if the Piece has no Merit, there is no Occaſion to put it to the Rack, it will ſoon die of itſelf, and be deſervedly neglected and forgotten.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE ON THE Preparation of the Body for the SMALL-POX, and the Manner of receiving the <hi>Infection,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Much honoured and worthy Gentlemen, Truſtees of this Academy,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING ſome Things to offer which I conceive may be of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefit, I thought they could not be more properly addreſs'd, than to a Sett of Gentlemen, who were ſo ſenſible of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Uſefulneſs of Academical Learning, as to become, in the moſt generous and diſintereſted Manner, the firſt Promoters of it in this Place. In all Places for Education, <hi>Medicine</hi> has been ever accounted one of the moſt uſeful Branches of natural Knowledge; and every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to improve any Part of it, has been always countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by the Friends and Well-wiſhers of the liberal Arts. I make no Doubt then but you will favour me with your Attention, while I propoſe ſome Things to your Conſideration relating to the SMALL-POX, a Diſeaſe at preſent in this Place, and which oftentimes proves fatal in every Part of the World where it has hitherto been known. As I have not been us'd to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in this publick Manner, I rely entirely on your Candour and Good-nature, to make a proper Allowance for all Defects in Point of Oratory. <hi>Truth,</hi> indeed, ſtands ſeldom in Need of any Embelliſhments, and often appears to the greateſt Advantage when dreſs'd in its own native Simplicity; more eſpecially theſe Sort of Truths which are rather intended to convince the Mind than excite the Paſſions. The Flowers of <hi>Rhetoric</hi> on ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, appear, for the moſt Part, only as ſo many ſpecious and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ornaments. I ſhall endeavour, therefore, to deliver myſelf with all the Plainneſs and Brevity I am capable, and the Nature of the Subject will admit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006617_0006_1029528A0A671218"/>EVER ſince the SMALL-POX appear'd in the World, it has always been accounted a dangerous, and frequently a mortal Diſtemper: When the Diſeaſe is violent, it is certainly extremely dangerous in its own Nature, but capable of being rendered much more ſo by a wrong Management. The <hi>hot Regimen,</hi> which was univerſally practis'd before <hi>Sydenham</hi>'s Time, and by too many ſince, has hurried Numbers out of the World, which might have been eaſily ſav'd by a different Treatment: But every Thing relating to the Management of the Patient thro' the Courſe of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per having been ſo fully handled by others, I propoſe not to dwell upon it in the preſent Diſcourſe. My principal Deſign is, to offer ſome Things concerning <hi>the Preparation of the Body,</hi> and <hi>the Manner of receiving the Infection</hi>; which, from any Thing I have yet ſeen, appears to me, never to have been conſider'd with that Attention the Importance of the Subject deſerves: This too ſeems the more neceſſary, as there are ſome Points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Matter, of the utmoſt Conſequence to the Life and Safety of Numbers of Mankind, concerning which, People are by no Means agreed in their Opinions.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT farther Introduction then in treating this Subject, I propoſe to obſerve the following Method.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I ſhall premiſe ſome general Things, and enquire a little into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>From theſe Premiſes I ſhall endeavour to ſhow what State of the Body is beſt fitted to receive the Infection, and how it ought to be prepared, as well in thoſe who receive it in the natural Way, as in thoſe who take it by Inoculation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>I ſhall try to diſcuſs this Queſtion,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether it be ſafeſt and moſt eligible to run the Riſque of catching this Diſtemper without any Precaution in the natural Way; to take the Infection in the natural Way premeditately after due Preparation; or by Inoculation? And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LASTLY, <hi>I ſhall conclude with a few Reflections on the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin then with the firſt Thing in the Method, which was to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſome general Things, and enquire a little into the Nature of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</hi> Tho' <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Variolorum Antiquitates Graetis erutae.</hi> D.

leave no room for any Diſpute. The <hi>Arabians,</hi> therefore, ſeem to have been the firſt who have handed us down any authentic Accounts of this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems highly probable, as well from Reaſon as Obſervation, that thoſe epidemic Diſeaſes which cannot be accounted for from the manifeſt Qualities of the Air, (<hi>viz.</hi> Heat and Cold, Moiſture and Dryneſs) have their Beginning, Encreaſe, Perfection, Declination and Period; and this, perhaps, in a great Meaſure, from the various Exhalations, that according to the different and unknown Alterations happening in the Bowels, or on the Surface of the Earth, taint the Atmoſphere with hurtful <hi>Miaſmata,</hi> which, tho' they be too ſubtile to undergo the Examination of the Senſes, may yet act at certain Conjunctures on the human Frame, and produce particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſeaſes. This, I ſay, may be, and very probably is the general Cauſe of all epidemic Diſeaſes which do not depend upon the manifeſt Qualities of the Air. Now, tho' the <hi>variolous</hi> Contagion, is generally taken from an infected Perſon, yet it is plain from Facts that the Diſeaſe is often epidemic, and that this epidemical Conſtitution of the Air is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs pernicious: Nay, ſo ſtrongly was the Air of <hi>England</hi> taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an epidemical Conſtitution of this Sort for the Space of near three Years (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Years 1667, 1668, and Part of 1669) that great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers during that Seaſon, who had already ſuffered the SMALL-POX, were ſeized with what Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> calls a <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>Variolous Fever,</hi> from its having every diſtinguiſhing Symptom of that Diſtemper, the Eruption of Puſtles alone excepted: At the ſame Time too, the SMALL-POX was very frequent among thoſe who never had the Diſtemper before. It is very likely that the Fuel for this Diſeaſe always exiſted in the human Blood, for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Natives of <hi>America,</hi> where the SMALL-POX was never known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Europeans</hi> came amongſt them, catch it as readily from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Perſon, as any other. Yet it ſeems very probable the SMALL-POX never appear'd in the World, before a <hi>variolous</hi> epidemical Conſtitution of the Air called it forth.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be more to the preſent Purpoſe to enquire a little into the Nature and Effects of this Diſeaſe, now it has appear'd, than to examine when, or how it came into the World. Now it appears in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that after the Variolous Contagion, whatever Way communicated, is mix'd with the Maſs of Blood of any Perſon who never had the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it always produces an inflammatory Fever. And in Proportion to the Violence of the Diſeaſe, ſo always are the Symptoms of this conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fever, in ſo much that from theſe, for the moſt part, a pretty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Prognoſtic may be form'd, whether the Diſeaſe will be more or leſs

All the ſucceeding Appearances in the Progreſs of the Diſorder are evidently of the ſame Kind. The <hi>Eruption</hi> is no other than a Number of ſmall Inflammations, which, when the Diſeaſe is moderate, regularly ripen into thick white, or yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Matter, and form ſmall <hi>Abſceſſes,</hi> from which, however numerous they may be, there is ſeldom much Danger under due Management. On the other hand, when the Diſeaſe is violent, the dangerous Appearances are all of the <hi>gangrenous</hi> Kind, ariſing from a <hi>putrid</hi> Diſſolution of the Blood, which are ſtill the genuine Effects of a higher and more exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Degree of the inflammatory Fever. The narrow Limits of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign will not permit me to enter into a more minute Detail of Particulars; but it would be eaſy to ſhow, that every threatening and mortal Symptom of this Diſeaſe proceeds from the Cauſes aſſign'd. I ſhall conclude, therefore, what I propos'd to premiſe in general concerning this Diſeaſe, with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it ſufficiently prov'd, that whatever be the more hidden and abſtruſe Nature of the Variolous Contagion, when it comes to be mix'd with the Blood of a Perſon who never had the SMALL POX, it is poſeſs'd of a ſtimulating Power, which produces an inflammatory Fever, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the worſt and moſt dangerous Sort.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the ſecond Thing propos'd, which was <hi>to endeavour to ſhew, from the foregoing Premiſes, what State of the Body is beſt fitted to receive the Infection, and how it ought to be prepar'd, as well in thoſe who take it in the natural Way, as in thoſe who take it by Inoculation.</hi> In general then, as it appears from what has been offer'd, that the whole Danger of this Diſtemper proceeds from a high inflammatory Fever, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a putrid Diſſolution of the Blood, that State of the Veſſels which is the leaſt diſpos'd to favour Inflammation, and that State of the Fluids which will be apteſt to reſiſt Putrefaction, muſt certainly be that State of the Body which is beſt fitted to receive this Diſeaſe. Now ſoft and flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Veſſels, containing a cool and temperate Blood, has been found, by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <note n="*" place="bottom">Idem. Ibid. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1387.</note> Experience and Obſervation, to be this State. Hence it is that old People, whoſe Veſſels are ſtiff and rigid, are more indanger'd by the SMALL POX, as well as all other inflammatory Diſorders, than Young.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006617_0009_10295293DAC0A5E8"/>
And hence, likewiſe, thoſe whoſe Blood is heated by High-living and ſtrong Liquors, are in great Danger by the ſame Diſtempers, than thoſe who live more temperately. A very ſmall Attention will eaſily diſcover the Reaſon of this. Every inflammatory Fever, as well as every topical Inflammation, is attended with an Obſtruction in the ſmall Veſſels; and ſurely the more lax, and moveable theſe Veſſels are, the more eaſily will theſe obſtructed Particles find a Paſſage through them. Again, <hi>Putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is always occaſion'd by too much Heat, and animal Heat is generated by the <hi>Attrition</hi> of the circulating Blood, and the Action of the Veſſels: Now the more ſoft, rare, and inelaſtic the Bodies ingag'd in Attrition are, the leſs Heat will be produc'd, <hi>caeteris paribus</hi>: But it appears, by many Experiments, that hot and intemperate Blood is compos'd of much more denſe, compacted, and elaſtic Parts, than cool and temperate, and the Veſſels that contain it are generally more tenſe and rigid; therefore a much greater Degree of Heat will be excited, even ſuppoſing the ſame Celerity of Circulation in both. A very moderate Skill in the Doctrine of Attrition, I imagine, is ſufficient to diſcover the Force of this Reaſoning. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, cool and temperate Blood would much longer reſiſt Putrefaction in the ſame Degree of Heat and Motion with that of hot and intemperate. For the Blood is compos'd of what we eat and drink, conſiderably alter'd indeed by the Action of the animal Organs, yet ſtill retaining a good deal of the Nature of the Food it was form'd from. Now the temperate Blood here ſpoken of, is ſuch as is chiefly form'd from a cooling, vegetable, or Milk Diet; and the intemperate ſuch as principally comes from hot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming, animal Food, with high ſeaſon'd Sauces, diluted perhaps with ſpirituous Liquors. But Milk, and all Vegetables (a few hot <hi>Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticks</hi> excepted) by heat turn <hi>acid,</hi> which is directly oppoſite to <hi>Putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and reſiſts it: Whereas, on the other hand, all animal Food, either Fleſh or Fiſh, naturally tends to Putrefaction, and ſtands in no need of the Heat introduc'd by high ſeaſon'd Sauces, or ſpirituous Liquors, to encreaſe and aſſiſt it. On this Account it is that the Fleſh of thoſe Animals, who live upon other Animals, putrefies a good deal ſooner, than the Fleſh of thoſe who live intirely on Vegetables, in the ſame Degree of heat. Nay, moſt of the rapacious Birds of Prey, even while alive, have a foetid Smell. And it is certain, from Experience, that the human Body cannot ſubſiſt long on animal Food alone, unleſs it be qualified with Salt or Acids, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into putrid Diſorders. <note n="*" place="bottom">

Whoever reflects duly on theſe Things will, I imagine, be fully ſatisfied, that ſoft and flexible Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, containing a cool and temperate Blood, prepared chiefly from a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid vegetable, or Milk Diet, muſt be in general that State of the Body which is beſt fitted to receive an inflammatory Diſtemper, whoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Effects is a putrid Diſſolution of the Blood, which was previouſly ſhewn to be the Caſe in the SMALL-POX.</p>
            <p>BUT I foreſee an Objection which may probably be raiſed againſt what has been advanced. It may be aſk'd, if this Matter be as it has been ſtated, how comes it paſs, that ſometimes a ſtrong, luſty, groſs Perſon, who takes the SMALL-POX in the natural Way without any Precaution, ſhall have it very moderately, whilſt another, again, of a thin, ſpare, and ſeemingly more advantageous Habit, perhaps too, after a careful Preparation, ſhall have it in a much more violent Manner? It is undeniable Matter of Fact, that there have been Inſtances, which if they do not come up fully to this Caſe, at leaſt come very near it: No body, however, I believe, will alledge that I have not done compleat Juſtice to the Objection; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, at firſt Sight, it looks very plauſible, but I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, whilſt the ſame Fluid in a more corpulent Habit, may be much more cool and temperate. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; By a careful Preparation, is for the moſt Part meant, an abſtemious Diet, with Bleeding and Purging: But I muſt beg Leave to obſerve, that Errors are eaſily committed in purſuing this Courſe. By ſuch Evacuations, and too abſtemious a Diet, the Patient may be render'd too weak to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſo tedious a Diſeaſe, and by over-purging, the Blood may be eaſily rendered hot, acrid and putreſcent, which would be much worſe than no Preparation at all; ſo that it requires more Skill to judge how far that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen, and theſe Evacuations, are proper in different Conſtitutions, than is generally imagined: And if the Qualifications of thoſe who are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Direction of ſuch Affairs be candidly conſidered, there can, I think, little Doubt be made that they are frequently injudiciouſly uſed. But, thirdly; To give the Objection its full Force, let it be granted that ſometimes (for the apparent Inſtances are but rare) the beſt prepared Body has the Diſeaſe worſt, nothing more will follow than that thoſe rare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are Exceptions from a general Rule, and it is ſaid that all general Rules have Exceptions.

No Man ever had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opportunities of making Obſervations; no Man ever obſerved with more Accuracy; and it is univerſally allow'd, that no Man ever related his Obſervations with more Candour. He tells <note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Opera Univerſa.</hi> Pagin. 141, &amp; alibi ſparſim.</note> us, he obſerv'd in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that old People fared worſe under this Diſeaſe than young, and Men worſe than Women, the latter being naturally of a ſofter and laxer Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: That young Men again, in the Flower of their Youth, whoſe Blood was heated by free Living, were more in Danger than thoſe who had not yet entered into Company: Nay, that the Children of poor People, who live chiefly on a homely vegetable and Milk Diet, generally had this Diſeaſe more moderately than the Children of rich People, who were us'd to higher Feeding. Theſe Things, I ſhould think, are ſufficient to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Truth of what was laid down, and remove the Objection; but perhaps, before what is intended to be ſaid on ſome other Matters relating to the Preparation of the Body, be finiſhed, theſe Inſtances on which the Objection is founded, may be made a proper Uſe of, and accounted for. I go on, therefore, to offer ſomething farther on that Subject.</p>
            <p>Now tho' the State of the Veſſels, and Temper of Blood deſcribed, be certainly a moſt uſeful and neceſſary Part of the Preparation, yet I am humbly of Opinion, ſomething more may be done; I think too, I have Reaſon from what I have experienc'd in Practice, to be of that Opinion: However, I ſhall explain myſelf candidly on this Matter, with as much Perſpicuity as I can, freely ſubmitting it to the Judgment and future Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of others. It appears to me then, highly probable, that there is a certain Quantity of an infinitely ſubtile Matter, which may be called the <hi>variolous Fuel,</hi> equally, intimately and univerſally diffuſed through the Blood of every human Creature, in ſome more, in others leſs, that lies ſtill and quiet in the Body, never ſhowing itſelf in any Manner hitherto diſcovered, until put in Action by the variolous Contagion, at which Time it is totally expelled in the Courſe of the Diſeaſe. Firſt, I ſay, this variolous Fuel ſeems to be infinitely ſubtile; that is, ſo ſubtile as to evade the Diſcovery of our Senſes, aſſiſted by the beſt Helps yet found; becauſe the Blood of a Perſon who never had the SMALL-POX, makes the very ſame Appearance, and affords the ſame Analyſis under the ſtricteſt Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the Blood of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> who had already ſuffered the Diſeaſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly; It ſeems to be equally, intimately and univerſally diffuſed thro' the Blood of every human Creature; for we find the Infection may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated at all Parts of the Body equally; and all the different Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Globe, <hi>Europeans, Aſiaticks, Africans,</hi> and <hi>Americans,</hi> have been hitherto found equally ſuſceptible of the Diſeaſe. Thirdly; This
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006617_0012_102952A10236DD30"/>
variolous Fuel, ſeems in ſome to be more, in others leſs in Quantity, and very probably different likewiſe in Quality, for we ſee People of the ſame apparent advantageous Habits, very differently affected with the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Nor are there any Marks hitherto diſcovered by which it can be ſo much as gueſs'd at, whether any Perſon has a greater or leſs Quantity of this <hi>variolous Fuel</hi> in the Blood, or whether it be of a greater or leſs malignant Quality. And this I think would ſerve to account for theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in a former Objection, where ſtrong, luſty, groſs People, ſometimes have the Diſeaſe very moderately, whilſt others again of apparently more advantageous Habits, have it with much greater Violence; becauſe, if the Quantity of this variolous Fuel in the former be ſmall, and its Quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, the Fever and all its conſequent Effects upon the Blood will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ſmall; whereas on the other Hand, ſhould thoſe of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Habits, have it in greater Quantity, or more malign Quality, tho' the Body would be better prepared to ſuſtain an equal Degree of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet as this would by no Means be the Caſe, the Danger would be much greater. But fourthly and laſtly; this variolous Fuel lies ſtill and quiet in the Body, until it is put in Action by the variolous Contagion, at which Time it is totally expelled in the Courſe of the Diſeaſe: This is ſo plain that nothing farther need be offered in Proof of it, than that thoſe who have once had the Diſtemper, let them be never ſo much expoſed to the Infection afterwards, are not liable to have it a ſecond Time. Yet whether ever there was a well atteſted Inſtance of the ſame Perſon having the Diſeaſe twice, I ſhall not take upon me to determine. Suppoſing there was, ſome uncommon Accident or Particularity in the Conſtitution may have prevented the total Expulſion of it the firſt Time. But if there be any ſuch Thing at all, it happens ſo exceeding rare, that it ought to be conſider'd as a Kind of Prodigy, and then the Anſwer is, that tho' uncommon and extraordinary <hi>Phenomena</hi> of Nature appear ſometimes, yet it is never thought a good Argument againſt reaſoning from its uſual Courſe. All the general Appearances then of the SMALL-POX evidently favour this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> which is more than can be ſaid of any other that I know of; but it was not with a View to eſtabliſh a Piece of <hi>Theory</hi> that it was firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, I proceed therefore to make the intended Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>IF then there be ſuch a ſubtile Matter in the Blood of all thoſe who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the SMALL POX, as, from what has been offer'd, appears, at leaſt, highly probable, it would certainly be of the greateſt Benefit to Mankind to find out a <hi>ſpecific Medicine,</hi> which would either expel it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, alter it ſo as to render it quite innocent, or mitigate its malignant Quality. A Specific poſſeſs'd of the former Virtues would undoubtedly be the moſt deſirable; yet a Medicine capable only of mitigating the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the variolous Fuel, would certainly make a noble Preparative for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006617_0013_102952A7C3E29160"/>
the Diſeaſe. It has been the Opinion of very eminent <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Aphor. Boerhaav.</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1390.</note> Phyſicians, that a Specific for the SMALL POX ought to be ſought for, and may probably be found. <note n="§" place="bottom">Idem, Ibid. 1392.</note> 
               <hi>Boerhaave</hi> ſeems to think (for he ſpeaks with Reſerve) that from ſome Things he had ſeen perform'd by the Uſe of ſome of the finer, and milder Preparations of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> intimately united, it was well worth while to make farther Trials of them, in order to find out a Specific in this Diſtemper. As for the general <note n="‡" place="bottom">Idem, Ibid. 1393.</note> Antiphlogiſtic Method, by which the ſame great Man propoſes to check the Diſtemper in its firſt Stage, and prevent the Eruption of Puſtles, or even after the Puſtles have appear'd, to cure the Inflammation, and ſtop its farther Progreſs, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take upon me to ſay how far it may be certain or ſafe to purſue it, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſeen'd it tried. But <note n="‖" place="bottom">Idem, Ibid. 1395</note> he aſſerts, there have been many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its Succeſs, while Phyſicians not appris'd of the SMALL POX, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Symptoms and Eruption in the ſame Manner as they would have done any other high inflammatory Fever. The Danger of ſuch a Method would be, that if it did not ſucceed, the large Bleedings neceſſary to be us'd, muſt render the Patient ſo weak, that he would be very apt to ſink under the tedious and trying Courſe which he muſt afterwards undergo. This Method, therefore, is not likely to take Place, unleſs, by repeated Trials on Criminals condemn'd to Death, it was found certain, and to be depended upon. But the Trial of an eaſy operating antimonial and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Medicine, as a Preparative for receiving the Diſeaſe can be attended with no Danger. If it does not alter the variolous Fuel, ſo as to render it perfectly innocent, or expel it intirely, it may perhaps expel it in Part, or mitigate its malignant Quality; and in either Caſe the Advantage would be conſiderable. Tho' I cannot take upon me to aſſert any Thing poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this Matter, yet there can be no Harm in relating what I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in this Affair. On every Occaſion, for the Space of twelve Years that I have been call'd upon to prepare People for the SMALL POX, either for receiving it in the natural Way, or by Inoculation (for I have prepar'd many for both) I have conſtantly us'd ſuch a Medicine as has been mention'd, and I can honeſtly declare I never ſaw one ſo prepar'd, in any conſiderable Danger by the Diſeaſe. One of them indeed that receiv'd the Infection in the natural Way, had the <hi>confluent</hi> Pock, but I attributed that to his having rid near twenty Miles in cold damp Weather the firſt Day of the contagious Fever, being taken unwell in the Morning before he ſet off. However tho' he was a young Gentleman in the Flower of his Youth, he got very ſafely over it. This Diſeaſe is often ſo eaſily got over without any Precaution, that many People are unwilling to be at much Trouble about preparing for it, ſo that eight, ten Days, or a Fortnight, has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006617_0014_102952AAF8B3DE80"/>
been the longeſt Time I have ever been able to perſuade any body to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for it, which was too little. For as the variolous Fuel is univerſally diffus'd, in order to obtain the full Efficacy of the Medicine, the whole Maſs of Blood ought to be richly impregnated with it. I met with one Inſtance, however, which, as it ſeems a little remarkable, I will take the Liberty to relate. About ten Years ago, in the Family where I lodg'd, there were five Children who had never had the SMALL POX. The eldeſt was about twelve Years of Age, and the youngeſt about two. They were all of healthy Conſtitutions, born of the ſame Parents, and liv'd after the ſame Manner, eating and drinking together every Day. The SMALL POX came to the Place, and their Mother would not hear of Inoculation. They were kept as much as poſſible out of the Way of the Diſtemper; but at laſt the eldeſt and youngeſt were both taken with very violent Symptoms, that preſag'd a high and dangerous Degree of the Diſeaſe, which indeed they both had, tho' they got over it. This alarm'd the Mother, upon which ſhe deſir'd I would prepare the other three for taking the Infection in the natural Way. I gave them a Fortnight's Preparation in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid, and then they came freely into the Room where the others were. Two of them took the Diſeaſe, yet in the moſt moderate Manner, ſo as never to lie by an Hour with it. But the third could not catch it at all, notwithſtanding he ſlept in the Bed with his Brothers and Siſters with the SMALL POX upon them. This young Man is now an Apprentice to a Practitioner in this Town, and he tells me he has been frequently among the SMALL POX ſince, and goes at this Time, as he has done for ſome Time paſt, freely amongſt them every Day, dreſſing inoculated Sores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet never has catch'd it to this Hour. I would not be underſtood to offer this as a Demonſtration of what has been ſuggeſted, for I know there are Inſtances of People having reſiſted very ſtrong Degrees of the Infection, who have afterwards taken it on very ſlight Occaſions, and perhaps this Youth may be amongſt that Number. It is far from my Intention to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by drawing certain Concluſions from doubtful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>remiſes: But after having ſtated Things fairly, and in the cleareſt Manner I could, I leave every Man to judge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>I HAVE purpoſely avoided giving any formal Directions about the Preparation, thinking it ſufficient to propoſe the general Intentions to be purſued, which every judicious Phyſician eaſily knows how to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and adapt to different Conſtitutions; for I think none elſe ought to be intruſted with a Matter of this Sort. Nor do I mean by ſuch, all thoſe who by the Courteſy of <hi>America</hi> are ſtil'd Doctors, becauſe it is well known that Surgeons, Apothecaries, Chymiſts, and Druggiſts, or even mere Smatterers in any of theſe, are all promiſcuouſly call'd by that Title, as well as real Phyſicians. I mention this as well to make
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006617_0015_102952AF850412A8"/>
People a little more careful in examining into the Pretenſions of thoſe they intruſt as Phyſicians, for ſurely it is a moſt important Truſt, as to gain the Method of Preparation propos'd fair play.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus finiſh'd what I intended on the ſecond Thing in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, I proceed now in order to the third Thing propos'd, which was to <hi>try to diſcuſs this Queſtion,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether it be ſafeſt and moſt eligible to run the Riſque of catching the</hi> SMALL POX <hi>in the natural Way without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, to take the Infection in the natural Way premeditately after due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or by Inoculation</hi>? Now whoever attentively conſiders what has been ſaid concerning the Nature of this Diſeaſe, and the Advantages of a proper Preparation, muſt, I think, allow that the ſame Perſon would certainly have the Diſeaſe much more moderately, while his Body was in that State deſcribed as the fitteſt, than if he was to have it under the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Circumſtances. But no one who runs the Riſque of catching the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe at random can tell but the latter may be his Caſe. Nay it is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the Caſe; for the more hot and putreſcent the Blood is, the more tenſe and active the Veſſels are, the apter they will be to imbibe any Thing applied to them. An Inſtance of this we ſee in <hi>acute</hi> Fevers, where that is the State of the Blood and Veſſels. Let a Perſon in this Condition drink as much as he will, the Moiſture applied to the Veſſels of his Mouth and Throat is ſoon ſuck'd up, and they quickly again feel parch'd and dry, which evidently ſhows that this Power of <hi>Abſorption</hi> in the Veſſels, by which Power alone it is that any Thing is taken into the Blood, is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that very State of the Body which is moſt unfriendly to the SMALL POX; conſequently, a Perſon will be apteſt to catch the Infection when he is worſt prepared for it. Seeing this is the Caſe then, it muſt certainly be the moſt dangerous and unſafe Method to run the Riſque of catching the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in the natural Way, without any Precaution.</p>
            <p>BUT to this ſome will reply, Allowing the Matter to be as it has been ſtated, as there are Inſtances of ſome who never get the Diſeaſe at all, there is a Poſſibility of eſcaping it entirely; and beſides that, getting a Diſtemper induſtriouſly looks like Preſumption, or a tempting of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Theſe Things, I am ſenſible, have conſiderable Influence on ſome People, but, with Submiſſion, they ſeem to me to have little of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in them. For firſt, the Inſtances of thoſe who never have the SMALL-POX at all, in populous Cities, where the Diſtemper is frequently among the Inhabitants, (for I ſpeak only of ſuch,) are exceeding rare, at moſt not one in ten Thouſand. This Chance then is ſo ſmall as ſcarcely to deſerve any Conſideration, when the Danger of running the Chance, and the Advantages of the other Method are ſet in Competition.</p>
            <p>But farther, as the Almighty has form'd us rational Beings, he ſurely intended we ſhould act on rational Motives; now Certainty is often out of our Reach,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006617_0016_102952B675C238E8"/>
and Probabilities are the only rational Motives we have to act upon in moſt Caſes. The Probability therefore of the greateſt Safety being ſo ſtrongly on the Side contended for, there can be no Preſumption in acting agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it; otherwiſe taking the moſt probable Means for Self-preſervation, a Principle ingrafted in us by the Author of our Nature, would be acting preſumptuouſly againſt him, which is a palpable Abſurdity. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in neglecting the moſt probable Means of Safety, ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lie on the other Side. But, in truth, tho' it be reckoned Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſome, yet there are many Things of the ſame Sort practiſed every Day by theſe very People, without any Scruple. Who amongſt them, for inſtance, would heſitate to bleed, vomit, or purge, in order to prevent any dangerous Diſeaſe, which they had but the ſlighteſt Reaſon to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of? And yet Bleeding, Vomiting and Purging, are all as real Diſeaſes as the SMALL-POX, while they laſt, and ſuch as have proved mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal too, even when they have been induſtriouſly brought on: Yet no Body calls this Practice Preſumption, or a tempting of Providence. The Caſe, I think, is exactly the ſame with reſpect to the voluntary Way of taking the SMALL-POX. A leſs Danger is willingly embraced to avoid a greater, not on ſlight Grounds, but with great Probability apprehended. Thus I have endeavour'd to obviate an Objection, which I have known to ſtick with Numbers of well-meaning but ſcrupulous Minds, and I thought it my Duty to do ſo in a Diſcourſe intended for the Publick, tho' perhaps it may have been unneceſſary to the Bulk of more intelligent People: But having already ſhewn that to run the Riſque of catching the SMALL-POX in the natural Way without any Precaution, is by far the moſt unſafe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, I proceed to examine, <hi>Whether it be ſafeſt and moſt eligible to take the Infection premeditately in the natural Way, after due Preparation, or by Inoculation</hi>?</p>
            <p>AND firſt it may not be improper to remark, that, after due Pains taken to prepare the Veſſels, one cannot be ſo certain of taking the Infection in the natural Way, as by Inoculation. The Regimen and Medicines would probably render the Veſſels not ſo ready to catch it, which might conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably prolong the Care and Caution neceſſary to be uſed before the Affair was over: So that ſuppoſing both Ways of receiving the Infection equally ſafe, Inoculation ought to be preferred. But that we may ſearch into the Bottom of this Matter, let us in the next Place ſuppoſe the Body equally prepared in both Caſes, when the Infection is received, and then the only Difference will be in the Manner of receiving it, which, if I am not much deceived, will appear, on a ſtrict Examination, to be of much more Importance than is generally imagined, and greatly in favour of Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. As the Contagion in infected Places is always contained in the Air, when it is received in the natural Way, it muſt be taken in by the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006617_0017_102952BB016EA360"/>
Veſſels of the Noſe, Mouth, Throat, Lungs, or Stomach, from the Air drawn in by <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or ſwallowed down by <hi>Deglutition.</hi> For, tho' the external Skin abounds with bibulous Veſſels, yet but little of that is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and beſides, their Orifices neither being ſo open, nor ſo moiſt, are not ſo fitly diſpoſed to take in any Thing applied to them in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But the internal Coats of the Noſe, Mouth, Throat, Air Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lungs and Stomach, are all lined with a lubricating <hi>Mucus,</hi> fit to entangle the infectious <hi>Miaſmata,</hi> and the <hi>inhalant</hi> Veſſels of theſe Parts are always open, and ready to ſuck up and convey into the Blood whatever is applied to them: So that ſhould the Contagion in the Air at any Time be ſtrong enough to enter the <hi>inhalant</hi> Veſſels of the external Skin, it would certainly enter the Veſſels of theſe internal Parts at the ſame time, as it muſt be applied to them with ſuch ſuperior Advantages. Now the peculiar Advantage of Inoculation, I take to be this, that by this Method the Infection is convey'd into the Blood by the external Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels alone, and that only from one particular Spot, which may be choſe in any Part of the Body. It may be worth while therefore, to examine in what this peculiar Excellency particularly conſiſts.</p>
            <p>It is a Thing well known, that the Danger of all inflammatory Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers almoſt wholly depends upon the Nature and Function of the Part where the Inflammation principally fixes. An Inflammation in the Legs or Arms for Example, or any external Part, is not near ſo dangerous as one in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of any of the Cavities of the Belly, Breaſt, or Brain. When the Inflammation ſuppurates in the former Caſe, it may always be cured, and often when it gangrenes; but any conſiderable Quantity of Matter lodg'd in any of the three Cavities mentioned, almoſt always proves mortal, and a Gangrene there is certain Death. Whatever then will be inſtrumental in determining the Criſis of the inflammatory Fever rais'd by the variolous Contagion, towards the internal and more noble Parts, muſt be hurtful and dangerous; whereas on the other Hand, whatever tends to lead this Criſis outwardly, and to the more remote Parts, muſt be highly advantageous and ſerviceable. That the Method of receiving the variolous Infection in the natural Way is of the former, and that by Inoculation of the latter Sort, appears to me ſtrongly ſupported by the following Obſervations.</p>
            <p>FIRST, we obſerve, that in other Poiſons which induce an Inflammation or Gangrene, it principally affects thoſe Parts where the Poiſon firſt enters, whether it be the internal Coats of the Noſe, Mouth, Throat, Lungs and Stomach, or the external Surface of the Body. Secondly; It has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd that the Puſtles round the inoculated Part are generally very thick; nay I have often obſerved the whole Side on which the Inoculation was made, to be much thicker of Puſtles than the other. Thirdly; The Wound itſelf, tho' made ſmall, which would otherwiſe heal up in a few
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006617_0018_102952BC8EB89DA0"/>
Days, often becomes an ill-conditioned Sore, and keeps running in moſt Caſes for the Space of a Month, and in ſome a good deal longer. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I have taken particular Notice, that thoſe who take the Diſeaſe by Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, even when the Pock is equally numerous upon the Surface of the Body, are not near ſo ſubject to Sore Throats, and theſe other Symptoms which ſhow the internal Parts affected, as thoſe who take the Infection in the natural Way. From all which it would appear, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> variolous Contagion, which Way ſoever it enters the Blood, diſorders the whole Body, and raiſes an inflammatory Fever, yet that it affects thoſe Parts it enters at, in a particular Manner, ſo as to determine the Criſis of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver principally that Way. This then, I ſay, ſeems to me to be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Advantage of Inoculation, that it determines the Criſis of the contagious Fever, from the internal and dangerous Parts to the external and leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, which, as has been already ſhewn, muſt be of the higheſt Benefit.</p>
            <p>GIVE me Leave to add, as a corroborating Circumſtance, that the Effects of the different Ways of taking the Infection as deſcribed, will, in my humble Opinion, clearly account for a very remarkable Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of this Diſtemper, taken Notice of by <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Opera Univerſa.</hi> Pagin. 591, &amp; 592.</note> Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto has never been accounted for, at leaſt, that I ever heard of. The Phenomenon is this: That the Danger of the SMALL-POX is entirely to be eſtimated by the Number and Nature of the Puſtles upon the Face; ſo that however few and <hi>diſtinct</hi> they may be upon the reſt of the Body, if they are numerous and <hi>confluent</hi> upon the Face, there is the ſame Danger as if the Body was cover'd with the ſame Sort: The Obſervation holds too, <hi>vice verſa.</hi> Now, agreeable to what has been ſaid, if the variolous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection enters chiefly at the Veſſels of the Noſe, Mouth and Throat, which has been ſhewn to be the Places it is moſt likely to enter at when the Infection is taken in the natural Way, the Criſis of the contagious Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be principally determined that Way. But the <hi>Carotid</hi> Arteries and others, which ſupply thoſe Places as well as the Face, ſend likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Branches into the Brain, ſo that a proportionable Part of the ſame Sort of inflammatory Particles that conſtitute the Puſtles on the Face, muſt be lodg'd in the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the Brain; and as they are of a mild and benign Sort or otherwiſe, will produce more or leſs Danger in the Courſe of the Diſeaſe. For the Face conſider'd in itſelf, is a Place of no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and conſequently one would imagine, no ſuch Prognoſtic could be taken from it, but when for the Cauſes aſſigned, it comes to give certain Indications of the State of ſo important a Part as the Brain, the Caſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers widely, and the Reaſon of <hi>Sydenham</hi>'s Obſervation appears evident.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides this, the Advantages deſcribed, ariſing from the Manner of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006617_0019_102952BFD06DC3C8"/>
receiving the Infection by Inoculation, are confirm'd by Experience; for it is a Thing well known in this Place, that at different Times, while the SMALL-POX was very mortal among thoſe who took the Infection in the natural Way, great Numbers were inoculated, a careful Preparation being little practiſed, yet few, very few indeed, miſcarried. Nor can this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Succeſs be aſcribed to the Care taken in communicating the Infection from a Pock of a good Kind by Inoculation; for we ſee frequent Inſtances of thoſe, who live in the Houſe where the SMALL-POX of the worſt Kind is, having, notwithſtanding, the Diſeaſe mild and moderate; whilſt others again, who never had been near any in the confluent Sort, yet have it in the moſt violent Manner: Nay, ſome who have been inoculated from a Pock of the beſt Kind, have nevertheleſs had the worſt. So that tho' it be a Practice to be very careful in getting the Infection from a Pock of a good Kind, and to be ſure there is no Harm in it, yet it would ſeem to be a Matter of ſmall Importance. If therefore the experienced Succeſs of Inoculation can neither be aſcribed to the Preparation of the Body, which was but little practiſed, or to that of taking the Infection from a Pock of a good Kind, which appears to be of no Moment, I cannot ſee any other poſſible Way of accounting for it, but from the different Way of receiving the Infection. I have endeavour'd to do this by Arguments, as I think, drawn from fair Reaſon, and juſt Obſervation; and I hope by this Time it appears ſufficiently plain, that it is by far the ſafeſt and moſt eligible Way to take the variolous Infection by Inoculation.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus finiſhed what I intended on the three Heads of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I come now in the laſt Place to make a few Reflections on the whole.</p>
            <p>AND firſt, from what was hinted in the Beginning of this Diſcourſe, that an epidemical Conſtitution of the Air for producing this Diſtemper is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and ſometimes leſs pernicious: I ſhould think the beſt Time for getting over this Diſeaſe would be when it was accidentally brought to a Place, and there was nothing in the Air to favour it at all, or when the <hi>epidemical Pock</hi> was of a good Kind: For the Diſeaſe is to be ſuffered but once, and once every one who travels, or is obliged to be often in large Cities where it comes, muſt in all human Probability have it. And the Hiſtory of the Diſeaſe ſhows, that it is at ſome Seaſons much more mortal, than at others. Certainly therefore it will be running the leaſt Riſque, to try to get over the threatening Danger at the Seaſon abovementioned.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY; If thoſe Parts the Infection enters at, be of ſuch Conſequence as to determine the Criſis of the contagious Fever principally that Way, it will undoubtedly be beſt to convey it at thoſe Branches of the <hi>vaſcular Syſtem</hi> which have the moſt diſtant Communication with the Veſſels that ſupply the more noble Parts. For this Reaſon, I ſhould imagine it would be ſafeſt to inoculate in the <hi>lower</hi> Extremities rather than the <hi>upper,</hi> becauſe the <hi>axillary</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006617_0020_102952C16AC1FFC8"/>
Arteries, which chiefly ſupply the Arms, come from the <hi>Subclavians,</hi> and they derive their Origin from what is called the aſcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> which ſends off all thoſe Branches which ſupply the Head, and a great Part of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> where the vital and dangerous Parts are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now, ſhould the Criſis be principally determined towards the Arm where the Inoculation was performed, the vital Parts will be in more Danger of partaking of it, than if it was determined towards the Legs and Feet, as the Courſe of the Blood in thoſe Veſſels from whence the lower Extremities are ſupplied, lead quite a different Way. I know the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice is to inoculate in the Arm, and perhaps a Sore in the Feet or Legs may be ſomewhat more inconvenient; but a Probability of greater Safety, in a Matter where Life itſelf is concerned, ought certainly to take Place of a mere Convenience. Theſe Sores are ſometimes extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubleſome, and difficult to heal, giving forth a thin, ichorous, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Matter, which both eats and inflames the adjacent Parts. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or remedy this, about three or four Half Drachms of Jeſuits Bark given at ſo many Doſes through the Day, will, I believe, ſeldom or never fail to bring good Matter into the Sore, and diſpoſe it to heal. I am ſenſible this Effect of the Bark in bad Sores, and even in the Puſtles of the SMALL-POX, has been taken Notice of, and made known to the World by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly famous <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Medical Eſſays.</hi> Edinb. Edit. Vol. 5. Part 1ſt. Art. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Monro,</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> whoſe Name, as one of my firſt Maſters in the healing Art, it is my Duty always to mention with Gratitude and Honour. But having often experienced its good Effects in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe, I judg'd there would be nothing amiſs in mentioning it by the bye.</p>
            <p>But thirdly; From what has been ſaid concerning this Diſeaſe, and the Advantages of a well prepared State of Body for receiving it, I think it clearly follows, that it will be much the ſafeſt Method to have the Body put into that State at all Times when the Diſeaſe is expected, as well in thoſe who are determined to wait for it in the natural Courſe of Things, as in thoſe who premeditately take the Infection. For tho' the SMALL-POX be frequently got over in a very eaſy Manner without any Precaution, yet as it often proves a dangerous and mortal Diſtemper, too much Care can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be taken in a Matter of ſuch Importance. Inoculation has been ſhewn to be much the beſt and fafeſt Way of taking the Infection, yet even in this way it ſometimes proves mortal; and indeed, conſidering how uncautiouſly and precipitantly this is often done, I am ſurpris'd it has not been much more frequently the Caſe. Inoculation ſeems to be conſider'd by many as a mere chirurgical Operation, and accordingly we ſee almoſt every one who knows how to handle a Lancet intruſted with the whole Management of it: But it has been ſhewn, that what ought to be done
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006617_0021_102952C360AC3E18"/>
on this Occaſion for the Safety and Security of the Patient, a judicious and ſkilful Phyſician only can judge. In Matters of Property and Intereſt prudent Men are always cautious and circumſpect, in proportion to the Value of the Thing in Danger. Now here, Life itſelf, the moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all earthly Things, is liable to be put in the moſt imminent Danger by Miſmanagement and want of Skill; and yet of all Profeſſions in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> the true Qualifications of a Phyſician are the leaſt examin'd into. This ſeems ſomething ſtrange and inconſiſtent, but the Fact is notorious. It may, perhaps, be occaſion'd, in ſome Meaſure, by a Notion which prevails even among ſome from whom better Things might be expected, that Phyſic is not a <hi>real Science,</hi> founded on juſt and rational Principles, but a Sort of <hi>Knack</hi> to be got intirely by Practice, which an ignorant, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Perſon, may as readily attain, as one of Learning and Knowledge, who had taken due Pains to ſtudy it. If this was the true Notion of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, the Diſtinction betwixt Phyſician and Quack would be without Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for that is in Reality the Principle on which Empiriciſm is founded. But the ableſt Phyſicians in all Ages have repeatedly confuted it, and prov'd it to be in the higheſt Degree ſenſeleſs and abſurd. They have bore their publick Teſtimony againſt it, as an injurious Slander on their Profeſſion, exceedingly hurtful too in its Conſequences to Mankind, as ſerving for a Cloak to ſcreen Impoſtors. In every Country of the known World, where Learning flouriſhes, Phyſic is regularly taught as a Science, and ſtudied as ſuch by all thoſe who qualify for practical Phyſicians. But without entering minutely into the Argument, whoever will be at the Trouble of making only a ſlight Examination into this Matter, will ſoon be convinc'd that the human Body is a <hi>pure Machine,</hi> and that its Diſorders are not to be underſtood, however often they may be ſeen in Practice, without a particular Knowledge of its Organization and Structure. They would ſoon confeſs with Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> that "<note n="*" place="bottom">

In the Knowledge of theſe Things, conſiſts what is call'd the <hi>Theory</hi> or Principles of Phyſic, without which, ſays <hi>Sydenham,</hi>

That ſome Things in this <hi>Human Oeconomy</hi> are not thoroughly underſtood, may be eaſily granted, and is undoubtedly true; yet nothing follows from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but that the Science is not perfect; and I would deſire to know
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006617_0022_102952C6DDB58F70"/>
what human Science is? Many Things are certainly known concerning it, and he who knows theſe Things beſt, muſt be beſt qualified to judge of Obſervations in Practice; and he who is ignorant of them, underſtands nothing that he ſees, and is not qualified for Practice at all. Yet the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs committed by the ignorant Profeſſors of Medicine are ſeldom pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known, becauſe the noxious Things they adminiſter work all their Effects in the dark, within the hidden Receſſes of the Body, which the greateſt Part of Mankind are not qualified to judge of; and therefore are eaſily made believe proceeded not from the injudicious Adminiſtration, but the Malignity of the Diſeaſe, or ſome other Cauſe, which either the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piric himſelf through Ignorance thinks the true One, or artfully invents to ſave his Character. This however is an Unhappineſs much eaſier lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than remedied, unleſs the Legiſlature was to interpoſe in Behalf of the Safety of the People, and appoint proper Perſons to judge of the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who were permitted to Practice. This, I believe, has been done by all the well regulated Governments of <hi>Europe</hi>; and there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a better Reaſon why it ſhould be done in a young Country, where the Arts and Sciences are but in their Infancy, becauſe there the Bulk of the People being more illiterate, are more liable to be impos'd on, as they will be leſs capable of detecting Impoſtors.</p>
            <p>YOU, Gentlemen, have made a laudable Attempt to erect an Academy in this Place for the Advancement of Literature, and the Improvement of the liberal Arts; I heartily wiſh your generous Endeavours may be crown'd with Succeſs, to the utter Mortification and Diſcouragement of Impoſtors of all Kinds, and the Increaſe of true Knowledge, which is the Source of all individual, as well as ſocial Happineſs.</p>
