            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT <hi>Mankind Univerſally</hi> ſhall, in the final iſſue of the Goſpel plan of mercy, be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and be admitted to the felicity of the ſons of God, is no <hi>novel doctrine,</hi> as many may be ready to imagine. It was (as ſome writers upon this ſubject have obſerved) received as a <hi>revealed truth</hi> by Origen and Clement of Alexandria, who both lived in the latter end of the Second Century, And it appears from Auguſtin, Jerom, and other celebrated writers, in their day, that it was not then either a <hi>new</hi> or <hi>uncommon</hi> tenet. And, in later times, a variety of books have been publiſhed in favour of it, in the French, High-Dutch, Low-Dutch and Engliſh languages. There is alſo an ingenious piece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> written in French by a noble miniſter of the court of the king of Pruſſia, ſtiled <hi>A Treatiſe on the Univerſal Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Creation.</hi> A conſiderable number of other books, upon the ſame ſubject, are now extant in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I ſhall only mention one or two out of many others. <hi>Jeremiah White,</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to Oliver Cromwel, and an eminently pious, good man, has writ a large book, in <hi>Vindication of God's goodneſs to be manifeſted, at laſt, in
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:017489_0003_0FA1239DEEF4E3A8"/>
the recovery of the whole lower creation from the fall.</hi> From this book many of the following extracts are made: <hi>Dr. David Hartley,</hi> in his <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon man,</hi> has ſeveral chapters upon <hi>ſalvation for all men</hi>; from which I may collect ſome thoughts in the following work. I ſhall ſay of him, he was a man of known ſerious piety, a diſciple of Mr. <hi>John Weſley,</hi> and in common with him and all his followers, a believer in the <hi>Reſtoration of all mankind, in God's time and way, to final happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be unſeaſonable to add here, that it is freely and fully acknowledged, by all the above writers, that <hi>many,</hi> among the ſons and daughters of Adam, will paſs through a ſtate of <hi>unutterable miſery</hi>; before they will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for, and admitted to the joys of God's preſence, in the heavenly world.</p>
            <p>This I judge proper to mention, becauſe the doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi> has in this, and ſome other towns, been held forth by a ſtranger, who has, of himſelf, aſſumed the character of a <hi>preacher,</hi> in direct contradiction not only to all the before mentioned writers, but to the <hi>whole tenor of the New-Teſtament-books, from their beginning to their end.</hi> According to this <hi>preacher,</hi> a man may go to heaven, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſins he has been guilty of in the
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:017489_0004_0FA1239FF1FD7470"/>
courſe of his life. Such a doctrine looks very like an <hi>encouragement</hi> to <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> and falls in with the ſcheme of too many in this degenerate age, who, under pretence of <hi>promoting religion, undermine it at the very root.</hi> It is certainly fitted to this end, and has already had this effect upon many, eſpecially of our younger people, who, by means of it, have loſt all ſenſe of religion, and given themſelves up to the moſt criminal exceſſes! If this kind of preaching is encouraged, it may prove as hurtful to <hi>civil ſociety</hi> as to <hi>religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would to God it might be realized as an <hi>undoubted truth,</hi> that there is the ſame reaſon, from ſcripture, to believe there is a <hi>HELL</hi> as a <hi>HEAVEN.</hi> And thoſe who are infidels as to the former, would do well to take care leſt they ſhould know, from their <hi>own experience,</hi> the <hi>horrors</hi> of that <hi>dreadful place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The doctrine held forth, in the following extracts is capable (as is the truth with every other doctrine) of being perverted and abuſed. If any ſhould be ſo diſingenuous, as to turn <hi>this grace into wantonneſs,</hi> they can reflect the blame no where but on themſelves, if they are made to ſuffer, God only knows how <hi>long,</hi> or to what an <hi>awful degree,</hi> in the future ſtate.</p>

            <head>Salvation for all Men.</head>
            <p>AFTER ſome pertinent obſervations, the pious and ingenious Mr. <hi>White</hi> proceeds in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.—"And here I do, in the fear of God, moſt humbly proſtrate myſelf before his divine majeſty, and in the deepeſt ſenſe of my own darkneſs and diſtance from him, do, with all my might, beg of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs I am endeavouring to repreſent to others, that if ſomething like to this platform and proſpect of things be not agreeable to that revealed and natural light he hath given to us, that my undertaking may be interrupted; my deſign fall; and that the Lord would pardon my attempt. And I know he will do ſo, for he hath given me to have no further concern in this matter, than as I apprehend it to be a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth, witneſſed to both by the ſcriptures of truth, and by the moſt eſſential principles of our own reaſon, and which will be found ſo at the laſt opening of the goſpel, to recover, in that opening, a degenerate world. But if this be a true repreſentation of the glorious deſign of the ever bleſſed goodneſs of the great God, who is goodneſs itſelf; and if the holy ſcriptures and right reaſon do bear witneſs unto it, how clear, how fair, how open lies the way before us to juſtify the ſovereign power, and diſpoſe of God, which he exerciſes by Election and Reprobation too, with all the methods he uſes in his holy and glorious wiſdom and prudence, in giving way to the entrance of ſin, and then inflaming the anguiſh of it by the law, that he
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017489_0006_0FA123A0F000AE58"/>
may thereby have occaſion to glorify his wrath againſt it, and his juſtice; and ſo make his way to the more glorious illuſtration of his grace and love in the cloſe.</p>
            <p>In this account and proſpect, there is, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel of this diſcourſe, nothing omitted, nothing excluded, of all the ways and methods of God with men, which have been, by good minds, variouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. Here his univerſal grace doth no longer thruſt out his ſpecial and peculiar favour. <hi>Reprobation</hi> here will be found conſiſting with <hi>Election,</hi> yea, <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> itſelf with <hi>Salvation.</hi> Here all thoſe knots which other ſyſtems of divinity have tied faſter, are in a great meaſure loofned. Here all thoſe difficulties, in the Chriſtian religion, which have ſo long perplexed the more thinking and enquiring minds, are, if not quite removed, at leaſt made ſo eaſy, that we may, with ſome contentment and pleaſure, wait for that ſtate which can alone perfectly ſatisfy us. And yet, all this while, nothing of moment in Chriſtianity is any way aſſaulted and ſhaken, but all is much better eſtabliſhed and confirmed, being hereby made one entire piece moſt pure and pleaſant, from the higheſt truth, and the higheſt good, meeting both in one, throughout the whole contrivance.</p>
            <p>Here all thoſe falſe, barbarous and monſtrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of a God are taken away, which have hitherto hindred ſo many minds (otherwiſe ingenuous) from owning him, for fear they ſhould, at the ſame time they acknowledge the ſupreme Being, reproach and blaſpheme him, by leaving out the higheſt and moſt eſſential perfection of the Deity, which is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or at leaſt making it more narrow and contracted than that of a finite imperfect creature.</p>
            <p>Here, in a word, all the ſcenes of time, and all things done therein, are with at unſpeakable pleaſure diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017489_0007_0FA123A1AF9FB238"/>
and ſeen to be invironed, encompaſſed, enfolded in the arms and embraces of eternity, lying down and reſting there, as in the end to which they were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ordained.</p>
            <p>He is not a Chriſtian, he is not a man, he hath put off the tenderneſs and bowels of a man, he hath loſt humanity itſelf, he hath not ſo much charity as Dives expreſſed in Hell, that cannot readily cry out,— <hi>this is good news, if it be true:</hi> that will not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it, provided it be agreeable to God, and what his word will countenance and own. For under no other law or condition can we groundedly rejoice in any doctrine, than as it bears the impreſs and ſtamp of divine authority, and tends to his glory, to which all muſt bow; for heaven itſelf muſt paſs away, rather than the goſpel be innovated, or another goſpel broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how gratifying or acceptable ſoever to our fleſhly minds. Upon this ſuppoſition, therefore, I conclude this doctrine muſt be acceptable and welcome to every <hi>good man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have often obſerved, with admiration and pleaſure, thoſe moſt affectionate irruptions of ſpirit and pangs of love in Moſes and Paul. <hi>Blot me out of thy book,</hi> ſays one; <hi>I could be accurſed from Chriſt,</hi> ſays the other: for the ſake of my brethren, I ſometimes feel ſo much of the ſame love working in my ſoul, that I verily believe, a man, thoroughly acted by a ſpirit of goodneſs, would be ever content to live in a baniſhment from God, I mean from the ſweet illapſes and touches of his love, ſo that he might be without ſin, rather than any of God's creation ſhould be ever unacquainted with him: and therefore, he thinks it would be the beſt employment and greateſt happineſs, in the world, to be uſed as an inſtrument to ſuch an <hi>univerſal good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:017489_0008_0FA123A2707CB070"/>And whilſt I ſometimes entertain myſelf with ſuch thoughts as theſe, I feel a ſecret joy ſpringing in my ſoul, and whiſpering to me, if there be ſo much love in a <hi>drop,</hi> in a <hi>beam</hi> in a <hi>creature,</hi> there muſt ſure be infinitely more in the <hi>ocean,</hi> in the <hi>ſun,</hi> in <hi>God</hi> himſelf. I find all theſe good deſires and cares in myſelf ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the diſcovery of an object, which is all goodneſs and omnipotence, an infinitely wiſe and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty goodneſs; and a raviſhing ſight of all things already lying in his tender arms, and ſacred embraces; who, in his ſovereign and incomprehenſible wiſdom, hath ſtill been conducting them through all their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intricacies, for a greater good and glory."</p>
            <p>Having ended his introduction, which breathes a ſpirit of piety and benevolence, our author proceeds to confirm the doctrine of an <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration of the human race,</hi> by a variety of teſtimonies, from ſcripture. I ſhall not quote every thing he advances under each head, as that would ſwell this work to too large a ſize: But, in as few words as poſſible, I ſhall endeavour to give you his ideas.</p>
            <p>The firſt text he produces is from the 1ſt Epiſtle of Timothy ii. 3.—<hi>God our ſaviour, who will have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Upon which he obſerves—"The letter of this text is full and expreſs; God will have ALL MEN to be ſaved, and ſhould we preſs it, there are almoſt as many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as words. For 1ſt, It is not ſaid God <hi>would</hi> have all to be ſaved by his <hi>good will,</hi> but that he <hi>authoritatively wills it: wills</hi> it as a being of ſupreme, uncontroulable power, a being that <hi>will</hi> be obeyed in ſpite of the corrupt diſpoſitions of men, or the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017489_0009_0FA123A330199170"/>
miſchievous arts of devils. It is a <hi>fixed, determined, immutable</hi> will, no <hi>tranſient,</hi> nor revocable. Thus <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> does God <hi>will all men to be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he <hi>wills</hi> the end, ſo does he <hi>will</hi> the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means</hi> leading to it. In order to their being <hi>ſaved,</hi> he will have <hi>all men come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> No man <hi>is</hi> or can be ſanctified or ſaved without the knowledge of the truth; God wills this therefore, that they be ſaved, and that this means of ſalvation ſhall paſs upon them.</p>
            <p>Further—this will has its ground in the eſſential benevolence of God's nature, The ſalvation of all men is good and acceptable in his ſight. The words <hi>God our ſaviour</hi> are not to be reſtrained to the <hi>Elect,</hi> for that would not carry forth a will to ſave all men; this, therefore, is to be taken in the ſame latitude and extent with other places, where he is called <hi>the ſaviour of all men,</hi> Ch. iv. 10. And <hi>God that quickneth all things.</hi> Ch. vi. 13. And our ſaviour tells us, <hi>all things live to God.</hi> Luke xx. 38. And he is called <hi>the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh.</hi> Numb. xvi. 22. And mark you, who is this ſaviour? It is <hi>God,</hi> not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for of him he ſpeaks diſtinctly afterwards. But <hi>God</hi> the <hi>father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this principle therefore, that <hi>God wills the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men,</hi> he hath commanded us to pray for the whole world of mankind. He hath aſſured us, this is peculiarly <hi>good and acceptable in his ſight,</hi> And with the higheſt reaſon, for it perfectly falls in with his gracious deſign, and tends to bring it into effect. Neither does this overſet the doctrine of <hi>Election,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew in the ſequel of this diſcourſe. For tho' <hi>many are called few are choſen to happineſs in the</hi> NEXT <hi>ſtate.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are required to <hi>pray for all men,</hi> even for their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017489_0010_0FA123A3EEEE38A0"/>
               <hi>ſalvation,</hi> it is not meant to throw down the diſtinction between the <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobate.</hi> It is not meant to reverſe and alter God's decrees, whereby he hath given ſome the <hi>preheminence</hi> and <hi>double portion</hi> above others, but it is a ſeeking that <hi>ſalvation</hi> for <hi>all,</hi> which God hath prepared for them in <hi>his own time and way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the <hi>will</hi> of God then, that <hi>all men ſhould be ſaved.</hi> But remember, this <hi>will</hi> of his does not reſt in pitying men and wiſhing it were better with them. No, the <hi>will</hi> of God and his <hi>work</hi> are one. He <hi>wills</hi> nothing but he <hi>works</hi> it. Being an <hi>omnipotent</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> agent, he can never be reſiſted. But in as much as he <hi>wills</hi> the ſalvation of <hi>all men,</hi> he will finally bring it about; ſo that the wickedneſs of the human heart ſhall be tempered and ſubdued, the curſe and wrath be done away, and a moſt delightful and bliſsful harmony take place."</p>
            <p>This reaſoning our author further illuſtrates, by the following words.—<hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> 5th and 6th verſes.</p>
            <p n="1">"1ſt. <hi>There is one God,</hi> or more properly—<hi>God is one.</hi> That is, <hi>all men reprobate</hi> as well as <hi>elect,</hi> have <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſelf ſame God.</hi> The <hi>Elect</hi> have not <hi>one</hi> God and <hi>Reprobate another;</hi> but <hi>one God</hi> is the God of them <hi>both.</hi> To adopt the words in Malachy ii. 10. <hi>Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Yea, the ſame good and kind and merciful God and father made all.</hi> So then we ſee the bleſſed God ſtands in ſame near and tender relation to the whole human race.</p>
            <p>Again— 2dly, The <hi>mediator is alſo one. One mediator,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>between God and man.</hi> Here again, all men are recapitulated and headed in one, who is the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017489_0011_0FA123A4B594A8D8"/>
mediator of reconciliation, and of all communion of good from God to man, in whom, as ſuch, all men have joint and equal intereſt. He is not ſtyled a <hi>Mediator</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Elect,</hi> but between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> that is, <hi>All Men,</hi> All that come under the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men, as they have an intereſt in the great God as their common father, ſo have they in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt as their common mediator. Under this character, he is not nearer to one part of the human race than another. So that <hi>all men</hi> are under an equally gracious counſel and deſign of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, This mediator <hi>gave himſelf a ranſom for all.</hi> Theſe words can ſignify no leſs than <hi>general redemption. God wills that all men ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and therefore, he has given <hi>his ſon a ranſom for all.</hi> Here a price is paid down, ſuch as juſtice required, and God was pleaſed to accept. And this <hi>univerſal ranſom</hi> is what the <hi>myſtical Jews</hi> can no more bear now, than the <hi>literal Jews</hi> could hear of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being taken into the covenant of Abraham. One would imagine the apoſtle foreſaw what a grudging ſpirit would prevail in the world. But the ſcriptures of the New Teſtament ſpeak yet more fully as touching this point. See Titus ii. 11. <hi>The grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation to all men, hath appeared,</hi> &amp;c. i Tim. iv. 10. Rom. v. 18. 1 John ii. 2. <hi>If any man ſin we have an advocate with the father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for</hi> OUR <hi>ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the</hi> WHOLE WORLD. A text ſo worded, with a <hi>Not Only,</hi> and the <hi>Whole World,</hi> looks as if the ſpirit had purpoſely conſulted to obviate and prevent all clippings of it.</p>
            <p>But to come to the argument: From hence it will be ſaid, what tho' <hi>Chriſt gives himſelf a ranſom for all,</hi> we ſee yet all men, nay the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of men, have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017489_0012_0FA123A5701A58A8"/>
no benefit by it, but live and die unreconciled to God. It is granted; but becauſe this redemption, this ranſom does not operate now, have we authority to ſay it never ſhall? The blood of Chriſt never loſes its virtue. Tho' the happy effects of his undertaking may not yet appear, yet the time will come when they ſhall be univerſally felt, and moſt illuſtriouſly diſplayed. For which reaſon the apoſtle adds—<hi>to be teſtified in due time.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. Paul is—that there ſhall be a time, when it will be manifeſt that <hi>all men</hi> are ranſomed and bought by the blood of Chriſt. God will not deny his ſon the price of his blood. But before he gives up the kingdom, he ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul and be ſatisfied. The reconciliation ſhall finally operate upon all, and if the <hi>Elect</hi> are firſt received to favour, the reſt ſhall follow after in their proper order."</p>
            <p>Another text produced by our author is in 1 Tim. iv. 10. <hi>The living God, who is the ſaviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi>" Nothing could be more to our purpoſe than theſe words. They imply that God is the common ſaviour of the whole human race, and yet that he is <hi>particularly</hi> ſo of them that believe the goſpel of his ſon. But the queſtion here is, what this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> imports, <hi>chiefly</hi> of them that believe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is, that ſome, even of thoſe that believe, have the advantage of the reſt of men: Before we look further let us take what this place affords. And the ſpecial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>believers</hi> above other men is, that they are ſaved from the wrath to come, ſaved in the next ſtate, and immediately upon the coming of Chriſt, are admitted to the heavenly happineſs. Others muſt ſtay for this; being unqualified for ſuch felicity, they muſt wait till they are bro't to a better temper of mind. Yet this does not prove that God is not <hi>their</hi> ſaviour; becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017489_0013_0FA123A7585E72F8"/>
them to ſuffering, he has not caſt them off. If you will turn to 1 Cor. xv. 22. &amp;c. and, you will ſee this matter fully cleared up. <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive, but every one in his own order, Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſt's at his coming: And when he ſhall have put down all rule, authority and power, cometh the end.</hi> The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſing from hence is, that believers will be raiſed to everlaſting life at Chriſt's ſecond coming; that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will be raiſed too, but only in order to puniſh them in <hi>hell;</hi> and that when their puniſhment ſhall have produced a proper effect, they will be recovered to the ſame happineſs with the ſaints. This being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, Chriſt having completed his undertaking will give up the kingdom to the Father.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid it appears that this term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not quieſcent, idle, or inſignificant, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a great difference between believers and others; yet not excluding the reſt altogether, or forever, from ſalvation; nay it ſtrongly implies the contrary, it implies that <hi>all</hi> are or muſt be ſaved in one degree or another, and at ſome time or another."</p>
            <p>The ingenious Mr. <hi>White</hi> purſues his ſubject, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring us next to Romans v. from the 15th to the 19th verſe. <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift: for if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017489_0014_0FA123A7B08E8EA8"/>
as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto juſtification of life. For as by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"In theſe words, the gracious deſigns of God are laid open at large. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are oppoſed to each other; the one as the ſource of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> the other of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to the human race. Between theſe two, there is a parallel drawn by the apoſtle, ſhewing wherein they agree, and wherein they differ. They agree in this, that they each, by turns, repreſented mankind, and greatly affected thoſe they repreſented, by their conduct. And in this they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially differ, that one will be the occaſion of much more <hi>good</hi> than the other was of <hi>hurt</hi> to the human ſpecies. For thus we read, ver. 15. <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift, for if through the offence of one many be dead,</hi> MUCH MORE <hi>the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath abounded unto many.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive other meaning of theſe words than this. <hi>That there is much more in the heart of God to make men righteous by the ſecond Adam, without their own perſonal merit, than to make men ſinners by the firſt Adam, without their perſonal demerit:</hi> Here you ſee, <hi>grace</hi> has the <hi>preference,</hi> in the plot, God hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, but more to glorify his <hi>grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond difference is in the compariſon inſtituted between the one ſin of Adam, charged upon all <hi>his</hi> ſeed, and the abundance of Chriſt's righteouſneſs imputed to <hi>his</hi> ſeed. It was but one ſlip, one tranſgreſſion, and that was the eating forbidden fruit, that men ſmart for to this day; but Chriſt performed <hi>many acts of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> he was all righteous, and therefore our many
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017489_0015_0FA123A871886798"/>
offences are forgiven, and they who "receive abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace; and the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one man Jeſus Chriſt." ver. 16, 17. yea, ver. 18. The apoſtle extends the reſpect and relation of this to <hi>all men</hi>; therefore, ſays he, <hi>as by the offence of one judgment came upon all to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi> This is directly to my general argument. There is one offence upon <hi>all men</hi> to condemnation, and the righteouſneſs of one upon <hi>all men</hi> to juſtification. Tho' it is true, none but thoſe who <hi>now</hi> lay hold on it, have the <hi>immediate benefit</hi> of it yet, it was a price paid for <hi>all,</hi> and that many other ſcriptures do atteſt. And therefore the <hi>many,</hi> in the next verſe, is not a bounding or limitation of the ſcope and intention of Chriſt's death, but it is equivalent to the <hi>all</hi> before, elſe it ſhould be leſs than the ſeverity, for <hi>all died in Adam</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, <hi>in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> For as the grace and righteouſneſs of the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> are much more than the ſin of the <hi>firſt,</hi> ſo the extent of them, with reſpect to the ſubject that reaps the benefit, cannot be ſuppoſed to be <hi>leſs.</hi> We conclude therefore, with the apoſtle that <hi>as ſin hath reigned univerſally unto death, ſo grace ſhall reign through righteouſneſs as univerſally, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Grace</hi> will triumph at laſt. Though Chriſt has not yet reigned ſo powerfully, as to bring into effect all theſe glorious advantages of his death, yet he will do it before the end; for he <hi>muſt reign till he has put all enemies under his feet.</hi> And will not that <hi>end,</hi> when he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even his father, when he ſhall have deſtroyed <hi>all the works of the Devil,</hi> when he ſhall have exhibited acts of the greateſt and moſt <hi>univerſal</hi> grace, be viewed with admiration by the whole intelligent creation, and celebrated with the loudeſt anthems of praiſe!"</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017489_0016_0FA123A930311110"/>The laſt quotation I ſhall make from <hi>Mr. White</hi> is has remarks upon Eph. i. 10. and Col. i. 20. <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> This is the <hi>myſtery</hi> of his will made known to us by the goſpel, according to <hi>his good pleaſure which he hath purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> To this join Col. i. 20. <hi>And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf, by him. I ſay, whether they be things on earth, or things in heaven.</hi> "The words rendered here to <hi>gather together in one,</hi> ſignify in the original, to <hi>rally</hi> or <hi>rehead</hi> routed or ſcattered forces or members, to reduce them to the place or rank where they were before. And the word which is rendered to <hi>reconcile</hi> ſignifies to <hi>change</hi> a thing from a ſtate of enmity to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; to make it <hi>another thing</hi> from what it was. It has the ſame force with the other word, tho' from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent metaphor. They both import, that <hi>all men,</hi> all things were originally made by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtood in him, were headed under him, comported dutifully with their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. There was no war, no fighting, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Theſe all came in by ſin: therefore be ſaith, <hi>Chriſt made peace by the blood of his croſs.</hi> By the fall, all things had fallen aſunder, became disjointed, knew not their proper place or ſubordination. Confuſion dwelt upon the face both of the natural and moral world. Every thing was diſordered, and as it were, in a ſtate of war. <hi>Elect</hi> as well as <hi>Reprobate,</hi> things in <hi>heaven,</hi> as well as things on <hi>earth,</hi> were in a miſerable ſhattered condition. But God, who is rich in mercy, ſent his Son to recover them out of this ſtate. And he has laid an effectual plan for it. He has ſtruck at the <hi>root of the miſchief.</hi> By taking upon him our ſins, and expiating them on the tree, he has reconciled the world unto God,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017489_0017_0FA123A9F0631D90"/>
ſlain the enmity between them, and made proviſion for an <hi>Univerſal reſtoration to favour.</hi> The ſubject-matter upon which God means to act is evidently <hi>univerſal.</hi> This is expreſſed by the <hi>comprehenſive</hi> term ALL THINGS. And when he ſays <hi>all things,</hi> it is manifeſt <hi>nothing is excepted.</hi> There is nothing either in heaven or earth which ſhall not finally be reconciled to God, and be reduced to a proper ſtate of ſubjection.</p>
            <p>And is there not power in the life and reign of Chriſt to do it? Is he not fully able to bring <hi>all things</hi> back to himſelf, as their proper head, and to continue them ſo? Surely he is. And when he has once recovered them to himſelf, it will appear that none are able to tear them from him. What the Father has deſigned, he will execute, and, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their joint operation, <hi>all things</hi> will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated from their preſent confuſion, reſtored to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and favour, and continue ſo throughout the endleſs ages of eternity!</p>
            <p>This recapitulation of <hi>all things</hi> under Chriſt, and <hi>univerſal reſtoration</hi> to favour, were the <hi>myſtery</hi> which was hid from the beginning of the world till the time of the goſpel. God did not declare it openly till the coming of his ſon. He gave ſecret intimations of it in former diſpenſations. But a complete diſcovery of his merciful intentions to the whole race of Adam was reſerved for the goſpel. And the time will come, when the <hi>myſtery</hi> of life and ſalvation ſhall be manifeſted upon <hi>all men,</hi> when <hi>all men</hi> ſhall know the fellowſhip of it.

For he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith, all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi> Upon which our writer obſerves,—</p>
            <p>"Though the apoſtle turns our view, in this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, to the END of the <hi>mediatory ſcheme,</hi> the time when <hi>Chriſt ſhall have delivered the kingdom up to the Father,</hi> he has yet very evidently taken care to do it in ſuch a manner, as to guard us againſt thinking, that this ſcheme will be finiſhed, will come to its intended period, upon the <hi>ſecond advent of Chriſt,</hi> by his then <hi>finally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably</hi> fixing the ſtates of men, whether good or bad. The apoſtle, I ſay, as though he had it in expreſs view, has taken all reaſonable care to guard againſt this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction of his meaning, by giving us very clearly and fully to underſtand, that there would be a <hi>great deal to be done, after the ſecond coming of Chriſt,</hi> for the accompliſhment of which, a <hi>long period of time</hi> would be requiſite, before the plan of God would be compleated, and the whole accompliſhed, which he had truſted to his Son to bring into effect. For 'tis here moſt peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily affirmed, that <hi>univerſal ſubjection to Chriſt</hi> ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017489_0019_0FA123AB751A8F08"/>
yet be effected; and the affirmation is expreſſed in a variety of as ſtrong and extenſive terms as could have been uſed: <hi>as by putting down all rule, and all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and all power; by putting all enemies under his feet; by putting all things under his feet; by all things being ſubject unto him. All enemies</hi> then, yea, <hi>all things</hi> muſt be ſubject unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before <hi>he delivers up the mediatory kingdom to his Father.</hi> This will not be accompliſhed at his <hi>ſecond coming.</hi> For however true it is that the <hi>firſt death</hi> will then be deſtroyed by him, it is not the truth that all enemies will be ſubjected to him; for SIN, the very enemy he came into the world to deſtroy ſtill reigns and triumphs, and <hi>will</hi> do ſo, in regard to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. Nor will the <hi>ſecond death</hi> be ever deſtroyed, tho' the greateſt enemy of man, if Chriſt, at his ſecond coming to judge the world, puts off his character as its ſaviour.</p>
            <p>It need not now be ſaid, what a poor, low idea the <hi>common explanation</hi> of this ſcripture paſſage gives us of the <hi>final effect</hi> of Chriſt's reign in his mediatorial king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in compariſon with that contended for in the above interpretation. According to this, <hi>Sin, Satan,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> as well as the <hi>firſt</hi> death, will be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed; and the <hi>whole human race</hi> reduced under a <hi>free,</hi> and yet <hi>full</hi> ſubjection to the government of God, ſo as to be the <hi>meet objects of his mercy,</hi> when he ſhall <hi>finally</hi> take <hi>the kingdom into his own hands.</hi> Whereas, according to the other, <hi>myriads</hi> of the ſons of Adam will be <hi>everlaſting confined</hi> in hell, as REBELS againſt the government of God, that is the moral enemies of his kingdom, notwithſtanding it is here moſt peremptorily affirmed, that <hi>all enemies ſhall be ſubdued;</hi> that <hi>all things ſhall be put under the

            <p>Another text produced by the ſame writer, is the <hi>very firſt</hi> that reveals the promiſe of a ſaviour, and <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi> comprehends the <hi>whole</hi> of what has been ſaid concerning the <hi>reduction of mankind univerſally</hi> to an <hi>obedient ſubjection</hi> to the governing will of God. The text is that Geneſis iii. 15.—<hi>And I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Expoſitors ſeem univerſally agreed, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was <hi>born of a woman,</hi> is the <hi>ſeed</hi> here intended.

For the words are evidently an alluſion to the way of <hi>deſtroying</hi> ſerpents, by ſtriking at their head. To <hi>bruiſe a ſerpent's head</hi> is a phraſe expreſſive of <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> thing with <hi>killing a ſerpent.</hi> Conſequently, when it is ſaid of Chriſt, that he ſhould <hi>bruiſe the ſerpent's head,</hi> the idea obviouſly and naturally communicated by the words, is that he <hi>ſhall deſtroy the Devil,</hi> not his <hi>being,</hi> but that <hi>kingdom of his,</hi> which as a <hi>tempter,</hi> he had introduced into the world, accompanied with <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> I ſee not, but this <hi>firſt promiſe</hi> of God fairly leads us to look for the time, when <hi>ſin, that work of the Devil,</hi> ſhall be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed, by him who was <hi>born of a woman.</hi> This is certainly the moſt ſimple and plain conſtruction that can be put upon the words, if they refer to Chriſt, and his <hi>conqueſt of the Devil,</hi> that is, of the <hi>kingdom of ſin,</hi> he has been an inſtrument of introducing into the world. So that the whole of what
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017489_0021_0FA123AE71D850A0"/>
has been offered is nothing more than an enlargement upon that, which was <hi>ſummarily,</hi> and in a few ſtrongly expreſſive words, delivered as the <hi>grand intention</hi> of God, in conſtituting his ſon Jeſus the ſaviour of men. And I muſt freely acknowledge, if the time does not come before Chriſt's delivery of the kingdom to the Father, when it ſhall be true in <hi>event</hi> and <hi>fact,</hi> that SIN is totally <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> by a reduction of <hi>all men</hi> under <hi>moral ſubjection</hi> to God, that it ought to be fairly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly owned, that he has not <hi>bruiſed the ſerpent's head,</hi> as it is declared that he ſhould. How can it be, that the <hi>Devil,</hi> that is, his <hi>kingdom,</hi> which <hi>eſſentially</hi> conſiſts in the reign of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>luſt,</hi> is deſtroyed by Chriſt, while thouſands and millions of the human race, not only in the preſent ſtate, but throughout all eternity (as is the commonly received opinion) will live in <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God,</hi> retaining their character as <hi>rebels</hi> againſt <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>ſubjects of the Devil's kingdom?</hi> How this ſhould be appears to me impoſſible!"</p>
            <p>Another text from this ſame writer, and the laſt I ſhall bring to view, is recorded Revelation v. 13. <hi>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I ſaying, bleſſing and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words, our author obſerves,—"evidently look forward to the <hi>completion</hi> of the ſcheme of God with reference to mankind, or to the time of God's being <hi>all in all.</hi> The <hi>ſinleſs intelligences above</hi> are brought in as uniting with the <hi>whole race of Adam,</hi> in aſcribing the glory of their <hi>reſtitution,</hi> or <hi>redemption,</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:017489_0022_0FA123AF340D3200"/>
who contrived the plan of it, and to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the perſon, under God, that carried it into execution. And that mankind, <hi>univerſally,</hi> are the perſons ſinging this hymn of praiſe, in concert with the holy angels of heaven, is evident, as I imagine, beyond all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpute, from the <hi>enumeration</hi> here made, which is in the fulleſt and moſt extenſive terms. For, not only the creatures which are in heaven, but thoſe alſo which are <hi>on earth,</hi> and <hi>under the earth,</hi> and <hi>in the ſea,</hi> are the creatures the apoſtle John ſaw bowing down in <hi>voluntary</hi> acts of homage, and <hi>thankful adorations,</hi> before <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the great benefit of <hi>redemption,</hi> or <hi>ſalvation.</hi> And, as though ſufficiently extenſive language had not been uſed, in the above enumeration, 'tis further added, <hi>and all that are in them.</hi> If the apoſtle, or rather the Spirit of God, who ſpake by him, had really intended to have introduced the <hi>whole human kind,</hi> together with the angels, as aſcribing thankſgiving and bleſſing to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>lamb,</hi> for their <hi>reſtoration, reduction,</hi> or <hi>ſalvation,</hi> how could he have done in words that more eaſily and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly convey this ſenſe? For the <hi>whole human kind</hi> are to be found in the places here ſpecified; and the ſpecification of theſe places which contain them <hi>all</hi> is a ſure argument that he intended to comprehend them <hi>all.</hi> Why elſe ſhould he be thus particular in ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? In ſhort, the <hi>creatures</hi> the apoſtle John ſaw paying their thankful acknowledgments, together with the angels, for the ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, were the <hi>whole poſterity of Adam, mankind,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For he here uſes language which comprehends all that <hi>live on the earth, all that ever died on it, and were buried under it; all that ever died on the ſea and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017489_0023_0FA123AFF1534608"/>
were thrown into it.</hi> And if <hi>every creature that lives on the earth, and every creature that is in the ſtate of the dead</hi> does not comprehend <hi>mankind univerſally,</hi> 'tis difficult to find words that can do it."</p>
            <p>Having extracted from a number of writers, ſome <hi>few,</hi> of the many texts they have mentioned in favour of <hi>Salvation for all men,</hi> I ſhall now exhibit <hi>a like extract</hi> from what they and others have offered in anſwer to the objections brought againſt the truth of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that the puniſhment of wicked men in the other world, is frequently declared in ſcripture to be <hi>eternal, everlaſting, for ever and ever;</hi> the conſequence of which is, that 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Mr. Joſeph Nicol Scott, in anſwer to this objection, ſays—"for my own part, I muſt frankly confeſs, that after having, with repeated care, examined <hi>all</hi> the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſcripture, that relate to the <hi>future puniſhment,</hi> I have not been able to find <hi>one ſingle text,</hi> in which this article of <hi>an eternal and endleſs miſery</hi> is either <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly affirmed,</hi> or <hi>neceſſarily implied.</hi> And as to the term ſo commonly tranſlated <hi>eternal, everlaſting, for ever and ever,</hi> it does not from any force of the word, imply what we mean by a <hi>ſtrict and proper eternity.</hi> The original words, both in the Hebrew and Greek, ſignify nothing more than an <hi>age,</hi> and in the plural <hi>ages,</hi> either <hi>longer</hi> or <hi>ſhorter, definite</hi> or <hi>indefinite.</hi>" Says another writer upon this ſubject, "there are hundreds of texts, in the old and new teſtament, in which this word, tranſlated eternal and forever, cannot poſſibly mean more than a <hi>definite</hi> or <hi>indefinite duration,</hi> which may not be <hi>eternal.</hi> Gen. ix. 12. <hi>This</hi> (the rain-bow) <hi>is the token of the covenant
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017489_0024_0FA123B0B0228A50"/>
between me and you, for</hi> PERPETUAL GENERATIONS. In the original it is, if tranſlated as the word is elſewhere, —for <hi>eternal generations.</hi> Gen. xiii. 15. <hi>All the land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed</hi> FOR EVER. Gen. xvii. 8. <hi>I will give unto thee</hi> and to thy ſeed, all the land of Canaan for an EVERLASTING POSSESSION. In the 13th ver. <hi>He that is born in thy houſe, muſt needs be circumciſed, and my covenant ſhall be in your fleſh for an</hi> EVERLASTING COVENANT. Exod. xii. 24. <hi>And ye ſhall obſerve this thing</hi> (the paſſover) <hi>for an ordinance to thee and to thy ſons</hi> FOREVER. But there is no end of citing <hi>ordinances, ſtatutes</hi> or <hi>grants,</hi> which were to be <hi>eternal, everlaſting</hi> and <hi>forever</hi> in our modern way of interpreting the <hi>original</hi> ſcripture words, which yet were to laſt no longer, at the utmoſt, than the Moſaic Oeconomy, and have ceaſed more than 1600 Years ago."</p>
            <p>"And the ſame uſe of theſe words is retained in the New-Teſtament, as may be ſeen by the following texts. Matth. xxviii. 20. <hi>Lo I am with you even to the end of the world:</hi> So the Engliſh tranſlation is, becauſe the tranſlators found it neceſſary. But had they tranſlated the Greek word here, as in other places, it muſt have been to the <hi>end of eternity.</hi> The evangeliſt Luke ſpeaks of <hi>holy prophets which have been ſince the world began.</hi> But had the original been rendered, as in other places, it muſt have been <hi>from eternity.</hi> I ſhall take up no more time and room in citing texts to the purpoſe we are upon. The reader may, if he pleaſes, look into the <hi>Greek Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance,</hi> and he will there find, a greater number than he can well imagine." I ſhall only ſay further here, from Dr. <hi>Hartley,</hi> that "it does not appear from the writings of the moſt ancient fathers, that they conſtrued the texts that ſpeak of the future puniſhment in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017489_0025_0FA123B174DA9BF0"/>
               <hi>never-ending</hi> ſenſe. And the omiſſion of this ſenſe, in the <hi>ancient creeds,</hi> ſhews that it was no <hi>original doctrine.</hi> And indeed the doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as now taught by the papiſts, ſeems to be a corruption of a genuine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine held by the ancient fathers, concerning that <hi>fire of hell</hi> which will <hi>burn out Sin and Luſt.</hi>" He adds, "it may be, that the <hi>abſolute eternity</hi> of puniſhment was not received, till after the introduction of metaphyſical diſputes concerning time, eternity, and the ways of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing theſe; that is, not till after the <hi>pagan philoſophy</hi> and <hi>vain deceit</hi> had mixed themſelves with, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Chriſtianity."</p>
            <p>"Another text applicable to our purpoſe, is Gal. i. 4. <hi>That he might deliver us from this preſent evil world.</hi> Had the original been rendered as in other places, it would have been—<hi>from this preſent evil eternity,</hi> which is palpable nonſenſe. The ſame may be ſaid of Luke xvi. 8. <hi>The children of this world are wiſer,</hi> &amp;c. In the Greek it is, <hi>the children of this Eternity,</hi> which the tranſlators knew would be an improper and abſurd ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the <hi>Original Word.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"It is objected, that the word <hi>eternal,</hi> the <hi>very word</hi> which is connected with the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of wicked men, is applied to <hi>God,</hi> repreſenting <hi>his ſtrict proper eternity;</hi> for which reaſon we may conclude, that the <hi>miſery</hi> of ſinners, in the other world, will be <hi>endleſs,</hi> and therefore, inconſiſtent with their being finally ſaved."</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this objection, a great number of writers upon the ſubject, unite in ſaying,—"that the <hi>eternity</hi> of God cannot be argued from the mere force of the word rendered <hi>eternal.</hi> As it ſignifies duration either <hi>definite</hi> or <hi>indefinite,</hi> it may be applied as well to that which has <hi>no end,</hi> as to that which is of a determinate continuance.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017489_0026_0FA123B234E96130"/>
But then, it is the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> and not the <hi>mere force</hi> of the word that muſt aſcertain its meaning. And did we not know, before hand, that <hi>eternity</hi> was an eſſential attribute of God, it could never be argued from the application of this word to him."</p>
            <p>"It is again objected, that the <hi>happineſs</hi> of good men, and the <hi>miſery</hi> of the wicked, are both connected with the <hi>ſame word,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame ſentence.</hi> And hence, if <hi>one</hi> is <hi>endleſs,</hi> ſo muſt the <hi>other</hi> be alſo."</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, that "the <hi>bare force</hi> of the word will not ſupport us, in maintaining an <hi>endleſs duration</hi> with reſpect, either to the <hi>happineſs</hi> of the <hi>righteous</hi> ſhall be <hi>happy forever.</hi> And why! becauſe they are ſaid, in other texts of ſcripture, to be <hi>incorruptible, indiſſoluble, immortal,</hi> not to <hi>die any more,</hi> and the like. But theſe terms are no where, in the inſpired pages, applied to the <hi>wicked.</hi> On the contrary they are ſaid to <hi>die the ſecond death,</hi> which means their ſuffering the <hi>future torments,</hi> which they may do, and yet be finally ſaved, as has been proved."</p>
            <p>"Another objection, and, in the opinion of ſome, the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> that can be urged, is taken from thoſe words of our Saviour in Mark ixth, thrice ſolemnly repeated,—WHERE THEIR WORM DIETH NOT, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED; which words, it is thought, are irreconcilable with the doctrine of <hi>Salvation for all men.</hi>"</p>
            <p>In anſwer hereto, it is ſaid by one and another of the before mentioned writers, that "this declaration of our Saviour can prove, in ſtrict argument, no more than that the <hi>torments of the wicked ſhall laſt as long as
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017489_0027_0FA123B2F3F8F268"/>
their next ſtate of exiſtence laſts,</hi> without determining <hi>how long</hi> that ſhall be. If their worm preys upon them, without ceaſing, <hi>as long as they are in hell,</hi> it is to them, ſtrictly and rigidly ſpeaking, a <hi>worm that does not die.</hi> So if the fire torments them <hi>as long as they exiſt in the next ſtate,</hi> it is to them <hi>a fire which is not quenched,</hi> though their exiſtence in that ſtate may not be <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eternal.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"But the moſt plain, eaſy and ſatisfactory anſwer is—that theſe words are taken from the book of <hi>Iſaiah's prophecy,</hi> and allude to the puniſhment of thoſe, whoſe bodies were either buried in the valley of Hinnom, or permitted to lie on the ground in the form of <hi>dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> to be fed upon by worms, that delight in putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And conſequently, as the <hi>fire</hi> which <hi>burned</hi> theſe bodies, and the worms that fed on them, can in no ſenſe be ſaid <hi>not to be quenched,</hi> and <hi>not to die,</hi> than this, that they continued till theſe <hi>carcaſes were conſumed;</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of the <hi>worm</hi> that preys on the wicked in <hi>hell,</hi> and of the <hi>fire</hi> that <hi>torments</hi> them, that the <hi>one dieth not,</hi> and the <hi>other is not quenched,</hi> till they have certainly effected the <hi>diſſolution,</hi> or <hi>death</hi> of wicked men, in the future ſtate. If any deſire to ſee a more full and large account of this text, they may find it in Mr. Joſeph Nicol Scott's diſcourſe upon the <hi>future torments,</hi> in the 2d Vol. of his Sermons."</p>
            <p>"It is objected yet further, that it will greatly tend to encourage wicked men, in their vicious courſes, to be told that the <hi>future torments</hi> will have an <hi>end,</hi> which muſt be the caſe, if <hi>All are finally ſaved.</hi>"</p>
            <p>To this it is anſwered, that "<hi>moral depravity</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconſiſtent with <hi>rational happineſs:</hi> and that the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017489_0028_0FA123B3B88E5CF0"/>
               <hi>ſuffering</hi> of wicked men, in the next ſtate, will be <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly great</hi> in <hi>degree,</hi> as well as <hi>long</hi> in <hi>duration,</hi> in order that they may be made the <hi>willing people of God.</hi> Nor will they be delivered from their <hi>ſuffering,</hi> till this is effected. And will it not argue folly, as great as can be imagined, for any rather than not <hi>proceed in their vicious courſes,</hi> to chuſe to expoſe themſelves to pain, <hi>unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pain, for a long duration</hi> (God only knows how long) when they might, only by approving themſelves faithful ſubjects to Jeſus Chriſt, paſs, without ſuffering this pain, into the joys of the <hi>reſurrection ſtate?</hi> And this folly will deſerve the name of <hi>downright madneſs,</hi> if it be remembered, they muſt ceaſe from <hi>being wicked,</hi> before they can poſſibly be inſtated in <hi>final happineſs.</hi> There is no room for debate here. Perſons muſt act in contradiction to all wiſdom, in defiance of common ſenſe, who will venture, for the ſhort lived pleaſures of ſin, to expoſe themſelves to that <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>hell</hi> which will effect their <hi>death a ſecond time,</hi> under all the circumſtances of <hi>lingering horror</hi> and <hi>tormenting agony:</hi> eſpecially if it be conſidered they may avoid all this by renouncing their ſins, and be admitted to <hi>immortal life and happineſs at the reſurrection morn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, it may be worthy of conſideration, whether the <hi>common doctrine</hi> is ſo likely to reſtrain men from ſin, as <hi>that,</hi> which has been explained and defended, in the foregoing pages. 'Tis undeniably certain, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that has been ſaid to make men believe the <hi>torments of hell will have no end,</hi> that they generally <hi>walk in the way of their own heart,</hi> and will not be kept under due reſtraint. And perhaps, upon examination, it will be found, that one principal reaſon of this is, that the <hi>terrrors</hi> propoſed for their perſuaſion, <hi>exceed their belief.</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:017489_0029_0FA123B475E973E0"/>
The conceptions they <hi>naturally</hi> form of the ALL MERCIFUL BEING are a counter-balance to their fear of <hi>never-ending miſery.</hi> Whereas, in the other ſcheme, there is nothing <hi>incredible,</hi> in the torments of another world. They are perfectly analogous to what is experienced in the <hi>preſent ſtate.</hi> And there is no more reaſon to object againſt them, than the <hi>preſent judicial proceedings</hi> of heaven againſt wicked <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. They are <hi>equally</hi> conſiſtent with mens natural notions of the <hi>benevolence of God.</hi> And conſequently. As pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the above ſcheme, their influence would not be <hi>obſtructed</hi> by their <hi>incredibility:</hi> But they would ſtrike the mind with <hi>full force,</hi> and operate to a much better purpoſe, reſtraining men more <hi>effectually</hi> from their <hi>wicked courſes.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally</hi>—It is ſaid, "upon ſuppoſition of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Univerſal Salvation,</hi> it may yet be <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> to open it, as a ſcripture doctrine to the world." To which I have ſeen the proper anſwer, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>"It would be very <hi>extraordinary,</hi> if ſetting a <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truth</hi> in its genuine light ſhould have a dangerous tendency. To ſuppoſe ſuch a thing would reflect diſhonour upon the <hi>revelation</hi> of God. If <hi>final, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal happineſs</hi> is a <hi>doctrine of the goſpel,</hi> we need not fear its injuring mankind, if they were brought <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely</hi> and <hi>univerſally</hi> to believe it. And indeed, all fear of this kind is founded <hi>ultimately</hi> on <hi>man's wiſdom,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> which ſtands in need of no <hi>human art</hi> or <hi>contrivance,</hi> but can, without it, guard mankind againſt wickedneſs, and make them good and faithful ſubjects, in the kingdom of righteouſneſs."</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, as a concluſion of theſe <hi>extracts,</hi> that, if we ſhall <hi>All,</hi> before the completion of the ſcheme
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017489_0030_0FA123B6A7DD8548"/>
of God, be crowned with <hi>immortality and honour,</hi> what an argument have we for patience, contentment and an entire reſignation to the divine pleaſure, under the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous trials of this frail, vain, mortal ſtate. And how eaſily reconcilable are the <hi>ſufferings of the world to come</hi> with the wiſdom and goodneſs, as well as juſtice of God? And how abſolutely are all complaints upon this head, ſilenced and refuted? For if we are brought into being <hi>expectants</hi> of a <hi>bleſſed immortality,</hi> and upon a foundation that will not diſappoint us, why then ſhould we find fault with that <hi>diſcipline,</hi> however <hi>ſevere,</hi> which may, in true reaſon, be <hi>morally</hi> connected with <hi>the actual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it</hi>? We are, upon this plan of things, <hi>infinitely obliged</hi> to God, and ought to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>thank</hi> him for our being, notwithſtanding all we may be called to paſs through, before we are received into <hi>his preſence above,</hi> where is <hi>fulneſs of joy forever.</hi>
