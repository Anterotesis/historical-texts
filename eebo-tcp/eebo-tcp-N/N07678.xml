            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> Second Part of the <hi>Quakers ASSISTING,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AS I have undertook ro Vindicate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our worthy Citizens, I think there remains ſomething more to advance, to Incomomiſe their Actions; and to ſhew to the World the darefull Conſequences of the others Conduct. We muſt all allow, that we are Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to <hi>England;</hi> our Laws receive their Eſſence, i.e. Their very Life and Being from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws; therefore I ſay, while we are thus ſituated, it is impoſſible to form Laws here Contrary to thoſe Laws: And where our Legiſlative body to agree together, form an Edict, and publiſh it as ſuch, it could have no more Weight or Force here, then a ſingle Blank; becauſe there is nothing to ſupport it; yet we derive from the Eſſence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, a Privelege to make ſuch Acts, as may ſerve our Neceſſities or Occaſions; but when they come upon Compotion with the Royal Laws, they muſt all nuckle into Subordination. I look upon this nearly a ſimelar Caſe with the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their Society Rules: Notwithſtanding they are ſatyriz'd by a ſet of mean envious Lowliv'd Scriblers, I have Tranſcribed in the firſt Place a Law; that was made in Heaven, and given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; a Law that is binding (as I there obſerved) to all Nations of People; a Law that it is impoſſible
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009807_0003_0F7A551FD1A935B0"/>
for Man to be exempt from; he muſt either ſubmit in mercy, or in Judgment: I ſay, this Law is the moſt extenſive and the moſt binding, for the good of Indiveduals, in civil Society, of any Law that ever was Publiſh'd on Earth; i.e. <hi>Whoſoever ſhedeth Man's blood, by Man his blood ſhall be ſhed: If a Stranger or Sojourner live with thee, thou ſhalt love him as thy ſelf.</hi> What can be more binding? Nay the Almighty has been ſo particularly carefull of his Creatures, that he has ſtampt the very Image of this Law in the Heart of every Man, and there it remains (until Men give themſelves up to utter Diſtruction) that a Man cannot ſee his Neighbour in Danger of looſing that Life, which GOD hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ſhall End in the Courſe of Nature, without making him all the help in his Power; no more than he can take it from him: But if an Omiſſion of that ſort ſhould ever happen, what can be more convincing to the World, then that Perſon is, a party concern'd in the murder, or at leaſt conſents to that horrid Crime, which brings him in equally guilty: Theſe are undeniable Facts, and now I come to conſider, the ſeveral Denominations of People, reſpecting worſhip, as they have each of them Rules in their Society, ſuiting their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to keep Matters in a good Decorum among their own Members, which is commendable: Yet when this univerſal Law calls for immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; it's impoſſible the Society, Rules can in any ſort interfear, the one is an act in civil Society, the other only rules in the Religious, the one is Inſtituted by Chriſtians, the other has the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valance over both Chriſtians and Heathens, throughout the World. The one is inſtituted by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009807_0004_0F7A5520B7CA9BA8"/>
the great Creator of the Univerſe, an Irrepealable Law to the End of Time, for the well-being of his Creator's; the other is inſtituted by (ſometimes) well thinking Men, to keep their Members within the Bounds of good order: Then all thoſe Rules, in each Religious Society, that are good, muſt be Conſequents of this Royal Law, and have ſuch a near Unity and Affinity with it, that they Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute mightily to the Propogation and Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, they are ſo incorporated with it, that its impoſſible to ſet them at Variance. How then can any Man be ſo wretchedly blind, as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that any Society of people can form Rules to bar againſt divine Juſtice? well, that's what this <hi>Unmasker</hi> aſſerteth, when he ſaveth; the <hi>Quakers</hi> forſook their Principles in helping to ſave the Lives of their Neighbours: Then, I ſay, agreeable to the Import of his Arguments, or as he would fain have it, and if they had ſtood Neuter, according to his faint Opinion of their Principles, they would not only have bar'd againſt this Divine Law, but would have bid open Defiance to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall now undertake to ſhew the Reader, wherein this Writer has cleared the <hi>Quakers</hi> from all the heavy Charges, he himſelf has thrown upon them; i.e. He ſeemingly Evidenceth againſt them in a Chain of Satyrical invectives, without inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one ſingle Fact: Nay, he proves no one Thing against them, wherein a ſtandard by, can ſay, ill they have done; therefore I ſay, the whole Charge retorts upon himſelf, and he muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

(I ask what has clear'd him?) and anſwer, the Accuſers own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, given before the Bench, which was upon a ſtrict enquiry, no other but ſlanderous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warantable Expreſſions, accompanied with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart againſt his Neighbour; Not one ſingle Fact proved; I look upon this to be a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Caſe with the <hi>Quakers</hi> and this Enemy to all good, who has been Stigmatizing that Society with being guilty of party Rage, publiſhing inflamatary Pamphlets, aſſerting many falſhoods to ſwell the Current of prejudices, nearly a blaſphemer of GOD, and a beliar of the Holy GHOST; but has proved not one of thoſe Charges: Nay he has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one ſingle poſition, that has weight enough in it ſelf, to perſwade me to forbare aſſerting, that they are all poſitive falſhoods. Well, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? Why a ſhower of Rain, falling from the Clouds, muſt lite ſomewere. So muſt theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, that have been uttered, by the Month of one of <hi>Baal</hi>'s prieſts: They cannot be loſt, they muſt lite ſomewere; (I ask were?) He has intirely cleared the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and accuſed none elſe. I anſwer they muſt return to the Place from whence
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009807_0006_0F7A5521F6952CD0"/>
they came; there is none other place for them; i.e. The Dog muſt lick up his own Vomit, and the Hog muſt ſtill wallow in the Mire: And this is all I can find his long written Harrangue proveth, that he himſelf is, (and not the <hi>Quakers,</hi>) the promoter of party Rage, publiſher of inflamatery pamphlets, aſſerting many falſhoods, to ſwell the Current of prejudices, nearly a Blasfamer of GOD, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar of the Holy GHOST. I think the D—l. acted in a very Raſcally manner with this poor fellow; I quite pitty him; it was that Serpent ſet him to work, in the very beginning; dictated his whole writing, which indeed might ſeem ſome Eaſe or Help to him, for the preſent, becauſe he had no more to do, then to write after him, and at that Time doubtleſs ſhewed a great deal of Love and Friendſhip to him; but behold! when his faithful Servants was like to be detected, and the Villan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scheme brought to Light, that old Serpent ſlipt (as the ſaying is) his Neck out of the Halter, and leaves the <hi>Unmasker</hi> a condemned Criminal to anſwer for the whole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well what remains, but to conſider in ſpeculation the Conſequence of that Horrid Act? May not the Hand of Divine Juſtice afflict this Land of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> for the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs blood that was ſhed therein; I mean the blood of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that was ſpilt at <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> with Famine or Peſtilence, for the Tranſgreſſion of <hi>Saul,</hi> in Slaying the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who were in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them. We may read in the 21. Chap. of the ſecond Book of <hi>Samuel, that there was a Famine over the Land of</hi> Judea, <hi>for three Years; and when</hi> David <hi>enquir'd of the Lord into the Cauſe</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009807_0007_0F7A5522AB11D160"/>
               <hi>of it,</hi> the Anſwer was, <hi>it is for</hi> Saul <hi>and his bloody Houſe;</hi> becauſe he ſlew the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> The King then called the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and queried of them what he ſhould do for them? In doing of which he might appeaſe the Wrath of divine Juſtice.) Their anſwer was <hi>the Man that conſumed us and that deviſed againſt us; let ſeven Men of his Sons be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>in</hi> Gibeah <hi>of</hi> Saul: <hi>This being done, the Lord was pleaſed, to bleſs the Land again."</hi> Here we ſee that the Inanimate Earth muſt bear the Curſe of GOD's Wrath, for a Time, untill the Blood of <hi>Saul</hi>'s nigh Relatives made the Aronement, for his Crime. Oh! my eſteemed Citizens, if that ſhould be the Caſe with us, how would you rejoice in ſecret, to feel the unſpeakable Peace, that would ariſe in your Hearts, when Reflecting on that act of Juſtice, in obediance to the Royal Law; I mean the ſaving of the Lives of your Fellow-Creatures. I ſay, it muſt afford hearty Satisfaction, to know yourſelves clear of the Blood of all Men, and that you, by your honeſt Endeavours, and the bleſſing of Heaven, hath protected and preſerved the Lives of more than one hundred of your Neighbours. One other Inſtance I ſhall give; and that was on our own Continent, in <hi>Boſton</hi> Government, where the <hi>Quakers</hi> were uſed in the moſt cruel Manner, that the Serpentine Nature in Man could invent, they bore cruel Whippings, cutting off their Ears, and ſeveral were murdered, and for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then for their faithful obedience to CHRIST. And this was all acted by this <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s dear Brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> Envious, Malicious, Hard-hearted,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009807_0008_0F7A55236A5E3CB8"/>
               <hi>Preſbyterians.</hi> I don't remember ever reading, or bearing tell, that any one <hi>Quaker</hi> was ever put to Death, for his Religious Principles, but in <hi>Boſton</hi> Government: beware, beware, my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, keepthe Reins of Government out of the Hands of <hi>Preſbyterians;</hi> for I believe they never had it, but that one Time, ſince the building of <hi>Babel;</hi> and I pray, they never may have it more, until Time is ſwallowed up in Eternity. Well what follows? Why the Judgment of GOD upon their Land, as I have heard one of their Inhabitants ſay; that the Land about <hi>Boſton</hi> was as agreeable too, and bore, as good Wheat, as any Part of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Colony: But ſince they had put the Quakers to Death, that ſame Ground has never brought fourth any Wheat to perſection. This was in the Year 1659, and whether the Judgment will Terminate here, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom only knows. How convincing muſt theſe Citations be, to every ſolid thinking Man, that our worthy Citizens could have done no one Thing more pleaſing to GOD, then their joining together, as one Man, in Vindicating his Righteous Law, with their Hands and Hearts, lifted up to implore a Bleſſing on their concentious Endeavours; for we ſee, by the above cited Inſtances, that there is no Attonement to be made for Willfull murder, but by ſheding the blood of the Murderer; or the Earth muſt feel the weight of GOD's Wrath.
