         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To thoſe who are acquainted with the merit of Mr. Berquin's firſt publication, for the uſe of Children, which he juſtly entitled the</hi> CHILDREN'S FRIEND, <hi>it will be unneceſſary to advance any other circumſtance in favour of the following work, than that it is the production of the ſame Gentleman, by whom that elegant and moral performance was given to the world. Being calculated for the peruſal of Children of a tender age, it naturally admitted a kind of Sequel or Counterpart, for the inſtruction and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of young perſons, who are rather paſt the period of childhood, and yet may be ſuppoſed incapable of thinking for themſelves. The following Sheets contain what has hitherto been publiſhed entire by the Author, on this plan, under the title of</hi> THE FRIEND OF YOUTH. <hi>It is neceſſary to be obſerved, that this work, in the original, came out, as did the</hi> Children's Friend, <hi>in detached periodical pieces, and therefore has not yet arrived at the ultimate point to which Mr. B. propoſes to continue it. Nevertheleſs, it was thought more adviſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>able, to gratify the impatience of the public, with what is finiſhed of in, than to wait the uncertain arrival of the little which remains to be added.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In order to make amends far this deficiency, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, the Tranſlator has joined the Hiſtory of</hi> Little Grandiſon, <hi>(from which an extract is previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly given in the firſt volume) to the pieces which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Friend of Youth. It was tranſlated from the Dutch by Mr. B. who found it to poſſeſs nearly the ſame ſpirit with his own works, and, therefore,</hi>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:045437_0003_101FFABF38B5A3A0"/>
                     <hi>judged it a proper preſent for thoſe readers to whom be had dedicated his pen. This Gentleman's laudable induſtry, has led him to examine the productions of ſeveral modern languages, and from them, to ſelect ſuch as appeared to anſwer the purpoſe which he had in view. Among the reſt, he has introduced, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing collection, a piece or two from the Engliſh, of which it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that they are here inſerted in the language of the ſeveral originals to which they belonged, as being obviouſly the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dreſs that they could aſſume, and beyond compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the moſt ſatisfactory to an Engliſh reader. No tranſlation can be ſuppoſed capable of conveying the ſpirit and freedom of the original: and this would be found particularly to be the caſe in the latter of the pieces alluded to,</hi> The Narrative of a Shipwreck on the Iſland of Cape-Breton, <hi>which opens the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond volume. The ſubject of this narrative being partly nautical, it would be ſound to ſuffer conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and appear to much leſs advantage, if delivered in any other ſtyle than the Engliſh, in which it was firſt compoſed. Indeed, the abſurdity of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from a foreign language, what would be read with infinitely more ſatisfaction as an original, is ſo apparent, that it does not require any further comment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If a critical inſpection of this work ſhould diſcover ſome of the pieces, in their preſent form, to contain, now and then, a ſlight improbability, it will, no doubt, be attributed to its real cauſe, the difference of national manners. The effect of this circumſtance is ſo important, that a ſmall defect of probability could not abſolutely be avoided in ſome caſes, without mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating againſt both the intent and moral of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:045437_0004_101FFAC1C7AB3DD8"/>
as well as deranging the whole plot and conduct of many of his pieces. An imperfection, which will always be found to ſubſiſt inherently in every perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance like the following, where it is propoſed to adopt, for inſtance, French manners and actions to Engliſh characters. A copyiſt in painting, would, probably, often find it a difficult taſk to ſupport the propriety of any particular action repreſented in a picture, were he obliged to alter the</hi> coſtumé <hi>of the figures exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the original. Thus, it may be preſumed, the picture of an Auguſtan Triumph would not ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſs the ſpectator with an idea of grandeur, were the perſonages in the proceſſion habited like Dutchmen: or, on the other hand, if a company of Roman Senators were repreſented as buſily engaged in the fantaſtical chace of a Pantomime, the mummery of the action would no longer be preſerved, but muſt unavoidably be overclouded with a caſt of ſolemnity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Imaginary actions, therefore, when adapted to one particular national character, are not eaſily transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; or, whenever it is attempted to make them ſo, either the action or the character, is liable to ſuffer a partial diſguiſe, and be ſeen, as it were, through a miſt. In ſuch a caſe, they will, neither of them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the imagination of the reader with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">
                           <desc>•••••</desc>
                        </gap>ively a force, as when they appear with the advantage of their orginal congruity. But this obſervation applies more conſpicuouſly to Novels, where a ſingle moral reſults from a ſeries of complicated actions interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, perhaps, with a variety of epiſodes appending to the main ſtory. I know not whether</hi> Gil Blas, <hi>the</hi> Fortunate Villager, <hi>and a few other novels, may not be adduced as inſtances to elucidate what has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:045437_0005_101FFAC352569C50"/>
remarked: but in a work like the preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſhort pieces, in which we quickly arrive at the moral, and find it generally to conſtitute the moſt leading feature, it is not ſo difficult to accommodate the manners and actions of each perſonage, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uniformity of human life, and to diveſt them of that</hi> nationality <hi>which would be more obſervable in narrative pieces of greater extent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon the whole, it lies with the judicious reader to determine, whether any conſiderable offences againſt veriſimilitude occur, in the following collection. The Tranſlator hopes he has reaſon to conſole himſelf in the reflection, that he has uſed all poſſible diligence to avoid any ſuch; and if, notwithſtanding his endeavours, the cenſure of criticiſm ſhould faſten on a few imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this nature,</hi> quas aut incuria fudit,</p>
                  <p>Aut humana parum cavit Natura, <hi>he has only to ſhelter himſelf behind the well-earned reputation of the Author, whoſe labours, ſo eminently beneficial to youth in general, he has endeavoured par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to adapt to the improvement of the riſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in this country.</hi>

                  <head>THE FICKLE YOUTH.</head>
                  <p>JACK WHIRLER was endowed, by nature, with a happy memory, a ripe underſtanding, and a lively, active, and fruitful imagination. Fortune ſeemed to enſure the accompliſhment of every hope, that could be founded upon ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing qualities, by allotting him parents, whoſe warmeſt wiſhes ever were, to cultivate, in their ſon, that pregnancy of parts, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the hands of nature. An extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary quickneſs of apprehenſion had advanced him, conſiderably, in his tender ſtudies, at an early period, and he was already eager to unite the ornament of exterior accompliſhments, to the more ſolid acquirement of mental inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>It happened, that, on a viſit to one of his young companions, he found him engaged in drawing a Roman head, which, from the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic greatneſs of the countenance, impreſſed him with the moſt lively ſentiments of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As his friend advanced toward the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his portrait, young Whirler felt theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents grow in his mind with additional ardor. Some other pieces, which the room afforded in the ſame ſtyle, completely inſpired him with ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:045437_0008_101FFAE0A2599828"/>
an enthuſiaſm as Raphael experienced on firſt taking the pencil in his hand.</p>
                  <p>He returned home at full ſpeed, and, meeting his father on the ſtairs, he threw his arms fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round him, and requeſted him to go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and engage him a drawing maſter. His father, charmed with the earneſtneſs that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, was eaſily induced to gratify this deſire. They went, therefore, together, to the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated maſter in town; and Jack Whirler would have been happy, could he have prevailed on him to give up all his other pupils, and confine his inſtructions to him alone, from morning to night. As he could not obtain this ſacrifice, he inſiſted, however, that each leſſon ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, at leaſt, two hours every day. He had no conception, how any one could refrain from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting every moment of his life, to the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo divine an art.</p>
                  <p>His maſter was not to come until the next day. I will not tell you how many faces he had ſketched before night. His port-folio was already full of beads, drawn in every poſſible variety of character, though you will certainly excuſe him, if they did not diſcover that correctneſs which is the reſult of lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

There was, perhaps, a large eye, to match a ſmall one, in the ſame face; the noſe was made, ſometimes, to riſe out from the middle of the forehead, and the ear would come to hear the mouth, or the mouth to bite the ear, acroſs the whole breadth of the cheek: but, except theſe trifling faults, his performance had all the correctneſs that could be reaſonably expected.</p>

He had, himſelf, prepared an enormous ſheet of paper, the largeſt that was to be had in town. This was ſoon found too ſmall to contain the number of eyes, ears, arms and legs, that he had ſketched out under the direction of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The hoſpitals of Greenwich and Chelſea, would here have met with excellent patterns to replace all the loſt members of thoſe honeſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans who inhabit them. His natural impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was a little fretted by the tedious ſameneſs of thoſe eſſays, to which, his firſt leſſons were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly confined, in order to ſteady his hand. As ſoon, therefore, as he was alone, he launched out freely, beyond the bounds of this ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, aſpiring already in idea, to the execution of complete and grand pictures. The garret-walls had been newly white-waſhed; he formed the deſign of painting them with the hiſtory of Rome, which he was juſt then reading at ſchool; and, in effect, at the week's end, there appeared drawn upon them, in charcoal, a comely ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heads and buſts of tribunes and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, with dictators a-foot, and emperors on horſeback; and I doubt not, that if the names had been placed under their reſpective figures, in order to render them perfect reſemblances, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>He was propoſing to himſelf to repreſent, in the ſame ſtyle of execution, the progreſs of our hiſtory, down from the conqueſt, when he one day found his whole work effaced by the ſervants,

who pretended, that theſe Roman heroes upon the wall only frightened the cats, but did not drive the mice away. This miſhap a little aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ardor of his paſſion for drawing: his diſappointment at ſeeing himſelf ſtill far behind his young friend, whom he had expected at his firſt attempt to overtake, alienated ſtill more his liking for the art. He preſently grew fearful of dirtying his fingers with the chalks, or, of making gaps in his pen-knife, by cutting them. His maſter, who at firſt had ſo much trouble to moderate his eagerneſs, now found it a more difficult taſk to re-animate it. In vain, did he enumerate to him the wonderful effects of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the curious anecdotes that are found in the lives of the great artiſts. He had introduced to him, a pupil of his, juſt returned from Rome; on purpoſe to entertain him with an account of the ſuperb paintings that he had ſeen and ſtudied in Italy. This young gentleman, in expreſſing his admiration of thoſe performances, made uſe of Italian words, either as being more ready, or more ſignificant; the founds were new to Jack Whirler's ears; and it ſtruck him in a moment, that to ſpeak ſo melodious a language was a much finer thing, than to draw heads; which, let them be ever ſo expreſſive, could not talk. He ran immediately to communicate this reflection to his father, who, though grieved to ſee him thus quit an agreeable accompliſhment, of which he had before been ſo paſſionately deſirous, did not however chuſe to oppoſe this new taſte of his; and the next day, Jack Whirler had an Italian maſter, in the room of his teacher in drawing.</p>

I muſt do Jack the juſtice thus publicly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that his progreſs for the firſt two or three days kept pace with his reſolution. Every gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical difficulty gave way to the quickneſs of his comprehenſion. He grew fond to enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm of a language ſo full of ſweetneſs and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and was inceſſantly talking it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the family, without troubling his head whether they could underſtand it. He addreſſed the cockmaid with <hi>Voſtra Signoria,</hi> and called the gardener <hi>Cor mio.</hi> The Italian tranſlation of<note n="*" place="bottom">The Tragedy of Cato, written by Mr. Addiſon, was tranſlated into Italian by Salvini, and acted at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> Cato became as familiar to him as the original. In examining his father's library for authors in this language, he laid his hands by chance on a Spaniſh Don Quixote. Don Quixote! the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite of his earlieſt ſtudies! Oh! what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be able to taſte the droll proverbs of his honeſt 'ſquire, when ſeaſoned with all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of their native language! Cato's grave ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy was not to be compared to the delectable ſallies of Sancho; nor the little ſenate of Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, to the council-chamber of the Baratarian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. This undertaking, however, required courage. Here he was to engage inceſſantly with ſtrange words, like the knight of the rueful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llage with windmills and flocks of ſheep. He came off, however, with at leaſt as much honor as the knight in this firſt campaign. But will you believe me? Before the hero of La Mancha had ſallied forth a ſecond time in queſt of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

Jack Whirler had quitted the Spaniſh to learn French, which he ſoon gave up in order to ſtudy the German. So that at the end of the year he was already a ſmatterer in four living lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, but ſo imperfect was he in each, and jumbled them together in his diſcourſe after ſuch a faſhion, that he ſhould have had an audience compoſed of deputies from theſe different nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to interpret one to the other the unconnect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcraps and phraſes that each might happen to underſtand in his converſation.</p>
                  <p>Dexterity in exerciſes of the body ſeems to lend both help and ornament to a well cultivated mind, and the moſt extenſive knowledge will not atone for awkwardneſs, in the eyes of the fairer part of ſociety. Jack Whirler had met with a diſagreeable proof of this, at a ball which was given by his papa on ſome particular occaſion. In the courſe of this, Jack, notwithſtanding his erudition, had put all the dancers out ſeveral times. He therefore reſolved to inſtruct himſelf in the principles of this agreeable art; but ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had he begun the minuet ſteps, when his head ran upon the rigadoon, and nothing elſe. What he moſt earneſtly wiſhed to learn in each leſſon was exactly the part of dancing that he ſhould not be taught as yet. Always eager after what he did not know, and diſſatisfied with what he had learned, he could lay up nothing in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with the leaſt order. Thus he would ſometimes <hi>figure in</hi> when he ſhould <hi>croſs over,</hi> and <hi>ſhuffle</hi> when he ſhould <hi>ſink.</hi> He found no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in dancing the hays when the company ſet out with a cotillion, nor had he ever occaſion for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:045437_0013_1020273EB9FCCD88"/>
a change of time in the muſic to ſtart off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Scotch reel, while he left his partner moving a minuet.</p>
                  <p>All this, it may be ſuppoſed, produced no ſmall confuſion among the young people his companions of the dance; in order therefore to reinſtate himſelf in the favor of the ladies, which he had loſt by this abſent and volatile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he ſet about learning muſic, that he might be able to accompany either the voice or the harpſichord. But what inſtrument ſhould he attempt firſt? To take his word for it, there was nothing eaſier in the world than to practiſe them all at once. However his father did not think proper to riſk this experiment, and gave him only the liberty of chuſing his inſtrument. While he was uncertain as to this point, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olin ſeemed a proper one to take in hand by way of trial, and it was not till ſix months after, that he fixed his choice decidedly on the flute, juſt as he began to attempt an open ſhake, and to bow with tolerable ſteadineſs.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time his father grew ſomewhat uneaſy on obſerving this unſettled and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition of his ſon, though a parent's fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs induced him to attribute the fault to youth alone. With a view therefore to advance the improvement of his underſtanding by obſervation and experience, he determined to ſend him upon a tour to the continent. Jack Whirler deſired no better than to ſhift the ſcene. The narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of travellers had always been a favorite reading with him, and his imagination had a thouſand times tranſported him to the countries
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:045437_0014_10202747A844A7A0"/>
which they deſcribe. A young friend of his, who was juſt returned from France, gave him ſo favorable an account of the reception that he had found in that country, and drew ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a picture of the improved ſtate of arts and ſociety there; deſcribed in ſo warm terms the engaging vivacity and elegance of the ladies, with the frank and open politeneſs of the men; offered him ſuch flattering letters of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to ſome of the nobility at Paris, equally eminent for exalted talents and amiable qualities; in fine, the happy effects already produced by the commercial union of the two nations, and the proſpect opened to both of enriching themſelves by a free and reciprocal interchange of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and of preſerving the repoſe of Europe by the envied example of their happineſs, as well as by the terror of their arms; all theſe ideas, united in deſcription, did ſo inflame his natural enthuſiaſm, that he could not contain his deſire of viſiting that polite nation; nor was it poſſible to moderate his joy, when the moment arrived that he was to ſet out, under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a preceptor, equally remarkable for his good ſenſe and attachment to the family of his pupil.</p>
                  <p>One ſhould have viewed the extenſive plains of Picardy, interſperſed with the agreeable land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape of diſtant hamlets, or ſloping hills crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with orchards and hopyards in full bloom, to conceive the impreſſion which this enchanting ſight produced on the mind of our young travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Even the rapidity of <hi>his</hi> imagination could ſcarcely keep pace with the ſucceſſion of ſtriking
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:045437_0015_1020274935CE0C40"/>
objects which his tour afforded. A continued rapture of admiration conducted him to the gates of Paris, where it was ſtill further heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by a view of the ſuperb palaces and other magnificent buildings which adorn that capital. The firſt few days after his arrival, he ſpent in viewing every quarter of it. The grandeur of the public edifices, the innumerable concourſe of inhabitants, the delicious gardens which abound both in the city and its environs, the ſplendor and elegance that ſhone in the dreſſes of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the ſightly decorations of their places of public reſort, and the unbounded feſtivity that reigns in their private and convivial circles; all theſe charms united, might be ſuppoſed, with the addition of novelty, to produce ſenſations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ardour and ſuſceptibility which young Whirler's imagination poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>So they did at firſt; but the impreſſion, lively as it was, ſoon vaniſhed. His eager curioſity once ſatisfied, he felt this paſſion ſucceeded by languor and ſatiety. His tutor perceived it, and propoſed to him to viſit ſome of the provinces. Jack Whirler, in the height of his joy, could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer him by preſſing entreaties to engage a poſt-chaiſe for that purpoſe againſt the next day.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not follow them in the whole of their excurſion, for fear of growing tireſome to my young reader; I will only ſtop with them a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Salency, a town celebrated for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a ceremony the moſt affecting and ſingular, that perhaps the whole world can afford, in this age of degeneracy. There the younger female inhabitants are early inſpired with the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:045437_0016_1020274C2BDEF500"/>
love, and encouraged in the practice of truth, probity, and innocence. She who is by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent pronounced the moſt virtuous maiden of the village, receives from the hands of its il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious proprietor a crown of roſes; which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is conferred once a year, on a day that is obſerved as a feſtival from the public celebration of the cuſtom; and this ornament, ſimple as it is, bath more powerful and univerſal effect on the morals of the riſing generation, particularly the female part of the peaſantry of Salency, than the moſt laboured or oſtentatious panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, the warmeſt effuſions of popular applauſe, or in fine, than any other incentive whatſoever, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe of their ſuperior; in rank and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. There virtue and merit are habitually revered, and the acquiſition of the roſe garland, the reward of unblemiſhed ſame and purity of manners, is viewed with more honeſt and more juſtly founded emulation, than trophies of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary proweſs, or the tinſel decoration and titles of a ſtateſman, can excite in the boſoms of the great.</p>
                  <p>Objects attractive and intereſting ſurrounded Jack Whirler in every part of his tour; he found every where a ſufficient variety of matter both for inſtruction and amuſement; but it was the misfortune of his diſpoſition never to wiſh for anything but what was out of his reach, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to think any place agreeable, unleſs he were a hundred leagues diſtant from it. What moſt employed his thoughts during this tour in France, was, (as he ſometimes termed it in a rapture) his <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> Italy. In the Louvre at Paris, he looked
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:045437_0017_1020274F191639D8"/>
round for the Roman Capital, or the Temple of the Sun, and was now ſighing for the ſhattered villages of Calabria in the midſt of the vineyards of Champagne. His tutor had tried all poſſible means to cure him of this reſtleſſneſs, but ſoon became apprehenſive, left his endeavours to that purpoſe ſhould only ſerve to throw his pupil into a conſumption, and therefore he ſeconded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which the latter had made to his father for permiſſion to ſet out for this ſame Italy, which he now longed to behold as much as ever the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Trojans did in the days of yore.</p>
                  <p>Except in croſſing the channel, all Jack Whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's travels had hitherto been upon dry land, and it was now two months ſince he had begun mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the poſt-roads of France. This was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to put him out of humour with all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling unleſs by ſea. His tutor conceived hopes of bringing him to a reaſonable diſpoſition by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to the experiment, and pretended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it as much as he did. They embarked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at Marſeilles, on board a veſſel bound to Leghorn.</p>
                  <p>Jack Whirler paſſed the firſt day entirely upon deck, where he could not help admiring the waves of the ſea, which were gently impelled by the wind, and ſeemed to come in playful ſucceſſion ſporting round the ſhip's ſides. The next day he was ſtill ſo clever in his own eyes for having had the courage to undertake this expedition, that his ſelf-complacent reflexions on the ſubject kept off the approaches of ſatiety. But the third day, both his agreeable muſing on the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſea, and his ſatisfaction in thinking ſo
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:045437_0018_102027536AFD3020"/>
highly of himſelf, quite forſook him. Nothing remained but the weariſome diſguſt that he felt in the ſameneſs of his voyage. He now longed to be on ſhore, all the wiſhes of his heart were directed towards the land: but unfortunately it was too far off to gratify his caprice. Nor did old ocean ſeem to uſe any extraordinary haſte in tranſporting him to the term of his wiſhes, ſo that he was obliged to be patient, or rather (as his temper inclined him) to be out of patience, until the ſhip's arrival at her port.</p>
                  <p>Happy power of imagination, which, through the ſweet illuſions of hope, ſteals from us the remembrance of our troubles! Jack Whirler forgot all his at his landing. He was now at length happily arrived in that famous country, the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of all the riches both of nature and art. After repoſing himſelf two days at Leghorn, he ſet out for Florence. He knew that the famous gallery of paintings in that city made it the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of travellers, many of whom, even after continually viewing it for ſix months, found their curioſity ſtill unſatisfied, and remained in town in ſpite of their reſolutions of departing every day. This did not ſeem ſo ſtrange to him at his firſt caſting his eye upon that ſuperb col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of maſter-pieces. Perhaps he would even have remained in the ſame mind until he had got to the end of the gallery, if it had not been for the idea of St. Peter's at Rome, and the Vatican Library, that juſt then ſtruck him. Theſe two edifices took up his thoughts the whole day, and preſented themſelves in unbounded magnificence to his imagination. In order to form a deciſive
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:045437_0019_102027565A35A3F8"/>
eſtimate of their ſplendour and dimenſions, he preſſed his tutor that ſame evening to ſet off for Rome. Never tell me of thoſe tedious travellers that pry without end, and take an age to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any remarkable object! Jack Whirler, in three days, had ſeen every thing that was curious in the antient capital of the world, and had even ſome of that time to ſpare, which he employed in putting together his baggage for a trip to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whither he was already tranſported in idea. It was not however the particular beauties of this latter place which excited his curioſity ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he had lately, it is true, paſſed through many magnificent cities, but all that he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſeen were above the ſurface of the earth, whereas Herculaneum and Pompeia were buried in its bowels. Cities under ground were all that he now thought worth his notice. The roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fruitfulneſs of his imagination formed to him a thouſand pictures of the terrible event which had reduced them to that ſtate. He was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, on going down amongſt their ruins, to find that he had fallen in love with a heap of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh; for he ſaw nothing more at that time, notwithſtanding the many curious remains of antiquity that have been diſcovered among them. Another would at leaſt have found ſome conſolation in admiring, at Naples, one of the fineſt harbours in Europe, but Jack Whirler could not help contraſting it with thoſe of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, Portſmouth, or Conſtantinople; which appeared to him much finer, becauſe they were at a diſtance. As to that burning mountain which commands the town of Naples, and makes
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:045437_0020_10202757E777F548"/>
its ſituation awful, as well as pictureſque, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly threatening to bury it in aſhes and flames; did not all travellers allow AEtna to be far before Veſuvius? Certainly; and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of its laſt eruption conveyed to his mind every idea of terror and admiration that a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano can excite. Thus in that dear country which Jack Whirler had ſo earneſtly deſired to viſit, there remained but one ſingle town, the ſight of which could recompenſe the fatigues of his journey. This was Venice, ſo ſingularly different from all the other cities, riſing from the middle of a huge moraſs, with her canals, her gondolas, and her five hundred bridges. To ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive there, he muſt travel, it is true, the whole length of Italy, but his imagination, as it was bold in ſmoothing every obſtacle, ſo it was clear-ſighted in ſhortening every diſtance, and he only waited to have his portmanteau packed up, that he might take the road towards Venice.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid, my young friends, that you have before now ſuſpected his tutor to have been too tamely complaiſant, as you have ſeen him give way to all his pupil's whims. I ſee that to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him, I muſt here diſcover to you a family ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, repoſing at the ſame time the ſtricteſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your diſcretion. During the whole of his tour, Jack Whirler had written home regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to his father, who remarked, that his letters always expreſſed a ſort of diſguſt for the place from which they were dated, while he ſeemed in raptures with that which he was next to viſit: thus it appeared that every country, though it preſented him at a diſtance with flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:045437_0021_1020275C2B955558"/>
never failed to ſend him away tired and diſappointed. Theſe remarks, confirmed by thoſe of his ſon's tutor, which after what you have read, you may eaſily imagine were quite to the ſame effect, gave him to underſtand, that his ſon was not of a temper or frame of mind cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to receive much improvement from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling. However, he did not chuſe, by haſtily recalling him, to furniſh him with a pretext for complaining at a future period, that he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by loſt the opportunity of improvement. He barely recommended to the tutor not to oppoſe his ſon's changeable whims, which would of themſelves be ſufficient to bring him home in a ſhort time. Thus Jack Whirler, after he had ſeen Venice, Turin, Switzerland and Flanders, all at full ſpeed, did now, in a freſh fit of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, wiſh for no more than to return to his own fire-ſide, even before the time which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſtipulated.</p>
                  <p>A parent never forgets that name: you may imagine, therefore, what Mr. Whirler felt at the return of his ſon. But why have I not here thoſe tranſports of joy to deſcribe to you, which poſſeſs a father's heart, when a child, worthy of his warmeſt affection, is reſtored to him after ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? Why can I not repreſent them to you, claſped in each other's arms, ſpeechleſs with joy, and mixing their tears together; the father proud of the new accompliſhments that he obſerves in his ſon, and the latter happy to ſhew them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage before the eyes of a parent, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt return that he could make to his fatherly affection and good wiſhes? How happy ſhould I
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:045437_0022_1020275F1FA691D0"/>
have been to lay before you ſo touching a ſcene, even though it ſhould loſe by my deſcription! You would at leaſt, as well as your parents, have obſerved in it, with pleaſure, the artleſs expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe ſentiments with which you feel your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mutually affected. It was in Jack Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's power to have made us all thus happy, by a better improvement of the attention that had been paid to his earlier years. Nothing would have been wanting to his education, either as to learning or accompliſhments, if he could have had the reſolution to conquer the reſtleſſneſs of his diſpoſition, and confine himſelf to a more conſtant and uniform courſe of application. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that fickle taſte which hurried him from one ſtudy to another, wading through the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that render the beginning of each dry and diſagreeable, and never taking time to enjoy the ſatisfaction which a more advanced progreſs affords; inſtead of thoſe deluſions of fancy, which dreſſed out diſtant objects in a flattering manner, only to make thoſe which were preſent, appear in more unfavorable colours; inſtead of being perpetually diſguſted and out of humour with the ſaint, unſatisfactory ideas, which a cloſe inſpection afforded him, of objects that his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination had exaggerated while at a diſtance; what a fund of ſincere pleaſing ideas might he have laid up for himſelf! Not to mention the delight which a youth of ſpirit feels in outſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the expectations of his family, how great would have been his ſatisfaction in this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant reſpect, that the firſt and ſtrongeſt principle of nature would have made his improvement the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:045437_0023_10202760ABA32480"/>
ſource of happineſs to his parents, in the moſt exquiſite degree!</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen Jack Whirler, from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood equally fond of learning and agreeable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, ſet out in purſuit of them with the moſt unbounded eagerneſs, and thinking to carry every thing at the firſt attempt, ſtruggle gallantly with the moſt diſheartening difficulties for a while, and then give up the conteſt at the very moment when he was about to get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them. In addition to his natural deſire of knowledge, and the encouraging applauſe of his parents, had he been endowed with a little more command over himſelf, he might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired every thing that would add ornament as well as happineſs to his future life. His reaſon early matured by ſtudy, and his taſte for agreeable relaxations would have preſerved his youth from that reſtleſſneſs which torments him, and from that weariſome diſguſt which he conceives to every object that becomes once familiar to him. From his acquaintance with both the principles and practice of the fine arts, he would have looked upon nothing with indifference in the courſe of his travels. The view of thoſe maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of art which foreign countries afford, while it gratified his curioſity, would have improved his taſte. His underſtanding would have been enlightened by the variety of objects that met his view, his judgment corrected by ſtudying their differences and relations, his knowledge of the world enlarged by obſerving the manners and characters of men in different countries. Strangers, flattered with the deſire which
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:045437_0024_10202763ED8D8B78"/>
a youth of education teſtifies to viſit their country, conceive the moſt advantageous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in his favor, and receive him with the politeſt attention. Thus admitted into every diſtinguiſhed circle, he might have done honour to his name and country, by that manly frankneſs and ſincerity of manners which I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to my young countrymen as the moſt eſſential accompaniment to politeneſs, inaſmuch as it certainly beſt conciliates friendſhip, eſteem, and reſpect. He would have returned home re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted by thoſe whom he had left, welcomed by his former friends, and doubly ſo by his parents, to whom he would then have afforded the moſt reaſonable ground of hope for his future ſucceſs in life.</p>
                  <p>How far was Jack Whirler from this happy ſituation, to which his circumſtances ſeemed ſo naturally to lead him! In all the towns through which he had travelled at full ſpeed, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was chiefly with the landlords of the hotels where he took a ſhort repoſe after the fatigues of riding poſt. His countrymen had little to promiſe themſelves from the feeble ſtock of information that he had collected; his father ſaw all his hopes diſappointed; and his friends—but his fickleneſs was inconſiſtent with ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—Jack Whirler had no friends. Unhappy youth! I pity him when I think, my dear Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, that our friendſhip was formed at an age as tender; our friendſhip, which has never ſince wavered a ſingle moment, and which would now, as in the firſt warmth of its commencement, lead us to unite our lives and fortunes, and ſhare them
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:045437_0025_1020276857C05280"/>
for the future equally and inſeparably! Sweet moments of our youth! when the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inclinations drew our hearts together by every tie that could bind them. How ſwiftly did the days glide away between our ſtudies, and the free intercourſe of our ſentiments! Every pleaſure, every pain was felt by both in common. Always together in town, together in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for eight years we felt it neceſſary to our happineſs to be ſo, and what tears did our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration coſt us! At this day, if we chance to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to thoſe charming walks by the ſide of a pleaſant rivulet, or up ſome romantic hill, where formerly, with a Shakeſpeare, a Fenelon, or a Goldſmith in our hands, we ſo oft enjoyed at once the charms of friendſhip, of poetry, and of nature, how pleaſing ſtill to find our mutual ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents ever the ſame, and to repoſe in a firm confidence that nothing but death can extinguiſh them in us.</p>
                  <p>O you, my young readers, who are witneſſes to this effuſion of my heart, if you have a friend like mine, if you love him, and are beloved by him as I am, you will pardon it. Beſides, have I not a right of ſpeaking to you concerning what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intereſts my feelings? Otherwiſe I ſhould have aſſumed in vain, the title under which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you this work. Whatever affects either you or me, can never henceforward be indifferent to the other party. We are united by ties that can never be broken on either ſide, without a groſs want of gratitude. If the care which I take in forming your hearts and underſtandings have any value in your eyes, I on my ſide owe you my
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:045437_0026_1020276B9909ED68"/>
warmeſt acknowledgments. Thanks to you, all nature looks gay and ſmiling round me; for my fancy places me in the midſt of your pleaſing countenances, on which innocence, chearfulneſs and candor, are painted ſo expreſſively. It is from your own mouths that I catch thoſe artleſs ſallies which make you ſmile, and thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of tenderneſs and generoſity that cauſe your tears to flow, or impreſs your young breaſts with an early ſenſe of honor. Would I could preſent you to my country, accompliſhed objects of her warmeſt hopes!</p>

                     <p>Becauſe they have ſometimes taken upon them to find little defects in me, which, however, I flatter myſelf do not belong to me. I ſhould ſuppoſe them to be ſomething envious.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady D.</speaker>

I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſurprize at ſeeing me treat Miſs Bland with ſo much freedom and ſeeming incivility, but you know that all my happineſs is centered in you; judge then of my feelings, when I ſaw it ſo near being embittered by her ſeducing arts. You have as yet no idea of the unhappy condition of a woman who is early ſpoiled by flattery. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world with pretenſions that nothing can juſtify, and an opinion of her own merit, in which nobody elſe joins her, what mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt ſhe experience! As to the homage that ſhe expected, the more her pride exacts it, the more ſhe finds it withheld, and the ſneer of contempt ſupply its place. If, blinded as ſhe is with ſelf-opinion, a tranſient ray of reflexion ſhould enlighten her for a moment, and ſhew her the true ſtate of herſelf, what ſhame muſt ſhe feel on finding herſelf deſtitute of a claim to thoſe qualities which ſhe imagined herſelf to poſſeſs, and what regret at having loſt the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:045437_0035_10202784B93631C8"/>
of acquiring them! On what ſhould ſhe, for the future, found her pretenſions to public eſteem, to the love of her huſband, or the reſpect of her family? To ſtifle the reproaches of her mind, as well as the troubleſome conſciouſneſs of her own want of merit, ſhe can ſuffer none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, but deſpicable flatterers of the ſame ſtamp with thoſe who firſt corrupted her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and, to crown her diſgrace, while ſhe contemns them, ſhe feels herſelf worthy of their contempt. Irritated by all theſe mortifications, ſhe is ſtill further tortured at the ſight of deſert in another, even in her own children. If ſhe diſtinguiſhes any by her regard, it is thoſe whom ſhe has tutored to a ſervile compliance with her folly; and thus ſhe is condemned to the crime of corrupting their veracity, in order to make them worthy objects of her affection.</p>

Even the flatterers reſpect her, even the envious receive her with a ſmile. By modeſtly yielding to her rivals all that they aſſume, ſhe takes the ſureſt way to gain a ſuperiority over them. She ſeems to appear every day with a conſtant addition of good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, as the eſteem which ſhe inſpires puts people upon finding new graces in her character. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the advice of her friends, which her

The homage addreſſed to her from all quarters, enhances her value in the eyes of her huſband, who therefore ſtudies to become more worthy of her affection by his conſtancy and attention. Her children, nouriſhed by her virtues, look up to no other pattern, and indeed the experience of her own ſucceſs, will make her the more proper to direct their education. She will be able to qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify them for the happineſs which ſhe herſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys. More and more pleaſed every day with herſelf, and with every thing that is round her, ſhe will be happy in the prime of life, and ſecure to herſelf, in a more advanced age, the grateful eſteem of her acquaintance, whoſe attachment her merit will have rendered both zealous and ſincere.</p>

                  <head>THE CAVERN IN THE PEAK</head>
                  <head type="sub">Deſcribed in the relation of a TRAVELLER.</head>
                  <p>I HAD left London behind me a hundred and ſeventy miles, and had croſſed ſeveral moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and vallies, when at length I ſaw myſelf near the end of my journey, being arrived in the wilds of Derbyſhire.</p>
                  <p>The mountains which I had now to climb grew more ſteep and difficult; and behind them I deſerted others ſtill higher, that were totally bate of trees, and preſented a ſurface of heath and greenſward, ſo that at a pretty good diſtance I could diſtinguiſh the flocks feeding upon their ſides.</p>
                  <p>When I had reached the top of one of theſe mountains, I was all at once ſurprized with the ſight of a delightful valley below me, interſected with rivulets, and ſurrounded on all ſides with lofty hills. At the bottom of this valley is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the village of Caſtletown, conſiſting of a few indifferent cottages, that ſeem to announce the poverty of their inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>A narrow road winding down the declivity of the mountain, conducted me to the bottom of the valley, and ſo into the village, where having ſtopped a moment at an inn to refreſh myſelf, I took the road towards the Cavern of the Peak,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:045437_0039_102027908D0A45A8"/>
being guided to its entrance by a ſmall ſtream that runs near it, after having paſſed through the town.</p>
                  <p>I ſtopped now and then in order to indulge my eyes with a more leiſurely view of the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar object before me. Between two groves of the fineſt verdure, an enormous rock, crowned with the ruins of an ancient caſtle, reared its ton to the very clouds. At the foot of this opened a vaſt Cavern, which, when viewed from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, while the beholder enjoys the light of noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, preſents to his eyes a huge abyſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>A man ſoon appeared at the mouth of the Cave, who aſked me if I choſe to go down. I followed him down an eaſy deſcent, the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which came in at the entrance, gradually loſing itſelf in a ſort of <hi>darkneſs viſible,</hi> ſomething like the faint twilight of a November evening.</p>
                  <p>After we had advanced a few ſteps, I was much ſurprized to ſee on my right hand, a ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous town under the immenſe vault of the rock. It happened to be a holiday, and the inhabitants were enjoying a relaxation from their labors, moſt of them ſitting with their children before the doors of their cottages, and amuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I gueſſed the nature of their uſual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to be ſpinning, from the number of large wheels that were every where to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>As we went farther in, the opening which ſtill admitted the feeble light of day, ſeemed to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row more and more, and ſoon appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> as they were, gave a tinge to the ſmoke that roſe from thoſe ſubterraneous cottages which we had left behind. The gloom, however, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened every ſtep, till at length the vault of the rock, and the darkneſs, both together, ſeemed to encloſe all round.</p>
                  <p>My guide, who was before me, then opened the door of a ſmall cabin cut in the hollow of the rock, and an old woman, who lived in it, came out and furniſhed us with lights. Each of us took one, and we continued our march, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged however to ſtoop very low for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length of way. But what was my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment when, at the end of this cloſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, I ſaw the Cavern widen round me all at once, and the vault riſe to a height which we could not diſtinguiſh by the help of our lights. I paſſed in ſilence through the extent of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, like a benighted traveller that has loſt his way, and arrived at length on the ſide of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty broad ſtream, whoſe ſilent waters, when our candles approached their ſurface, threw all round us a pale reflexion of light, that was ſtill more full of horror than the darkneſs. A ſmall boat was made faſt to the bank, and my guide, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me enter it, jumped into the water up to his middle, and taking the rope of the boat over his ſhoulders, began to drag it after him.</p>
                  <p>The ſtill horror of this place reſembled the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the grave. As I advanced I ſaw the roof of the rock become gradually lower, like a dark cloud deſcending towards the earth. My guide cried out to me to lie down on my back; and I had ſcarcely been a moment in that poſture,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:045437_0041_10202797BB0B2C60"/>
when I found myſelf under a part of the vault ſo low, that ſtretched as I was at full length in the boat, I could ſcarcely hold the candle upright by my ſide. While I was thus buried as it were, I confeſs the ſtories of the river Styx, and of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's ferry-boat, began to appear not quite ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous. I ſeemed as in a dream, going to land in the gloomy regions of Erebus, condemned by an unuſual deſtiny to carry my own funeral torch. Fortunately this dreary viſion did not laſt long, we ſoon croſſed the ſtreights, and I landed alive and well on the oppoſite ſide.</p>
                  <p>The vault over our heads preſented us once more in our walk with the ſame irregular ſurface, ſometimes riſing to a prodigious height, and ſometimes ſinking all at once as if to ſtop up our way. I perceived all round me a number of plants and ſmall animals petrified, and would willingly have examined them, but I was obliged to decline the gratification of my curioſity, for fear of burning out our candles.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond piece of water appearing before us, I imagined that we were now arrived at the end of our journey, as I ſaw no boat. This ſtream was not ſo broad as the former; we could eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the oppoſite ſide. My conductor took me upon his back, and carried me ſafe over.</p>
                  <p>A little farther we found a ſmall current which ran parallel with our path. Our ground here became moiſt and ſlippery, and our path ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that we could hardly get one foot before the other. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe and ſuch diſagreeable obſtacles, I followed with pleaſure the courſe of the ſubterraneous water. Every
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:045437_0042_1020279AA5AEB698"/>
object that I could diſcover, in this empire of darkneſs, appeared to me to carry with it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the marvellous. My mind was loſt in a chaos of agreeable muſings, when ſuddenly a murmur of diſtant harmony ſtruck my ear.</p>
                  <p>I ſtopped my guide, and aſked him whence theſe ſounds proceeded, which my fancy (already in a romantic mood) repreſented to me ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? He anſwered me that I would ſoon ſatisfy myſelf. Each ſtep that I advanced, this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, which at a diſtance was indiſtinct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, grew more articulate. I preſently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed a ſort of pattering noiſe, like that made by drops of rain. It was no more than a ſmall water-fall, the ſtream of which ſeparating as it fell, came down in a thick ſhower; and the noiſe of this, prolonged from echo to echo, through the ſilent vault, formed, by its mingled and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual reverberation, a ſucceſſion of ſounds full of harmony. I could already ſee theſe drops ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle like diamonds at the approach of our candles, but I did not dare to go too near them, for fear of ſeeing our candles go out, and of being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to grope our way back in the dark, perhaps unſucceſsfully.</p>
                  <p>In the ſides of the rock, at different places, I obſerved large openings, which led probably to other caverns. I barely peeped into them, and was ſorry that my time would not permit me to explore them thoroughly. My guide, in order to give me an agreeable ſurprize, bid me ſhut my eyes, and ſuffer him to lead me. I gave him my candle, and holding him by the coat, followed him blindfold. He ſtopped ſhort, and when I
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:045437_0043_1020279C2F492DC8"/>
opened my eyes, I found myſelf in an auguſt temple, the dome of which, irregularly ſuſpended upon enormous pillars, poſſeſſed all that awful beauty and magnificence, which is ſeen in the great works of nature. I could not help falling on my knees to adore the majeſty of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who ſeemed to have formed even this ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous ſpot, as a temple where he might be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhipped.</p>
                  <p>I quitted this contemplation with reluctance, in order to continue our expedition, which was now drawing to a period. The faithful ſtream conducted us to the extremity of the Cavern, where the rock bends down for the laſt time. Its arch deſcends to the very waters, where it unites with them, and cloſes up the paſſage ſo complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the moſt adventurous traveller cannot paſs the bounds which here ſet to his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                  <p>We now therefore turned back, and as I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, were to come out by the ſame path by which we had penetrated thus far; but I very ſoon ſaw my guide turn off to the left, by one of the lateral openings of the rock. He gave me notice that I ſhould find myſelf much fatigued in this new expedition, and muſt be ſatisfied to creep for ſome length under a part of the rock which nearly touches the ground. As he found me reſolved to follow him, he adviſed me to take good care of my candle.</p>
                  <p>We were obliged to creep on our hands and feet for a pretty long time, upon a moiſt ſand, the paſſage being ſometimes ſo ſtreight, that we could hardly ſqueeze our bodies through. When
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:045437_0044_102027A0D76699C0"/>
I roſe from this painful poſture, I ſaw a ſteep hill full before me, the top of which ſeemed to loſe itſelf like a cloud, among the hardly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able extremities of the ſurrounding rock. The aſcent was ſo ſteep from its moiſture, that I fell back at every ſtep. My guide, more active at this exerciſe, took me by the hand, and at length ſucceeded in helping me to the top. I ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſight of the depths which ſurrounded me on all ſides. He bid me ſit down, and requeſted me to wait for his return. Leaving me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſolitude, he deſcended the hill pretty rapidly, and was ſoon loſt to my view. All at once I ſaw re-appear, not him, but his light, which ſhone like a ſpark in an abyſs of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>After ſuffering me to enjoy this ſpectacle for a moment, my guide returned: I went down with him to the ſame depth where I had before loſt ſight of him. He now reaſcended the hill, and through an opening in the rock, he gave me a view of his candle, while I removed mine. It was to me as if, in the darkeſt night, I ſaw a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſtar twinkle in the narrow ſpace between two dark clouds.</p>
                  <p>This part not offering any freſh objects to gratify my curioſity, we re-entered our former creeping paſſage, in order to arrive once more on the bank of the ſmall ſtream which now conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us back. I beheld the wild temple again with the ſame impreſſion of awe; I heard with the ſame pleaſure, the harmonious murmur of the caſcade; but I repaſſed with leſs terror beneath the vault which my fancy had before compared
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:045437_0045_102027A40BD213C8"/>
to a tomb. I conſidered myſelf as Theſeus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning victorious from his expedition to Hell: and how great was my joy, when, after the vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sibyl had extinguiſhed the remainder of our candles, which we returned to her, I at length diſcovered the feeble gleam of day! How I bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, after ſo long a confinement in darkneſs!</p>
                  <p>I now came chearfully forward amidſt a very pictureſque diſtribution of light and ſhade. At every ſtep I ſaw the veil of darkneſs gradually unfold. As the opening of the Cavern enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it gave me an idea of Aurora, opening the ſplendid portals of the dawn. I arrived in the light as in a new world, where the ſun now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waited me on the borders of the Weſt, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with clouds of purple and gold, to contraſt, as it were, by the grandeur of ſuch a ſpectacle, the gloomy objects which were ſtill pictured in my memory.</p>

                  <head>THE PEASANT, HIS COUNTRY'S BENEFACTOR.</head>
                  <p>MR. Stanley, tired with the noiſe and buſtle of the town, had purchaſed a ſmall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryhouſe, in which he promiſed to himſelf the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of rural tranquillity, amidſt the ſtudy of books and the exerciſe of benevolence. Being naturally of a penſive turn, he was fond of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the amuſement of walking, in which he occaſionally indulged himſelf in all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters round his new habitation. One day, his wandering ſteps led him to a ſmall valley the ſight of which alone was ſufficient highly to gratify his contemplative inclination. Surrounded by high hills, the ſlopes of which preſented an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variety of corn fields, groves and cottages, it ſeemed to be the retreat of rural happineſs. The ſtillneſs of this retired vale was only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the murmuring found of a rivulet,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:045437_0050_102027B2A1390140"/>
which falling down a rock, reflected from its broken waters all the colors of the rainbow, as the ſun's rays enlightened it at a certain ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Its froth expanded in white volumes round the baſon which it had hollowed out by its fall. The rivulet afterwards divided itſelf into ſeveral ſmaller ones which interſected the valley in many directions, and freſhened the verdure of the meadows by their beneficent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Yet the moſt pleaſing ſenſations of Mr. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's breaſt were not occaſioned merely by the natural beauties of the ſpot. The whole extent of the valley was covered with new cottages, each having its ſmall farm annexed, with an orchard and kitchen garden. Theſe parcels of land were only ſeparated by plain gooſeberry hedges, which ſeemed at once to indicate the value of the ground and the mutual confidence of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Mr. Stanley rejoiced to ſee that no ſingle perſon had engroſſed to himſelf the whole of this delicious plain. He was pleaſed in the reflexion that many families might there enjoy the ſweets of eaſe and tranquillity. While he in his own mind, congratulated the owner of the land, who had a number of ſo happy tenants, he thought ſome praiſe was alſo due to his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, which had certainly, by its encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aſſiſtance, occaſioned the rich ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of cultivation that he admired. So wholly was he rapt in meditation upon this intereſting ſubject, that he had not obſerved the gathering of thick dark clouds that was forming over his
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:045437_0051_102027B2A1390140"/>
head. A ſhower of rain, accompanied with lightning, ſoon obliged him to ſeek for ſhelter. He ran therefore and knocked at the door of the firſt cottage, which was opened by a woman far advanced in years, but whoſe countenance old age had made venerable. She received him in a free and friendly manner. I am very glad, ſaid ſhe, that our cottage happened to be the neareſt to you, though, I am pretty ſure, our children would have received you kindly too. As the ſtorm ſurprized you in the middle of the plain, you could hardly miſs of applying for ſhelter to ſome one or other of our family. But I ſee, you are quite out of breath. Compoſe yourſelf. I will make up a good fire for you, that you may dry yourſelf by it.</p>
                  <p>While ſhe was laying on ſome wood, Mr. Stanley was looking about him very attentively. He obſerved an appearance of plenty and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the diſpoſition of the furniture, that pleaſed him very much. He had underſtood, by the good woman's words, that a great part of the habitations of the plain was occupied by her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. His curioſity was rouſed by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and he was preparing to aſk a few queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in order to ſatisfy it, when he heard ſomebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from the inner room ſay, "I hope, dame, you will make the gentleman welcome." "Yes, yes, gaffer, anſwered ſhe, never fear."—"That is your huſband, then, that ſpeaks to you," ſays Mr. Stanley. "Yes, Sir, he is within there, in that room."—"Will you give me leave to pay my reſpects to him?" "And welcome, Sir; you will perhaps be glad to know each other; walk
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:045437_0052_102027B8D21C6210"/>
in." Mr. Stanley entered, and perceived an old man lying in a bed, the covering of which was remarkably neat. His head was bare; his locks, white as ſnow, fell down to his ſhoulders; his countenance, which time had reſpected, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the tranquillity and goodneſs of his ſoul; there was a ſmile upon his lips, and his eyes ſparkled with the fire and vivacity of youth. Mr. Stanley, attracted by an exterior ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing, approached him.</p>

                     <p>Though I ſay it, I think I have earned it ſufficiently. How many ſheaves of corn have I tied up in the courſe of my life! How many have I threſhed out! I have wearied my poor body ſadly, that is certain.

                     <p>I dare take upon me to ſay ſo. When I was young, to be ſure, I was all alive, like other folks; I ran about to every wake and revel; but as ſoon as I had once pronounced the ſolemn word <hi>I will,</hi> in church, I left off all thoſe youthful tricks. Happily my wife was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, good-natured and virtuous. That keeps a man in awe. Beſides, children began to come on apace. I was not rich at the time, and it I had been ſufficiently ſo for myſelf, I had affection enough for my family, to wiſh them alſo a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency. I trained my children up to work ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young. I carried them to the fields as ſoon as they could walk. The youngeſt I ſeated upon the plough, while the reſt played round about us. My daughters amuſed us with ſinging, while they ſpun at their wheel. In ſhort, I taught them all to work chearfully for their bread, that they might eat it happily.</p>

week, to ſee that every thing went on well in their families. Now, when I cannot go out, it is their turn to viſit me. Every Sunday after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, my daughters, my grand-daughters, and my daughters-in-law, bring their children here. It would be a good ſight to ſee me in the middle of twenty women, dreſſed in their Sunday clothes, and as freſh as roſes. Theſe all vie with each other in their fondneſs to me; and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have a certain family reſemblance that charms me. I have generally a dozen of them in my arms and playing about me. Then there is ſuch a buz, and a chatter, as would ſtun ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, but it is muſic to my ears.</p>

It is the laſt ſpot of ground on which I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worked. I open the ball with my dame, and then every one falls a capering about us.

Oh! if I had him here to ſhew him to you! he is the very model of me, except theſe

wrinkles, and his roſy complexion, which I have no longer in my cheeks. And indeed he is my Benjamin, the darling of my heart. I can tell you ſo much, Sir, as you are a ſtranger, but I ſhould not wiſh that any of the family knew it.</p>

                     <p>If I have not thoſe, I have others. Having never been from this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I know it as well as I do my own cabin, and all the inhabitants likewiſe. I have been at the birth of them all. They come to conſult me about laying down their grounds. They have only to bring me a baſket of the earth of each farm. I handle it, and taſte it, and tell at once what ſort of grain it will produce beſt. If they are poor folks, I lend them ſeed, which they pay me after the harveſt; and I prevail upon thoſe whom I have ſerved, to lend them a day's work, which is all the return that I aſk for my ſervices. I have ſeen the time when every one worked only for himſelf, and would have thought that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched himſelf by ruining his neighbour. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, however, at length, to perſuade them, that the richer the country was, the richer each would be in particular; that the fruits of the earth would ſell better, and attract manufacturing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this quarter, by the plenty of them and their good quality; and that, in order to effect this, they ought to aſſiſt each other. According as the ſeaſon is wet or dry, the crop of the low grounds is more or leſs forward th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:045437_0057_102027C614129C60"/>
with the firſt ripe; thus the whole is got in at its juſt point of maturity. In fact, you may enquire at the markets all round concerning our grain. The factors ſtrive which ſhall buy it up. Sometimes they come and take it in the crop, and our corn has been ſold before it was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground; whereas if there come ten buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of bad corn from a pariſh, it is enough to give all the reſt a bad name.</p>

                     <p>By degrees, from the experience of each year. Beſides I muſt ſay, I have been well aſſiſted. Our vicar is a ſenſible man; I had made him as rich as a dean, by the weddings, the chriſtenings, and the tithes that I brought him. He ſometimes touched upon the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of my practice, in his ſermons. Beſides, when our head landlord came down to reſide here, he ſaw his lands quite changed, they let for double the rent; upon which he ſhewed me marks of his regard. If there was any new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of agriculture, in your London papers, they will come both of them to conſult me. I made the experiment before their eyes, and as ſoon as it ſucceeded, it was preſently ſpread. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers follow their old way, and deſpiſe any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries taken from books, but thoſe that I had approved, there was no contradicting. They put them in practice, and found the good effects of them. Beſides my doctrine is not very long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded. I deliver the whole of it in a few

                     <p>It is true, I have taken many a cauſe out of his worſhip's hands. I ſhould be as rich as a judge, if I had only taken a ſhilling for every diſpute that I have ſettled. There is always ſome little quarrel, in a country village, upon one ſubject or another. They come to aſk my advice. If one of the parties be at a diſtance, they take me in a chaiſe cart, and convey me to the ſpot. There upon hearing the merits of the cauſe, I endeavor to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate matters ſatisfactorily. If they refuſe to agree, I invite them to come to my houſe againſt next day. I have ſome excellent old ale, that would ſoften hearts of ſtone. They taſte it, and as ſoon as it begins to have its effect upon my diſputants, I make them ſenſible that a law ſuit would coſt them ten times more than the thing in diſpute; that they would loſe their time, their money, their reſt, and the pleaſure of being friends. I mention to them the example of thoſe, who, through not taking my advice, have impoveriſhed themſelves to make lawyers rich. Before the firſt mug of ale is finiſhed, they no longer look ſhy on each other, and the ſecond is ſcarce half emptied, before they would go through fire to ſerve each other. Thus I give away my ale, but I get, in return, pleaſure and ſatisfaction in this life, and good hopes for that which is to come.</p>

                     <p>Why, Sir, I govern here upon my bed, as another upon his throne. But I am not only loved, but feared alſo. Go nearer to that wall. Do you ſee there names, with dates of the year, that I have cut with my knife? Some of them are for good actions, but thoſe that you ſee written backwards, are marks of diſgrace. As our head landlord and the vicar are ſo good as to come ſometimes and ſee me, and as all the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage are conſtantly flocking to my cabin, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter on the wall, has as much effect, as if the folk's names were put in the newſpapers. Your name written backwards up there, is a ſort of public infamy. Every body ſhuns you, even to the children. You muſt mend your manners, or decamp. If you reform, well and good, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe your name; in the firſt place, to remove the memory of your diſgrace, and then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you in good behaviour. Of twenty names, in all, that I have thus engraved back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there remain but three which will ſerve as an example for a long time to come; whereas a name written up there, ſtraight forwards, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt enough to make one a gentleman, and to ſee a ſingle letter turned backwards, would be as dreadful us death to the party, ſo great is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a good reputation.</p>

                     <p>I ſhould be much more ſo, had I ſpent it ill, had I been idle, and a libertine; if I had not done all the good that was in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or if I had left a large family in a ſtate of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty or vice, through my fault. Inſtead of ſuch an afflicting retroſpect, I look back on fourſcore years of uſeful labor, of lands improved, and friends aſſiſted.

He ſees, every day, old trees replaced by young ones. He ſees, every year, the winter devour the produce of the other ſeaſons. I will repreſent all this to my children, when they ſhall aſſemble round my death bed; I will make them ſenſible that my Maker, after having given me a long and happy old age, crowns all his bleſſings to me, by taking me from life, before it becomes a burthen by pains and infirmities.

                  <p>The old man, who had raiſed himſelf up in his bed, to addreſs theſe words to his Creator, fell back with fatigue as he finiſhed them. Mr. Stanley was terrified, and ran for his wife to aſſiſt him. She had fallen on her knees, in a corner of the cottage, at the beginning of his prayer: her hands were ſtill liſted up to heaven. He led her, trembling as ſhe was with terror, to the old man, who diſpelled the apprehenſions of both, by a ſmile, and by the livelineſs of his action, as he waved his hand to them. However, Mr. Stanley judged that repoſe would be neceſſary to him, after an emotion ſo violent, for his age; he therefore thanked theſe good people for their hoſpitality, and promiſed to come again and ſee them, after a few days.</p>
                  <p>The ſtorm which had forced him to ſeek ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the cottage, was now over. Nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from her gloomy dreſs, had once more aſſumed a radiant cheerfulneſs. The ſun, who was now near ſetting, ſeemed to ſhine with new ſplendor. Theſe objects brought back the thoughts of the old man to Mr. Stanley's ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. They repreſented his ſoul ſpotleſs and unſullied, alternately yielding to impreſſions of tenderneſs and gaiety; and the ſtrength and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of his ſpirit juſt then blazing forth, when it was going to be finally extinguiſhed. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to himſelf all that one ſingle man, in the moſt humble ſtation, could do for the advantage
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:045437_0065_102027DF50E2A990"/>
of ſociety. Fifty induſtrious citizens given to the ſtate. His active years employed in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his children to honeſt labor, and his old age dedicated to the maintenance of peace and unanimity among his neighbors. With what freedom, thought Mr. Stanley, did he ſpeak to me of the good that he had done, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which he repoſes in the Supreme Being! what tranquility of conſcience! how happy a ſtate of aſſuredneſs! Who would not prefer the ſound old age of this honeſt peaſant, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of his country, though allotted to a ſtate of obſcurity, proud of his own eſteem, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the trueſt honor, that of leaving behind him a reſpectable memory, to the decrepitude of thoſe great men who only uſe their riches in ſcattering round them corruption and obloquy, who feel the public contempt fall light upon them, habituated as they are to the contempt of their own ſouls, and whom even the grave will not have power to reſcue from infamy and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</p>
                  <p>But why introduce theſe images, ſo afflicting to the virtuous, while there are others ſo proper to inſpire them with conſolation and delight? While the portrait of a Howard is at hand, that benevolent traveller who has already ſeveral times gone over a great part of Europe, viſiting the children of captivity, and who, by his eloquent writings, and the authority of his virtues, has procured more humane treatment to a race of men, often more unfortunate than guilty! or of a Hutton, who croſſes the ſeas at the age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:045437_0066_102027E2418BA910"/>
and without aſſuming any other character than that of miniſter of humanity, treats with thoſe of the ſtate, concerning the exchange of priſoners of war, and returns modeſtly to his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to aſſiſt thoſe unfortunate perſons of whom he is the friend and ſupporter. Generous men! you need not my praiſe to recompenſe your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. They find a reward worthy of them, in that very ſentiment which inſpired them, and in the good that they have produced. More need is, that I endeavor to conſecrate them in the memory of tender youth, a ſhrine ſuitable to their purity, and to preſerve your name as long as I can upon the earth. If the love and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of humanity can be kindled in the ſouls of youth, let them owe it to the force and impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your examples, and to the noble deſire of imitating them.</p>

                  <p>MRS. Croſby had retired, in the third year of her widowhood, to a ſmall, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious houſe, at ſome diſtance from London. Here ſhe endeavoured to amuſe the grief which ſhe felt for the loſs of her huſband, by attending to the education of a daughter whom ſhe regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the only remaining pledge of their mutual affection. She herſelf had been married very young, and her father, when he made an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous bargain, as it is called, in the diſpoſal of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:045437_0067_102027E3CCC30378"/>
her hand, imagined that the ſplendor of a large fortune, and a few ſhewy accompliſhments, would enable her to appear in the world with ſufficient diſtinction. As he was always invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the hurry of buſineſs, or engaged in tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous diſſipation, he had never reflected, that, in a calmer ſtate of life, his daughter would have any more occaſion, than himſelf, for thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of the heart and underſtanding, which ariſe from a proper cultivation of both, or that the better choice he made of a huſband for her, the more neceſſary theſe advantages would be to her in order to gain his eſteem, and preſerve his attachment. Theſe conſiderations, obvious as they were, never once occurred to him, and of all the cares that he felt for the happineſs of his daughter, the moſt uſeful were, thoſe to which he leaſt attended.</p>
                  <p>It was not long, before Mrs. Croſby felt and regretted this neglect, particularly as ſhe was now placed in the ſociety of a man, diſtinguiſhed for delicacy of ſentiment, and clearneſs of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and who united a large portion of knowledge, to a refined taſte. While ſhe ſought therefore to ſupply the deficiency of her own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, ſhe reſolved, above all things, to avoid any ſuch neglect in that of her daughter. The amuſements of town had never totally divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from this project, and the ſolitude in which ſhe propoſed to paſs her widowhood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her there all the leiſure neceſſary for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in execution. She had already taken advantage of the firſt years of Emily's childhood, to perfect herſelf in thoſe things which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:045437_0068_102027E6ECA04160"/>
one day or other to teach her. Her appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and force of memory, her quick and juſt apprehenſion, ſo well fulfilled the views which her affection had ſuggeſted, that ſhe was now perfect miſtreſs of ancient and modern hiſtory, geography and the elements of mathematicks, and had ſome general notions of aſtronomy and natural philoſophy. In order to be able by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone to inſtruct her daughter, ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired her own knowledge, without any other aid, than good books of introduction to thoſe ſeveral ſciences. Thus, while ſhe ſought for herſelf the moſt pleaſing and effectual mode of inſtruction, ſhe ſtudied beforehand that which would be moſt proper for Emily's underſtanding, whoſe acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vivacity, from an infant, afforded the moſt favorable hopes; nor did her ſubſequent improvement diſappoint them. Emily, now ſcarcely thirteen, had already, by her progreſs in learning, and her dutiful behavior, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the pains which her mother had taken in inſtructing her. Their hours were ſpent in the pureſt enjoyment of mutual happineſs. The company of a few particular acquaintances in the neighborhood, and the viſits which they ſometimes received from their friends in town, were the only interruptions to their ſtudies, the variety of which, together with the culture of flowers, and the care of their ſinging-birds, ſerved as a relaxation to them.</p>
                  <p>Whether it was to purge her daughter's heart of every ſentiment of vanity, or to rid her houſe of a load of viſitors, Mrs. Croſby had thought proper to conceal her fortune, and aſſumed as
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:045437_0069_102027EB6C340658"/>
a pretext for her country retirement, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of retrieving her affairs, by ſtrict oeconomy. Thus, while ſhe avoided the tireſome details and uſeleſs expenſe of a great houſe, ſhe had more time to apply to her labors, and was better able to indulge her generoſity by the private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactions which ſhe ſo liberally diſpenſed. From the tranquility of ſo agreeable a life, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing her daughter equal her hopes, and a good ſtate of health acquired by exerciſe, temperance, and regularity, ſhe had contracted an unchangeable ſerenity of temper, and ſuch a ſprightlineſs in converſation, as made her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany highly delightful to little Emily. The feelings of her young heart were wholly dedicated to her mamma, and the memory o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> her father which Mrs. Croſby took care to keep up, by the example of her own ſorrow for his loſs, and by the remembrance that ſhe expreſſed of his good qualities. Emily, brought up in all the freedom of ingenuous innocence, had not a thought, that ſhe needed to conceal from her affectionate friend, and therefore had preſerved that amiable ſimplicity, which is the ſweeteſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ornament of reaſon. As all her reflections had ariſen from what ſhe heard in converſation with her mother, they were of a lively and animated turn, ſuch as the warmth of converſation generally produces, and ſhe delivered her thoughts with equal clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and force, equal correctneſs and vivacity.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Glanville, brother to Mrs. Croſby, whom ſhe loved affectionately, from a child, was ſettled in London, where he held an honourable poſt under government; and the duties of this, together with the ſtudy of natural ſcience, which
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:045437_0070_102027EE5C8E7C60"/>
he cultivated ſucceſsfully, were his chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Two daughters, as yet under the firſt cares of their mother, and little George, now twelve years old, made up his family. Amidſt the corruption of a capital, his houſe was a ſtranger to immorality. His ſon had never been far from his preſence. Born with a lively ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, an ardent and fearleſs ſpirit, frankneſs, generoſity and reſolution, George was mild, and at the ſame time ſuſceptible of the moſt impetuous emotions. He was even, at his age, ſtrongly in love with glory, and whatever was great. When he heard an inſtance of bravery and generoſity related, you would ſee his breaſt heave, and the fire ſparkle in his eyes. While Mr. Glanville conceived the beſt hopes, from ſuch a diſpoſition, he was thoroughly ſenſible of the anxiety that it might cauſe him. However, his ſon's tender affection for him, alleviated his fears. He had early accuſtomed himſelf to manage him by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A cold look would have filled George with terror; a reproach would have been a ſevere puniſhment to him.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of a preſſing invitation, which they both received from Emily's hand, though dictated by her mamma, to ſpend a few days of the ſummer vacation at her houſe, they arrived there, as it happened, the day before her birth-day; the addition of this company made it therefore a ſort of feſtival, which Emily adorned by her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and George animated by his vivacity. Mrs. Croſby repaid, with tears of joy, the amiable attentions of theſe charming children; but this happineſs was ſtill more increaſed, when ſhe had an opportunity of diſcourſing at freedom with
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:045437_0071_102027EFE7834F88"/>
her brother, of their projects and expectations concerning their children. Dinner time, which aſſembled them and their young family, was a new ſcene of delight. After a long ſeparation, to find themſelves once more together, amidſt all the beauties of nature, a fine country, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful weather, and in the preſence of objects ſo mutually intereſting! to feel the ſweet emotions of parental tenderneſs, and all the <hi>mingled chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>

Mrs. Croſby, breaking off her diſcourſe all at once, went and ſeated herſelf on the end of a ſtone ſeat which fronted a large walk of the garden. Mr. Glanville, thinking that his ſiſter was taken ill, made haſte to follow her, and anxiouſly aſked her what was the matter? Nothing at all, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, ſmiling, but without moving her eyes, which were fixed upon the ſetting ſun.

Mr. Glanville, and the children, looked at each other in ſilence, not daring to interrupt her. Preſently the ſun was out of ſight, and Mrs. Croſby then riſing with a chearful air, I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſays ſhe, every thing goes on well in the univerſe. Theſe words, and the haſty manner in which I quitted you juſt now, muſt ſurprize you; I ſhall therefore explain. This is, you know, my birth-day. It ſeems as if every object in nature became this day unuſually intereſting to me. I obſerve with more attention whatever paſſes, and every thing affords me matter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. This morning, as I walked in my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, I endeavored to remark the changes that might have taken place in the trees during the courſe of the laſt year. I ſaw that ſome began to loſe their youthful look, and others to ſucceed them in ſtature and vigor. The firſt afforded me a ſerious leſſon, but the latter comforted me with a pleaſing type of my own youth, renewed in my daughter.</p>

                        <p>Without being more credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than thoſe ladies, why ſhould you be leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent?

                        <p>I could prove it to you in a moment.</p>

                        <p>But however, uncle, if we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to the ſize that you mention, we ſhould be much larger than the ſun. The ſtars ſee the ſun, and they would be much better able to ſee us, in that caſe.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>The houſe is much larger than the candle, which throws its light upon it; can you diſtinguiſh the houſe?</p>

                        <p>You ſee, then, that a body, which is luminous in itſelf, can be diſcerned at a great diſtance, while a much larger body, that only reflects the light which it receives, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible to us.</p>

                        <p>Now reduce the earth to its real proportion: inſtead of being large with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſun, as the houſe is with reſpect to the candle, it would be no more, in compariſon, than a pin's head to a lighted torch.

                        <p>I think I ſee one of our great folks in London, full of the idea that all the whole kingdom have their eyes upon him.

                        <p>A happy idea enough! how many pretty whimſies might then be explained by the variety of her phaſes, and the inequalities of her motion! You ſee by this, my friend, that

                        <p>It is a great pity, that we are not a little more luminous, for, you muſt confeſs, papa, that we could not be placed to more advantage, to make a ſhining figure.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, papa, and that fine large walnut tree that we paſſed yeſterday evening, when I felt ſuch an appetite for ſome of the walnuts. I was glad to ſee it again, though at a diſtance, for it appeared to me, as I ſtood here, to be juſt on the edge of the horizon.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>Your perſpective is not quite exact; for you might ſee far behind it that large gothick caſtle, that is falling to ruin; you know it is a good way farther off; when we had paſſed it in the chaiſe, was it not a full quarter of an hour before we reached the walnut-tree?</p>

ſhould ſuppoſe the tree, I aſſure you, from this ſpot, to be in the ſame circular line with the hill, the wood, the caſtle, and the village-ſteeple; and our terrace here, to be in the centre of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. I took particular notice.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mrs. Croſby.</speaker>
                        <p>Only a mile and a half; I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently walk to it, and with eaſe.</p>

                        <p>Now I gueſs, by the time of our coming, that the caſtle is about two miles and a quarter from this place, and the walnut-tree about half that diſtance, at moſt. But how do you compute? thoſe objects, ſome ſo far off, and ſome ſo near, to be in the ſame circular ſweep from this point! all thoſe inequalities, both of diſtance and ſurface, to form a round and regular horizon! and our terrace to be exactly in the centre of all that! May it not be the ſame, George, with reſpect to the ſeemingly regular arch of the heavens, and thoſe ſtars that appear to be fixed in the ſame concave ſurface? and, in ſhort, with reſpect to us who think ourſelves to be in the centre of this beautiful ſphere?</p>

                        <p>I cannot deny it, papa; if my ſight deceives me at a ſmall diſtance, it very well may, where the ſpace is ſo immenſe. But that we are not in the middle ſpot under the heavens, I can hardly give up. I would have wagered, that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:045437_0079_10202807DF869268"/>
there are not two inches more on one ſide than the other.</p>

                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>But that is nothing to the diſtance of the objects which we viewed.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>It follows then, that when, from two different points, we imagine diſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to retain ſtill the ſame diſtance, theſe points cannot be very far aſunder. In ſhort, it is as

if they were only one point: Is not that the caſe, George?</p>

                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>Exactly, papa; you have juſt hit my meaning; I like your way of explaining it.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>So, there is ſomething to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me; well then, let us go a little further. You know, I ſuppoſe, as well as Emily, that the earth moves in an orbit round the ſun. I will draw it here upon the ground. Do you ſee? it is a ſort of oval, called an ellipſe, as you have been told. There, it is finiſhed. You can ſee it pretty well by the light of the moon, which is juſt riſing. I will put down my hat within the orbit for the ſun.</p>

                        <p>Well, I have remarked it.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>Come, now begin to march ſlowly along the circular line of the orbit, with your eye ſtill on the torch, that ſtands for a ſtar. Move forward, do you ſee the ſtar become lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or nearer?</p>

                        <p>Then go farther ſtill, as far as the oppoſite part of the orbit to that from which you ſat out. There, ſtop; well, how is the ſtar?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>How! does not it appear lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or nearer? and yet you have moved towards it!</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, a good deal. But it is perhaps ſixty yards off, and I am only come nearer to it, by the length of the diameter of this orbit, which is about ſix feet.</p>

                        <p>Theſe ſix feet are nothing, then, compared to the diſtance of the torch; and you may think, it would be ſtill leſs, if the torch were to be removed farther off; for inſtance, three miles, till it appeared no bigger than a ſpark.</p>

                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>Nay, then the whole orbit would be no more than a point, quite imperceptible. Let us try a larger ſcale, papa.</p>

                        <p>Come, then, to ſatisfy you; take a diameter of two hundred millions of miles, which is that of the real orbit of the earth, and inſtead of the torch, your imaginary ſtar, take a real one.</p>

                        <speaker>George.</speaker>

                        <p>Softly, let us recollect our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a little. I remember, I told you, when I <hi>juſt hit your meaning</hi> ſo well, that whenever from two different points, one imagines diſtant objects to preſerve ſtill the ſame diſtance, thoſe two points muſt be ſuppoſed not very far aſunder; and in ſhort, it is juſt as if they both made but one.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, that was it, word for word.</p>

point, compared to the diſtance of the torch, if it were ſo far removed as not to appear bigger than a ſpark.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>It is acknowledged, that the diameter of the earth's orbit, is 200,000,000 miles. The earth, therefore, at one extremity of this diameter, ſees the oppoſite ſtar 200,000,000 miles nearer than at the other.</p>

                        <speaker>George.</speaker>
                        <p>That is plain.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, if the earth, from two points ſo different, and notwithſtanding the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous diſtance by which ſhe is nearer in one of them, ſees this ſtar preſerve ſtill the ſame diſtance; if, notwithſtanding the immenſe bulk of this ſtar, which I ſhall make appear to you by and by, ſhe never perceives it to be larger than a ſparkling point, the two extremities of the diameter of her orbit, for all the vaſt interval between them, may then be imagined to coaleſce in one point, and this immenſe orbit itſelf will appear as no more than ſuch a point, become imperceptible with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the infinite diſtance which the ſtar will preſerve from her.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, my poor George, what have you to ſay, in reply?</p>

Will this proud planet then imagine, that the arch of the Heavens is built only to form a pavilion over

her, in which the ſtars are ſet at equal diſtances for ornament, and that ſhe is of conſequence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to occupy the middle place of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, in which ſhe is hardly ſo much as perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>

                        <p>Well now, what mortifies me much more, is, that all the famous philoſophers of antiquity, would place our inconſiderable planet in the centre of the univerſe, and no where elſe. I ſee, that in the firſt age of wiſdom, men were ſtill but a compoſition of pride and folly.</p>

                        <p>Pythagoras had brought from Egypt and India, the foundeſt notions of aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, which he extended no farther during his life-time, than the compaſs of the ſchool that he had founded in Italy; his diſciples, however, carried them into Greece, after his death. By this great man, the ſun was placed in the centre of our ſyſtem, the planets moving round him in this order, Mercury, Venus, the earth, with her moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. He did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, it is true, as to their diſtances and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; but the geometry of his age, was not ſufficiently advanced, nor inſtruments brought to their preſent perfection.</p>

                        <speaker>Mrs. Croſby.</speaker>
                        <p>That accounts for his deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: however, he was ſtill the philoſopher: and was his ſyſtem followed?</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>How could he ſucceed among people who were taught, by their men of genius, that the earth was flat, like a table, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens an arched vault of hard ſolid matter, like
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:045437_0085_1020281A1A87B7B0"/>
the earth; or that the ſun was a maſs of fire, ſomewhat larger than Peloponneſus; that comets were formed by the accidental concourſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wandering ſtars; that ſtars were only rocks or mountains carried up by the revolution of the ether, which had ſet them on fire; or, in ſhort, that the ſtars were lighted up at night to be put out in the morning, while the ſun, which they made a fiery cloud, was kindled in the morning, to go out at night; and that there were ſeveral ſuns and moons to enlighten our different cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates? Now, if the ſtar of day was, according to all theſe notions, leſs than the earth, could it be expected that ſhe would reſign the centre of the univerſe to him?</p>

                        <p>Ptolemy finding theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons received in his time, and building on the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious evidence of the ſenſes, eaſily perſuaded himſelf and others, that the opinions of Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras were only viſionary, that the earth was the centre of all motion, both of the planets (the ſun being reckoned among them) and of the fixed ſtars, with his glaſs heavens, which he blew out at one whiff. This ſyſtem held its ground for more than fourteen centuries, patched up every day with ſome additional abſurdity, which its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorers adopted, in order to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the objections that preſſed hardeſt upon them.</p>

                        <p>There was a difference. He did make all the planets now turn about the earth, ſhe had only the moon left her. The ſun, taking the reſt in his train, moved round her in the courſe of a year; which, however, did not hinder him, together with the whole aſſemblage of the ſtars, from repeating the ſame mark of reſpect to her once in every twenty-four hours.</p>

                        <p>I muſt confeſs, I felt that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſome degree, laſt year, when I went to ſee his ſtatue at Cambridge. Roubilliac, a French ſculptor, has repreſented him in an erect attitude, looking at the ſun, and ſhewing him, with one hand, a priſm, which he holds in the other to decompoſe his rays. While I was lifted up in thought, to the vaſt height to which he has raiſed human knowledge, I imagined Nature as ſhe formed him, to addreſs him thus. "Though man has ſtudied my laws for ſo many ages, he has ſtill miſconceived them; it is time now to reveal them to him. Thou art born to publiſh them upon earth; go then, renew aſtronomy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large geometry, and lay the baſis of natural phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. I aſſign thee theſe ſciences, at the ſame time, with the genius that attends thy birth. Thou ſhalt tell the extent of the univerſe, and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:045437_0089_10202825CC7E49B8"/>
the ſimplicity of the order that governs it. Thou ſhalt weigh the maſs of thoſe immenſe bodies which I have ſcattered through it; thou ſhalt point out their form, determine their revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and meaſure their diſtances; thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to preciſe calculation, even the inequalities of their movements. In the midſt of them, thou ſhalt fix the ſun, and ſhalt ſay by what power he rules them, and how he diſtributes to them light and activity. For thy reward, I will place thee thyſelf, as a new luminary, in the midſt of all the great men who are to follow thee. Whilſt thou giveſt a rapid impulſe to their genius, thou ſhalt make it inceſſantly tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thine own; and they ſhall move round thee with reſpect, in order to receive light from thee. As for thoſe who would depart from it, like rebellious comets, that to ſhrink from the empire of the ſun, loſe themſelves for ages in the viewleſs depth of ſpace, but which he conſtantly brings back to the foot of his throne, ſo they, from the darkneſs of their errors, ſhall be forced to return to thee, nor ſhall they ſhine in any part of their courſe, even with tranſient light, ſave when at your approach, they are enveloped in the ſplendor of your rays."</p>
                        <p>Here the ſervant came to inform Mrs. Croſby, that ſupper was ſerved up. Emily and George would have been glad it were kept back, that they might ſtill liſten to Mr. Glanville. For their ſatisfaction, he was obliged to promiſe, that after ſupper, he would take another turn in the garden, and that they ſhould be of the party.</p>

                     <head>SECOND CONVERSATION.</head>
                     <p>An agreeable chearfulneſs reigned during the time of ſupper. Mr. Glanville and his ſiſter were delighted with the readineſs of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and fondneſs for inſtruction, which their children had diſcovered. They ſmiled, to obſerve the diſpatch that Emily and George made of their ſupper, who ſpoke not a word the whole time, ſo eager were they to return to the terrace, and reſume the ſubject of their converſation. Our little philoſophers had already finiſhed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, and began to fret upon their ſeats with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, which Mrs. Croſby, who obſerved it, probably took a pleaſure to prolong. Be that as it may, Emily, in order to loſe no time, began to joke upon George's romantic pride, in wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be viſible to the ſtars. George bore this pleaſantry with a good grace, until he ſaw his father and aunt (whom he had been watching for ſome time) finiſh their ſupper; then turning ſhort to Emily, "couſin," ſaid he, loud enough to draw the general attention, "I was reading the other day a ſtory which, I dare ſay, my papa knows, and your mamma too, but which, I dare ſay, you do not. I will tell it to you. Mahomet had once a mind to give his army a proof of the power which he exerciſed over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and promiſed to perform a very great miracle in their preſence. This was no leſs than to make a pretty high mountain move and come to him, from a conſiderable diſtance. One fine morning, therefore, he aſſembles all his ſoldiers, who already gave their great prophet credit for
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:045437_0091_1020282D0CE05360"/>
the performance of ſomething prodigious, and placing himſelf at their head, he orders the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to approach. The mountain turns a deaf ear to his word of command. Mahomet is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized. He calls it a ſecond time, with a voice more terrible than at firſt. The mountain, as you may imagine, did not ſtir the more for this ſummons. How is this! cried the impoſtor, with an air of inſpiration, the mountain will not walk to us) Well then, my friends, let us walk to the mountain.—I have no more ill-nature in me, than Mahomet; if the ſtars do not ſee us, why then, couſin, let us go ſee the ſtars.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words he roſe briſkly from table, and bounced towards the door, leaving Emily a good deal ſurprized at this concluſion. Mr. Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville and Mrs. Croſby ſmiled at his ready turn, and followed him into the garden.</p>
                     <p>It was a moſt beautiful clear night; not a cloud intercepted the ſight of the ſky. The moon which had now begun to appear above the horizon, ſuffered thoſe ſtars which ſhe had juſt before obſcured, to reſume their luſtre, as ſhe gradually withdrew from them. The children had often admired the grandeur of this ſight, but now, when their curioſity upon the ſubject was going to be ſatisfied, they beheld it with additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rapture. The bright ſtar of Sirius was the firſt that attracted George's notice. He wiſhed to know its name; and when he had heard it, I like Sirius, papa, cried he, for it is the largeſt of any of the ſtars.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:045437_0092_101FFAB771FA20E0"/>
it is in fact, no larger nor brighter than the reſt, but then it is nearer the earth. If it were brought to the diſtance of the ſun, it would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly appear at large as he does. Indeed, if we conſider that it is 200,000 times farther off, we muſt be aſtoniſhed that it is ſo viſible.</p>

But this very impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is ſufficient to prove, at leaſt, that the diſtance is prodigious; for the magnitudes of the planets have been determined with ſufficient accuracy, even the moſt diſtant ones, and among the reſt, this handſome planet, Jupiter.</p>

                        <p>I ſuppoſe, as Jupiter and the moon only reflect a borrowed light, this light cannot have the ſame force of motion as when it comes from bodies that ſhine of themſelves.</p>

                        <p>Surprizingly well explained: and thus it is, that Jupiter's diſk does not appear magnified; and ſmall as his diſtance ſhews him, aſtronomers have inſtruments of ſufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to meaſure him. But the ſtars, with that dazzling radiance that ſurrounds them.—</p>

                        <p>It is exactly the effect which a teleſcope produces, by uniting and concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all their rays into a point. But then that point is ſo ſmall; and the more perfect the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcope is, the more this point, while it grows brighter, becomes alſo ſmaller, until, at laſt, it eludes all meaſure.</p>

                        <p>Well, but how have they been able to compare the ſun's diſtance with thoſe of the ſtars?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>By a very ingenious method. The magnitude and diſtance of the ſun is known from the ſureſt reaſoning. They have alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, both how much he ſhould be diminiſhed, or how far removed, to bring him down to the ſize of Sirius. From theſe calculations, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer the prodigious diſtance of this ſtar, which is, nevertheleſs, the neareſt to us of any. Moſt aſtronomers even judge this diſtance to be more conſiderable, becauſe it is to be doubted, whether the beſt teleſcope can totally diveſt a ſtar of its ſuperfluous light, and make it preſerve, to our view, the ſize which it ſhould, at that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

                        <p>Oh! ſince the ſtars are ſo far off, I can eaſily believe, as we have been told, that they are real ſuns. If they poſſeſſed only a borrowed light, how could their rays reach, even to us, with ſuch a lively brightneſs, after having paſſed through immenſe ſpace?</p>

                        <p>Very well, my boy, your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is quite juſt. It has been demonſtrated, that the light of a ſtar might be diminiſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of times, by removing it farther from our ſight, and yet it ſhould ſtill appear no fainter than a piece of white paper by moonlight.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Glanville.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, have not you obſerved that thoſe of Fleet-market, which were the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, appeared with a livelier and ſtronger light than thoſe of London-bridge?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <p>Now, ſuppoſe that between any two of the latter, you ſaw one of the ſame ſize at Tower-ſtairs, which, conſequently, would be about twice as far off. You remember what we ſaid before ſupper, that objects, at a certain degree of remoteneſs, appear equally diſtant from the eye, though they may be much farther off ſome than others.</p>

                        <p>You underſtand then, my dear, that the lamp at the Tower-ſtairs, would appear ranged in the ſame circular line with thoſe of London-bridge, and that you can judge it to be farther off no otherwiſe than by the ſmallneſs of its flame, and the weakneſs of its rays.</p>

                        <p>I will try and bring it down to your level. Thoſe ſtars that are about Jupiter, would not one ſuppoſe them as near to us as he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? If the moon was now on the ſame ſide, would not one think Jupiter as near as the moon? And if there was a cloud in the neighborhood of the moon, would not one think her alſo as near to us as the cloud? The cloud, the moon, Jupiter, and the ſtars, would then appear all in the ſame arch, as it were. Now, do you know, couſin, that their diſtances are very different?</p>

                        <p>Yes; ſo well, that I can tell you too, that the very largeſt cloud would not be viſible at the diſtance of the moon, that the moon
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:045437_0097_1020283D89057A90"/>
would not be viſible at the diſtance of Jupiter, and that Jupiter would be ſtill leſs viſible at the diſtance of the ſtars.</p>

                        <p>This is well, my little friends. I like this repartee. Luckily, thoſe laſt words of Emily, bring us back to what we were juſt now mentioning, that the ſtars muſt needs ſhine with their own light, and that this light muſt needs be very ſtrong, to reach us from a diſtance at which Jupiter would have ceaſed one thouſand times to be viſible.</p>

                        <p>Of what ſervice could they be to her? If we depended upon them to ripen the corn, it would be long before the country folks could ſing harveſt home.</p>

                        <p>They have nothing that can be of uſe to us, but their dim light. And even the moon from behind a cloud, hardly gives a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more.</p>

                        <p>More ſtill than you think; for the comets do not move like the planets in an ellipſe that differs little from a perfect circle, by which means they would be always nearly at an equal diſtance from the ſun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They deſcribe an ellipſe exceſſively oblong, and ſo increaſe their diſtance continually, until they arrive at that point of their orbit from which the ſun forces them to return by the oppoſite ſide; but when arrived at this ſo diſtant point, where, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they yield to the force by which the ſun continually attracts them, they muſt be ſtill a good deal farther from the ſuns of the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtems, otherwiſe the neareſt one would force them to enter within its dominions: at this diſtance, therefore, which our comet takes nearly a century and a half to meaſure, it muſt ſtill leave beyond it, an immenſe ſpace unoccupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

clouds, which cannot be ſeen, without an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! The millions that are contained in the milky way! the very idea of their number is ſufficient to terrify the imagination. At the ſight of a high mountain, a man feels himſelf particularly affected: he ſhudders, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on the vaſt extent of the earth: the ocean and its unfathomable depths, make his blood run cold; and yet what is this whole globe, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the burning maſs of the ſun, which is one million four hundred thouſand times larger? and the ſpace occupied by this luminary, immenſe as it is, what will it be found, on compariſon with that ſpace in which the bodies move, that are ſubject to its action? But while he makes the planets, ſurrounded by their ſatellites, move round him, what would you ſay, if he, as well as other ſuns, followed like him, by their retinue, moved round ſome other body ſtill more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than all of them at once.</p>

Nature has impreſſed this motion on all bodies which move in an orbit round another more powerful, that governs them; thus the ſatellites turn on their axes, while they encircle their proper planets, and the planets, while they encircle the ſun. Would Nature, ever uniform and conſiſtent in its law, have given the ſun this vertiginous motion, if he had no other? All the planets, at the ſame time that they go round him, move thus, in order to receive his warmth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively in all their parts. Now, ſince he is endowed with this ſame movement, may we not ſuppoſe him to have the other alſo, and to be carried round a central power, ſtill ſuperior to himſelf?</p>

How ſhall thoſe ſyſtems, which were poiſed by the equality of their forces, reſiſt the uſurper, ſtrengthened with the addition of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded world, and puſhed forward in his courſe with a new impetuoſity? As a fire attracts the light ſtraw, he ſees thoſe worlds, which border on his paſſage, ruſh in crouds into the vortex of his flames: thus he moves on, conſuming as he goes, and becomes the wandering fire-brand of general conflagration to the univerſe.</p>

The earth, only ſixty times larger than the moon, can yet ſway her courſe; Saturn carries his ring and his Satellites along with him; nor is Jupiter ever forſaken by his. If theſe planets, by their governing maſs, compel the bodies in their train to accompany them as they revolve round the ſun, certainly the ſun, with a maſs of matter vaſtly more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than all the comets, planets and their Satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites

This is a law which Nature invariably follows in the ſyſtem of the univerſe.

Now how many millions of creatures does he diſcover ſtill more minute? A drop of prepared water, the tranſparence of which ſeems not the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, exhibits to him a ſea ſwarming with whales: a piece of mouldy fruit preſents to his view a mountain covered with foreſts, (like the Apennine to us) and towering to the clouds.

But what wiſdom, much more worthy of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hath he ſhewn in the equipoiſe in which they are kept up by the eternal concord of their movements! Caſt your eyes firſt upon our ſolar ſyſtem; beſide the ſeven planets, and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellites, which move through it in unchangeable order; behold upwards of ſixty comets in the whole, revolve in it, whoſe dark excurſions are traced: what an infinitely greater number ſtill that we have never diſcovered. Geometry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, that from the form of their orbits, a million of theſe bodies could move round the ſun, without incommoding each other's courſe. Riſe now upon the wings of thought, traverſe all thoſe worlds in which the ſame harmony reigns throughout; go proſtrate yourſelf at the foot of the Creator's throne, and behold from thence
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:045437_0112_1020285589628AC8"/>
the march of univerſal nature. What a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle opens to your eyes! Thoſe ſtars, which to us here below, appear but immoveable lights, you behold in all their ſplendor, like ſuns moving in ſilence, with all their planetary train, round more powerful ſuns, who carry them alſo round ſuns ſtill more glorious. What juſt proportions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe heavenly provinces, empires and worlds! what majeſty of domination, and even of dependence! how all theſe intermingle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confuſion! What then ſhall be the inviſible chain ſufficiently ſtrong to connect all the parts of an infinite whole? The great Newton has diſcovered it to us. It is one ſingle principle of mutual attraction which the Supreme Being hath implanted in all bodies. This, combined with the impulſe which they received on coming from his creative hand, and regulated by the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of magnitudes and diſtances, is the univerſal agent of nature. This tends to re-unite what the projectile motion would ſeparate. Theſe two forces perpetually acting, balance each other and preſerve among the worlds, that order which was eſtabliſhed ſince the creation. Each body, nay, each ſyſtem, attracts all the reſt, as it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by them. A general reciprocity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction unites them, while it keeps them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and acts as a prop to their orbits, without breaking in upon them. The ſuns which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them, receive their reflected rays, that not an atom of light be diſſipated in vain through the immenſity of ſpace. It ſeems as if the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would have traced, in this ſame law, the greateſt principle of human morality; "Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:045437_0113_10202859D855FB00"/>
aſſiſt each other with your lights, and with your powers tend one towards the other, without departing from the ſphere in which my provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has placed you. This order is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much for your happineſs, as for the ſupport of the univerſe."</p>
                        <p>The two children had not ſuffered a ſingle word to eſcape them during the latter part of this converſation: but they were not ſilent from ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it was from the impreſſion of ſurpriſe with which they had been ſtruck, and the attention that they had paid to the magnificent picture which was preſented to them. Mr. Glanville, nevertheleſs, feared, left part of his diſcourſe might have been loſt to their apprehenſion, as he had not given them time to reflect on it: and therefore, as ſoon as he roſe the next morning, he wrote down from memory, the two conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the preceding evening. Emily and George read them over ſeveral times in the courſe of the day. Mr. Glanville promiſed to give them, in an evening walk, every explanation that they could deſire on the ſubject of attraction, while he explained, at the ſame time, the motion of the earth round the ſun, and that of the moon round the earth.</p>

                        <p>By the flaſhes of the lightning, I perceived Pythias on his knees, at the ſhip's ſide, with his hands lifted up toward heaven. "Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods, cried he, it is not for my own life that I ſupplicate you, but for that of my friend. Let me live to return, and break thoſe chains with which his friendſhip for me has loaded him. I reſign you then my life, when I have ſaved his. Would you, by my deſtruction, cauſe the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Damon to fall a victim to his virtue? Ye know, who read the hearts of men, that ye have not a more noble image of yourſelves upon earth." "Thy lips, anſwered I, inſult the gods, in daring to compare a mortal to them—thus they puniſh thy impiety;" and I ſtruck him with a dreadful blow that plunged him to the bottom of the devouring deep.</p>

                     <head>SCENE Fairfax's tent before the walls of Colcheſter.</head>
                     <p>THE civil war in England under Charles I. being, as it were, re-kindled, after a ſhort ceſſation, the parliament, by reſolving to preſent no more addreſſes to that unfortunate prince, then a priſoner in the Iſle of Wight, filled the hearts of all honeſt men with indignation. Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Wales, ſome towns in the North, part of the county of Surry, and even ſeventeen men of war in the parliament's pay, declared for the king. There were ſome riſings alſo in his favour in the counties of Eſſex and Kent, which were ſupported by the zeal of the Earl of Surry, Lord Capel, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Liſle. Againſt theſe Sir Thomas Fairfax was ſent with a pretty numerous army. That able
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:045437_0129_1020288AB6681DA8"/>
General found no difficulty in defeating a few troops newly raiſed, and ill diſciplined. He gained a complete victory over them at Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in Kent; and purſuing their ſcattered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, he obliged both them and the royaliſts in Eſſex to ſhut themſelves up in the town of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, which he haſtened immediately to inveſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſiege of Colcheſter is one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable events of that unfortunate period, on account of the obſtinate defence made by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. It laſted from the 18th of June, to the end of Auguſt, 1648. The walls and fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the town, ſaid to have been built by the Romans, and remarkable for that ſtrength and ſolidity which their works uſually diſplay, ſtill exhibit dreadful marks of the fury of the ſiege. The greateſt part of the churches in particular were half demoliſhed by the batteries of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament army; but the beſieged, notwithſtanding the violent aſſaults of their adverſaries, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the extremities to which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for want of proviſion, inſomuch that they had nothing left for ſubſiſtence, but the horſes of the garriſon, continued to make briſk ſallies, and defied all the force of the beſiegers, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain expectation of relief from ſome quarter or other.</p>
                     <p>At this period commences the action of the following drama, in which the principal object is, to delineate in its proper ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gth, the reſolute and generous character of Lord Capel, which was invariably diſplayed in every circumſtance of his life and death. Such a character, it is
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:045437_0130_1020288C46239820"/>
preſumed, will not be found unintereſting to the mind of a young reader; and in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it to the fulleſt advantage, at the end of the drama, are ſubjoined ſome intereſting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars concerning the death of that virtuous nobleman.</p>
                     <p>It remains, however, to be obſerved, that the fact upon which the drama principally turns, is by no means advanced as authentic. Neither Lord Clarendon, or any other writer of that age, takes the leaſt notice of it. Nor has Hume, or ſuch modern hiſtorians, as from their averſion to the republican party, it might be ſuppoſed would not let ſlip ſuch an incident, made any mention of the circumſtance. It depends, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, entirely upon the credit of Monſieur Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenet, who in his life of Cromwell relates it at large, with many particulars, which at leaſt give it the appearance of probability.</p>

                     <head>SEQUEL.</head>
                     <p>Cromwell, who was ſent by General Fairfax to oppoſe the Duke of Hamilton and Sir Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduke Langdale, having defeated thoſe two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals ſucceſſively, and taken the duke priſoner, and the Earl of Holland having alſo been defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made priſoner, by another detachment of the parliament-army; the inhabitants of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, who only held out, in hopes of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſaw themſelves, at length, reduced to the neceſſity of capitulating: they deputed perſons to Fairfax, to treat of the ſurrender of the town upon honorable terms; but he, provoked at the obſtinacy of their defence, offered them no other than to ſurrender at diſcretion. Upon receiving this anſwer, the beſieged ſpent two days more in conſultation: the firſt reſolution taken by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, was, to force their way through the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's camp, ſword in hand; but the few horſes, which their hunger had ſpared, were found too weak for this attempt: on the other hand, the ſoldiers, exhauſted with fatigue, were unable to ſuſtain another aſſault; ſo that they were obliged, at length, to open the gates to Fairfax, and to ſubmit to the conditions that he ſhould think proper to impoſe on them.</p>
                     <p>He ſuffered the ſoldiers to depart, but without arms or baggage; but the officers he ordered to be confined in the town-hall, and a liſt of their names to be ſent to him. Ireton, whom Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:045437_0157_102028DC28827FA8"/>
in his abſence, had left as a ſpy upon the unſuſpecting general, choſe out of this lift ſuch as were more particularly his enemies, in order that they might be put to death. Sir Charles Lucas, therefore, Sir G. Liſle, and Sir Barnard Gaſcoyne, were brought before the council of war, where Fairfax declared to them, that for a puniſhment of their obſtinate reſiſtance, and a warning example to all others who ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to imitate it, they were ſentenced to die, that very day, at the foot of the caſtle-walls.</p>
                     <p>When this ſentence was communicated to the other priſoners, Lord Capel prevailed upon an officer of the guard which was over them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the council of war a letter ſigned by the principal officers, intreating them to revoke their cruel ſentence, or elſe to extend it to all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, who bluſhed to ſee themſelves excepted from it. This generous requeſt had no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than to haſten the execution of their unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate companions.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles Lucas, who was the firſt officer ſhot, gave the ſignal to his murderers to fire, with as much coolneſs as he would have delivered the word of command to his own men. Liſle, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him fall, ran to him, and embraced his dead body, and then riſing, looked with a ſtern air upon the ſoldiers by whom he was to be ſhot, and ordered them to come nearer. One of them anſwered him, that they were near enough, and that they ſhould not miſs him. My friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, ſmiling, I have been nearer to you, and yet you have miſſed me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="unknown:045437_0158_101FFAC99453DB80"/>
Sir B. Gaſcoyne, or Guaſconi, a Florentine gentleman, was ſpared by the council of war, under the apprehenſion left the Grand Duke of Tuſcany, informed of ſuch a violation of the laws of war, ſhould retort upon the Engliſh who might be found in his dominions.</p>
                     <p>After the execution of Liſle and Lucas, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Fairfax, accompanied by G. Ireton, went to the town-hall to ſee the priſoners. In ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the Earl of Norwich and Lord Capel, he endeavored, with a ſoothing ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, to excuſe the rigour which military juſtice had exacted from him. But Lord Capel, who looked upon Ireton as the ſole inſtigator of this barbarity, loaded him with the bittereſt reproaches, which, however, the latter very ſoon found an opportunity of revenging.</p>
                     <p>The parliament having ordered the Lords Norwich and Capel to be confined in Windſor Caſtle, they found the Duke of Hamilton there before them, with whom they had the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfaction of deploring their misfortunes in common. They were ſoon, however, removed to the Tower, there to await the deſtiny which parliament ſhould think proper to allot to them.</p>
                     <p>About a month after King Charles I. was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, another high court of juſtice was formed for the trial of theſe three noblemen, as alſo of the Earl of Holland and Sir John Owen, who had taken an active part in Wales, in favor of the king, and killed, with his own hand, a ſheriff of the oppoſite party.</p>
                     <p>Lord Capel appeared with the greateſt firmneſs and dignity in the preſence of his judges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:045437_0159_102028DF20272F98"/>
to acknowledge their authority; alledging, that as a ſoldier and a priſoner of war, he was not amenable to the civil law. Upon which Bradſhaw, who was preſident of the court, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him with unfeeling inſolence, by alluding to their form of proceeding againſt the king, "that they had tried a much better man than his lordſhip." After ſome debates, in which Ireton broke out with all the violence and fury of his natural diſpoſition, ſentence was paſſed upon Lord Capel and the other priſoners. They were all condemned to loſe their heads; upon which it is ſaid, that Sir John Owen made the judges a low bow, and thanked them for the high honor which they conferred on him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him, who was but a poor Welch gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to loſe his head in company with noblemen of ſo conſiderable rank; adding, that his greateſt fear had been, leſt the common hangman ſhould have terminated his deſtiny. The priſoners were allowed but three days to ſet their affairs in order, and to prepare for death.</p>
                     <p>Lady Capel employed this ſhort ſpace in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a petition to be laid before parliament; when read, it was very ſtrongly ſupported by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral members, who ſpoke in the higheſt terms of Lord Capel's many and eminent virtues. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Cromwell praiſed his lordſhip ſo highly, and profeſſed ſo much reſpect and friendſhip for him, that every one expected him to be inclined in his favor, when he added, in a hypocritical canting tone, that his zeal for the public cauſe got the better of all his private affections; that he knew Lord Capel to be the laſt man in England who
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:045437_0160_102028E0B5148810"/>
would abandon the royal party; that his inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility of principle, his experience and valor, the number and attachment of his friends, made him the moſt formidable enemy that parliament had; that as long as he lived, let him be reduced to whatſoever condition he might, they would find him always a thorn in their ſides; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with proteſting, that his conſcience, and the intereſts of the commonwealth, impoſed it on him as a duty to give his vote againſt the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                     <p>The implacable Ireton vented his hatred and animoſity with leſs diſguiſe: he vehemently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in the houſe of commons, the ſentence which he had procured to be paſſed in the high court of juſtice. Though there was not a ſingle perſon who knew Lord Capel's character, but entertained the higheſt eſteem and veneration for him, and very few who had any ſubject of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal quarrel againſt him, yet Cromwell and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton thus appearing his declared enemies, the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice due to his virtues, and the compaſſion which his misfortunes inſpired, were put to ſilence by the terror of thoſe two names, and his fate was given up to their revenge.</p>
                     <p>Of the number condemned, the Earl of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich and Sir John Owen received a pardon. The former having preſented a petition to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the houſe divided upon it, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on both ſides were found to be equal; the Speaker, therefore, whoſe vote was to determine the earl's deſtiny, having formerly been under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations to him, was induced, from a motive of gratitude, to ſave his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:045437_0161_102028E6C5033BD0"/>
Sir John Owen was ſo indifferent about his, that he had not ſo much as thought of petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Ireton whimſically made this very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a plea in his favor, when he moved the houſe to ſpare his life. He thought, perhaps, by this exception, to offer a freſh inſult to the three noblemen, and to make their death more grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſhewing them a private perſon ſaved from the rigour of his ſentence, without ever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning, while their applications were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly rejected.</p>
                     <p>A ſcaffold was therefore erected under the windows of the parliament houſe. After the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl of Holland had ſuffered, Lord Capel was called: he walked down Weſtminſter Hall with a ſerene counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and a firm ſtep, ſaluting his acquaintances with dignity. Dr. Morley, his friend, who had not quitted him, from the moment of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, was ſolicitous to accompany him now, that he might receive his laſt commands: but he was ſtopped by the ſoldiers, at the foot of the ſcaffold. My lord took leave of him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him affectionately, thanked him for all his attentions, and would not ſuffer him to go any further, leſt he ſhould be expoſed to the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the guards. Advancing then towards the edge of the ſcaffold, he looked round him with a placid countenance, and aſked whether the other lords had ſpoken to the people unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and being anſwered in the affirmative, he gave his hat to one of the attendants to hold; then, with a clear bold voice, he declared that he came to loſe his life for an action which he could
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:045437_0162_102028E9B111D038"/>
never repent of; that having been brought up in principles of attachment to the conſtitution of his country, loyalty to his ſovereign, and fidelity to his religion, he had never violated any of theſe principles; that he was now condemned to die, contrary to all the laws of the realm, and that, nevertheleſs, he ſubmitted to this unjuſt ſentence.</p>
                     <p>He then enlarged upon the praiſes of that king whom they had recently murdered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought heaven not to avenge this crime on the deluded nation. He concluded, with earneſtly exhorting them to acknowledge the ſon of Charles as their rightful ſovereign. Laſtly, after a ſhort and fervent prayer, he ſtretched his neck to the fatal blow, which deprived England of the moſt virtuous citizen that ſhe had left her.</p>

                  <p>FARMER BLUNT, when he died, left two ſons, the one named Roger, the other Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey. His death put them in poſſeſſion of farms ſufficiently advantageous to afford them a decent competency. Very little was wanting to their happineſs. Alas! then, why could they not live in that harmony and good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which Nature deſigned ſhould ſubſiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween brothers, when ſhe formed them of the ſame blood?</p>
                  <p>

Among the poſſeſſions left by their father, was a very fine orchard, which he had cultivated in his life time with particular care. As it bore, moſt years, a prodigious quantity of apples, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for making the beſt cyder, it appeared to both the brothers a very deſirable lot; but, unfortunately, in the partition of their father's lands made by his will, the property of this was left undetermined.</p>
                  <p>Each, therefore, claimed the poſſeſſion of it, and obſtinately perſiſted in ſupporting that claim. They no longer ſpoke to each other in amicable terms; on the contrary, their mutual obſtinacy degenerated on both ſides into a confirmed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. You are not an honeſt man, ſaid Roger, for claiming what is my property, and you do not deſerve to be maſter of ſo good a piece of ground. Humphrey, in a rage, would anſwer, it well becomes you to talk ſo, lazy fellow as you are: Have you not always made my father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, by your drunkenneſs? What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe trees, in your idle hands? In two or three years the orchard would not be worth ſixpence.</p>
                  <p>The curate of the village being informed of their quarrel, went to them, and expoſtulated with them in the moſt friendly manner. What are you doing, my friends? ſaid he; wherefore are you weary of living happily together? Shall this orchard be the means of diſuniting you? Why not rather join your induſtry to improve it, and afterwards divide the produce?</p>
                  <p>

I do not intend any ſuch thing, ſaid one, I will have it all to myſelf. We ſhall ſee that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the other, I think <hi>I</hi> ſhall have it.</p>
                  <p>Well, then, ſaid the clergyman, let the moſt reaſonable of you reſign his claim, upon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſuitable conſideration from the other.</p>
                  <p>With all my heart, cried they, both at once, let my brother give it up to me. I have moſt right to it, ſaid the eldeſt. It belongs to my farm, ſaid the youngeſt.—Oh, I am reſolved to have it, now I have once taken it in my head.—You may take it out again, if you will; I would ſooner give you my right hand.</p>
                  <p>Since you are both ſo obſtinate, ſaid the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and cannot agree together, will you leave the deciſion of the matter to fortune, and diſpoſe of it by lot? No, I will riſk nothing, ſaid Hodge. Nor I, neither, ſaid Numps. Laſt of all, the gentleman propoſed to them to ſell the orchard, and divide the money; but this propoſal alſo was equally rejected on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>I ſee, ſaid the worthy clergyman, nothing can overcome your obſtinacy: you will ſoon find the miſerable effects of mutual hatred in hearts, which were intended by nature to be dear to each other.</p>
                  <p>The brothers did not trouble themſelves about this prophecy, but each of them went to the man of law whom he thought moſt capable of ſetting off his claim to advantage. Thus began a lawſuit, which ſeemed eaſy enough to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but was kept on foot, nevertheleſs, for five whole years; the counſel on both ſides being veterans in the buſineſs. If one party put in a

                     <hi>plea,</hi> the other intercepted it with a <hi>demurrer.</hi> It was, every term, freſh <hi>writs, declarations,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinders.</hi> The orchard all this while, we may ſuppoſe, was not ſo well cultivated as in the time of honeſt Farmer Blunt: thoſe fine apple-trees were neglected, and did not produce near their uſual quantity. Horſes and pigs were ſuffered to break in and damage them; Humphrey, who had the orchard in his hands, being too much taken up with his lawſuit to attend to the culture of it.</p>
                  <p>They were both married to very amiable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and had many children, in whom they would have been perfectly happy, had their minds been more at eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Each of their wives would ſometimes accoſt them thus: My dear huſband, why are you ſo uneaſy? We have every thing that our hearts can wiſh; Have we not? You are in very good health, ſo am I. Our little family goes on charmingly; then we have an excellent farm; and, you know, it is your own fault if you do not make money by it. Why will you not chuſe to be happy? Each of them would mutter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his teeth, and anſwer, How can I be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, while I have ſuch a good-for-nothing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? His injuſtice and obſtinacy are poiſon to my happineſs.</p>
                  <p>When, at their return from the field, they ſaw their children running joyfully towards them, they would cry out to them, before they came near, What do you want with me? Get away. I am not in a humour, now, to mind your tricks; I am too angry: and if the poor children ſtrove
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:045437_0166_102028F5D1AC79A0"/>
to ſoften them, by their innocent fondneſs, they would puſh them away harſhly, and ſometimes give them very violent blows.</p>
                  <p>At table, nothing could pleaſe them, becauſe their hearts were filled with gall; and, in bed, it was out of their power to ſleep, becauſe they were eternally thinking how to hurt each other.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you may ſuppoſe that I have now told the worſt. Alas! no. From ill-will they were carried to ſlander and calumny: each ſtrove how to blacken the character of his brother the moſt. If Numps happened to be in company with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther farmers, he would ſtrive to perſuade them that Hodge was a very bad man, who labored to ruin him firſt, and would then go to law with every man in the pariſh. And as Hodge, for his part, was not backward in ſaying much the ſame of Humphrey, the end of it was, that people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them both: ſo that, in ſhort, they were ſhunned by every body, as dangerous perſons; and there was not one of their neighbours who did not wiſh to ſee the village fairly rid of them.</p>
                  <p>After five years of jarring and brawling at law, judgment was given; and he who gained the cauſe, ſaw himſelf obliged, very ſoon, to ſell not only the orchard, but the greater part of his farms, to pay the expenſes of the ſuit.</p>
                  <p>I leave you to gueſs how the loſer came off. In fact, the confuſion of them both may more eaſily be imagined than deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Well, ſaid Numps, we have both of us deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this. It was in our own power to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it. We might ſtill have had our farms and our money. Inſtead of all the trouble that

we have each cauſed the other, we ſhould have made one another, as well as our own families, happy, and have gained the friendſhip and eſteem of our neighbors.</p>
                  <p>See, ſaid Hodge, all this we have loſt by our folly. Ah! if things were to begin again!</p>
                  <p>Marry, ſaid Numps, let us be wiſer for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Come, brother, here is my hand, I will never be your enemy as long as I live.</p>
                  <p>Nor I your's, replied Hodge, taking his hand. So ſaying, they both ſhed tears, and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hatred departed from their hearts.</p>
                  <p>They very ſoon found themſelves much eaſier in living upon friendly terms with each other; but the ill effects of their former perverſeneſs they were deſtined to feel for a long time. They ſaw their orchard, which had been the poſſeſſion of their family for ſome generations, turn to good account in the hands of ſtrangers, while the little that remained to them of their own farms took ſome time to recover from the ill-manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of five years. Beſides, deriſion was ſwift to purſue them in the village, while confidence and amity returned to them with a ſlow pace. The alacrity of their advocates, in receiving the fee, had thinned their purſes, while fatigue, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and large draughts of unwholeſome law, impaired their health. Even their children did not now ſalute them with the free unconſtrained affection which appears in the children of the virtuous and the benevolent. And their wives—Alas! it was ſome time before they could view their huſbands with the tenderneſs of former years.</p>

                  <head>LOST TIME RECOVERED.</head>
                  <p>LORENZO'S parents were ſo much engaged in the way of buſineſs, that they found it impoſſible to ſuperintend his education them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They had heard of a remarkably good ſchool, where a number of young perſons had been bred, who were diſtinguiſhed for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in learning, and for the principles of honour which they had imbibed. Though it was upwards of a hundred miles from his houſe, yet Lorenzo's father ſent him thither, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to the maſter. This gentleman, who regarded each of his pupils as his own ſon, ſpared no pains to correct his faults, to encourage him to ſtudy, and to implant ſentiments of honour and generoſity in his young breaſt. The perſons alſo, whom he had choſen to aſſiſt him in theſe labours, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted their utmoſt to promote the ſame laudable purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe endeavours, ſo affectionately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his favour, were not ſo ſucceſsful as might naturally be hoped: Lorenzo was of a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inconſtant diſpoſition, and would forget the ſenſible advice which was given him, even at the very moment that he received it. In the hours alotted to ſtudy, he ſuffered his thoughts to wander in ſuch a manner, as not to poſſeſs the ſmalleſt attention for the leſſons of his maſters.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:045437_0169_102028FD365A4E80"/>
All his occupations were ſacrificed to the moſt frivolous amuſements; and he ſhewed the ſame negligence in the care of his perſon and his books. His clothes were always in diſorder; and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his agreeable face and figure, one could not approach him, without feeling a certain diſtaſte ariſe, on ſeeing ſo much ſlovenlineſs.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy to conceive how prejudicial this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention was to his advancement in learning. All his claſs-fellows left him far behind. There was not one, even to the ſmalleſt, who came to the ſchool long after him, who did not look upon him with contempt, as they were, every day, outſtripping him. Whenever any ſtrangers of condition viſited the houſe, he was always ſent out of the way, left his ſhabbineſs and wild ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſhould diſgrace his companions. He never appeared in the public yearly examinations that were held in the ſchool: his ignorance would have been conſidered as a reproach to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</p>
                  <p>All theſe humiliating circumſtances made no impreſſion on him: ſtill he continued in the ſame levity, the ſame diſſipation, the ſame negligence. His teachers beheld him with a ſort of inward regret; and their zeal for his improvement grew, every day, cooler and cooler. They would often ſay to each other, Poor Lorenzo! how unhappy he will make himſelf! What will his parents ſay, when they ſee him return home ſo full of ill habits, and ſo deficient in learning?</p>
                  <p>Two whole years had thus ſlipped away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt profit to his education, when, at
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:045437_0170_1020290193ADF2D8"/>
the end of that time, he received a parcel, ſealed with black: he opened it, and read the following letter:</p>

                  <p>Lorenzo's giddineſs had not ſuppreſſed the feelings of nature in him; and this letter awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them effectually. He burſt into tears, wrung his hands, and, in a voice, broken with ſobs, he cries, Ah! my father, my father; have I then loſt you for ever! Taking the portrait, he preſſes it to his heart and his lips, and apoſtrophizes it
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:045437_0171_102029031D0B7878"/>
with theſe words: O dear author of my being, you have expended ſo much for my inſtruction, and I have not profited from it! You were ſo worthy a man, and I—No, I do not deſerve to be called your ſon.</p>
                  <p>He ſpent the whole day in theſe bitter reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At night he went to bed, but in vain he turned himſelf to and fro: ſleep viſited him not. His imagination repreſented before his eyes, the form of his father, who, in an angry and terrible voice, thus rebuked him: unworthy boy, I have ſacrificed my repoſe and my life, to make you happy, and you bring diſhonour on my name, by your miſconduct. His thoughts would then turn on his mother, and on the diſtreſs that he muſt occaſion to her, inſtead of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation which ſhe expected to receive from his return. What will be her diſtreſs, ſaid he, when I ſhall appear before her, and have none but the moſt mortifying teſtimonies of my inattention to ſhew her, from my inſtructors! Inſtead of having cauſe to be proud of the education that ſhe has given me, I ſhall force her to bluſh: ſhe will wiſh to love me, and I ſhall deſerve but her hatred. O my dear parent! I ſhall, perhaps, be the cauſe of her death. Oh, that I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited better by the inſtructions that have been laviſhed upon me! Oh that I could recover the precious time that I have loſt!</p>
                  <p>Thus did he torment himſelf the whole night, and bathe his bed with his tears. As ſoon as it was light, he roſe in haſte, intending to begin an immediate and perſevering application to his ſtudies; but meeting the head maſter, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:045437_0172_1020290667CA5B08"/>
to the ſchool, he fell on his knees before him, and, O Sir, ſaid he, you ſee here the moſt unfortunate child upon earth. I have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to your words. I have learned nothing of what I ſhould now know perfectly. Have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on me; I would not wiſh to make my mother die of grief.</p>
                  <p>The maſter was ſenſibly touched with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs: he raiſed Lorenzo, and embraced him. My dear child, ſaid he, ſince you ſee your fault, you may ſtill repair it. You perceive how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mortifying it is to have cauſe for ſelf-reproach. Before you had a clear ſenſe of your folly, you were barely blameable; but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it would be criminal in you now. Two whole years you have entirely loſt: you have but another for the finiſhing of your ſtudies. Judge how you muſt exert yourſelf. However, be not diſcouraged: there is nothing that cannot be accompliſhed with aſſiduity and perſeverance. Begin, this very moment: it ſhall not be the fault of my zeal, if you are not very ſoon as well ſatisfied with yourſelf as you now have reaſon to be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Lorenzo could thank him no otherwiſe, than by taking his hand, and preſſing it to his lips. He than ran immediately to his form, and began to ſtudy his leſſon, and continued to do the ſame every day following. His maſters, aſtoniſhed at ſuch perſevering diligence, ſat immediately about cultivating his natural parts, with more care and attention than they had ever uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. His companions, who had conceived a mean opinion of him, were ſoon obliged to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:045437_0173_1020290ADBB4DD70"/>
change it, for eſteem. Encouraged by all theſe fortunate circumſtances, Lorenzo every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his ardour and vigilance. He was no longer that giddy child who neglected every duty, to indulge himſelf in ſilly, trifling amuſements. Order and cleanlineſs ſucceeded to his former ſlovenly manner; and his teachers were now obliged to force him away from his ſtudies, in order to make him enjoy ſome relaxation. He would, ſometimes, indeed, find himſelf inſenſibly relapſing towards his old habits, but he needed only to caſt an eye upon his father's picture, to ſtrengthen him afreſh in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dable reſolution.</p>
                  <p>The year which his mother had allowed him for the finiſhing of his ſtudies, was drawing near a period: it ſeemed to glide away very rapidly, as he filled up every moment of his time, and therefore found it hardly ſufficient for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his application.</p>
                  <p>At length the hour of departure arrived. The change wrought in his character, had attached his companions to him ſo affectionately, that the thoughts of parting with him gave them extreme concern. His maſters were grieved to ſee a youth depart, who now began to do credit to their inſtructions; and he was grieved no leſs at leaving his maſters, whoſe prudent advice had ſo well ſupported him in his reſolution: the head maſter, in particular, who began to felicitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on Lorenzo's progreſs, as his own proper work, was inconſolable; and his concern ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very ſtrongly expreſſed, in a letter which he wrote to Lorenzo's mother, rendering her the
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:045437_0174_1020290C644E3C38"/>
moſt advantageous account poſſible, of her ſon's behaviour.</p>
                  <p>During the whole journey, Lorenzo's emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of hope, joy, and expectation, kept him <hi>tremblingly alive.</hi> His heart throbbed with the idea of re-viſiting the ſcenes of his infancy; nor did he now dread ſo much to ſhew himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his mother, becauſe he was conſcious, that for a twelvemonth paſt, he had neglected nothing that could tend to his improvement. Yet he could not help ſaying to himſelf, now and then, Fool that I was! Could I not have done the ſame thing three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>His mother had come a part of the way to meet him. With what joy did ſhe behold her dear ſon once more! The head maſter's letters had before informed her of his happy reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he now brought one from him, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of which were ſtill more flattering. A mother only wiſhes for new reaſons, to love her ſon with redoubled fondneſs. Thoſe reaſons ſhe found in the idea that Lorenzo had reformed his conduct, only out of affection for her; and, with a mother's eye, ſhe looked preſagingly forward to the happineſs of his future life.</p>
                  <p>Lorenzo did not diſappoint theſe hopes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dedicating a few days to the viſits of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and friends, he returned, with freſh ardor, to a life of application. The habit of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:045437_0175_1020290F5B309240"/>
employed, gave ſtrength to his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that he ſoon acquired every information neceſſary, to qualify him for putting himſelf at the head of his family affairs. The manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them was too laborious for a tender wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, already much depreſſed by her grief; and her ſon's activity, diligence and ſkill, ſoon brought them into a flouriſhing ſtate. A wealthy eſtabliſhment, which he formed ſoon after, and the good order with which he conducted it, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in a ſituation, ſufficiently at eaſe, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to undertake, himſelf, the education of his numerous children. He endeavored, above all things, to make them thoroughly perceive the ineſtimable value of time; and to caution them, by his own experience, againſt ever expoſing themſelves to the unpleaſant regret of having illy employed it.</p>

                  <p>MR. MEANWELL, who had been long abſent from his native country, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a conſiderable employment that he held in the Eaſt-Indies, was at length returned to his family, in order to enjoy, in their peaceful ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, the ample fruits of his labors. He had but one ſon, about fourteen years of age, in whom his fondeſt hopes were centered. It was in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſecure to this ſon the advantages of a
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:045437_0176_102029124FF44250"/>
ſplendid fortune, that he had devoted his life to buſineſs of the moſt laborious nature, far from his country and his friends. His views, in this reſpect, had been gratified beyond the extent of his wiſhes. He returned, loaded with wealth; but, alas! he very ſoon perceived how much better the time which he had ſpent in acquiring it, would have been employed, in perſonal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſon's improvement, and how much more likely ſuch an attention would have been, to enſure him happineſs, than all his riches.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Meanwell, who was as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>k in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as in conſtitution, had put young Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per under the care of a family-tutor, who, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keep his employment, had only ſtudied to gratify the child's whims, and impoſe on the blind fondneſs of a mother, who idolized her ſon. Intoxicated with the flattery of all about him, Jaſper had inſenſibly grown hardened in all the ill-habits that he had been ſuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from his infancy. His tutor, whoſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though tolerably profound, ſcarce equalled his meanneſs, frequently gave him to underſtand, that with the treaſures which he was one day to poſſeſs, he had no occaſion to impair his health by a cloſe application to ſtudy; and that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, by the care which ſhe had taken of him, had too favorably diſtinguiſhed him from the reſt of mankind, to ſubject him to the ſame labours. Theſe perfidious inſinuations accorded ſo well with the natural weakneſs and preſumption of his pupil, that they effected the complete corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his heart and his underſtanding; Jaſper was therefore become a confirmed liar, ſlothful,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:045437_0177_1020291544F03C88"/>
inſenſible to the affections of his fellow-creatures, and ſo diſguſtingly conceited, as to look down upon all who were his inferiors in fortune, as if they were no, better than beaſts of the field. Of all the ſtories with which the tutor amuſed his idleneſs, he liſtened only to thoſe that afforded examples of pride and effrontery. Inſtances of courage, greatneſs of ſoul, and humanity, made no impreſſion upon him; nor were his eyes ever moiſtened with thoſe delicious tears which the recital of a virtuous action draws from the eyes of thoſe who poſſeſs true generoſity.</p>
                  <p>This odious character was not long concealed from Mr. Meanwell's obſervation. What a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſcovery for an affectionate father, who, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the fartheſt parts of the earth, with the hopes of one day finding, in his ſon, the comfort and glory of his old age, ſaw him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſſed of every quality that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing and diſgraceful. His firſt care was, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the contemptible perſon, who had been made his inſtructor. Notwithſtanding the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infirmities which already began to attack him, he reſolved to take upon himſelf alone, the charge of remedying the faulty education of his ſon. He imagined, however, that he ſhould ſucceed better in this undertaking, if he placed near him a child of a good diſpoſition, and nearly his own age, whoſe behaviour might inſpire him with a noble emulation. The choice of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he thought, ſhould not be left to chance. For ſeveral weeks he ſought ineffectually for ſuch an one, but happening one day to be riding in the country, and earneſtly meditating upon his
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:045437_0178_10202918311EBCD0"/>
project, he perceived, at the entrance of a village, a number of young boys at play: one of them was poſſeſſed of ſo happy a phyſiognomy, that, at the firſt fight, Mr. Meanwell was captivated with him. He approached him, aſked him a few queſtions, in a mild tone of voice, and received anſwers ſo replete with candor and ſimplicity, that they effectually confirmed in his mind the good opinion which the youth's countenance had excited. He learned from him, that he was the eldeſt of ſix children, that his father was the apothecary of the village, and barely able to maintain him and the reſt of his family in the moſt limited mediocrity. Theſe particulars hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given Mr. Meanwell ſome hopes, he begged the boy, whoſe name was Emilius, to conduct him to his father. He found him to be a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, and one whoſe abilities, in a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>here, might have procured him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſtimation. But, moderate in his deſires, he preferred the tranquility of a retired country life, to the noiſy buſtle of the capital, and contented himſelf with the happineſs of doing good to his poor neighbours, and of fulfilling the duty of a parent, to his numerous children. His wife, who was ſtill young, had adopted his views, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeemed to divide, with happineſs, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his family. Mr. Meanwell, after having, for ſome time, diſcourſed with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their children, in order the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the principles which they had followed in their education, ſoon perceived them to be ſuch as correſponded with his own ideas. In the fullneſs of his joy, he took the apothecary by the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:045437_0179_1020291B299CB9A8"/>
hand, and imparted to him the deſign that he had in view, with reſpect to his ſon, aſſuring him, that he would bring him up as his own, and that from that day forward he would take upon him the care of his fortune. The well-known integrity of Mr. Meanwell, and the reputation of his wealth and intereſt, would have induced pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who were leſs affectionate, or more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to accept his offers, without heſitation: but the parents of Emilius found a difficulty in parting with a ſon, who formed their principal happineſs; and the boy himſelf was no leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the propoſal, than they were. However, the more objections they raiſed to the ſcheme, the more Mr. Meanwell, actuated by freſh ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of eſteem, adhered to it. In ſhort, he redoubled his ſolicitations ſo powerfully, that he, at length, ſhook their reſolution. The frequent opportunities which would offer of ſeeing their ſon, and the hope that his advancement might, one day, contribute to that of his brothers and ſiſters, induced them, at length, to yield their conſent; and Mr. Meanwell took his leave, filled with the moſt perfect and heartfelt ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Three days were demanded by the parents of Emilius, to prepare him for appearing in town; at the end of that time, Mr. Meanwell appeared at their door. I will not attempt to deſcribe to you the grief occaſioned by the departure of a child, ſo dearly loved by his family. Emilius, who had had the courage to reſtrain his tears in the preſence of his mother, for fear of increaſing her ſorrow, was no ſooner ſeated in the carriage, than he let fall a flood of tears. Mr. Meanwell
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:045437_0180_1020291F8244F690"/>
did not ſeek, at firſt, to interrupt them, otherwiſe than by ſilent careſſes; but when the firſt guſh of ſorrow was over, he took Emilius by the hand, and, kiſſing him, My boy, ſaid he, be not afflicted; you ſee in me a ſecond father, who will cheriſh you with as much affection as the parent whom nature has given you. Be honeſt, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and diligent, and nothing ſhall ever be wanting to your happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Emilius was ſomething eaſed by theſe marks of tenderneſs and affection. Then you ſhall be my other father, ſaid he, preſſing Mr. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's hand between his, and I will make myſelf worthy of your friendſhip and regard.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Meanwell introduced Emilius into his houſe, upon the footing of a ſon, and ordered all his ſervants to treat him with the ſame reſpect; and his mild and ſenſible manner, ſoon gained him the affection of all that approached him. Jaſper was the only perſon of the family, who could not behold him, without an emotion of envy. He ſoon perceived that the preſence of this rival laid him under the neceſſity of altering his behaviour, and of becoming more diligent in his ſtudies. Not being able to find in his heart any juſt foundation for hating Emilius, he thought that he might at leaſt reaſonably deſpiſe him, as the ſoon of a poor country apothecary. Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, his father's diſpleaſure, he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to keep theſe thoughts to himſelf, and therefore diſguiſed them under the maſk of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Emilius, who could not ſuſpect in others a falſhood to which his own heart was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, grew tenderly attached to him; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:045437_0181_102029214901D110"/>
to aſſiſt him in all his exertions, and to facilitate the labours of his ſtudy; at the ſame time, he put up with his pride and capriciouſneſs, as one uſually winks at the defects of a beloved friend.</p>
                  <p>He had already been accuſtomed, under the immediate direction of his father, to exert his powers of apprehenſion, ſo that he met with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in the courſe of his ſtudy, that was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of damping his ardour. Endowed with a lively penetration, and a powerful memory, and, eſpecially, animated with the deſire of meriting the applauſe and encouragement of Mr. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, he made ſo rapid a progreſs, that his maſters could ſcarcely believe it poſſible. He improved himſelf no leſs ſucceſsfully in the exerciſes of the body; thus his manners became graceful, at the ſame time that his underſtanding was enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his heart expanded with ſentiments of honor and generoſity. Mr. Meanwell beheld him every day, with renewed affection; and even ſtrangers were ſeldom twice in his company, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling a ſecret prepoſſeſſion in his favour. Polite, without affectation, attentive, without ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, chearful, without thoughtleſsneſs, he enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, by his preſence, the joy and happineſs of the whole family. In the midſt of theſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering circumſtances, Emilius, far from ſuffering the illuſions of vanity to ſteal upon him, became only the more modeſt. Although he could not be inſenſible to his own ſuperiority over Jaſper, he would have been contented to call it in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtill better pleaſed to have hid it from the obſervation of others, for fear of mortifying
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:045437_0182_102029259E866078"/>
his friend. He was the firſt to defend him, or to make him appear to advantage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Ah! ſaid he to himſelf, if my friend had not been ſo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to me, and ſo powerfully aſſiſted me in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laudable acquirement, 'ſpite of the affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cares of my father, I ſhould ſtill be far from knowing even what little I know. Other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in my ſituation, would, perhaps, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited better from the opportunities indulged me by Providence. Jaſper himſelf would, perhaps, have ſurpaſſed me, had he been in my ſituation, and I in his. He can do without learning, better than I can; the abſolute neceſſity of acquiring it, has done every thing for me.</p>
                  <p>Eight years paſſed on thus, during which, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius made himſelf maſter of every accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is conferred by the moſt liberal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Time and place would fail me, were I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to particularize to you the various mental acquirements with which he had ſtored his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. As to Jaſper, it would be a ſtill longer taſk, to enumerate all thoſe which he had not. His natural ſelf-ſufficiency had perſuaded him, that with a few terms of ſcience, which was all that remained to him from his ſtudies, he was a match for ſome of the ableſt maſters. His diſpoſition, in the mean time, was, at bottom, very little altered; the fear of his father had, indeed, a little reſtrained his vicious impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but, in return, it had beſtowed on him hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, as a convenient maſk to conceal them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Meanwell, whoſe penetrating eye obſerved them, even through this veil, would have fallen a victim to the chagrin which he felt on this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying

diſcovery, if the good behaviour of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius had not afforded him a pleaſing conſolation. Nevertheleſs, when Jaſper had reached his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year, the apprehenſions that he formed to himſelf of his ſon's future impropriety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, overbalanced every other conſideration. While his heart was torn with theſe cruel reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was ſeized with a violent diſorder, which carried him off in a few days, in ſpite of the affectionate cares and ardent wiſhes that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius teſtified for his recovery, even to the fatal moment which ſeparated them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Jaſper, freed as he now was from the curb which formerly reſtrained his paſſions, had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid the laſt offices to his father, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew forth his natural diſpoſition. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the memory of an excellent father, in the perſon whom he had adopted as a ſecond ſon, and forgetting the obligations that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bore to the ſame youth, he furiouſly ſhut his doors upon him, and flew down to his paternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eat in the country, there to make himſelf amends for his former conſtraint, by indulging a life of ſavage tumult and unbridled licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>How different were the emotions which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the heart of Emilius, who was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the mediocrity of his father's houſe! he grieved, indeed, but not on account of his change of condition. Mr. Meanwell had made him a handſome proviſion for life; but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt gave him very little concern; it was the loſs of his generous benefactor that he felt moſt ſenſibly: the recent loſs of that friend who had taken care of his youth, whom he was accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:045437_0184_1020292A1CE95630"/>
to look upon as a father, and in whom he had found all the affections of one. The ſorrow oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by this loſs, brought on a ſickneſs, which had nearly ſent him after the friend whom he mourned. In the moſt violent fits of his deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, he pronounced only the name of Mr. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. He even called his father by this name, whenever he ſat by his bed, as the diſorder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all knowledge of his relations. They were long apprehenſive for his life: in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he owed his recovery to the vows and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable cares of a family, who all ſeemed only to exiſt in him.</p>
                  <p>After devoting a few months to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his friends enjoyed in ſeeing his health re-eſtabliſhed, and in admiring his virtues and accompliſhments, Emilius returned to the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, intending to enter upon one of the learned profeſſions, and, in the mean time, reſuming his ſtudies with more eagerneſs and advantage than ever. He had gained the friendſhip and eſteem of many perſons of quality, during his reſidence at the houſe of Mr. Meanwell, who now united all their intereſt to procure him an advantageous eſtabliſhment. The duke of—, having juſt finiſhed his ſtudies, was about to make the tour of Europe, and Emilius was recommended to his family, as a proper perſon to accompany him. Though he appeared very young, for ſuch an office, he, nevertheleſs, impreſſed them ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, with reſpect to his character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that he was judged to be as truſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent a governor as they could ſend with the young nobleman. In the courſe of this tour, he
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:045437_0185_1020292EAC383C78"/>
found numberleſs opportunities of enlarging and applying the knowledge that he had acquired from ſtudy. His ſprightly wit and engaging manners, made him a favorite at every court which his pupil viſited. There were even ſome foreign princes, who diſtinguiſhed him in a very flattering manner, and wiſhed to attach him to their ſervice; but his engagements to the young duke's family, made him decline every offer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſplendid. He was not long, without receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reward of his fidelity. He had ſcarce conducted his pupil home to his native country, when a nobleman of the ſame family, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ambaſſador to one of the foreign courts, choſe him for his ſecretary. During a long ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ambaſſador, Emilius managed the principal buſineſs of the embaſſy, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with ſo much ability, that, upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's recommendation, he was entruſted with a very delicate negociation, in which he had the honor, as well as ſatisfaction, of rendering his country a ſervice of the moſt important nature.</p>
                  <p>Jaſper, in the mean time, had met with very different fortune: we left him in the country, upon his eſtate, haraſſing his game and his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. This way of life gave the finiſhing ſtroke to his manners; that is to ſay, it rendered them thoſe of a brute, and his underſtanding ſeemed degraded to the groſſeſt degree of ruſticity. A quarrel with a neighboring country gentleman, in which his paltry behaviour covered him with ſhame and mortification, forced him to quit his country reſidence, and to come up again to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: but even thither his infamy purſued him;
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:045437_0186_1020293034A399E8"/>
and being aggravated with the additional im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of fraud, became a ſubject of the moſt public notoriety.</p>
                  <p>Jaſper now found himſelf excluded from all genteel company, where his father's name had formerly procured him a welcome. Unable to find a reſource, either in ſtudy or reflection, he ſuffered himſelf to be carried away by the torrent of vicious example; and gaming ſoon ſuggeſted to him the deſign of ſelling his eſtate, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards furniſhed him with opportunities of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating his money, while intemperance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, at the ſame time, made rapid havock with his conſtitution. In order to elude his creditors, whoſe importunities now became preſſing, he determined to tranſport himſelf to the continent, and, by a ſingular accident, arrived in the very ſame town where Emilius reſided, and where, for his many amiable and reſpectable qualities, he enjoyed the univerſal eſteem of all parties.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy Jaſper carried with him ſtill his extravagant paſſion for play: fortune ſeemed at firſt to favour him in this new ſcene; and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive manner of living procured him credit. But it was not long, before his affairs fell into confuſion; and his creditors, finding that he had treated them with the groſſeſt impoſitions, ſent him to priſon, upon his not being able to ſatisfy their demands. The rumour of ſuch a diſgrace happening to one of his countrymen, ſoon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned Emilius to come to the knowledge of his name. "Heavens!" cried he, "is the ſon of my deareſt benefactor in a priſon?" for he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately forgot Jaſper's ungenerous behaviour
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:045437_0187_1020293323E5AE98"/>
toward him. He flew, therefore, to the dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where he was confined. But, alas! in what a dreadful condition did he find him! Pale, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, pining in diſtreſs, waſted by pain, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed by remorſe, and a prey to all the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of rage and deſpair. He ſtrikes off his chains, ſnatches him from this manſion of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, carries him to his own houſe, and there treats him with the moſt affectionate care and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He would have ſacrificed all his fortune to reſtore him to life, and to be the author of his happineſs. But heaven had already dealt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging blow. Jaſper ſurvived this event but a few days. Emilius was grieved at his death, as much as if he had loſt the moſt affectionate friend. He was inconſolable, that fate had put it out of his power to render to the ſon of his benefactor the kindneſſes which he had received from the father. This reflection depreſſed his ſpirits a conſiderable time. Images of gloomy ſadneſs were ever before his eyes, and haunted him, even in his moſt collected hours of buſineſs; but the alacrity with which he attended to his duty, and the command which he was accuſtomed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe over himſelf, reſtored him at length to his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſerenity of mind; and he continued to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the offices of his employ, with a zeal and integrity, that ſoon advanced him to the exalted ſtation in which we ſee him at this day.</p>

                  <head>THE PUNISHMENT OF PRIDE.</head>
                  <p>RUPERT, the ſon of an honeſt laborer, had early teſtified a ſtrong inclination for the profeſſion of arms. He was continually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his ſpade, and had ſcraped acquaintance with every game-keeper in the neighborhood, in order that he might have an opportunity of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their fowling-pieces. At the age of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, he enliſted as a ſoldier; and being (through the good care which his father had taken of his education) a tolerable proficient in writing and figures, he was very ſoon made corporal, and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, ſerjeant.</p>
                  <p>At the commencement of the war, his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going abroad, he behaved himſelf ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably well, the firſt ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>paign, as to obtain a pair of colours. He had been ſent upon ſeveral hazardous expeditions, in which he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be equally intelligent and brave; and it was remarked, to his praiſe, that a ſoldier had never turned his back, while under his command.</p>
                  <p>The general, who had been a witneſs to his bravery, in many engagements, now promoted him to the command of a company, in order to raiſe the emulation of his troops, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rupert's good fortune. And, ſome cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns after, a very ſplendid action, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a battle in which moſt of the elder cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:045437_0189_1020293913AEDD38"/>
were killed, was the occaſion of his being elevated to the poſt of major.</p>
                  <p>Honorable mention had frequently been made of his name in the public papers; and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were often gratified by their neighbors, with the recital of actions conſiderably to his praiſe. It may eaſily be imagined how proud they were of being ſo nearly related to him. Whenever they ſpoke of him, they ſhed tears of joy. Their affection to him ſeemed to entitle them to a ſhare in his reputation; and they wiſhed for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py moment of his ſafe return, that they might embrace a brother who did ſo much honor to his kindred.</p>
                  <p>With all theſe good qualities, however, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert poſſeſſed one which was very odious; his words and actions were marked with the moſt inſupportable arrogance. There was no man in the world (to take his word for it) ſo ſenſible, or ſo intrepid as himſelf. He ſpoke of his own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant deeds, as a flattering courtier would of thoſe of a ſovereign prince, before his face. He arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to himſelf more glory from them, than was juſtly due to him; and ſeemed inſenſible to the merit of the other officers, whenever they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves with as much gallantry as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>At the concluſion of the war, his regiment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, was ſent into country quarters, and (as it happened) by a route that led very near his own native village. As ſoon as ever his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were apprized of this circumſtance, they went off to meet him on the road, accompanied by a few friends, and arrived in a neighboring
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:045437_0190_1020293D6CF56640"/>
town, juſt as the diviſion which he commanded of the regiment had entered, and was forming in the market-place.</p>
                  <p>My dear Rupert, ſaid the elder brother, how happy I am to ſee thee, and how happy would our aged father be, were he alive this day! Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be praiſed that we behold you ſafe returned from the dangers of war. For my part, I never felt myſelf ſo happy in my life as at this moment. Saying theſe words, he held out his hand, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rupert to a ſimilar demonſtration of frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal amity. But the major, ſwelling with ſhame and indignation, to ſee a man, in a frize coat, call him brother, rejected his proffered ſalutation. You had better go home, ſaid he, my friend. I have not time to talk to you at preſent. How! cried the younger brother, do not you know me neither? Look well at me: I am your brother George. You uſed to be very fond of me. It was from you that I learned to plow, when I was a boy.</p>
                  <p>The major now foamed with rage and deſpite, and having no other means to be rid of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome relations, he cauſed his ſoldiers to make a ſudden movement or evolution, which obliged the ſurrounding populace, and, among the reſt, his brothers, to fall back, and retire from the ſpot of ground where he ſtood.</p>
                  <p>The two peaſants, who had promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much joy and happineſs in meeting with a brother that had been abſent from them ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, returned home, full of grief and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were ſcarce able to credit their ſenſes, that ſuch had been their indifferent recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:045437_0191_1020293EF654E3C8"/>
with one whom, notwithſtanding his unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural pride, they found themſelves ready ſtill to love as a brother.</p>
                  <p>The ſoldiers who were preſent at this diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene, did not, it is true, expreſs their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it aloud, but they ſaid to each other, in whiſpers, A man muſt have a very bad heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to be aſhamed of his relations. Does our major think it a diſgrace to be the ſame as we are? He ought, much rather, to be proud of having made his way, in the army, by merit, than to put on the airs of a man of family.</p>
                  <p>Rupert had not a ſoul formed for thinking ſo nobly: inſtead of remembering that he had once been a private ſoldier, he thought, by his aſſumed loftineſs, to make his former comrades forget it. He treated them, therefore, with the laſt degree of contempt; but he appeared, in their eyes, much more worthy of this paſſion. His prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which before had given them ſo much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, now only ſerved to mortify them. They obeyed his orders, but with reluctance; and every ſoldier in the regiment, wiſhed him fairly out of it.</p>
                  <p>One day, when the corps to which he belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was paſſing in review before a general, this officer made ſome remarks on the manoeuvres performed by the major, with his diviſion, to which the latter replied in terms of the moſt pointed diſreſpect. His ſupercilious deportment had, already, more than once, offended his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. This freſh breach of military ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, underwent the ſevereſt animadverſion; for, as it was too public and groſs to be paſſed over in
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:045437_0192_101FFAC6DBA25F10"/>
ſilence, it became the ſubject of a general-court-martial, the deciſion of which compleated his ruin; for, even here, he expreſſed himſelf in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſo unguardedly perſonal againſt his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, and perſiſted, with ſuch inflexible haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in refuſing to make a ſubmiſſion, that he was ſentenced to be caſhiered, to the univerſal joy of his regiment.</p>
                  <p>Reduced, by this ſtroke, to his original pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was obliged to embrace the alternative, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſtruggling with indigence and neceſſity, or of employing means for his ſubſiſtence, which, before, he would have ſpurned, as unworthy of his rank and conſequence. He had a ſmall farm (if a piece of ground might be ſo called, that was ſcarcely large enough for a cabbage-garden) ſituated cloſe by his native village. As (by his father's will) he had not the power of ſelling it, in the life time of his brothers, he had let it to one of them upon his entering the army, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought the rent of it, though accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an object of ſo ſmall importance, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he was made an officer, that he had, ſince that time, in his own mind, almoſt wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the property of it, as he had the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his origin, and the relationſhip of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was his tenant. He now found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however, under the neceſſity of deriving, from this patch of ground, the means of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubſiſtence, by making application to his brother for the rent ariſing from it. For this purpoſe, a journey to the place of his nativity was, if not indiſpenſable, at leaſt highly expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and then it was when the peaſants and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:045437_0193_10202944D4EAA510"/>
his former acquaintances, ſaw him come down among them, ſtripped of his plumes, and reduced to the ſame ſtate of harmleſs obſcurity with themſelves, that they repaid him his former inſolence, with uſury. However, as he courted the friendſhip of none, in return none offered him their ſociety. Thus he ſaw himſelf depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of one of the greateſt bleſſings that human life can afford, particularly to thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſſure of adverſity.</p>
                  <p>If the other inhabitants of the village were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at Rupert's unnatural pride, his brothers had, certainly, the firſt cauſe to reſent it, having been the more immediate objects of his inſult. Perhaps, therefore, you fear, leſt they ſhould, in their turn, have ſlighted him. "We know you not," would have been a juſt anſwer to all his applications and advances toward reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but, fortunately for him, the brothers poſſeſſed that real greatneſs of ſpirit which he wanted. They ſought no other ſatisfaction, than that of conferring kindneſſes on him. For this purpoſe, the renter of his little farm, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it to him in good condition, together with the revenues thence accruing, but concerted with the other brother, the means of ſettling him comfortably, on a moderate farm, if he choſe to embrace that way of life. This, as they were thriving, reſponſible perſons, they found no great difficulty to effect; and Rupert returned once more to the happy occupation, from which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and chimerical dreams of glory, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſeduced him. But he was, by no means, happy in his condition. Every day, as he went
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:045437_0194_102029493044B850"/>
about thoſe labours, which he had ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, the thoughts of his former elevated hopes and expectations, continually haunted him. How did he ſuffer, under the mortifying thought, that he owed almoſt his preſent exiſtence, to thoſe, whom he, on the contrary, might, comparatively ſpeaking, have made rich men. Accurſed pride! he would ſay, to what a pitiable degree haſt thou humbled me!</p>
                  <p>This cutting reflection filled his hours with bitterneſs; and he died, in a ſhort time, devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with chagrin, leaving a melancholy example to thoſe whom the ſame intoxicating paſſion might tempt to deſpiſe the ſound admonitions of reaſon and modeſty.</p>

One evening, a little before ſupper, as he ſat with her and her huſband beſide their cottage door, and diſcourſed with them concerning family affairs, there paſſed by a little girl about five years of age, and totally in rags. Townſend remarked the miſerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of her whole perſon, and ſaid to his ſiſter, "There is a poor little girl, very much to
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:045437_0195_1020294AB9C12FD0"/>
be pitied. Not one rag about her ſeems to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her a covering. It is a diſgrace to your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Her father muſt have very little induſtry, and her mother very little feeling."</p>
                  <p>Alas! anſwered his ſiſter, ſhe has no father nor mother, and there are two other children, beſide her, of the ſame family, who are equally wretched. Through ſome diſpute between two different pariſhes, (each aſſerting this deſtitute family to belong to the other) the poor children wander up and down the country, without houſe or home. They lie, at night, in barns, or under hedges. When hunger becomes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, they go and ſit down before the doors of cottages. If any body gives them a morſel of bread, they receive it with joy; but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſk any thing. Their father, who was a man of ſpirit, though reduced by ſickneſs, to the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt deplorable ſtate of poverty, forbad them, with his dying lips, to beg.</p>
                  <p>This recital affected the honeſt farmer very much. It is ſhocking, ſaid he, that any poor creatures ſhould be ſo neglected by the reſt of their ſpecies: I will take them, added he, under my care, ſince nobody here wiſhes to be charged with them. His ſiſter, and her huſband, thought it their duty to diſſuade him, as ſtrongly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from this undertaking. They told him, that he had children of his own, that he knew nothing about theſe, that they were, for three months paſt, accuſtomed to a lazy vagabond life, and that it was a matter of doubt, whether they would ever turn to good. Then, brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, added they, what an addition of trouble
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:045437_0196_1020294DE05EE938"/>
they will cauſe to your wife, and what a burden they will be in your family.</p>
                  <p>Townſend was not one of thoſe weak men, who ſuffer themſelves to be diverted from the performance of a laudable deſign, by a few diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties accompanying it. He was not very ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to hear all their objections, and ſtill leſs to anſwer them.</p>
                  <p>He roſe, therefore, from his ſeat, in order to retire to reſt: but his ſcheme of benevolence, in favour of the orphans, kept him long awake, by exciting, in his mind, reflections of a tenderer caſt than uſual; and the moiſture of generous compaſſion was ſtill upon his eyelids, when they cloſed in ſleep for the night.</p>
                  <p>The next morning early, he ſent for the eldeſt girl, who was about twelve years of age. I was given, ſaid he, to underſtand, yeſterday, that your father and mother are dead, and I ſee, by your dreſs, that they have not left you any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fortune.</p>

                     <p>Come, then, that is ſettled: but I am going home on horſeback, and could not take you all three together. It was the youngeſt ſiſter that I ſaw firſt: I will begin with her.
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:045437_0197_10202950D346A588"/>
Bring the child to me. Let us be acquainted together.</p>
                     <p>The youngeſt girl ſoon came. She had a countenance ſo mild, and gained ſo much upon the farmer, by her little fond careſſes, that he looked upon himſelf already as her father. He took her up, therefore, before him, on his horſe; and when they arrived at the farm-houſe, his wife aſked him whoſe child that was. It is your's, Maria, anſwered he, and began withal to relate to her, how, the day before, he had ſeen the little child, and been informed of her wretched and friendleſs ſituation; how he had compaſſion on her, and took her home with him, in order to ſupport her as one of his own children.</p>
                     <p>During all this relation, the little girl crept cloſe to the farmer's ſkirt, and ſhed tears without ceaſing. Maria, who was as compaſſionate as her huſband, ſympathized with the little orphan; ſhe took her up in her lap, and endeavoured to ſoothe her with theſe words: "Since my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band has promiſed to be your father, I will be your mother too. Come then, my dear child, do not cry any more."</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Townſend.</speaker>
                     <p>But, wife, there are two others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who are equally worthy of our compaſſion, the brother and ſiſter of this little one.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>Ah! my dear, I ſee what you mean. Well, we muſt ſend for them.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the farmer put the horſe to his chaiſe-cart, and went for the other two orphans.</p>
                     <p>Go, ſaid his wife, embracing him at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, go, my dear; and that Being, who ſends
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:045437_0198_102000BF9F8EB858"/>
us theſe children, will not fail to ſend us, alſo, bread for their nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Juſtice Garboil, however, thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. He had been landlord to the father of theſe unfortunate little ones, and was well appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed of their diſtreſs. Hearing the farmer had taken them home to his houſe, he diſpatched his clerk to him, with a peremptory injunction to ſend the children to their own ſettlement, (which, it has been obſerved before, was in litigation) or, in failure thereof, to give ſecurity to his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that they ſhould never become chargeable to it.</p>
                     <p>Farmer Townſend was filled with indignation on receiving ſuch a meſſage. If this, cried he, be his worſhip's humanity, I would rather be the child of miſery, for an age, than accept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that overſwoln baſhaw, during his moſt ſelf-complacent hour. Let me know, however, what bail is required; I am ready. Poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents! the more I ſee oppreſſion endeavour to tread you down, the dearer you become to me, and the more I feel myſelf intereſted to protect you.</p>
                     <p>After the farmer had ſatisfied every demand of Juſtice Garboil, he returned to his houſe, and now, ſaid he, ſurely theſe children are mine. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body will queſtion my being a father to them, by one title or other.</p>
                     <p>You are anxious, no doubt, my young friends, to know what became of theſe children, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel. Luckily, I can inform you, by relating to you a converſation between Farmer Townſend
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:045437_0199_101FFC6B45D3C688"/>
and a perſon who happened to be travelling in that part of the country, ſome years afterwards.</p>
                     <p>All the little family were at play together, one evening, before the farmer's door, while Maria was getting their ſupper ready. He himſelf was in the midſt of them, partaking of their ſport and feſtivity. The traveller happened to paſs by, juſt at the time, and ſtopped to gaze on this ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of rural happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Are all theſe children your's, neighbour? ſaid he to the farmer.</p>
                     <p>Yes, Sir, anſwered Townſend: I have ten of them alive; ſeven that Providence beſtowed on me, and three that I have purchaſed.</p>
                     <p>Purchaſed? ſaid the traveller, much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                     <p>Why, Sir, it was, in ſome ſenſe, a purchaſe, replied the farmer, and, upon this, told him the whole ſtory, adding, as he concluded it, thank heaven, neither my wife nor I have, at any time, repented of the action. It was the beſt bargain that ever I made in my life.</p>

                     <speaker>The traveller.</speaker>
                     <p>There muſt be no ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe in the maintenance of ſuch a family.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Townſend.</speaker>
                     <p>It ſeems, at firſt view, a difficult matter to find bread for them all, without an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; for any one can eaſily ſpend the fruits of his own labour: and, unleſs you were to make a trial, you would ſcarcely think it poſſible to be done. I owe, perhaps, to this difficulty, the good management which has ever kept me above want; but when a man is ſober, laborious and circumſpect, he will always have a trifling ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity for the unfortunate.</p>

                     <speaker>The traveller.</speaker>
                     <p>Still you have no occaſion to have done that. She was nothing to you.</p>

                     <speaker>Townſend.</speaker>

                     <p>Farmer Townſend then entertained the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller with the happineſs and ſatisfaction that he

                     <p>His heart was ſoftened at this recital of his own, and a tear of benevolence moiſtened his eye. He wiped it away, however, immediately, and ſaid, with an ironical ſmile, Ah! Juſtice Garboil, Juſtice Garboil, you might have had all this happineſs, if your heart could have known a duty beyond the letter of the law. You forced me to give bail; but you little thought it was to enſure to me, for life, a happineſs to which you have ever been a ſtranger.</p>

                  <p>TOMMY Merton, the ſon of a gentleman of fortune, and Harry Sandford, the ſon of an honeſt farmer, were both under the care and inſtruction of Mr. Barlow, a country clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Harry, in one of his walks with Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, had ſaved a young chicken from the claws

of a kite. He had taken the greateſt care poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of its little wounds, and fed it every day with his own hands. The little animal was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered of the hurt it had received, and ſhewed ſo great a degree of affection to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, that it would run after him like a dog, hop upon his ſhoulder, neſtle in his boſom, and eat crumbs out of his hand. Tommy was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſurprized and pleaſed, to remark its tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and docility, and aſked by what means it had been made ſo gentle. Harry told him he had taken no particular pains about it, but that, as the poor little creature had been ſadly hurt, he had fed it every day till it was well, and that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that kindneſs, it had conceived a great degree of affection toward him. Indeed, ſaid Tommy, that is very ſurprizing, for I thought all birds had flown away, whenever a man came near them, and that even the fowls which are kept at home would never let you touch them.</p>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tommy.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Barlow.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, then, it is probable that animals are only wild, becauſe they are afraid of being hurt, and that they only run away, from the fear of danger. I believe you would do the ſame from a lion or a tyger.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tommy.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed I would, Sir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Barlow.</speaker>
                     <p>And yet you do not call your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a wild animal.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Tommy laughed heartily at this, and ſaid, no. Therefore, ſaid Mr. Barlow, if you want to tame animals, you muſt be good to them, and treat them kindly, and then they will no longer fear you, but come to you, and love you. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaid Harry, that is very true: for I knew a little boy that took a great fancy to a ſnake that lived in his father's garden, and when he had his milk for breakfaſt, he uſed to ſit under a nut-tree and whiſtle, and the ſnake would come to him, and eat out of his bowl.</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tommy.</speaker>
                     <p>And did it not bite him?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="206" facs="unknown:045437_0204_101FFC78CB173FA8"/>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>No; he ſometimes uſed to give it a pat with his ſpoon, if it ate too faſt; but it never hurt him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Tommy was much pleaſed with this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and being both good natured, and deſirous of making experiments, he determined to try his ſkill in taming animals. Accordingly he took a large ſlice of bread in his hand, and went out to ſeek ſome animal, that he might give it to. The firſt thing that he happened to meet, was a ſucking pig that had rambled from its mother, and was baſking in the ſun: Tommy would not neglect the opportunity of ſhewing his talents; he therefore called Pig, pig, pig, come hither little pig! But the pig, who did not exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his intentions, only grunted, and ran away. You little ungrateful thing, ſaid Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, do you treat me in this manner, when I want to feed you? If you do not know your friends, I muſt teach you. Saying this, he ſprung at the pig, and caught him by the hind leg, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to have given him the bread which he had in his hand; but the pig, who was not uſed to be treated in that manner, began ſtruggling and ſqueaking to that degree, that the ſow, who was within hearing, came running to the place, with all the reſt of the litter, at her heels. As Tommy did not know whether ſhe would be pleaſed with his civilities to her young one, or not, he thought it moſt prudent to let it go; and the pig, endeavouring to eſcape as ſpeedily as poſſible, unfortunately ran between his legs, and threw him down. The place where the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happened was extremely wet; therefore
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:045437_0205_101FFC9D740F2218"/>
Tommy, in falling, dirtied himſelf from head to foot, and the ſow, who came up at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, paſſed over him, as he attempted to riſe, and rolled him back again into the mire. Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who was not the cooleſt in his temper, was extremely provoked at this ungrateful return for his intended kindneſs; and loſing all patience, he ſeized the ſow by the hind leg, and began pummelling her with all his might, as ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eſcape. The ſow, as may be imagined, did not reliſh ſuch treatment, but endeavoured with all her force to eſcape; but Tommy keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hold, and continuing his diſcipline, ſhe ſtruggled with ſuch violence, as to drag him ſeveral yards, ſqueaking in the moſt lamentable manner, in which ſhe was joined by the whole litter of pigs. During the heat of the conteſt, a large flock of geeſe happened to be croſſing the road, into the midſt of which the affrighted ſow ran headlong, dragging the enraged Tommy at her heels. The goſlings retreated with the greateſt precipitation, joining their mournful cackling to the general noiſe; but a gander, of more than common ſize and courage, reſenting the unprovoked attack which had been made upon his family, flew at Tommy's hinder parts, and gave him ſeveral ſevere ſtrokes with his bill. Tommy, whoſe courage had hitherto been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable, being thus unexpectedly attacked by a new enemy, was obliged to yield to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and not knowing the preciſe extent of his danger, he not only ſuffered the ſow to eſcape, but joined his vociferations to the general ſcream. This alarmed Mr. Barlow, who, coming up to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:045437_0206_101FFCA1E13772D0"/>
the place, found his pupil in the moſt woful plight, daubed from head to foot, with his face and hands as black as thoſe of any chimney-ſweeper. He enquired what was the matter, and Tommy, as ſoon he had recovered breath enough to ſpeak, anſwered in this manner; Sir, this is all owing to what you told me about taming ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. I wanted to make them tame and gentle and to love me, and you ſee the conſequences. Indeed, ſaid Mr. Barlow, I ſee you have been very ill-treated, but I hope you are not hurt; and if it is owing to any thing I have ſaid, I ſhall feel the more concern. No, ſaid Tommy, I cannot ſay that I am much hurt. Why then, ſaid Mr. Barlow, you had better go and waſh yourſelf; and when you are clean, we will talk over the affair. When Tommy had returned, Mr. Barlow aſked him how the accident had happened, and when he had heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tommy.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir; but you told me that feeding animals was the way to make them love me, and ſo I wanted to feed the pig.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Barlow.</speaker>
                     <p>But it was not my fault that you attempted it in a wrong manner. The ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal did not know your intentions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you ſeized him in ſo violent a manner, he naturally attempted to eſcape, and his mother hearing his cries, very naturally came to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. All that happened, was owing to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

you ſhould make yourſelf perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its nature and diſpoſition. Had you obſerved this rule, you would never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to catch the pig by the hinder leg, in order to tame it; and it is very lucky that you did not make the experiment upon a larger animal.</p>

                     <p>THE part which James I. king of England, took, in the diſpute between the biſhops and the Preſbyterians, had ſo violently enraged the latter, that after his death, they took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſome arbitrary meaſures in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his ſon and ſucceſſor, Charles I. to excite the whole nation to open revolt. The
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:045437_0208_101FFCA60FE13F20"/>
intent of the Preſbyterians was, to annihilate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, and to leſſen the royal prerogative: but the Independents, a new ſect which had ſprung up from the former, aimed at the total abolition of royalty, and the eſtabliſhment of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in its ſtead. Cromwell, who had made both parties equally ſubſervient to his ambitious views, declared, at laſt, in favour of the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. After having filled the parliament and the army with perſons devoted to his fortune, or the dupes of his hypocriſy, he procured a formal ſentence of death to be paſſed againſt his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. The Preſbyterians, though they ſaw themſelves plainly outwitted by his cunning, did not dare to riſe up againſt the power which he had uſurped. Thoſe of Scotland had more courage; they called over the eldeſt ſon of Charles I. from France, whither he had fled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and they received him as their king, though under the moſt ſevere reſtrictions. Cromwell, however, ſoon marched into Scotland, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Hoſtilities, which were ſuſpended during the winter, began afreſh the year following. Charles II. whom the Scots had proclaimed king, was, notwithſtanding, ſo diſguſted at the ſtate of ſubjection and reſtraint to which they would have reduced him, that he took the reſolution of quitting Scotland, whither Cromwell was come to purſue him, and of entering England with an army of fourteen thouſand men, in hopes of ſeeing it augmented by the Engliſh Preſbyterians, and the ſecret friends of the royal

cauſe. But Cromwell did not give him time to receive theſe additions of ſtrength: he followed him by forced marches, overtook him with a ſuperior army, and entirely routed the Scottiſh troops. After having fought bravely to the very laſt, Charles, with difficulty, eſcaped off the field of battle, accompanied by fifty men. The diſtreſſes to which he was reduced after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, obliged him to conceal himſelf under the meaneſt diſguiſes, in order to eſcape from the ſoldiers, whom Cromwell had ſent out, every where, in ſearch of him; the inſtances of fidelity that he received from the Earl of Derby, the companion of his flight, from Colonel Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Drama he is called Lord Wyndham.</note> and his ſervants, who kept him concealed, notwithſtanding the ſevere penalties denounced by the parliament; the fanaticiſm of the parties which then diſtracted England, and the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate of the nation in general; during this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of tumult, preſent a multitude of intereſting ſituations, and inſtructive ſcenes, to which the author has endeavoured to give connexion in the following drama, at the ſame time, that he has ſtudied to preſerve hiſtorical truth in the leading actions of the piece.</p>

                           <p>A right, founded on the good old cauſe: Shall the ungodly have dominion over ſaints? We were ſtrayed from the paths of righteouſneſs, and heaven, in its wrath, ſent us a tyrant, armed with a rod of iron. Now that we are ſanctified, power is given us to break the rod with which we have been ſo long chaſtiſed.</p>

                           <p>The Lord will have no king, but himſelf, to govern his people. No ſight is more pleaſing to him, than that of the army at prayers. That is what has carried the good old cauſe ſo far.</p>

                           <p>Much too far. Had we ſtopped at the aboliſhing of popery and epiſcopacy, it had been well. I took up arms myſelf to attain theſe ends; and with this view alſo we called you to our aſſiſtance; but you have managed ſo as to get the power all into your own hands, and now you exerciſe it according to your errors.

                           <p>If you were only to hear Cromwell, he would teach you what to think on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the overthrow of the royal army, and the taking of the king, he came down here to the country, to mourn in ſilence, for the cruel fate of his maſter.

I would chearfully take you with me, if I were ſure that you were of the right ſide; for, otherwiſe, it would be of no uſe for you to appear before him. You are aſtoniſhed, perhaps, that I dare ſpeak my mind to you with ſo much freedom; but, in ſpite of all the tyranny of the parliament, we are not afraid to give our thoughts vent. It is true, we are too weak to ſtem the torrent of rebellion. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may oblige us to be quiet, but not to betray, or even to diſguiſe our ſentiments.</p>

brave generals, we ſee ignorant tradeſmen fill the firſt poſts of the army. Fanaticiſm, of the moſt abominable nature, reigns in the place of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                           <p>On what foundation can we build a hope? The royal army is diſperſed. If the prince were even living, where would he find forces to retrieve his fortune? His friends, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened by a long ſeries of overthrows, far from daring to reſiſt the torrent of rebellion, are, perhaps, deſtined, by their ruin, to augment the general devaſtation. Our laſt reſource is only the ſwelling of this tyranny to its height. That period approaches; and the people of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, finding themſelves oppreſſed by a heavier yoke than they ever yet experienced, will arm themſelves with all their native reſolution, to ſhake it off. But how many troubles and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will bring about that happy revolution! I ſhall not live long enough to be a witneſs to it:

If you are only come to be ſpies on me, or to ſound my principles, you ſee, I avow them; your commiſſion is fulfilled. If you were to ſtay longer, you would learn no more. However, I give you the protection that you demand, and if you are what you ſay, I give it with pleaſure.</p>

He galloped twenty-ſix miles, without halting; after which, he thought it moſt adviſeable to ſeparate from his eſcort, and, with the Earl of Derby, alone, in his company, he threw himſelf into the adjacent foreſt. Since then, nothing particular has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him.</p>

                           <p>Sire, we inherit theſe principles from our anceſtors. A few days before his death, my father ſent for me, and in a voice, which, even from its weakneſs, was heard the more attentively, he ſpoke to us thus: "My children, England has ſeen, during the laſt three reigns, a ſucceſſion of peaceful and happy years; but I ſee now riſing, on every ſide, clouds that forebode the moſt violent ſtorms. Prepare to encounter them. They will ſhake the whole realm to its centre. But ſtand ye firm, in the midſt of the tempeſt. Continue to love your country; be faithful to your ſovereign, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake the crown, though you ſee it hang on a buſh." Theſe words made ſo powerful an impreſſion upon our minds, that all the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous revolutions, which have ſince taken place in the commonwealth, have not been able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face them.</p>

                           <p>Reſpectable family! what tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs do I experience in the midſt of you!

                           <p>At preſent, my friends, it is time to conſult the ſecurity of the king. Prudence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to prolong our ſtay here. The whole country is full of parliament ſoldiers. I know not whether there be ſo much as a ſingle corner in the three kingdoms, that can afford us a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure retreat, in the preſent general ferment of people's minds. The buſineſs is, therefore, to conſult means for quitting England, by the leaſt dangerous way.</p>

The preſent violent criſis of affairs cannot laſt long. The ſoundeſt part of the nation ſigh for that tranquility which they enjoyed under your father and grandfather. The people, loaded with taxes, impoſed on them for the maintenance of a murderous ſoldiery, will ſoon riſe againſt exactions that become every day more tyrannical. Diſcord is ready to break out between the parliament and the army.

Become the object of general execration, he will endeavour to ſuppreſs it, by violence and terror; but a people ſtill ſhaken from the impulſe of a long and vehement concuſſion, do not ſubmit in ſilence to the yoke. The tyrant's life will be paſſed in continual alarms. Impaired by the exceſſes of his youth, tormented by his crimes, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed by remorſe, he will ſoon finiſh his days, without eſtabliſhing his uſurped power; and for the completion of his views, will leave none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, but two ſons, who muſt ſoon bend under the weight of their adventitious fortune, becauſe not endowed with their father's daring genius. Then it will be that the nobility, free at length to exert their voice, and to ſupport it with their arms, will make the nation acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you as their ſovereign, a ſovereign worthy of ruling them, after having matured his virtues in the ſchool of adverſity.</p>

The choice of true friends is difficult, even in private life. Is it eaſier for a prince to diſtinguiſh wiſe miniſters, in the midſt of ſo many courtiers, who are intereſted to impoſe on him by aſſumed good qualities? The more he loves his people, the leſs can he ſuſpect thoſe who are round him, of being ſtrangers to the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

The misfortune of my father, and which many kings have ſuffered in common with him, was, to have lived long in proſperity. I ſhall have the advantage of him, in the ſalutary experience of misfortune. Perhaps, at no other price, will heaven give me the inſtruction that can enable me to govern wiſely. I ſhall not think that I have paid for it too dear, if I can render it conducive to the happineſs of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if I can make England forget, under a reign of juſtice and of peace, the troubles which have ſo long diſtracted her. I will take, for my pattern, that Henry, whoſe name will be for ever dear to the French, and whom we ourſelves are forced to revere. I go into his country, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the remembrance of all his virtues. Firm, like him, in adverſity, I will imitate his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when I mount the throne. Theſe are my engagements with my people; and do you, whom I look upon, at this moment, as repreſenting my people, receive the oath, which I make to reſpect and defend its rights, until my dying day.</p>

                           <p>By that pride they were undone. I am not ſorry for it. They did not ſerve the prince's cauſe ſincerely: He had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into their arms, and they treated him as a priſoner. They removed him from the army, becauſe they ſaw that he gained the affections of the ſoldiery, by his valour. They alſo ſent home five thouſand brave fellows, whom they thought too ſtrongly attached to his intereſt. They wiſhed to have the glory of ſubduing Cromwell, all to themſelves. They had reduced him to extremity. It was all over with him, if they had continued upon the heights, as their general would have had them: but their head-ſtrong miniſters ſaid, that they had wreſtled with the Lord, in their prayers, that they had forced him

to grant them the victory, and to deliver the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy into their hands. They came down, therefore, like madmen, into the plain, and were beaten. They deſerved it, for their blindneſs. They talked of diſcourſing with the Lord, in the ſame manner as of a familiar converſation with a friend. If they had been victorious, perhaps, they would not have treated the king any better than Cromwell himſelf would have done.</p>

                           <p>True; but we ſoon ſee pride baſely yield to intereſt. The Engliſh complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under their laſt king, of the oppreſſion of ſhip-money and the ſtar-chamber. Taxes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heavier at preſent, under the arbitrary adminiſtration of parliament: immenſe ſums have been conſumed for the levy of troops whoſe pay is extravagant. It will be neceſſary to keep theſe armies up for a long time, in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formidable to honeſt citizens, as well as to foreign enemies. It is the nation that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports theſe additional expenſes, at the ſame time that its manufactures languiſh, and its commerce is interrupted. Diſcontents will break out every where, at once. Thoſe whom fortune has left in their original obſcurity, inflamed with envy, on ſeeing people of their own claſs raiſed above them, will rather wiſh the ſovereign power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed in the hands of thoſe whoſe rank and birth more naturally qualify them for it.

ſhall ſoon ſee that Cromwell and the parliament have overturned royal authority, in order firſt to divide it between them, and afterwards to quarrel for it. Open violence and ſecret perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution will be exerted to repreſs the murmurs of diſcontent: then the people at large will be ſenſible that tyranny never roſe to more ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceſſes of oppreſſion and audacity, than when they were amuſed with the vain hope of liberty.</p>

In conformity to this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you ſee what our conduct was before Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennis-caſtle.

                           <p>The buſineſs is only to underſtand well the fundamental points of our doctrine.

Was it not heaven that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired even our women, with a zeal quite divine, for the good old cauſe? Have we not ſeen thoſe of the higheſt diſtinction, ſtrip themſelves, with alacrity, of their moſt precious jewels; and the very ſervants bring us the amount of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in order to raiſe troops for the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to force all England to walk in the ways of ſalvation?

                           <p>I am charmed with Henry's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to the king. His reſpect is fervent, without having any thing of ſervility. His words are tempered with affection, deference, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity. He comforts the prince; he animates him; he ſwears to ſerve him at the expenſe of his life. We may diſcover, already; in his youth, the good ſenſe and firmneſs of more advanced experience.</p>

Forced as I was a few days ago to ply the axe as a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutter in the foreſt, why ſhould I be aſtoniſhed at this new diſguiſe? It is but another inſtance of the inconſtancy of Fortune. The more ſhe loads me with inſults, the more pride I take in deſpiſing them. I wiſh even to riſe above her, above myſelf, from the low eſtate to which ſhe reduces me. A king, in this dreſs, receives an important leſſon from Providence to tranſmit to other ſovereigns.</p>

moſt auſpicious hopes; and, in one moment, he has now gone far beyond them. With ſo many claims to my affection, can you think that he is indifferent to me, or that his loſs would create in me leſs poignant grief than in you? Pity my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, therefore, in your turn. You think me inſenſible, becauſe I would comfort you. Ah! why cannot I lay bare my heart before you? You would ſee it harrowed up with tortures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible. What ſhall I ſay to you? Such a ſoul as your's is not to be deluded by unreal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations; but ſome ſources of comfort are yet open. See your ſon, already full of virtues, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire immortal glory in the flower of his age, by ſaving his prince and his country. Let your affection dwell a moment upon theſe noble thoughts. If we are to loſe our ſon, there is this well-founded hope left, which Cromwell's fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cruelty will not render vain, that we ſhall all be included in the ſame proſcription with him.</p>

Sleep, at length, ſteals upon her eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and gives me a moment of freedom to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge my griefs alone.

This monſtrous chaos is the work of your gloomy policy: I have ſeen you lurk among the independents; unable to lead the ſect by the force of your eloquence, you have agitated them by the ravings of a diſtempered imagination: you wrapped yourſelf in the veil of religion, to amuſe the ambition of your rivals: you urged on all parties to the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of arbitrary power, that you might reach it, by treading in their ſteps, and then diſpoſſeſs

                           <p>Yes, my friends: the parliament had promiſed a reward to ſuch as ſhould deliver Charles Stuart into their hands. The generous Wyndham could have earned this reward, but he diſdained it. He had ſeen me, before, ſend the tyrant's younger brother<note n="*" place="bottom">The Duke of Glouceſter, the youngeſt ſon of Charles I. Cromwell ſent him over to Holland, after the beheading of his father.</note> over ſea. He has done more, he has driven away the tyrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to the end, that none of the accurſed family, may remain in the land of the ſaints.</p>

                  <head>ADVENTURES OF CHARLES II. IN HIS FLIGHT.</head>
                  <p>AFTER the battle of Worceſter, the king left the field, accompanied by fifty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He kept his eſcort together, during a flight of twenty-ſix miles, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect himſelf, either from the inſults of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people, or againſt the detachments that Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well had ſent out in purſuit of him. He then thought proper to ſeparate from them, and only retained about his perſon, the Earl of Derby, and Lord Wilmot, with whom he arrived at the old monaſtery of Witlade, the occupier of the lands on which the monaſtery ſtood, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given an aſylum to the earl, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of his little army. This farmer, whoſe name deſerves to be handed down to poſterity, was called Penderel: he had four brothers, men of loyalty, like himſelf, who had another ſmall farm at Boſcobel, in the neighbourhood. He ſent for them, and into their hands, the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his deſtiny. They cut off his hair, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:045437_0307_102000D3BA9BFB88"/>
his face, and conducted him, in an old tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered diſguiſe, to cut wood in the foreſt. They made him lie in a little chapel, upon a ſtraw bed, with a wretched bolſter. A woman, whom they were obliged to admit into the ſecret, brought him milk, butter and eggs. The king was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at ſeeing her, and not knowing whether the Penderels had truſted her without reſerve, he aſked her, in order to aſſure himſelf, how ſhe could think of being faithful to one of the king's party. The woman anſwered, without explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf further, that ſhe would be faithful to the king as long as ſhe lived. She uttered theſe words with ſuch an appearance of feeling, that Charles' apprehenſions were perfectly quieted, and he made a very hearty meal of the victuals which ſhe had brought him, neceſſity rendering it, perhaps, the moſt delicious that ever he made in his life. Charles had ſcarcely left Witlade, before ſome of Cromwell's ſoldiers alighted at the monaſtery, and ſearched it all through. Luck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily a very abundant ſhower of rain hindered them from leaving it, to ſcour the neighbourhood; and nothing diſturbed the little repoſe, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive wearineſs, and violent anxiety, ſuffered the king to enjoy in his diſmal lodging.</p>
                  <p>Informed of this alarm, the next morning, as ſoon as he awoke, he reſolved immediately to go into Wales. He promiſed himſelf more ſecurity there, until he ſhould be able to make for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, whither he had ſent Lord Wilmot, to wait his coming. He ſat out, therefore, at night, with one of the Penderels for his guide. As they paſſed near a mill, the miller hearing them
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:045437_0308_102000D7293F72C0"/>
open a gate at the end of the bridge that croſſed his mill-race, ſallied out haſtily from his mill, and demanded, with a threatening tone, where they were going, at ſuch an unſeaſonable hour. They continued endeavouring to open the gate, without anſwering him. The miller ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, crying out to them to ſtop, at which ſummons Penderel abandoned the bridge, and ruſhed into the ſtream: the king followed him, without heſitation, the noiſe that he made in the water directing his ſteps, as the darkneſs prevented him from ſeeing his guide. Luckily the ſame darkneſs, together with the miller's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulence, hindered him from overtaking them.</p>
                  <p>They arrived, quite wet, at the houſe of a country-man, named Wolf, an acquaintance of Penderels. Wolf, after having concealed the king as well as he could, went himſelf to the edge of the river, to prepare a paſſage for him; but he found the whole bank ſo covered with ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that he thought it his duty to diſſuade his gueſt from ſo dangerous an enterprize. Charles was obliged to return to Boſcobel, and from thence to the chapel, where he kept himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, while the Penderels examined the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to diſcover whether there were any of the parliament's troops in the neighbourhood. One of them, as he went his rounds, met a perſon, at the ſight of whom the king was agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized. His name was Careleſs, one of thoſe brave warriors, who, in order to let the king gain a larger diſtance from Worceſter, had ſtemmed every effort of the enemy for a conſiderable time, at the city gates. Careleſs was a native of this
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:045437_0309_102000D8B7729480"/>
part of the country, and knew the Penderels, who brought him home to their houſe. The king having hurt his foot, came hither at night to have it dreſſed. Careleſs knew him, and would not quit him afterwards. He re-conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the foreſt before break of day, and made him climb into a large tree, where they both remained concealed among the thick bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for near four and twenty hours. They ſaw ſeveral ſoldiers walk by at the foot of the tree, many of whom expreſſed the moſt ardent deſire of ſeizing the king. This tree received the name of the royal oak, and has ever ſince been honoured with the higheſt veneration by the people of the country.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, a ſecret report had been ſpread, that Charles was ſomewhere thereabout. One of the Penderels going into a neighbouring vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, found there a number of ſoldiers very buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in collecting every account poſſible concerning the king. The officer, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, put many queſtions to Penderel himſelf, and promiſed him a great reward if he would give information where Charles lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. Penderel did not ſwerve from his loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but his account of this circumſtance, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the king to take the reſolution of ſeeking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother retreat.</p>
                  <p>The guide, whom he had ſent with Lord Wilmot, to conduct him to London, returning, informed the king, that his lordſhip, deſpairing to reach town, through the crouds of ſoldiers, who filled all the roads, had ſtopped ſhort at the houſe of a gentleman of the royal party, named
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:045437_0310_102000DB357787D0"/>
Witgrave, where he was in ſafety. Charles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the deſign of going to him, and had the good fortune to ſucceed, in ſpite of every dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he was to encounter.</p>
                  <p>Charles, while he indulged the ſatisfaction that he felt on ſeeing Lord Wilmot, had not time to deliberate with him on the courſe or meaſures which would be moſt proper for them to take, when a party of ſoldiers appeared before Mr. Witgrave's houſe, with an intention of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Reſiſtance would have been unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Witgrave concealed his gueſts, and, at the ſame time, opened his door with ſo much alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unconcern, that his viſitors were induced to make but a very ſlight ſearch. It was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards underſtood, that a freſh inſpection had been made of Witlade monaſtery; and that the officer of the party by whom it was ſearched, had ſeveral times held his piſtol to Farmer Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derel's breaſt, to oblige him to confeſs where the king was concealed.</p>
                  <p>The danger increaſing every day, Charles dropped all thoughts of ſtaying any longer in England, and reſolved to get as near the ſea as he could, in order to embark, with more ſpeed and convenience, the firſt opportunity. Colonel Lane, a zealous loyaliſt, who lived at Bentley, a place but a few miles diſtant, promiſed to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate in effecting this purpoſe. The king had made his feet ſo ſore by walking in heavy boots, or great ſhoes, which had not been made for him, that he was obliged to ride. He reached Bently, in company with Lord Wilmot, and the four Penderels, who had always been ſo faithful
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:045437_0311_102000DEA2A90818"/>
to him. Colonel Lane propoſed to convey the king to Briſtol, where they might hope to find ſome veſſel that would take him on board. This officer had a relation, called Mrs. Norton, who lived about three miles from Briſtol, and was then very far advanced in her pregnancy. He obtained a paſſport (without which, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to travel in thoſe troubleſome times) for his ſiſter and a ſervant, under pretence of viſiting his relation in the neighbourhood of Briſtol. The king, therefore, ſat off on horſeback, and rode behind Miſs Lane's chaiſe, paſſing for her ſervant. Lord Wilmot leading a brace of ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels, coupled together, and carrying a hawk upon his wriſt, paſſed for a ſporting country gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of their acquaintance, who had met them on the road.</p>
                  <p>During this journey, which laſted but three days, the king met with ſeveral adventures, moſt of them ſufficient to inſpire him with well-grounded terrors. He had only travelled ſix miles, when his horſe having dropped a ſhoe, he went himſelf to the neareſt blackſmith, to have him ſhod, as he choſe to go through with the character that he had aſſumed. While he ſtood by at the operation, the ſmith aſked him what news were going, and if the king was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Charles anſwered, without changing countenance, that he had not heard any thing of it, and that, in all likelihood, his majeſty was gone back to Scotland. I do not think ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſmith; I ſhould rather ſuppoſe him to be concealed in England. Wherever he is, I ſhould wiſh to know his place of concealment.

The parliament has publiſhed a proclamation, offering a reward of 1000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling, to whoever will diſcover him.</p>
                  <p>This diſagreeable converſation being over, the party ſat forward again, and continued their route to near Eveſham, where, as they were about to paſs a ford, they perceived, all at once, a number of horſes ſtanding, ſaddled, at the other ſide of it. Charles was for going right on, but his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, leſs reſolute, prevailed upon him, at length, to turn off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They found themſelves ſtill in the view of the ſoldiers, whom they had thought to avoid: but the prince ſhewed ſo good a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the whole cavalcade appeared ſo much in nature, as a country family paying a viſit in the neighbourhood, that the ſoldiers, who were, at that moment, buſied in ſeeking him, and him only, conceived not the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of him.</p>
                  <p>When they came to Mrs. Norton's, Miſs Lane told her, that ſhe had brought with her a young man, whom ſhe wiſhed her to take into her ſervice. He was the ſon, ſhe ſaid, of a poor countryman, in her neighbourhood, and had caught an ague on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the road, for which reaſon, ſhe requeſted that he might have a room to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Charles retired to it, and did not ſtir out; but a ſervant of the houſe, whoſe name was Pope, knew him, and, throwing himſelf at his feet, Is it you, Sire? ſaid he; I have ſeen your majeſty when very young, and therefore was not long recollecting you: if I can ſerve your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, put my zeal to the teſt, and depend upon my fidelity. Charles was ſurprized and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:045437_0313_102000E2A6ECFB28"/>
at this new adventure. He ſaw an equal riſk in diſcovering himſelf to a ſtranger, and in ſhewing that he diſtruſted a man, who had it in his power to verify his ſuſpicions. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, the apparent ſincerity of the man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the king to conceal nothing. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent proved that he was right. Pope rendered the king great ſervices, and contributed not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his ſafety, by pointing out to him, as a ſafe retreat, the houſe of Colonel Wyndham, where, in effect, he ſpent nineteen days, waiting until his friends ſhould find an opportunity for him to embark on board ſome ſhip.</p>
                  <p>This was not an eaſy matter, on account of the precautions taken againſt receiving ſtrangers. It was even dangerous to propoſe it, the captains of ſhips ſuſpecting every body, whom they did not know, to be the king, and dreading the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties denounced againſt ſuch as ſhould refuſe to diſcover him. A report of his death had prevailed ſome time, and would have contributed to render his life ſerene, had it laſted longer. He learned this, from the ringing of bells, and the public rejoicings that were made, on account of it, in the neighbourhood; but the report fell to the ground too ſoon, and did not, in the leaſt, diminiſh the difficulties which oppoſed his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking, notwithſtanding all the pains that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Wyndham took, in order to forward this object.</p>
                  <p>A merchant, of the name of Eſden, had juſt conveyed Lord Barclay over ſea, whither he ſled from the perſecution of the parliament. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Wyndham, who knew this merchant, went
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:045437_0314_102000E66B29FCE0"/>
directly to Lyme, where he lived; and entreated him to perform the ſame kindneſs for a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a friend of his, who would deſire to take no more than one ſervant with him in the whole. Mr. Eſden went with him to the village of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, where he directed him to a maſter of a ſhip, with whom he might make his agreement. It was fixed, that the captain ſhould come the next day but one, and receive his paſſengers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, at a ſolitary part of the coaſt. The king was exact to the hour of his appointment, but no ſhip appeared. They learned, afterwards, that the preceding day, there had been a fair in Lyme, at which the parliament's proclamation, againſt ſuch as ſhould harbour or conceal the king, was read. The captain's wife being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by her huſband, that he was going to convey to France, certain perſons, whom he did not name to her, oppoſed his deſign very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and, in order to hinder him completely from effecting it, ſhe locked him up in his room, while he was buſy getting ready ſome things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the voyage.</p>
                  <p>Dreading, leſt this incident ſhould become public, Charles was obliged to quit Colonel Wyndham's houſe, without well knowing where to face. He proceeded, however, towards Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, accompanied ſtill by Wilmot, Colonel Wyndham, with one of his ſervants, being their guides. Wilmot's horſe loſing a ſhoe, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance was very near occaſioning the king's diſcovery. They had ſent the horſe to be ſhod in a village where they had ſtopped, as night came on. The blackſmith aſked the hoſtler
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:045437_0315_102000E8E71274E8"/>
where his gueſts came from, who anſwering, that, by their own account, they came from Exeter: they impoſe upon you, replied the ſmith, with a countenance full of the important diſcovery, theſe ſhoes were made down in the north. The hoſtler, from this obſervation, recollecting that the four horſemen had ordered their horſes to remain ſaddled, and had not beſpoke beds for themſelves, he concluded, at firſt, that they were certainly people of quality belonging to the king's army, which had been defeated near Worceſter; and afterwards, that it might, very poſſibly, be the king himſelf. Upon the ſtrength of this conjecture, he went to the miniſter of the pariſh, a violent parliamentarian, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his ſuſpicions to him. The miniſter was, at that moment, engaged in prayer, and would not be interrupted. But the noiſe of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture gaining ground, as the blackſmith, on his ſide, had not failed to circulate it, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter took fire, and went to a juſtice of the peace. Immediately the whole town is up in arms, ſearching for the ſtrangers, and a party is ſent off after them, by the read which they were ſeen to take. The king could not poſſibly have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped them, if, inſtead of keeping the main road, he had not turned ſhort, and made the beſt of his way, by croſs roads, to Saliſbury.</p>
                  <p>We cannot ſufficiently admire his continuing undiſcovered during the remainder of his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings. The whole country was full of troops, marching in every direction; at every ſtep he was ſurrounded by them. He no ſooner ſtopped at an inn, but the ſoldiers, officers, whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:045437_0316_102000EA6F8F1450"/>
enter the place. Juſt as he was going to ſtep into a ſhip, which had been prepared for him at Southampton, there came up a battalion of ſoldiers, ordered for Jerſey, and took poſſeſſion of it before his face: at length, a friend contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to procure him a ſmall bark at Shoreham, in Suſſex, upon the application of a Mr. Manſell, a rich merchant of that quarter. They met at night, in a houſe not far from the harbour, and Charles waited on Sir John Wilmot at table, who had kept Mr. Manſell to ſupper, and the captain of the bark, whoſe name was Tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall. Supper being over, they were preparing to go aboard; and the king expected now to have no further riſks to run, except thoſe of the voyage, when the captain, taking the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his being alone with Mr. Manſell, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him thus: You have deceived me, ſaid he, and your enterprizing ſpirit, might have coſt me my life. Mr. Manſell, who appeared igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the matter himſelf, uſed every effort to perſuade him, that the idea was without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and at length, Sir John Wilmot, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing them, came in, and plied him ſo ſtrongly with money and promiſes, that he overcame his reſiſtance. Captain Tatterſhall ran home im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and aſked his wife for linen and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. You are in a great hurry, ſaid ſhe, why not wait till to-morrow; and as he continued preſſing her to make haſte; Well, ſaid ſhe, I ſee it is for the king. God give you ſucceſs, and him too. The attempt is hazardous; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you ſave him, I am ſatisfied to beg my
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:045437_0317_102000EC3AA1DF58"/>
own and my children's bread, all my life. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by theſe words, Tatterſhall went to give the neceſſary orders, that his bark ſhould be in readineſs to ſail the next morning at five o'clock. It took up the king at the appointed place; and his taking leave of his faithful friends, was a very tender ſcene. Mr. Manſell, approaching him the laſt, took him by the hand, and kiſſing it with fervor, I was willing, ſaid he, to have been deceived by your majeſty: I pray God, that you may arrive in ſafety, at your port, and return, very ſoon, in peace, to theſe your realms. Charles anſwered him, ſmiling, that he would then remember a ſervice which was done him with ſo good a grace. The bark ſoon loſt ſight of the ſhore, and had ſo favourable a courſe the whole day, that they anchored, the ſame night, at Feſcamp, from whence the king ſat out for Paris, and arrived there October 30, 1651.</p>

                  <head>THE HAT.</head>
                  <p>A COUNTRYMAN came, one day, into a ſhop, in the city, and laying his hat on the counter, begged the maſter of the ſhop, to lend him half a guinea upon it, as a pledge. Do you take me for a madman, ſaid the maſter of
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:045437_0318_102000EFA8A048A8"/>
the ſhop? it is againſt the law, and if it were not, that ſhabby hat is not worth two-pence. Such as it is, replied the countryman, I would not give it for five guineas, and yet I have very urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the ſum that I aſk. I ſold my corn at the market, a week ago, to a mealman, who was to pay me to-day; and I depended upon having it to make up my rent, which has been ſo long due, that if it is not paid to-morrow, as I promiſed it ſhould, I expect to be diſtrained for it. But the poor meal-man is almoſt broke, he has lately buried his only ſon, a grown-up youth, and now, this laſt week, his wife died of grief, ſo that I cannot be paid until next market-day. As I often come into your ſhop, to buy things, and you know me to be an honeſt man, I thought you would not make much difficulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout lending me half a guinea: it is nothing in your pocket, but is a great matter to me: at all hazards, there is my hat, to anſwer for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and a better ſecurity than you think. The tradeſman anſwered him only with a ſneer, and, turning upon his heel, attended to other perſons who were in the ſhop.</p>
                  <p>Sir George Liberal happened to be one of them: he had liſtened, with attention, to the countryman's diſcourſe, and was ſtruck with the air of honeſty, that was apparent in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He approached him gently, and putting half a guinea into his hand, Here is the money that you want, ſaid he, ſince you find people ſo loth to oblige you, I will be your friend, without a pledge. With theſe words, he went out of the ſhop, eying the maſter of it with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:045437_0319_102000F310D8AAF8"/>
and his carriage was gone a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance off, before the countryman had recovered from the emotions of his joy and amazement.</p>
                  <p>About a month after, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ir George Liberal was going in his chariot, up the Hay-market, he heard ſomebody call out, ſeveral times, to his coachman, to ſtop, but to no purpoſe, for the coachman drove briſkly on, without paying any regard to him: at the ſame time, Sir George looking out, ſaw a man upon the footway, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with all ſpeed, to overtake the carriage; he, therefore, drew the ſtring, to make the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtop. Immediately, the man ſprings to the coach-door, crying, I beg your pardon, Sir—I have run myſelf out of breath, to overtake you; Did not you, Sir, about a month ago, put half a guinea into my hand, in a ſhop in the city?—Why, yes, I remember ſomething of it—Well, Sir, here is the money, which I return you, with many thanks. You did not give me time to thank you then, much leſs to aſk your name and addreſs; and the man of the ſhop did not know you. I came to town, every week, with my own hay and corn, in hopes that I might, ſome time or other, have the good fortune to meet with you: luckily, I ſaw you as you paſſed up the ſtreet. I ſhould never have been happy, if I had not had the opportunity of paying my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to you; and may Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon you the recompenſe which your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity deſerves. I am happy, ſaid Sir George, in having obliged ſo honeſt a man as you ſeem to be; but I confeſs to you, I did not expect to ſee the money returned me. I intended it as a
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:045437_0320_102000F49A13B478"/>
ſmall preſent to you.—That is more than I knew, Sir; and beſides, I make a conſcience of not receiving money that I do not earn. I had done nothing for you, and you had ſerved me ſufficiently, by lending me the ſum in queſtion. Let me beg you, therefore, to receive it again. No, my good friend, it belongs neither to you nor me, now: Do me the pleaſure to buy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with it for your children, and give it to them as a preſent from me. Sir, your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very genteel, and it would be uncivil in me to refuſe your offer. Well, then, ſay no more, the matter is finiſhed. But pray explain one particular to me, which has not ceaſed to engage my curioſity, ever ſince I ſaw you: How could you have the conſcience to aſk half a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea on your hat, which was ſcarcely worth a groat? Ah! Sir, it is worth every thing to me. How ſo, pray? I will give you the hiſtory of it.</p>
                  <p>Some years ſince, my landlord's ſon, ſliding on a pool in his father's grounds, fell through the ice. I happened to be at work near the place, and hearing ſome people cry out, who ſaw the child ſink; I ran to the ſpot, and throwing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the water with my clothes on, juſt as I was, I had the good fortune to ſave the child, and to reſtore him alive to his father: my land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord did not forget this ſervice; he gave me a ſung farm, in addition to what little land I held under him before, which was not much more than a cabbage-garden, ſupplied me with ſtock and utenſils of huſbandry, and in ſhort ſet me up completely in my ſmall farm. But this was not
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:045437_0321_102000F737B984A8"/>
all. As I had loſt my hat in the water, be placed his own upon my head, ſaying at the ſame time, that he could have wiſhed to place a crown upon it. You ſee, Sir, if I have not reaſon to be fond of this hat. I never wear it in the country: every thing there reminds me of my benefactor, though he has been dead ſome time. My children, my wife, my cottage, my land, all ſeem to ſpeak, as it were, continually of him to my remembrance, But whenever I come to town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I always put on this hat, that I may have ſomething about me to put me in mind of him. I am only ſorry that it begins to grow old. You ſee, Sir, it is going; but as long as a bit of it remains together, it ſhall be ineſtimable in my eyes.</p>
                  <p>Sir George felt great pleaſure from this recital of the countryman, and taking out his card, here, ſaid he, farmer, take this, it contains my addreſs, I am obliged to quit you now, but ſhall be glad to ſee you at my houſe next Sunday morning.</p>
                  <p>The countryman did not fail to come, at the time appointed: as ſoon as the ſervant carried in his name, Sir George himſelf came out to receive him, and, taking him by the hand, he ſaid, my worthy friend, you have not, it is true, ſaved me an only ſon, but you have, nevertheleſs, performed me a very conſiderable ſervice; you have taught me to love mankind better than I did before, by proving to me, that there are ſtill hearts replete with honeſty and gratitude. Since hats figure to ſuch advantage on your head, here
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:045437_0322_102000F9B14C8F48"/>
is one that I wiſh you to accept as a preſent: I do not deſire, however, that you ſhould leave off that of your benefactor; only when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being worn longer, I beg the reverſion of your head for this; and every year, on this ſame day, you will find a new one here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place it.</p>
                  <p>This was no more than a genteel pretext, which Sir George's delicacy ſuggeſted to him, in order to avoid hurting the countryman's pride: he knew, very well, that we ſhould endeavour not to humble thoſe whom we oblige, but to raiſe them in their own opinion. After having gained his heart by this firſt tie of friendſhip, he acquired ſufficient aſcendancy over him, to aſſume the right of conferring the moſt eſſential benefits on him and his family, and of repairing the loſſes which they had ſuſtained by unavoidable ſtrokes of fortune. He had finally the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing them nearly as happy in their gratitude, as he himſelf was in his generoſity.</p>

                  <head>LITTLE GRANDISON. A Letter from WILLIAM D—to his MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER.</head>
                  <p>O Dear mama! every body here is in the greateſt conſternation. Charles went out early this morning, on horſeback, attended by a ſervant, in order to pay a viſit to a friend five or ſix miles off and only think, he is not returned yet. His father had deſired him to be home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore five o'clock, and it is now paſt nine. Never before, did he diſobey the commands of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Something muſt have happened to him. It is a very dark night, and a dreadful thick fog. Mr. Grandiſon has juſt ſent off a ſervant, to make enquiry about his ſon. How impatiently do I expect his return!</p>
                  <p>Eleven o'clock.</p>
                  <p>What diſtreſs! The ſervant is returned from the houſe where Charles went to ſpend the day. Charles had left it with his ſervant, before four o'clock. What can have become of him? Can he have gone aſtray in the foreſt, or fallen from his horſe? Who can tell? Or have ſome vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:045437_0324_102000FFE42C4100"/>
robbed and murdered him? Good heaven! Mrs. Grandiſon will die, with apprehenſion. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily does nothing but weep. Edward is like one diſtracted; he runs every moment up ſtairs, and into the yard. Mr. Grandiſon endeavours to comfort his wife; but it is eaſy to ſee that himſelf is in the deepeſt affliction. He has juſt ſent out men on horſeback, different ways, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find poor Charles. If it were not for leaving his wife in her preſent diſtreſs; he would, before this time, have hurried out in ſearch of his ſon. Oh! that I had gone with my friend! I ſhould, at leaſt, have ſhared all his dangers; but Mrs. Grandiſon inſiſted that I ſhould ſtay at home, on account of a ſlight cold. Perhaps, if I had entreated her preſſingly, ſhe would have ſuffered me to go with him. I am quite unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. I know not how I ſupport my affliction. I can no longer hold the pen. I do not ſee what I write.</p>
                  <p>One o'clock in the morning.</p>
                  <p>No Charles yet. Not a ſoul has gone to bed. Indeed, who could reſt? The ſervants wring their hands: Edward and Emily cry inceſſantly, O, brother! brother! and this increaſes my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs. I wiſh it were morning.</p>
                  <p>Half after ſix in the morning.</p>
                  <p>God be praiſed, mama, we have news of Charles. The ſervant, who was with him, is juſt returned. No accident has happened to my friend. It is not his fault that he cauſed us ſo much uneaſineſs: he ſtaid out neither through careleſſneſs nor for pleaſure. Far from deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:045437_0325_1020010295FD4D90"/>
to be blamed, he is worthy of the higheſt praiſe. Oh! when you ſhall hear his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! But Mr. Grandiſon abſolutely inſiſts, that we all go and lie down for a few hours, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ourſelves, after the fatigues and anxiety of the night; and we muſt obey Farewell, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, until I awake. My firſt care ſhall be to write to you. I will riſe two hours the ſooner, on purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Nine o'clock.</p>
                  <p>I will now tell you the whole ſtory, mama, from the account given us by the ſervant. His young maſter and himſelf, had ſet out before four o'clock, as I mentioned, in order to be at home by the time that Mr. Grandiſon had fixed for their return. They had ſcarcely come the fourth part of the way, when it began, all at once, to grow dark. There came on ſo thick a fog, that one could not diſtinguiſh an object at the diſtance of two yards. Charles, who is naturally cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, did not make himſelf the leaſt uneaſy. They held on their way, at a full trot, when ſuddenly they perceived, ſtraight before them, a man, ſtretched at his full length, on the road. What is here? cried Charles, ſtopping his horſe. I ſuppoſe, replied the ſervant, ſomebody that has taken a glaſs too much. Let us go on, maſter.</p>
                  <p>No, ſaid Charles, if it be a man in liquor, we muſt remove him, at leaſt out of the coach way, for fear that ſome carriage, paſſing by, ſhould go over him, in the dark. He had not ſaid theſe words, before he was on the ground: but what was his ſurprize, when approaching the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:045437_0326_10200104276914B0"/>
ſtranger, he perceived him to be an old offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, in regimentals. He had a large wound in his head, from which the blood flowed in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Charles ſpoke to him, but he returned no anſwer.</p>
                  <p>It is a dead man, cried the ſervant, who had alſo alighted.</p>
                  <p>No, no; he is ſtill alive, ſaid Charles. He is only in a ſwoon. Heavens! what ſhall we do?</p>
                  <p>What can we do? replied the ſervant; we muſt go on; then we can call at the firſt village, and ſend ſomebody to his aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>How unfeeling you are, John, cried Charles, with vivacity; before the perſons that we might be able to ſend, ſhould arrive here, this poor gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would be dead. See what a quantity of blood he has loſt. Faſten our horſes to theſe trees. We muſt ourſelves give him whatever aſſiſtance we can.</p>
                  <p>How, Sir? ſaid John; ſure you are not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It will be dark night preſently; and we ſhall never be able to find our way home, in this fog.</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, then, we will ſtay here.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>And what will maſter and miſtreſs ſay? You may gueſs how uneaſy they will be.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! that is very true. I never thought of that.</p>
                     <p>Charles was going to mount his horſe again, but turning his eyes, which were filled with tears, toward the officer, he felt himſelf held to the ſpot by a ſecret power. No, unfortunate ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, cried he, I will not leave you in this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:045437_0327_10200106AAC96650"/>
ſituation. My parents cannot be angry with me for it. I will not ſuffer a fellow creature to periſh, without doing every thing in my power to relieve him.</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid theſe words, he took off his clothes in haſte, and tore his waiſtcoat in two pieces.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>What are you doing there, maſter?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>I muſt bind up his forehead, to ſtop the wounds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Sir—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>Do not ſay a word more, but come and aſſiſt me.</p>
                     <p>He then doubled his handkerchief in four folds, and bound the gentleman's head with it, which was ſtill bleeding plentifully, and taking one ſide of his waiſtcoat, folded in length, he applied it to keep the bandage on faſt, with pins. Afterwards, aſſiſted by John, he lifted the unfortunate ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of the high road, and carried him on the graſs.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we do now, Sir? ſaid John.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>You muſt gallop to the firſt village, and bring ſome people to convey this poor gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to a farm houſe. I will pay them for their trouble, and, in the mean time, I ſhall wait here for you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven forbid that I ſhould do as you ſay. No, Maſter Charles, I will do no ſuch thing. What, leave you all alone in this ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place? Your father would never forgive me for it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>I take the whole upon myſelf, and I inſiſt that you obey me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="330" facs="unknown:045437_0328_1020010922DC4160"/>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, Sir, ſince you order me ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, I have nothing more to ſay. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at leaſt—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>I will remember every thing.</p>
                     <p>John ſat off, therefore, as faſt as his horſe could gallop. A little farther on the road, he found a cottage, in which were two men at work, making wicker baſkets, with ſeveral women and children. He opened the door, and, addreſſing himſelf to the head of the family, he requeſted him to come, with his eldeſt ſon, to the aſſiſtance of an old offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who had fallen on the road, and was welter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his blood. They ſhewed, at firſt, ſome unwillingneſs to go out, on ſuch a dark night, at the deſire of a perfect ſtranger. But, at length, perſuaded by the entreaties of John, and by the ſincerity that appeared in his proteſtations, they went to fetch a ſort of bier, and then accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him.</p>
                     <p>During all this time, Charles had not quitted the old gentleman's ſide, a moment, and, by dint of care, had brought him to his ſenſes again.</p>
                     <p>Shall I take the liberty, Sir, to aſk your name, ſaid he, as ſoon as he ſaw him open his eyes, and by what accident you came to be in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>My name is Arthur, replied the old man, in a weak, tremulous voice. I am major in the—regiment. I had come from my own houſe, intending to take a ride. My horſe ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the road, hereabouts, and, in his fall, threw me over his neck. My head ſtruck againſt a ſtone. I endeavoured to get up, but what with pain, loſs of blood, and the weakneſs of old age, I
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:045437_0329_1020010BF0980870"/>
fainted away, and cannot tell what happened to me from that moment. But you, amiable child, who ſo feelingly compaſſionate my misfortune, is it you, that have dreſſed my wound, and ſaved my life?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir, and I am happy to have had; it in my power to ſerve you. I had a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with me: him I have ſent to the next vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, to procure you lodging, and aſſiſtance more effectual than mine.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The major.</speaker>
                     <p>What, have you had the courage to ſtay by my ſide, in this lonely place, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the darkneſs of the night! Young as you are, you have paid the moſt humane atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me. What thanks do I owe you!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>None, Sir. I have but done my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhall count myſelf happy, if I can be ſtill farther uſeful to you.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe was interrupted by the arrival of John, with the two men. They placed the major on the bier, on which they had, previouſly, laid a good mattraſs: but, in ſpite of the pains that they took to convey him gently, the ſhaking of the bier, as they walked along, revived the pain of his wound, ſo that he fell again into a fainting fit.</p>
                     <p>Charles having given his horſe to John to lead, walked in ſilence by the ſide of the bier, and ſhewed every ſort of attention poſſible, to the wounded perſon, in order to make him recover his ſpirits. When they came to the door of the cottage, he made one of the countrymen mount his horſe, and diſpatched him, with all ſpeed, for a ſurgeon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="332" facs="unknown:045437_0330_1020010E81B919E0"/>
Nevertheleſs, John uſed the moſt earneſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions to induce his young maſter to return home, and repreſented to him the terrors which his parents muſt feel, on account of his ſtay.</p>
                     <p>What, ſaid Charles, ſhould I leave this old man to die in the hands of ſtrangers! You ſee, he is ſtill inſenſible. I ſhould have done nothing for him, were I to leave him now. No, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>How, Maſter Charles! You do not ſay ſo?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                     <p>My reſolution is fixed. Do you haſten home to my father and mother; tell them every thing that has happened, that they may not be uneaſy on my account. Tell them that I will wait their orders, here, to-morrow.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>Really, Sir, it is what I cannot think of doing. My maſter would receive me finely, if I were to return without you.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be ſo, for all that, replied Charles, in a firm tone of voice. Do not loſe time. It is night already.</p>
                     <p>It was in vain that John proteſted againſt what he called the imprudence of his young maſter: he was obliged to go.</p>
                     <p>Charles was eaſier then, ſuppoſing that his parents would ſoon hear of him: but there was another unlucky accident ſtill deſtined to befall them; the fog grew thicker and thicker, the night grew darker, and John, loſing his way in a wood through which he was to paſs, and not knowing by what courſe he was to get out of it, was obliged, after many ineffectual ſcampers, to ſeat himſelf at the foot of a tree, and there
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:045437_0331_10200110FA5F9E68"/>
to wait for daylight, leaving us, all the while, in the moſt terrible alarm. The poor man was quite exhauſted with cold and wearineſs, when he came home this morning. Notwithſtanding his hurry to come, he was afraid to ſhew himſelf, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o bleſs heaven for having given me ſuch a ſon! And you, John, have done very well, to obey his orders in every reſpect. Here are two guineas, to make you amends for your bad night. Go, refreſh yourſelf, and take a little ſleep, that you may be able to go back to my ſon. I am not the leaſt angry with him for all the uneaſineſs that he has cauſed us. He did every thing in his power to relieve us from it.</p>
                     <p>But how will my friend be grieved, when he learns from John what we ourſelves have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! John is ſet off already. I ſaw Mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon give him a purſe of money for his ſon, that he may have wherewithal to provide every thing neceſſary. I am impatient now to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poor major be alive or dead. I hope ſoon to be able to give you ſome account of him. Farewell, dear mama, continue to love me, and love alſo my friend Charles, for his courage, preſence of mind, and humanity.</p>
                     <p>Eleven o'clock.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, mama, Charles is returned. With what tranſport did I embrace him! He appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an angel in my eyes. Thanks to his care, the major is much better. His hurt will ſoon be cured.</p>

Charles arrived much ſooner than we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Emily was the firſt who ſaw him! She ſcreamed out with joy and ſurprize, Charles! Charles! and ran precipitately to meet him: they came in, kiſſing each other. Charles quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her at the door, to fly to his father. He threw himſelf at his feet, and did not riſe from thence, till he perceived his mother hold out her arms to embrace him. I will relate to you, word for word, the diſcourſe that paſſed between them. I ſhall never forget it as long as I live.</p>

                  <p>ON the 17th of November, 1780, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board the St. Lawrence brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, then lying in the baſon of Quebec, and bound to New-York, being charged with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches from General Haldimand, commander in chief in that province, to Sir Henry Clinton. The ſame day, on receiving our ſailing orders, we weighed anchor, and dropped down to the harbour called Patrick's Hole, in the iſland of Orleans, in company with a ſchooner bound to the ſame port, on board of which was an Enſign,

Drummond, of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> regiment, with dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of General Haldimand's diſpatches. In this place, we were detained ſix days by a contrary wind: at the expiration of which time, the froſt had ſat in with prodigious ſeverity; and the ice was forming faſt in all parts of the river. Had the wind continued unfair for a few days longer, we ſhould have been entirely blocked up by it, and had happily eſcaped the calamities which afterward befel us.</p>
                  <p>On the 24th, the wind being fair, we got under way, and proceeded down the river St. Lawrence, as far as the Brandy-Pots; iſlands ſo called, about forty leagues from Quebec. At this place; the wind veered about to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, which obliged us again to anchor. The weather continued intenſely cold; and the veſſel being leaky, made ſo much water, as to render it neceſſary to keep one pump continually going. A change of wind ſoon after enabled us to proceed on our voyage, and to make the iſland of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſte, which is at the mouth of the river St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; when the wind coming round again to the eaſtward, we were obliged to beat off and on, between this iſland and Cape Roziere for four days; our veſſel at the ſame time increaſing her leaks to ſuch a degree, that we were under the neceſſity of rigging the other pump, and of keeping them both conſtantly at work. Being now in a higher latitude, the ſeverity of the cold had increaſed in proportion, and the ice began to form ſo faſt about the ſhip, as to alarm us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, leſt we ſhould be entirely ſurrounded
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:045437_0339_1020012710075138"/>
by it; which we only prevented, by cutting and breaking vaſt quantities of the ice from her ſides. To this taſk, with that of keeping the pumps at work, the crew, together with the paſſengers, were ſcarcely equal; only nineteen perſons being on board, of whom ſix were paſſengers, and the remainder very indifferent ſeamen. As for the maſter, from whom, in the preſent emergency we might have expected ſome degree of exertion, inſtead of attending to his duty, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his ſhip, he remained continually in a ſtate of intoxication in his cabin.</p>
                  <p>On the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the wind came round to the north-weſt, and we proceeded down the gulf of St. Lawrence, with two feet water in the ſhip's hold. The wind kept gradually increaſing till the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of December, when it blew a perfect gale from the north-weſt quarter; and the ſhip's crew being now almoſt overcome with cold and fatigue, ſeeing no proſpect of gaining upon the leak, the water having already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to four feet in the hold, nor a poſſibility of making any port, they came to the reſolution of working no longer at the pumps; which was unanimouſly agreed to, by all the foremaſt-men. They accordingly left off working, and declared themſelves quite indifferent about their fate; preferring the alternative, of going to the bottom together with the veſſel, to that of ſuffering ſuch ſevere and inceſſant labour in ſo deſperate a ſituation. Their fatigues, it muſt be confeſſed, from the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of November had been exceſſive: and though hope might ſtill remain, yet our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:045437_0340_102001289A385B48"/>
preſent circumſtances were ſuch, as to exclude at leaſt all probability of ſaving the veſſel. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by the force of perſuaſion and promiſes, together with the timely diſtribution of a pint of wine per man, which I had fortunately brought on board, they were diverted from this deſperate reſolution; but with great reluctance, ſaying, with ſome truth, as we afterwards experienced, and with more than they themſelves were aware of, that whether the veſſel filled or not, was a matter of no conſequence. This delay, though not exceeding a quarter of an hour, had increaſed the depth of water another foot; but the men added to their exertions, being encouraged by the wine, which was iſſued to them every half-hour, ſucceeded ſo far, as to reduce the water in the ſpace of two hours, to leſs than three feet. The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> captain ſtill remained in his cabin.</p>
                  <p>During the 2d and 3d of December, the gale ſeemed to increaſe rather than diminiſh. The ice formed ſo thick on the ſhip's ſides, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede her way very much through the water; which furniſhed us with a new labour, that of cutting it off, as faſt as it formed, with ſaws and axes. The leak continued to gain ground. The ſchooner that was in company, far from being able to afford us any aſſiſtance, was in as leaky a condition as our own veſſel, having ſtruck upon ſome rocks at the iſland of Coudres, through the ignorance or neglect of her pilot. A heavy ſnow beginning to fall, it was with the utmoſt difficulty we could get ſight of each other, though at no great diſtance, and,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:045437_0341_1020012A26CD9BE8"/>
in order not to part company, fired every half-hour. The ſchooner, at length, made no anſwer to our guns; whence, we concluded, ſhe had foundered; nor were we wrong in our ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. There were ſixteen perſons on board, every one of whom periſhed.</p>
                  <p>On the following day the gale increaſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly, and the ſea began to run high, with a heavy fall of ſnow, ſo as to prevent our ſeeing twenty yards a-head of the veſſel. The men being exceſſively fatigued, the water had riſen to its uſual quantity, of between four and five feet. The mate, whom I have not yet taken notice of, an intelligent young man, and well acquainted with his profeſſion, judged, from the diſtance we had run, that we could not now be far from the Magdalen Iſlands, which lie about mid-way in the gulf of St. Lawrence. Theſe iſlands are nothing more than a cluſter of rocks, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing above, and others hidden under the water, and have been fatal to many veſſels. Seamen wiſh often to make them in fine weather, as they ſerve to take a new departure from; but in foggy or blowing weather they, as ſtudiouſly avoid them. The mate's conjecture was but too well founded; for in leſs than two hours, we heard the ſea breaking upon the rocks; and ſoon after diſcovered the principal iſland, called the Deadman, cloſe under our lee; the point of which, it was with the greateſt difficulty that we weathered. Having happily cleared the main iſland, we were ſtill far from thinking ourſelves ſecure; for being unable, on account of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:045437_0342_1020012EB2815A10"/>
heavy fall of ſnow, to ſee many yards a-head of the veſſel, and, being in the midſt of the ſmall iſlands, there appeared very little probability that we ſhould paſs clear of them all in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Not being able to diſtinguiſh any one, in time to avoid it, we were obliged to leave the veſſel to the direction of Providence, and fortunately, I might ſay almoſt miraculouſly, ran through them all, without damage. The anxiety and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mind that the crew and paſſengers were in, while in the midſt of theſe rocks, may be eaſily conceived: and now, that the danger was over, it turned out to be a fortunate occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for us; for, by this time, the ſailors being ready to ſink under the accumulated diſtreſſes of cold and fatigue, and depreſſed by the little hopes they had of ſaving the veſſel, had nearly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, a ſecond time, to quit the pumps; and leave the veſſel to her fate: when acquiring freſh ſpirits from the danger we had eſcaped, and, as the vulgar are generally inclined to ſuperſtition, attributing what was perhaps accident alone, to the immediate interpoſition of Providence, they agreed to continue their efforts a little longer; towards which, they were likewiſe not a little encouraged, by the wine which I diſtributed to them occaſionally.</p>
                  <p>During the night, the gale continuing, and the ſea running very high, we were apprehenſive of being what ſeamen call pooped, or having the ſtern or poop of the veſſel beaten in by the waves; which happened in fact as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: for about five in the morning of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:045437_0343_10200130408D6738"/>
5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, a large wave broke on the ſhip's quarter, which ſtove in our dead-lights, filled the cabin, and waſhed the maſter out of his bed, where he had remained ever ſince the commencement of the gale. This accident, was attended with worſe conſequences than we at firſt imagined; for we ſoon diſcovered, from the increaſe of the leaks, that the ſtern-poſt had been ſtarted by the impulſe of the ſea. Having nothing in the after-hold, no other reſource was left but that of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſtop the leaks with beef, which we cut into ſmall pieces for that purpoſe: but this expedient we ſoon found ineffectual, and the water continued to gain on us faſter than ever. The ſailors finding all their labours fruitleſs, and the leak, which was conſtantly increaſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now rendered by our late misfortune en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely irreparable, abandoned themſelves totally to deſpair; and again refuſed to work at the pumps any longer. They had not however long remained inactive, before we contrived once more to perſuade them, to make another effort to clear the veſſel; when, to our great ſurpriſe and conſternation, we found the pumps ſo hard frozen, that it was impoſſible to move them.</p>
                  <p>All endeavours now to keep the ſhip clear were ineffectual, ſo that in a very ſhort time ſhe filled to the water's edge. Having no longer, as we imagined, the ſmalleſt foundation for hope, we reſigned ourſelves, with as much fortitude as poſſible, to our fate, which we expected every moment, to be that of going to the bottom. Notwithſtanding, when the veſſel was quite full,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:045437_0344_10200132B60B3480"/>
we obſerved ſhe was very little deeper in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than before; and, then recollecting a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the trouble and confuſion we had been in had almoſt obliterated, namely, that we had a quantity of lumber on board, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accounted for the phenomenon of her not ſinking beyond a certain depth in the water; and began to recall hopes of ſaving our lives, at leaſt, if we could but prevent her from overſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till we could make the iſland of St. Johns, or ſome other iſlands in the gulph. Having no guns on deck, (and not much lumber) to render the ſhip top-heavy, we contrived to prevent her from overſetting, by ſteering directly before the wind; though not without ſome difficulty, as, from the little way ſhe made through the water, the waves frequently waſhed clear over the decks. Beſides taking care to keep the veſſel ſteady, we uſed every precaution, to ſecure our boat from being waſhed overboard, the loſs of which would, in our preſent circumſtances, be a dreadful mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. The cabin, being raiſed above the level of the main deck, was tolerably clear of water, and afforded us ſome little ſhelter from the ſeverity of the weather. Thither we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, leaving only one man upon deck to govern the helm, who was faſtened by a rope, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his being carried away by the waves, which, at times made a free paſſage over us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:045437_0345_10200134455AD598"/>
The gale ſtill continued, without remiſſion, the ſnow falling ſo thick, at the ſame time, as to prevent our ſeeing to the maſt-head. We knew, from the diſtance we had run, that we could not be far from land. The captain imagined, from our courſe, during the night, and ſince the ſhip filled in the morning, that we muſt be near the iſland of St. John's, which lies between the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen iſlands, and the Gut of Canſo. This gave us hopes of ſaving our lives, in caſe we could run aſhore on ſome ſandy part of it, till they were daſhed, by the further information we had from he captain, that the north-eaſt ſide of the iſland, was nothing but a continued reef of rocks, from one end to the other, and that there was but one harbour where ſhips could put in, which he recollected, was on the oppoſite ſide of the iſland. In a few hours after, we obſerved the waves grew ſhorter and break higher, which is always found to be the caſe on approaching the ſhore; and likewiſe, a number of gulls and ducks flying about, a further ſign we could not be far diſtant from it.</p>
                  <p>We now concluded that we were about to run upon the rocks, which, the captain informed us, ſkirted the north-eaſt ſide of the iſland, and on approaching the land, laboured under greater dread and apprehenſion, than amidſt all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers we had before experienced, the idea of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt upon thoſe tremendous rocks, being more terrifying than that of being buried, as our companions were, in the boſom of the ocean. The ſhip had ſtill made conſiderable way through the water, though full, and with no other ſail
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:045437_0346_10200137DAB96E40"/>
ſet, but a cloſe-reefed fore-top-ſail, which was the only one we could diſplay; and the canvaſs being new, it had hitherto ſtood the gale. The captain propoſed bringing the ſhip too, to keep her off the land; which I oppoſed, as well as the mate, urging the probability that, we ſhould overſet her in the attempt; and that moreover, ſhould we be able to effect it, ſhe muſt, after all, drive aſhore, as in her preſent ſtate, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make any way to windward. Our opinion, however, was rejected, and an attempt was made to brace about the fore-yard; but it was found impracticable, the ropes and blocks being covered with ice. We were, therefore, obliged to let it remain as before; and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſuddenly changed its colour, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the ſhip to ſtrike every inſtant. Small as our expectations were of ſaving our lives, I thought it incumbent on me, to take every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to ſave the diſpatches I was charged with, and therefore ordered my ſervant to open my trunks, and collect all the letters they contained, which I put into a handkerchief, and faſtened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my waiſt. He, at the ſame time, offered me the money he found in them, to the amount of one hundred and eighty guineas, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to diſpoſe of as he thought proper, thinking it, in the preſent emergency, rather an incumbrance, than a matter worthy of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My ſervant, however, thought otherwiſe, and took care to ſecure the caſh, which was, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, of more ſervice to us, than at that time I could poſſibly have imagined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:045437_0347_1020013B5EEE80B8"/>
The weather continued thick, as uſual, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one o'clock, when ſuddenly clearing up, we diſcovered the land, at about three leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This ſight gave us no ſmall ſatisfaction, taking it, at firſt, to be the iſland of St. John's, which, being inhabited by ſeveral French and Engliſh families, we might have expected ſome aſſiſtance from them; but, on a nearer view, found, from the plans we had on board, that it had not the leaſt appearance of that iſland, there being no ſuch mountains and precipices laid down, as we diſcovered. On drawing nigher, we obſerved the ſea break high, and have a very diſmal appearance, about three miles from the land. As it was neceſſary for us to paſs through thoſe breakers, ere we could gain the ſhore, we expected that our fate would be determined there; but, contrary to our expectations, there was a conſiderable depth of water, ſo that we went over the reef without touching, though not without ſhipping many heavy ſeas, which, had not the veſſel's timbers been ſtrong, and her loading light, muſt infallibly have daſhed her to pieces. The land now began to have a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearance, ſeeming, at the diſtance we were off, to be high and rocky; but, on approaching within a mile of it, we had the pleaſure of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrying a fine ſandy beach, and a bold ſhore. The ſea ran high, but not to ſuch a degree as on the reef we had already paſſed. As we advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the water continued to have a depth beyond our moſt ſanguine wiſhes, ſo as to allow us to come within fifty or ſixty yards of the beach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſtruck. Now was the time for every
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:045437_0348_1020013CE84FA038"/>
man's apprehenſions to be on the rack, as we might expect, on touching the ſhore, that the ſhip would go to pieces. At length ſhe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a violent concuſſion. On the firſt ſtroke the main-maſt went out of the ſtep, and on the ſecond, the fore-maſt; but neither of them fell over the ſide, the deal boards in the hold being ſtowed ſo cloſe together that the maſts had no room to play below; at the ſame time the rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was unſhipped, with ſuch violence, as to be near killing one of the ſailors. As ſoon as the ſhip had grounded, the ſea began to beat over her in every part, each wave lifting her four or five feet nearer the ſhore. In a ſhort ſpace of time the ſtern was beat in by the ſea; and then, having no ſhelter in the cabin, we were obliged to go upon deck, and hang by the ſhrouds, leſt we ſhould be waſhed overboard. In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſituation we remained, till the veſſel was beat ſo high by the waves, that we could venture to walk upon deck. We now perceived that the ſhip's keel was broken, which we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined would occaſion her to go to pieces: this, however, did not happen for the preſent; which I can only attribute to the boards in the hold being ſo interwoven with each other, and frozen together by the ice, as to give a degree of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to the veſſel.</p>
                  <p>Our firſt care now was to get out the boat; which was not be accompliſhed, without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on account of the quantity of ice that was in and about it, and our reduction in number of effective hands by the intoxication of ſeveral of the crew, who had thought that the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:045437_0349_1020013F62F2BB48"/>
method of getting rid of the apprehenſions they laboured under. Our veſſel had, from the violence of the waves daſhing againſt her, broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too, with her broadſide to the wind, ſo that afforded ſome ſhelter for the boat to the leeward. Having, with much labour, cleared the boat of ice, and prepared her for launching, I ordered ſome liquor to be diſtributed to thoſe who were yet ſober, and then aſked, if any were willing to embark with me in the boat, and make the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to gain the ſhore. The ſea running ſo high, that it appeared ſcarcely poſſible for the boat to live in it for a minute, very few were willing to make an experiment ſo full of riſk; ſo that all who offered themſelves, were, the mate and two ſailors, together with my ſervant, and a boy, who was a paſſenger on board. What gave us the greateſt embarraſſment in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, was, the ſurf which broke over us every moment, and the intenſeneſs of the cold, which froze every drop of water immediately, ſo as to cover our clothes with a ſheet of ice. At length we got the boat into the water, and having thrown into it an axe and a ſaw, I leaped in, followed by my ſervant and the mate. The boy followed us, but not ſpringing far enough, fell into the water: he did not, however, ſink im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and we contrived to drag him into the boat, but not without difficulty; our fingers being ſo benumbed with the cold, that we had ſcarcely the power of uſing them: and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident was, in the iſſue, by the chill it gave him. of fatal conſequence to the unfortunate youth. The two ſailors, who had agreed to go with us,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:045437_0350_1020014324D31FC0"/>
next leaped into the boat; and all the reſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ready, notwithſtanding their former heſitation, to follow the example, when I found it neceſſary to ſhove her off from the ſhip's ſide; for, being very ſmall, ſhe certainly would have ſunk, had ſo many perſons crowded in together. The ſhip was lying about forty yards from the ſhore; but, before we got half-way to it, we were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by a wave that almoſt filled the boat, and the next drove us on the dry ſand.</p>
                  <p>To find ourſelves once more ſafe upon the land, gave us no ſmall ſatisfaction, though in ſo deſtitute a ſtate: the joy at having eſcaped thoſe dangers, which ſo long had been the chief objects of our dread, made us, for a few moments, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that we were ſnatched from them, merely to be expoſed to others more inevitable; that we had eſcaped one ſpecies of death, probably to undergo another, more lingering and painful. What moſt affected us, was, the diſtreſs of our companions, whom we had left on board, whoſe lamentations, and cries for help, we could hear very diſtinctly. But it was impoſſible for us, however anxious, to afford them any aſſiſtance. Our boat being beat high upon the ſand, could now be of no uſe, either to us or to them, while the ſea was running to ſuch a degree, that it was not in the power of a human being to relieve them.</p>
                  <p>The night was now approaching, and we had not long remained in this ſituation, ere we found ourſelves getting ſtiff with cold; and the gale continuing as ſevere as ever, we were obliged to made, with extreme difficulty, up to our waiſts
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:045437_0351_10200144AEE02AF8"/>
in ſnow, to the ſhelter of a thick wood, about two hundred and fifty yards from the beach. This afforded ſome relief from the piercing north-weſt wind; yet a fire was ſtill wanting, to warm our frozen limbs, and we had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to kindle one. We had, indeed, taken the precaution to put a tinder-box in the boat, but the water had rendered it totally uſeleſs. Freezing, as we ſtood, there was nothing to be done, but to keep the blood in motion by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: I, therefore, recommended it to the men, to move about, being better acquainted with the nature of cold climates, and that of froſt, than any of my companions. My advice was ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhered to, for about half an hour, when the young paſſenger, whom I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being overcome with the ſeverity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, threw himſelf down, in order to ſleep; for extreme cold always occaſions a ſleepy ſenſation, that is not eaſily to be reſiſted. I uſed my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours, both by perſuaſion and force, to rouſe him, and make him ſtand on his legs, but all to no purpoſe; ſo I was obliged to let him purſue his inclination. After walking about for half an hour longer, during which time, I felt ſuch a ſtrong deſire to ſleep, that I ſhould have lain down myſelf, had I not been aware of the fatal conſequences attending it, I went to the place where the boy lay, and, putting my hand on his face, and finding it quite cold, I obſerved to the mate, who was cloſe by, that I believed he was dead. To which the youth anſwered, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, that he was not yet dead, but would be ſo very ſhortly; and requeſted I would write,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:045437_0352_10200147306C7FE8"/>
if I ſurvived, to his father, at New-York, and inform him of the circumſtances of his ſon's misfortune. In about ten minutes, we found that he had expired, and, as I imagined, without any pain whatever, at leaſt without any acute ſenſation of it. Theſe trivial matters would be unworthy of notice, but as they ſerve to ſhew the effect of intenſe cold on the human body, and to prove, that freezing to death, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with ſo much pain as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>The death of the boy could not deter the reſt of my fellow-ſufferers from giving way to this drowſy ſenſation; and three of them lay down, in ſpite of my repeated exhortations to the contrary. Finding it impoſſible to keep them on their legs, I broke a branch, and, deſiring the mate to do the ſame, our employment, during the remainder of the night, was to prevent them from ſleeping, by beating them continually with the branches. This was an exerciſe uſeful to ourſelves, at the ſame time that it preſerved the lives of our companions. The day-light, which we looked for with ſuch anxious expectation, at length appeared, when I deſired the men to pull down their ſtockings, and let me examine their legs, as they obſerved they had no feeling in them. As ſoon as I caſt my eyes on them, I perceived, very clearly, that they were frozen, at leaſt, half way up; and deſired they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rub them with ſnow, which they did for a conſiderable time, but to little purpoſe; for it was impoſſible to reſtore them to their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:045437_0353_10200148DFD202E8"/>
I then went with the mate, down to the beach, to ſee if we could diſcover any traces of the ſhip, and our companions, whom we had left on board, and, to our great ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction, found ſhe had not yet gone to pieces, though the wind continued with unabated ſeverity. My firſt ſtudy, now, was, how to get them aſhore, our own ſafety, as well as their's, depending on it. I was almoſt ſtiff with cold, but found feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every part, and was therefore certain I could not be frozen. What ſeemed greatly to facilitate the undertaking, was, that the veſſel had, by this time, beat much nigher the ſhore, ſo that the diſtance was but very ſmall at low water. It was high flood, when we arrived on the beach; we were therefore obliged to wait till the tide was out, when we adviſed the people on board, to faſten a rope to the jib-boom, by which they might ſwing themſelves, one by one, toward the ſhore. They accordingly adopted this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and, by watching the motion of the ſea, and ſeizing the opportunity of ſwinging themſelves, as the waves retired, they all got ſafe on the land, except a carpenter, who was a paſſenger in the veſſel. He did not think proper to venture, in this manner, or was unable, having, the night before, made rather too free with the bottle. We were happy, however, to get ſo many of them on ſhore, every one of whom, a few hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we concluded muſt have periſhed.</p>
                  <p>The captain had, fortunately, before he left the ſhip, put ſome materials for ſtriking a light, in his pocket. We therefore went to work in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:045437_0354_1020014C65363EC0"/>
cutting wood, and gathering the branches that lay ſcattered upon the ground, of which we made a fire, with all poſſible expedition, and were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, for ſome time, in hovering about it, and warming our benumbed limbs. Conſidering the extreme cold we had endured for ſuch a length of time, no luxury could be equal to that of the fire; but this gratification was, like many others, to ſeveral of my companions, followed by the moſt excruciating pain, as ſoon as their frozen parts began to thaw. Several of thoſe who had remained all night in the veſſel, as well as thoſe who came aſhore with me in the boat, had been frozen in different parts of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The diſtreſs that was now painted in the faces of theſe unfortunate men, from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they underwent, was beyond expreſſion: this I knew would be the caſe, before I heard them complain; but, as there was no remedy, did not think it neceſſary to give them any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it.</p>
                  <p>When we came to examine into our numbers, I obſerved that a Captain Green, a paſſenger, was miſſing; and was informed, that he had fallen aſleep on board the veſſel, and had been frozen to death. We were rather uneaſy about the man who ſtill remained on board, yet had ſome hopes of ſaving his life, in caſe the ſhip did not go to pieces, at the return of low water: but it being too difficult to undertake in the night, we were under the neceſſity of waiting till the following day. This night we paſſed a little better than the laſt; yet, notwithſtanding we had a good fire, we found extreme inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:045437_0355_1020015012373158"/>
from the total want of covering, as well as from hunger, a new miſery, that we had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been unacquainted with. Beſides which, the greateſt part of our number were in the moſt wretched ſtate imaginable, from the ſores occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the froſt.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, as many of us as were able, went to the beach, to contrive ſome means to extricate the carpenter, whoſe voice we heard on board the veſſel. The ſea ſtill running with the ſame violence as before, we could not put out the boat to his aſſiſtance, and were, therefore, obliged to wait the return of low water, when we perſuaded him to come on ſhore in the ſame manner as the others had done; but this he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with much difficulty, being very weak, and frozen in different parts of his limbs. We ſtill remained without any kind of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and began to be reduced in ſtrength, for want of nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>The 7th and 8th, the gale continued as boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous as ever; and, in the night, between the 8th and 9th of December, the ſhip went to pieces, from the ſtern to the main-maſt, from the extreme violence with which the ſea broke againſt her. By this part of her going to pieces, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome proviſions, which waſhed on ſhore, <abbr>viz.</abbr> ſome pieces of ſalt beef, likewiſe ſome freſh meat, that hung over the ſtern, and a quantity of onions, that the captain had on board for ſale. This relief was very ſeaſonable, it being now the fourth day ſince we had eaten any kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion whatever. Having no utenſils, we dreſſed our meat in the beſt manner we could, and made
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:045437_0356_102001519BF902C0"/>
what we thought a moſt delicious repaſt. The ſenſe of hunger being aſſuaged, we ſet to work in collecting all the proviſions we could find ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the beach, being apprehenſive that we ſhould not ſoon get a ſupply from any other quarter. This done, our next care was to get ourſelves under cover, and form ſome kind of ſhelter from the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing blaſt. This taſk was not an eaſy one, ſo many of our company being unable to move, and of the remainder, none but the mate and myſelf capable of any active exertion, being all more or leſs bitten by the froſt; and our number reduced to ſeventeen, by the loſs of two perſons, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. A quantity of deals had float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſhore from the wreck: of theſe we carried about two hundred and fifty into the wood, and by ten at night completed a kind of houſe, about twenty feet long and ten wide; which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the following manner. We cut two poles of the abovementioned length, and, having no nails, tied them at a proper height on the outſide of two trees, at the diſtance of twenty feet from each other: the interval between the poles, which was equal to the breadth of the trees, ſerved for the ſmoke of our fire to go through; the fire itſelf being laid in an oblong poſition, extending itſelf nearly the whole length of the houſe. Againſt theſe croſs poles we placed boards with a ſlope of about ſixty degrees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ground, which conſtituted the two principal ſides. The two other ſides were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of boards placed perpendicular, the trunks of the trees being taken in, and forming part of each ſide, on one of theſe ſides, that looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:045437_0357_102001548223E9A0"/>
the ſouth-eaſt, we left a vacancy for the entrance.</p>
                  <p>This buſineſs being over, we examined the quantity of proviſions we had collected, and had the ſatisfaction to find that we had in ſtore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three hundred pounds of ſalt beef, and a conſiderable ſtock of onions. As to bread, we had none; for, when the veſſel went to pieces, the caſks were ſtove, and the bread loſt. Economy and good management, were now highly neceſſary, to make our little ſtock laſt as long as poſſible, it being quite uncertain when we could get any relief; and, in conſequence, it was determined, that each man, whether ſick or well, ſhould be confined to a quarter of a pound of beef, and four onions per day, as long as the latter ſhould laſt. This wretched allowance, but juſt enough to keep a man from ſtarving, was the utmoſt we thought it prudent to afford ourſelves, leſt we ſhould be in an uninhabited country; for as yet, we were rather uncertain on what coaſt we were caſt away; though afterwards, on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring circumſtances, we concluded it muſt be on the iſland of Cape Breton.</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of December, being the ſixth day after we landed, the gale abated, and gave us an opportunity to launch our boat, and get on board what remained of the veſſel. Three of us accordingly embarked, having, with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, launched the boat, and cleared her of the ſand and ice. As ſoon as we got on board the wreck, we went to work at opening the hatches, and having but one axe, and the cables being fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen over them in a ſolid lump of ice, it took the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:045437_0358_1020015701D29D20"/>
whole day to accompliſh it. The next day, the weather being ſtill moderate, we went again on board, and having cleared away the remainder of the cable, we cut up part of the deck, in order to make room to get out two caſks of onions, with a ſmall barrel of beef, containing about one hundred and twenty pounds, and three barrels of apples, ſhipped by a Jewiſh merchant, of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec. We like wiſe found a quarter caſk of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes, a bottle of oil, which proved very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the men's ſores, another axe, a large iron pot, two camp-kettles, and about twelve pounds of tallow candles. With much difficulty we got this great ſupply on ſhore. On the 13th, we made it our buſineſs to get our proviſions ſtowed away in a corner of the hut, when, on opening the apple-caſks, we found their contents, to our great ſurpriſe, converted into bottles of Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an balſam, a more valuable commodity, to be ſure, than apples, but what we could gladly have exchanged, in our preſent ſituation, for ſomething more friendly to the ſtomach than to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. This diſappointment, as may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, extorted a few hearty good wiſhes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Jew; yet we found, afterwards, ſome uſe for his Canadian balſam, though ſomewhat different from what he intended it ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to.</p>
                  <p>The conſiderable ſupply we got from on board the wreck, enabled us the next day to add four onions to our daily allowance. We went on board once more on the 14th, and cut as much of the ſails as poſſible from the bowſprit, with part of which we covered our hut, and made it

tolerably warm and comfortable, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeverity of the weather. By this time the ſores of the men, who had been froſt-bitten, began to mortify, and cauſed their toes, fingers, and other parts of the limbs affected, to rot off, their anguiſh being at the ſame time almoſt into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. The carpenter, who came on ſhore after the others, had loſt the greateſt part of his feet, and on the 14th, at night, became delirious, in which unhappy ſtate he continued, till death releaſed him the following day from his miſerable exiſtence. We covered him with ſnow and branches of trees, having neither ſpade nor pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe to dig a grave for him; nor would it have been poſſible, if we had been provided with them, the ground being in this climate ſo hard frozen during the winter, as to be almoſt impenetrable. Three days after, our ſecond mate died in the ſame manner, having been delirious ſome hours before he expired. We felt but very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at the death of our companions, either on their account or our own: for, in the firſt place, we conſidered it rather a happineſs than a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, to be deprived of life, in our preſent wretched ſituation, and, in the ſecond, becauſe there became the fewer mouths to conſume our little ſtock of proviſions: indeed, had not ſome paid the debt of nature, we ſhould in the end have been reduced to the ſhocking neceſſity of killing and devouring one another. Though not yet reduced to this neceſſity, our condition was ſo miſerable, that it ſeemed ſcarcely poſſible for any new diſtreſs to make a ſenſible addition to it. Beſides the proſpect of periſhing, through
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:045437_0360_1020015C58369FA8"/>
want, in that deſolate place, and the pain ariſing from a perpetual ſenſe of hunger and cold, the agony that the greateſt part were in, from the ſores occaſioned by the froſt, was beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, while their groans were almoſt equally diſtreſſing to the remainder—but what affected me more than all our other miſeries, was, the quantity of vermin, proceeding from the men's ſores, and continually increaſing, which infeſted us in every part, and rendered us diſguſting even to ourſelves. Several, however, who had been but ſlightly frozen, recovered in a ſhort time, with the loſs of a few toes and fingers; no one having entirely eſcaped the froſt, but myſelf. On the 20th another ſailor died, after having been, like the others, ſome time in a delirium, and was buried, or rather covered, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Our number was now reduced to fourteen perſons; yet we did not think it prudent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the allowance of proviſions, but ſtill kept it at the rate originally fixed on, of a quarter of a pound of beef <hi>per diem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mate and I had frequently gone out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſince we were ſhipwrecked, to try if we could diſcover any traces of inhabitants, but, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, without ſucceſs. About a fortnight after we had fixed ourſelves in the hut, we took the opportunity of a fine day to walk ten or twelve miles up a river, upon the ice, where we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many tracks of mooſe-deer and other animals, ſome of which we might have killed, had we been provided with arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In our progreſs up the river we diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:045437_0361_1020015F1FA4BD10"/>
ſeveral trees cut on one ſide, as we imagined, by an axe, which gave us reaſon to think there might he Indians near at hand. On going up to the place, we could plainly perceive, that there had been ſome there lately, by their wigwam, which ſtill remained with ſome freſh bark about it. We likewiſe found the ſkin of a mooſe-deer hanging acroſs a pole. We travelled a good way further, in hopes of making ſome more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of this nature, but to no purpoſe. It gave us, nevertheleſs, ſome ſatisfaction to find, that we were in a place where inhabitants had been lately, as it was probable they might again return there. In caſe this ſhould happen, I cut a long pole, and ſtuck it in the ice, upon the river; then with my knife, which I always took care to preſerve, as it was the only one among us, cut a piece of bark from a birch tree, and forming it into the ſhape of a hand, with the fore-finger extended, and pointing toward our hut, fixed it on the top of the pole, and took away the mooſe-ſkin, in order that they might perceive that ſome perſons had been on the ſpot ſince they left it, and the route they had taken on their return. We then purſued the way to our habitation, and communicated this agreeable information to our companions, who were not yet able to move about: trifling as the hopes were, which we could in reaſon derive from this diſcovery, yet it gave them conſiderable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Twenty days being elapſed ſince our ſhipwreck, and our proviſions being very much reduced, I began to entertain a ſuſpicion, that there was ſome foul play during my abſence at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:045437_0362_10200160B0CF4128"/>
different times from the hut, in ſearch of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. I was therefore determined to find out the truth, if poſſible, by keeping a conſtant watch at night; by which means I at length diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the depredators were no other than the captain and two ſailors, who had conſumed no leſs than ſeventy pounds, beſides a quantity of onions, in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time. To prevent ſuch unfair practices for the future, the mate and I never went out together, one of us conſtantly remaining in the hut.</p>
                  <p>We continued in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe, from our laſt diſcovery, for ſome days, when giving up, at length, all hopes of ſeeing any Indians or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in this place, having proviſions only for ſix weeks longer, and a few of our men, together with the captain, being recovered, I propoſed leaving our habitation, with as many as could work in the boat, in ſearch of inhabitants. This propoſal was unanimouſly aſſented to; but when we came to think how it was to be put in execution, a new difficulty ſtarted itſelf, namely, that of repairing the boat, which had been beat in ſuch a manner by the ſea upon the beach, that every ſeam was open. We firſt attempted to ſtop them with dry oakum, but ſoon found that it would not anſwer the intended purpoſe, and having ſaved no pitch from on board the wreck, we began to deſpair of the poſſibility of repairing them. I, at length, thought of making a kind of ſuccedaneum for pitch, of the Canadian balſam, which, as I before mentioned, had been ſhipped f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r apples, and had been by us brought on ſhore under that deception. We accordingly went to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:045437_0363_1020016516D39120"/>
work in making the experiment, and boiled a quantity of the balſam in the iron kettle we had ſaved, and frequently taking it off the fire to cool, we ſoon brought it to a proper conſiſtence. A ſufficient quantity of it being prepared, we turned up the boat, and having cleaned her bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, gave her a coat of the balſam, which effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſtopped up all crevices for the preſent. This done, we got a ſmall ſail rigged to a maſt, which ſhipped and unſhipped occaſionally; and then pitched upon the perſons who were to go with me in the boat.</p>
                  <p>By the 1ſt of January, with much difficulty and fatigue, we got our boat in tolerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that ſhe could ſwim, without making much water; likewiſe our maſt and ſail rigged, in caſe we ſhould happen to get a fair wind, which we could not often expect on this coaſt, at the preſent ſeaſon of the year; for, during the winter months, it blows almoſt conſtantly from weſt to north-weſt, which is immediately on the land. We could not expect, therefore, to have much occaſion for our ſail; nevertheleſs, it might ſometimes be ſerviceable, and afford ſome relief to the rowers. We had agreed to take ſix in the boat, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the captain and mate, two ſailors, myſelf and ſervant: of the others, none were ſo far recovered as to be judged equal to the fatigues we might expect in this expedition. Our ſhoes being all nearly worn out, my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, during the whole of the next day, was, to make a kind of mowkiſins, or Indian ſhoes, of canvaſs. My needle was nothing more than the handle of a pewter ſpoon, which I had
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:045437_0364_1020016793673578"/>
faſhioned, as well as I could, for the purpoſe, and the ſame canvaſs ſupplied me with thread. As ſoon as I had made twelve pair, which was two for each man in our party, we divided the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that remained, into fourteen equal parts, which amounted only to a quarter of a pound of beef <hi>per</hi> day, for ſix weeks; thoſe who were to ſtay behind, ſharing as much as we who were to go in the boat, notwithſtanding the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue which we had every reaſon to expect. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary preliminary being adjuſted, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſetting off the next day; but the wind blowing freſh at north-weſt, were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main where we were, till the fourth. By this time, the ice, floating in prodigious quantities on the coaſt, and in ſome places collecting, and blocking up the bays, rendered our undertaking extremely hazardous; yet we thought it more adviſeable, to face any danger, and to encounter any hardſhip, than to remain in our preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, with a certainty of ſtarving.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon of the 4th, the wind moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, we got our proviſions, and whatever little matters might be of ſervice to us, into the boat; and, having taken leave of our companions, ſat off on our expedition. Having got about eight miles from the place of our ſhipwreck, the wind began to increaſe, and blow very hard at ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, which was immediately off the ſhore. The boat, as well as the oars, being none of the beſt, we were on the point of being blown out to ſea, but by dint of rowing, made ſhift to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep bay, about a mile a-head, where we
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:045437_0365_102001691C7F5960"/>
thought we might paſs the night with ſafety. Having got every thing on ſhore, we hauled our boat up as high as our ſtrength would permit, ſo as to prevent the ſea from doing her any more damage. This done, we ſet to work in lighting our fire, and cutting our wood for the night: we likewiſe cut ſome pine-branches, the ſmaller of which ſerved us to lie on, and the larger, in the form of a wigwam, to ſhelter us from the inclemency of the weather.</p>
                  <p>The place we had landed on, was a fine ſandy beach, with little or no ſnow on it. Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome ſmall pieces of wood caſt on ſhore by the tide, that had formerly been cut with an axe, and a number of long poles ſcattered along the edge of the bank, which had likewiſe been cut in the ſame manner, I thought it likely there might be ſome inhabitants near at hand; and propoſed, as ſoon as we had taken a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, to go along the beach to a high point of land, at about two miles diſtance, which was clear of wood, and appeared to be cultivated; thinking from thence we might make ſome uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcoveries. I accordingly ſat out, ſoon after, with two of the men; and, before we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a mile, ſaw the remains of a ſhallop, or Newfoundland fiſhing-boat, almoſt covered with ſand, which ſeemed to have been ſet on fire. This gave us hopes of diſcovering ſomething elſe to our ſatisfaction, and we proceeded, as faſt as we could, to the point of land. Having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the top of it, we deſcried, to our inexpreſſible joy, a few houſes, about half a mile diſtant, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which we directed our courſe, having no
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:045437_0366_1020016CC0633288"/>
doubt but that we ſhould now meet with ſome relief; but, on coming up to them, found they were only the remains of ſome old ſtore-houſes, which had been built there for the curing of cod-fiſh; and, to all appearance, had been aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſome years before.</p>
                  <p>This was a mortifying diſappointment to us. We determined, however, to make the moſt of our diſcovery; and, obſerving a number of old caſks lying about, in different parts, we ſearched them, as well as the houſes, very minutely, in hopes of finding ſome proviſions; but to no purpoſe. As we walked along the point, we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about a quart of cranberries, ſome of which we are, preſerving the remainder for our companions. Having reconnoitred every part of this point, without any further ſucceſs, we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our boat, and communicating the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we made to our companions, gave them their ſhare of the berries we had gathered. Even theſe diſcoveries gave us much ſatisfaction, as they tended to confirm our hopes of finding ſome inhabitants in the courſe of our voyage along the coaſt.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the wind came round to the north-weſt, and blew with ſuch violence, as to prevent us from proceeding on our voyage. It continued ſo for two days, when, happening to get up in the middle of the night, I was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed on obſerving, while the wind continued blowing as hard as ever, that the ſea was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without agitation. I immediately awoke the mate, to inform him of this extraordinary phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon: and going down to the beach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:045437_0367_10202955205534D8"/>
to know the cauſe, we found the ſea all covered with ice, nothing but a large ſheet of it being to be ſeen for leagues around. This was an alarming circumſtance, as it ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all poſſibility of proceeding any farther, and might give us cauſe even to regret having left our habitations; for, though we were ſo near, it was impoſſible to return by land, beſides other impediments, on account of the depth of ſnow, which was impaſſable, unleſs with ſnow-ſhoes.</p>
                  <p>The wind continued to blow from the ſame quarter for two days longer; and at length, on the 9th, it became perfectly calm. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wind came round to the ſouth-eaſt, which was directly off the land, and in a ſhort time blew extremely hard, ſo that by four o'clock in the afternoon, there was not a piece of ice to be ſeen along the coaſt, the whole of it being blown out to ſea. This was a very pleaſing ſight to us, as it gave us a proſpect of being extricated from our preſent dreary ſituation. However, the violence of the wind prevented us from mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the 11th of January, when the weather being moderate, and a fine light breeze blowing along the coaſt, we launched our boat with much difficulty, being greatly reduced in ſtrength, for want of a due degree of nouriſhment. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got round the clear point of the land, we hoiſted our ſail and put before the wind.</p>
                  <p>The weather being very moderate, and little or no ſea running, we made tolerable way, and had not proceeded far, before we deſcried an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely high point, about ſeven leagues a-head,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:045437_0368_10202956A9235F40"/>
with a continued precipice along the coaſt, ſo that it was impoſſible for us to land on any part of it, before we came to that headland. This made it very dangerous to attempt the paſſage; for if the wind ſhould happen to come round to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, we muſt infallibly have periſhed among the rocks. But danger was no longer an object to be conſidered by us; ſo we got out two oars, not being able to uſe any more, as the boat had been ſo much damaged, that two men were conſtantly employed in keeping her clear of water, and, with the aſſiſtance of a fair wind, made the point about eleven o'clock at night; but finding no place that we could poſſibly land on, we were obliged to keep along the coaſt till two in the morning, when the wind increaſing, and a ſtony beach appearing, on which we ſhould not have thought it expedient to land, had the wind been moderate, we were obliged to put aſhore, and immediately got our proviſions out of the boat. The beach was of ſome height from the ſurface of the water, the ſea having beat the gravel up into a kind of bank; which rendered it impoſſible for us to haul our boat up. We were therefore obliged to leave her to the mercy of the ſea.</p>
                  <p>The place where we landed, was a beach of about four hundred yards in length, bounded at the diſtance of about fifty yards from the water's edge, by a precipice of at leaſt one hundred feet in height, which incloſed it on all ſides. If the wind ſhould come round to the north-weſt, we knew that we ſhould be entirely deprived of ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet, as it blew too freſh for us to attempt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:045437_0369_102029599D045070"/>
putting to ſea again, we were obliged to remain there, notwithſtanding theſe inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th the wind came round to the north-weſt, and blowing very hard, the ſea beat with ſuch violence againſt the ſhore, as to drive our boat twenty yards higher than ſhe was, and to beat ſeveral holes in her bottom. Now was the time for us to feel all the miſeries of our preſent ſituation; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, being ſurrounded by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, which prevented us from ſheltering our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the woods, and having ſo little covering, and no firing, but what we collected from ſome pieces of timber, which floated accidentally upon the ſhore, we could but juſt keep ourſelves from abſolute freezing. The ſame weather continued for eight days, with a prodigious fall of ſnow, a circumſtance that added to our other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. At length, on the 21ſt, the weather became more moderate, and the ſnow ceaſed, having in the courſe of this laſt week, fallen to the depth of three feet, perpendicular. This gave us an opportunity of cooking our proviſions, which we had done but once, ſince our landing. Even this was a great loſs to us, as the water that the meat was boiled in, afforded us almoſt as much nouriſhment, as the meat itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Next day we contrived, with much labour, to turn our boat half way over, in order to examine the damage ſhe had received, which we found conſiderable; the coat of balſam being entirely rubbed off, and ſeveral holes made in her bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. We expected the ice would go to ſea, as it had done once before, whenever the wind ſhould come round to the ſouthward; and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:045437_0370_1020295C8B7CA898"/>
therefore thought, if we could but get our boat repaired, that we might ſtill have ſome chance of meeting with inhabitants. But the great difficulty was, how to repair it; for we had no pitch or balſam left, and but little dry oakum, which was of no ſervice to us, without the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. After trying various methods, we at laſt gave it up as a thing entirely impracticable, and began to turn our thoughts toward ſome other means, of getting out of this bleak and barren place, to ſearch for relief, in an uninhabited country.</p>
                  <p>Though it was impoſſible for us, to climb the precipice, by which we were encompaſſed, yet, if we were determined to abandon our boat, we imagined, that we might eaſily get into the woods, by walking along ſhore upon the ice, which ſtill covered the ſea, and had ſtrength ſufficient to bear any weight. In fact, the mate and I, propoſed walking a few miles on it, in order to make the experiment. We accordingly ſat out, and had not proceeded far, before we came to the entrance of a river, and a fine ſandy beach, where, had our good fortune directed us to land, we might have lived more comfortably, and have preſerved our boat. But what was to be done now, that we could get into the woods? We could not think of walking acroſs them, in ſearch of a cultivated country: beſides, that we ſhould be entirely ignorant, how to direct our courſe; the depth of ſnow, which had, by this time, increaſed to ſix feet, in the wood, rendered it impoſſible for us to travel, without ſnow-ſhoes. After conſulting together, we at laſt
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:045437_0371_10202961296ED790"/>
came to a reſolution, of taking, the next day, what proviſions we had, upon our backs, and coaſting along the ice, till we could diſcover ſome inhabitants; expecting, from its preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſtrength, that it would remain for ſome time longer: and the wind having drifted the greateſt part of the ſnow off it, we compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that we ſhould be able to walk about ten miles a day, even in our preſent weak and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced condition.</p>
                  <p>This being fully reſolved, we were to ſet out the morning of the 24th; but on the night preceding it, the wind came round to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, and blew hard, attended with ſnow and rain; ſo that in the morning, as I already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended would be the caſe, that whole ſheet of ice, which the night before looked ſo firm, was demoliſhed, or driven out to ſea. Thus were all our ſchemes fruſtrated—neither ice to walk on, nor boat to carry us through the water; not even a poſſibility of moving from this place, where we were embayed, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by inſurmountable precipices. Thus circumſtanced, we were again obliged to turn our thoughts toward ſome ſcheme for repairing our boat: upon that our only hope depended. We had plenty of oakum to ſtop up the holes and ſeams, but nothing to ſubſtitute in the room of pitch, to prevent the water from penetrating. I at length thought of a plan, which I imagined might have the wiſhed-for effect, namely, that of throwing water over the oakum, and letting it freeze into a cake of ice. As ſoon as day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, I reſolved to put this ſcheme to the teſt,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:045437_0372_101FFC7D312E7FF8"/>
and having cleared the boat of ſnow and gravel, immediately went to work. The men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral made light of my undertaking, and aſſiſted, with much reluctance, thinking that they were throwing away their labour. However, I ſoon convinced them to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, by four o'clock in the afternoon, by continually throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water over the oakum, we froze up every ſeam and hole, in ſuch a manner, that not a drop of water could enter, as long as the weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued freezing, as at preſent.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th of January, the weather being moderate, and a light breeze directly off the ſhore, we got our boat very carefully launched, and ſat off early in the morning from this ill-omened bay. We had the pleaſure to obſerve that the boat made little or no water, ſo that we were enabled to keep our four oars continually at work. As we advanced along the coaſt, we found it ſtill bordered by nothing but barren pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, with every four or five miles perhaps a ſmall ſandy beach.</p>
                  <p>The weather continued very moderate all the day of the 27th, ſo that, by ſix o'clock in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, we computed that we had rowed about twelve miles from where we departed in the morning. This indeed would be but an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent day's work for people in health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, but a great deal for thoſe in our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; not only being extremely weakened and reduced, but the boat itſelf being very heavy and unwieldy, from the quantity of ice in it. We put aſhore about ſix o'clock, upon a ſmall ſandy beach, and, by placing oars under our boat,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:045437_0373_1020296418ABB450"/>
dragged her carefully ſome yards from the water, ſo that ſhe lay very ſafe, while the wind continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it then was. We next cut ſome branches, and having made a fire, ſheltered ourſelves, as well as poſſible, in the wood. Our tinder being nearly conſumed, I was obliged to furniſh a freſh ſupply, by cutting away the back part of my ſhirt, which I had worn ever ſince we left the ſhip.</p>
                  <p>A ſhower of rain, the next day, unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly melted all the ice off our boat: we were, therefore, prevented from going any farther, till a return of the froſt, and had the mortification to loſe the benefit of a fine day, in the courſe of which, we might have proceeded, with a good boat, ſeveral leagues more on our journey. What made the matter worſe, was, that our proviſions were now reduced to two pounds and a half of beef for each man. On the morning of the 29th, the mate having wandered a little diſtance from our fire, returned in haſte to inform me, that he had diſcovered a partridge perched on the bough of a tree, which he thought I might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deviſe ſome method of catching. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went to the place where he had ſeen it, and found it in the ſame ſituation as before. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the bird was very tame, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fourteen feet from the ground, I cut down a long pole, and taking part of the rope-yarn that faſtened my canvaſs ſhoes, made a running loop of it, and fixed it to the end of the pole; then walking ſoftly under the tree, and lifting the pole gently up, I fixed the loop about the partridge's neck, and giving it a ſudden jerk, cloſed the loop,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:045437_0374_10202965A3DCF820"/>
and ſecured the bird. The mate, as well as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as ſoon as I had caught it, laughed very heartily, for the firſt time that either of us had any inclination to ſmile ſince our ſhipwreck. We then went toward the fire with our prize, and boiled it in ſome melted ſnow, together with a little ſalt water, to give the broth a reliſh: hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided it, when dreſſed, into ſix equal parts, and caſt lots for the choice of each, we ſat down to what we found a delicious meal; the only one, excepting the quart of cranberries, for which we were indebted to chance, or providence, ſince we had been caſt upon the iſland.</p>
                  <p>On the afternoon of the 29th, it began to freeze hard, when we took the advantage of the froſt, to ſtop the boat's leaks, as before; and the wind ſtill continuing moderate, we launched her, as ſoon as that buſineſs was completed, and put to ſea. The day being almoſt ſpent, before we ſat off, we could not make above ſeven miles, to a ſandy beach and thick wood, which ſeemed to afford a tolerable ſhelter. In this place we paſſed the night; and the next day, the weather being ſtill favorable, we launched our boat betimes in the morning, in order to get, before night, as far as poſſible on our journey; but we had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded above ſix miles, before the wind freſhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from the ſouth-eaſt, obliged us to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, and haul up our boat.</p>
                  <p>A heavy fall of rain, which continued the whole day, rendered our ſituation extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, and melted again the icy caulking of the boat. We were therefore to conſole our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as we could, in the certainty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:045437_0375_10202968F0C59498"/>
here till the return of the froſt, and mean while, propoſed to reconnoitre, as far as our reduced ſtate would allow us, into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In this, however, we were prevented by the quantity of ſnow which ſtill lay on the ground, and was not yet ſufficiently frozen, to bear our weight, without rackets, or ſnow-ſhoes. Toward the ſpring of the year, in theſe cold climates, they may, for the moſt part, be diſpenſed with, when the ſnow has become more condenſed by its own weight, the influence of the ſun, and the rains, which began to fall at this ſeaſon. The froſt then returning, after the thaw, forms a kind of incruſtation on the ſurface, that will bear a man's weight, without ſinking. Had this ſeaſon been arrived, we ſhould have abandoned our cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy boat, and, taking the little proviſion we ſtill poſſeſſed, have made an attempt to diſcover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by a march into the heart of the country; perhaps it was fortunate we could not attempt it, as in all probability, we ſhould have periſhed in the woods.</p>
                  <p>Not having it in our power to wander toward any other part, we walked along the ſhore as far as we were able, and ſaw nothing that could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract our notice, but ſome ſtumps of trees, from which the trunks might have been cut ſome years before: from this circumſtance, we could collect no very ſanguine hope of being near an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted country. Soon after, the wind coming round to the north-weſt, and bringing the froſt along with it, we were once more enabled to repair our boat, and to prepare for launching it, as ſoon as the wind ſhould abate its violence. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:045437_0376_1020296D5293D818"/>
in ſome degree, on the 1ſt of February, we immediately embarked, and purſued our coaſting voyage; but the ſeverity of the cold having formed a quantity of ice, it was with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme labour that we contrived to get five miles before night, one of our party being employed in breaking the ice with a pole, and clearing it from the bows of the boat.</p>
                  <p>The following day, the wind blowing freſh from the north-weſt quarter, prevented us again from proceeding any farther, till the 3d, when, coming round to the weſt, which is directly along the ſhore, and the moſt favourable that could blow for us, we were enabled to embark, and purſue our voyage. Our boat, notwithſtanding all our diligence in caulking, made now ſo much water, that we were obliged to keep one man conſtantly at work in baling it out with a camp-kettle. The wind, however, was as fair as we could wiſh, and being neither too ſlack nor too violent, we, for ſome time, went at the rate of four miles an hour, with the aſſiſtance of our oars; but ſoon after, the wind increaſing, we laid in our oars, and ran under our ſail alone, at the rate of about five miles an hour.</p>
                  <p>After having run above ſixteen miles, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an exceeding high land, about ſix leagues diſtant, with ſeveral other mountains and large bays between us; and, it being yet early in the day, a fine wind, and no great ſea, we were in hopes, if the wind ſhould not increaſe too much, that we ſhould be able to reach it before night. As we proceeded along the coaſt, we found it in every part high and rocky; which made us very
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:045437_0377_1020297048220800"/>
uneaſy, leſt the wind ſhould riſe, before we could make the head-land. About two o'clock in the afternoon, when we ſuppoſed we were within three leagues of it, we diſcovered an iſland about twenty miles from the main; and, on compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, we concluded that the iſland muſt be that of St. Paul, and the high land, the north point of Cape Breton. The prodigious height of the land, led us into an erroneous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of its diſtance; for, notwithſtanding we had ſuppoſed that we were within three leagues of it, when we firſt diſcovered the iſland of St. Paul, we found, before we reached it, that we had run near five leagues.</p>
                  <p>It was almoſt dark by the time we reached the North Cape; where, finding no place to land, we were obliged to double the Cape, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our journey. The wind now began to freſhen, and we had a heavy ſea from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt to encounter, as ſoon as we came oppoſite to the Cape. After having doubled it, our courſe lay in a very different direction from what it had been in the morning; ſo that we were obliged to ſtrike our ſail, and take to the oars. The wind, at the ſame time, blew ſo hard off the high lands, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty we could keep along the coaſt: had we not been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by a heavy ſwell, that came from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, we muſt certainly have been blown out to ſea.</p>
                  <p>Finding no place to land during the night, we continued rowing as cloſe as we could to the rocks, till about five in the morning; when, hearing the ſea run on the ſhore very long and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:045437_0378_10202971D2BA20E0"/>
heavy, we imagined that we muſt be off a ſandy beach. We accordingly rowed toward the land, and, at the diſtance of fifty yards, for it was yet dark, were able to diſcern a beach at leaſt four miles in length. It was not, however, a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place for us to put in, on account of the ſurf, and a long and heavy ſea that rolled on it; yet being ſo much fatigued with rowing, that we were incapable of proceeding any farther, we were obliged to attempt a landing. This we ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with more eaſe than we looked for, and ſuffered no other inconvenience, but that of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our boat nearly filled with water on the beach. Having landed, our firſt care was to haul up the boat, that ſhe might meet with no further da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from the ſea. We then got into the woods, which lay cloſe to the ſhore; and, as I had taken the precaution to put our tinder-box in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, before we landed, to preſerve it from the water, we contrived to kindle a fire; a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we had much occaſion for, having got wet in landing, and being in ſo weak and reduced a condition, that it was with the greateſt difficulty we could keep ourſelves awake for a few minutes, when before the fire; ſo that we were under the neceſſity of watching in turn, leſt, all being aſleep together, the fire ſhould go out, and we ſhould be frozen to death. Having now time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every circumſtance, and finding, as ſoon as day-light appeared, that the land ſtill continued to have an oppoſite bearing to that on the other ſide of the point, we had no doubt remaining, but that we were upon the north cape of the iſland of Breton, which, together with Cape
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:045437_0379_10202974B9AB0020"/>
Roy, on the iſland of Newfoundland, marks the entrance of the gulph of St. Lawrence.</p>
                  <p>Our proviſions were now entirely conſumed, and having not the moſt diſtant proſpect of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any more, we were ready to abandon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to deſpair. As we were certain of being on an inhabited iſland, we might have flattered ourſelves with the hopes of getting relief, by perſevering in our dilatory progreſs, had we wherewithal to provide for our immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Having weighed the neceſſity of the caſe, and the miſery of periſhing by hunger, I was of opinion, as well as the mate, that it would be moſt adviſeable to ſacrifice one, for the preſervation of the reſt; and that the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per method would be, by caſting lots, which ſhould be the unfortunate victim. But this ſhocking, though prudent, reſolution, we agreed to put off to the laſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>We had not been able to ſecure our boat ſo effectually, but that the ſea had beat her higher up on the beach, and filled her with ſand. We were obliged, therefore, to ſet two of the men to work in clearing her, and afterwards in ſtopping the leaks, as already deſcribed; while the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our party was detached by different routes along the ſhore, to ſee if they could find any kind of proviſion. The mate and myſelf travelled along the ſandy beach, till we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from going any farther, by an inlet of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we were a good deal ſurpriſed, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the tide ebb and flow every ten minutes. We were not, however, at preſent, in a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay much regard to this or any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:045437_0380_102029791D0A5F38"/>
appearance of nature; and ſeeing a great quantity of oyſter-ſhells lying upon the ſhore, we ſearched them diligently, in hopes of finding ſome that were full; but without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. This again made us curſe our deſtiny, that we ſhould have been caſt away on ſo barren and miſerable a country, and in ſuch an unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky time of the year, when we were not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the relief we might have got, at any other ſeaſon, from the natural productions of the earth, but when even the animals, inhabitants of both elements, had retired to their holes and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding places, to ſhield themſelves from the intenſe cold which prevails during the winter, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable climate.</p>
                  <p>We ſtill continued our ſearch, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill ſucceſs we had hitherto experienced, and contrived, at length, to gather about two quarts of hips, or wild roſe-buds, by throwing up the ſnow, and ſearching in different parts of the bank. Having, with this ſorry food, allayed, in ſome degree, the keen ſenſe of hunger, and the wind having become ſomewhat more moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, we got into our boat, and puſhed off, the day being already drawing toward a concluſion. Our progreſs was, however, ſoon impeded by the quantity of ice that floated upon the water; which obliged us to put aſhore on another part of the ſame beach. In landing, I had the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to let the tinder-box fall from my boſom into the water, by which means we were unable to kindle a fire; and being exceedingly wet, as was generally the caſe, when we landed, we were, in this place, in a moſt uncomfortable ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:045437_0381_1020297C4E8C03A8"/>
and ſuffered much from the cold. We therefore, thought it beſt to get into our boat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as faſt as poſſible, and return to the ſpot from whence we came, in hopes of finding ſome fire ſtill remaining.</p>
                  <p>It was with the greateſt difficulty we got back, being the whole way under the neceſſity of breaking through the ice, which had, by this time, formed almoſt into a ſolid ſheet. We were very anxious, leſt our fire ſhould mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, have gone out, and thought it a lucky circumſtance, we had not been able to go any farther from it. On our arrival at the place, we had the ſatisfaction to find, it was not totally extinguiſhed: had this been the caſe, we muſt have periſhed in the courſe of the night. The fire being repaired, I cut up the remainder of my ſhirt to make ſome more tinder; and, as the damage it got had nearly proved fatal to us, was reſolved to be more particular in my care of it for the future.</p>
                  <p>On the 8th of February, the wind came round to the ſouth-weſt, which cleared off the ice, and enabled us to leave this place by ten o'clock in the morning. As we proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſhore, we found it was not quite ſo rocky as it had been on the other ſide of the north cape. We were therefore able to land this night, without difficulty, within a large rock, by which we were ſheltered from the wind and ſea. We were here very comfortably ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, in every reſpect, except our want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The next day, the weather continuing moderate, we had again proceeded about eight
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:045437_0382_1020297DD786E360"/>
miles on our journey, when the wind beginning to blow ſo hard as to raiſe a conſiderable ſwell, we were obliged to ſteer to the ſnore; and in landing, had the misfortune to loſe two of our oars, which were waſhed overboard by the ſurf.</p>
                  <p>On the following day, the wind lulled; and we immediately took the advantage of it, to put to ſea. We had now but two oars remaining; which being double-manned, we contrived to get about ſix miles before night. This was a very hard day's work, conſidering our preſent weak condition; for, having been a length of time without taſting any kind of nouriſhment, we were ſo much reduced in ſtrength, that when we got on ſhore, we could ſcarcely walk for fifty yards together.</p>
                  <p>The weather being unfavourable on the 11th, we were under the neceſſity of remaining the whole day in the ſame reſting-place; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leiſure to ſearch about the ſhore, we were fortunate enough to find a few roſe-buds, which we eſteemed at preſent a great delicacy. Had we not met with this ſupply, it would have been abſolutely requiſite to put our beforementioned ſcheme into execution. We thought ourſelves extremely unlucky, in not having found, in the courſe of our wanderings, ſo much as the body of any dead animal: nor, except the partridge, did we ſee any live one, that we had the ſmalleſt chance of capturing. At different times, we had hopes of catching ſome of the others that we frequently ſaw on the ice, particularly on the ſmall rivers and inlets: but we never found them at any diſtance from the holes, which they
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:045437_0383_102029810079A888"/>
continually kept open, to give themſelves a free paſſage in and out of the water. We likewiſe diſcovered, at different times, ſome beaver's houſes; but could not inſnare any of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th, the wind became moderate, and we proceeded, once more, on our journey. The coaſt ſeemed to diminiſh in height as we paſſed along it, which made us hope we were now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the cultivated part of the iſland. Next day the weather got milder, with a fall of rain: ſo that it was with difficulty we could get our boat to ſwim, the ice thawing gradually off the bottom. This obliged us to put aſhore long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night; and when we had landed, and made a fire, we found no other immediate want but that of proviſions, having conſumed all the hips or roſe-buds that we had gathered at our laſt landing-place.</p>
                  <p>Having reconnoitred, very carefully, all around, and ſearched in every part under the ſnow, we were not able to procure ourſelves even that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſuſtenance. Being now driven to the laſt extremity, we were obliged to ſacrifice our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of travelling any farther, to the immediate preſervation of our lives. About a dozen tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low candles remained, which we had hitherto employed in ſtopping the leaks of our boat, as faſt as ſhe ſprung one in any particular place. Of theſe we divided a ſmall part among us; which gave us ſome relief for the preſent. The two following days we coaſted for a few miles, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a place where we could meet with ſome hips; but our ſearch proved ineffectual. This
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:045437_0384_1020298550C7F5A0"/>
was the only kind of food we could now expect; and had we diſcovered any place that abounded with them, it was our intention to draw up the boat there, and remain till they were conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>We began now to be fully ſenſible of our deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſituation, and to expect that our fate would be that of periſhing with hunger. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that idea was horrid enough, yet, what gave me the moſt uneaſineſs, was, that my friends would probably forever remain uninformed of our wretched cataſtrophe. It may appear to thoſe, who have not been in ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that this would take up but a ſmall part of one's reflection, in compariſon with the dread of ſuch a death; yet, however it might have been with the reſt of my companions, it was that idea that chiefly preyed upon my ſpirits. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent it, as far as poſſible, I took every occaſion of cutting out my name on the bark of the largeſt trees. The fatigue of cutting it, as well as the preſervation of my knife, which I obſerved before, was the only one among us, would not allow me to be more particular. But on the walls of the ſtore-houſes, which we had diſcovered in the beginning of our progreſs, I wrote a ſhort account of our diſaſters in Engliſh and French, and requeſted, if any perſon ſhould fall in with it, that they would tranſmit it to my father at Quebec.</p>
                  <p>On the 17th, we made another diviſion of a part of the tallow candles that yet remained; and on the following day, the wind being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, we proceeded about five miles: where,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:045437_0385_1020298847E30330"/>
finding a flat country, and a ſandy beach, that extended for a conſiderable way, and being ſo much debilitated, that we knew it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to go much farther, we put on ſhore, with a determined reſolution to periſh on this place, unleſs ſome unforeſeen accident ſhould bring us relief. To attempt drawing up our boat, would, in our preſent weak condition, be a vain undertaking, ſo we were obliged to leave her, expoſed to the mercy of the ſea. All that we could preſerve was our axe, a ſaw, and the ſail of the boat, which we generally made uſe of as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>covering.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we landed, we made it our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to clear away the ſnow from a particular ſpot in the entrance of the wood, where we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remain; and having cut ſome ſmall branches of pine to lie upon, together with ſome larger to ſerve for a ſhelter, which we ſtuck into the bank of ſnow that ſurrounded us, we made our fire. This done, we all went in ſearch of hips, and had the good fortune to find about a pint of them, which, boiled up with a couple of tallow candles, afforded us a tolerable meal.</p>
                  <p>The next day we paſſed without any kind of proviſions, and being apprehenſive that our little remaining ſtrength would ſoon deſert us, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ourſelves in cutting and piling as much wood as we were able, to ſupply the fire. Mean while, the waves had beat our boat ſo high upon the beach, as to be quite dry as ſoon as the wind ſubſided, and to deprive us of the power of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſea again: had we been diſpoſed to do it:
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:045437_0386_101FFC7A52A354F0"/>
for our ſtrength was by no means equal to the taſk of moving her a ſingle foot.</p>
                  <p>We again employed the whole day of the 19th in ſearch of hips; but it was not attended with any ſucceſs. Our tallow candles were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the only reſource we had left, and by this time they became reduced to two. We found ourſelves ſo much weakened the following day, that we could make no further uſe of our axe, and were under the neceſſity of creeping about in our turns, to gather for our fire the rotten branches of trees, that lay ſcattered upon the ground. As we had not a proper quantity of fuel, the fire that we kept up was but juſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preſerve us from freezing: for, though the ſeaſon was ſo far advanced toward the ſpring, yet, excepting ſome particular days, the weather was as cold as in the month of December.</p>
                  <p>Having now no more than two tallow candles remaining, and finding no longer a poſſibility of gathering any hips, being too weak even to ſearch for them, we thought it likely that we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive ſome degree of nouriſhment from the kelp-weed, of which there was a quantity lying upon the ſhore. We accordingly collected a little of it, and with melted ſnow boiled it for a few hours in a kettle; but, at the concluſion, found it very little tenderer than at firſt. We then melted one of our tallow candles in the liquor, and having ſupped it up, and eat a quantity of the weed, our appetite became ſomewhat ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but in about two hours time, we were all affected with a very uneaſy ſenſation, and were ſoon after ſeized with a fit of vomiting, without
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:045437_0387_1020298CC346D248"/>
being able to bring the offending matter entirely off the ſtomach. This fit of vomiting having continued for about four hours, we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tolerably eaſy, but, at the ſame time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly exhauſted.</p>
                  <p>On the 22d we made uſe of ſome more kelp-weed and our laſt tallow candle. It ſtill opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame manner, but not to ſo violent a degree as it had done before. The next day the wind blew very moderate from the north-weſt, and brought a ſevere froſt along with it. We had now an opportunity to repair our boat; and, if our ſtrength had been ſufficient to launch into the water, we ſhould have changed our reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have quitted the place. We made, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a faint attempt to launch the boat; but, on finding that we could not move her an inch from where ſhe lay upon the ſhore, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to give over the deſign. Our candles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all conſumed, we were under the neceſſity of boiling the kelp-weed, without the mixture of tallow, which, however nauſeous at any other time, afforded us, then, not only ſome kind of nouriſhment, but even an exquiſite reliſh.</p>
                  <p>Having, for three days, taſted no other food but the kelp-weed, we began to ſwell to an alarming degree. This we were at a loſs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attribute to the kelp-weed, or to the cold (for we were not able to keep a ſufficient fire): however, I thought then, and do ſtill believe, that it proceeded from the former; for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we had often before been expoſed to the utmoſt ſeverity of the froſt, and ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhelter whatever, yet we had never found
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:045437_0388_102029911FDF0308"/>
ourſelves affected with this extraordinary ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; but, on the contrary, were as much redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in bulk as we were in ſtrength: whereas in a few days, the ſwelling had increaſed to ſuch a degree all over our bodies, that, notwithſtanding the little fleſh we had upon our bones, we could ſink our fingers two inches deep on the ſkin; the impreſſion of which remained viſible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hour after. Hunger, nevertheleſs, ſtill obliged us to make uſe of the kelp-weed. I have never ſince conſulted with any naturaliſt or phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician about the extraordinary effects of this weed; yet doubt not but they may be accounted for from natural cauſes.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed a few days more in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; at the expiration of which, we were ſo much ſwollen, as to be almoſt deprived of our ſight, and ſo reduced in ſtrength, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty we could keep our fire in by crawling about in turn, and breaking the rotten branches that lay ſcattered upon the ſnow. The time was now arrived, when I thought it highly expedient to put the plan beforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into execution; but, on feeling the pulſe of my companions, found, that ſome of them were rather averſe to the propoſal; the deſire of life ſtill prevailing above every other ſentiment, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the wretched condition they were in, and the impoſſibility even of preſerving it by any other method.</p>
                  <p>I thought it an extraordinary inſtance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation, that men ſhould prefer the certainty of a lingering and miſerable death, to the diſtant chance of one more immediate and leſs painful.

However, on conſulting with the mate, what was to be done, I found, that, though they objected to the propoſal of caſting lots which ſhould be the victim, yet, all concurred, in the neceſſity of ſome one being ſacrificed for the preſervation of the reſt. The only queſtion was, how it ſhould be determined; when, by a kind of reaſoning more agreeable to the dictates of ſelf-love than of juſtice, it was agreed on, that, as the captain was now ſo exceedingly reduced, as to be evidently the firſt who would ſink under our preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated miſery; as he had been the perſon to whom we conſidered ourſelves, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, indebted for all our misfortunes; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he had, ever ſince our ſhipwreck, been the moſt remiſs in his exertions towards the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good, he was, undoubtedly, the perſon who ſhould be the firſt ſacrificed.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, that I thought, at that time, there was ſome colour of truth in this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet, I was not a little ſhocked at the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's intended fate, although I had more reaſon than any one elſe to be incenſed againſt him, not only on account of his neglect of duty, and his mal-practices at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut in purloining our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but for another reaſon likewiſe. After our ſhipwreck, I had diſcovered, by ſome papers, which had been waſhed on ſhore, that, though the captain's pretended deſtination was to New-York, yet his real one was to the Weſt-Indies, if he could poſſibly effect it Thus would he have baffled General Haldimand's intentions, in ſending me with diſpatches, that might be of the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:045437_0390_10202995A7017558"/>
firſt conſequence to this country; and not only have diſappointed, but alſo have defrauded me of the money which I paid him for my paſſage.</p>
                  <p>The determination now made, was kept ſecret from the captain; and it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to live many days longer, without putting it into execution, had we not happily met with relief from a quarter whence we little expected it. On the 28th of February, as we were all lying about our fire, we thought that we heard the ſound of human voices in the woods; and ſoon after diſcovered two Indians, with guns in their hands, who did not ſeem yet to have perceived us. This ſight gave us freſh ſtrength and ſpirits: ſo, getting up, we advanced towards them with the greateſt eagerneſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we were perceived by the Indians, they ſtarted back, and ſeemed fixed for a few moments to the ground with ſurpriſe and horror. This, indeed, is not to be wondered at, when it is conſidered, that, beſides the amazement they muſt naturally have felt, on ſuddenly meeting with white men in this uninhabited part of the iſland, our appearance itſelf, was enough to alarm the moſt intrepid: our cloaths being almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely burnt off, ſo that we were bare in ſeveral parts of our bodies, our limbs ſwollen to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious bulk, our eyes, from the ſame cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inviſible, and our hair in a confuſed and diſhevelled ſtate about our heads and ſhoulders, particularly of thoſe who wore it long; for we had not been able to comb it ſince our ſhipwreck. As we advanced toward the Indians, ſome of us
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:045437_0391_1020299893893880"/>
wept, while others laughed through joy. Being a little recovered from their ſurpriſe, they did not ſhew much inclination to accoſt us, till I got up to one of them, and took him by the hand; when he ſhook it for ſome time very heartily; the uſual mode of ſalutation among the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p>They began, at length, to ſhew marks of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion at our diſtreſſed appearance; and I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, their ſhyneſs at firſt proceeded from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance which it naturally inſpired: for, theſe Indians being converted to Chriſtianity, I will not attribute it to a motive ſo contrary to that doctrine, as the idea of the trouble they might expect, without any compenſation, in relieving us. They then walked with us to our fire, and, ſitting down by it together, one of them, who could ſpeak a little broken French, deſired we would inform him whence we came, and the particulars of the accident that brought us there. I accordingly gave him as conciſe an account as poſſible, of the diſaſters and fatigues we had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone: during the relation, he ſeemed to be very much affected at our ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Having finiſhed my narration, I aſked the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, if he could furniſh us with any kind of proviſions: to which he anſwered in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative. Obſerving that we had very little fire, he ſuddenly ſtarted up, and took our axe in his hand; when, looking at it, and laughing hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſuppoſe at the badneſs of it, he threw it down again, and taking his tomahawk from his ſide, which is a ſmall hatchet that the Indians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carry about them, he went, and, in a ſhort
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:045437_0392_10202AA2CB0D9AE8"/>
time, cut a quantity of wood, which he brought, and threw upon our fire. This done, he took up his gun, and, without ſaying a word, went off with his companion.</p>
                  <p>This would have been a very alarming cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to perſons ignorant of the Indian manners; but I was ſo well acquainted with the humour of theſe people, who ſeldom ſpeak when there is not an abſolute occaſion for it, that I doubted not, but they were gone for ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that we ſhould ſee them again very ſhortly. Notwithſtanding the length of time we had been without nouriſhment, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that I felt but little inclination to eat: the fire which the Indian had made, was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt refreſhment to us, as we had been many days without a good one.</p>
                  <p>After about three days had elapſed, during which interval, ſome of our party were not without anxiety, leſt the Indians ſhould never return, we perceived them coming round a point, at a ſmall diſtance, in a bark canoe. Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and landed upon the beach, they took out of their canoe ſome ſmoked veniſon, and a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſeal oil; which they brought up to our fire-place: having put ſome of the meat into our kettle, they boiled it in melted ſnow; and then gave each of us a very ſmall quantity of it, together with ſome oil. I knew very well their reaſon for being ſo ſparing of their meat; for, eating a quantity of groſs food in our preſent ſtate, might be attended with the moſt fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. It gave me no ſmall pleaſure to find that the Indians were ſo careful of us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="unknown:045437_0393_101FFC8F0F40F7E0"/>
This light repaſt being ended, the Indians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired three of us to embark in their canoe, that being all ſhe could carry at a time, and proceed from this place to their hut, which lay five miles farther by water, and about a mile from the ſhore, in the middle of the woods. We were received at the ſea ſide by three other Indians, and about twelve or fourteen women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who had been there waiting our arrival. Having landed from the canoe, we were conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe laſt to their habitation in the wood, which conſiſted of three huts or wigwams, there being that number of families among them: meanwhile, the ſame two Indians who had brought us, went back in their canoe for the three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining men of our party. On arriving at the but, we were treated, with the greateſt humanity by theſe people; they gave us ſome broth to ſup, but would not ſuffer us to eat meat, or any kind of ſubſtantial food whatever.</p>
                  <p>The two Indians being come back with our companions, and having all received a tolerable refreſhment I was deſired, at the requeſt of a very old woman, who appeared to be miſtreſs or mother of the families preſent, to give them an account of our tranſactions ſince the day of our ſhipwreck. I accordingly gave a more particular account, than I had done before in French to the Indian, whom I have already mentioned; and he explained it in his own language to the other Indians. In the courſe of my relation, I could perceive that the old woman was exceedingly affected, at certain parts of it; which gave me much ſatisfaction, as I thence derived hopes,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:045437_0394_101FFC90AD1C7258"/>
that they would continue, to treat us with the ſame humanity. As ſoon as I had done ſpeaking. the old woman roſe up, and after ſupplying us with ſome more broth, deſired the interpreter to explain to us, the ſhipwreck of the famous French partiſan St. Luc Lacorne, on his paſſage from Canada to France.</p>
                  <p>He informed me, that this gentleman, of whoſe ſhipwreck I had already heard ſomething, was caſt away directly upon the North-Cape; that a great number of perſons, periſhed on the occaſion, amongſt whom, were two of Mr. St. Luc's children, who were drowned in his arms, as he was attempting to carry them on ſhore. He likewiſe informed me, that after his having remained five days there, and ſuffered much from cold and hunger, he himſelf had relieved him, and conducted him to Louiſbourg; for which ſervice, he ſaid, Mr. St. Luc was indebted to him thirty pounds, which he promiſed to remit from Halifax, but had never performed it. Whether this part of the Indian's ſtory be true or not, it is impoſſible for me to determine: the gentleman himſelf, is beſt acquainted with it. But this I am certain of, that the poor Indians muſt have earned the money very dearly, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him ſo far, at the ſeaſon of the year in which the journey was performed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people did every thing in their power, to reduce the ſwelling from our limbs; which they at length accompliſhed, after much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Having provided for our own immediate wants, our thoughts recurred to thoſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate men, whom we had left by the wreck. We
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:045437_0395_101FFC942C7D86C0"/>
were under much anxiety for them, leſt by this time they might have periſhed with hunger. However, in caſe they ſhould be ſtill alive, I was determined, no means ſhould be omitted for their preſervation; and, having deſcribed to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the part of the iſland we were caſt away upon, aſked them, if it was poſſible to go to their relief?</p>
                  <p>From the deſcription I gave the Indians of the ſituation of the river, and of a ſmall iſland that lay nearly oppoſite, they ſaid, that they knew the place perfectly well; that it was above one hundred miles diſtant, through very difficult paths, over rivers and mountains; and that, if they undertook the journey, they muſt expect ſome compenſation for their trouble. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was but reaſonable: for it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that the Indians ſhould leave their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which alone they ſubſiſted their wives and families, to undergo a fatigue of that kind through pure benevolence: and as to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the diſtance, I could eaſily give credit to it, as I knew we had come above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty miles by water. I then informed them, for the firſt time, for in fact it did not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to me before, that I had ſome money, and that, if it would be any object to them, I would pay them for their trouble. They ſeemed much pleaſed when I told them that I had money, and deſired me to let them look at it. Then taking the purſe from my ſervant, I ſhewed them the hundred and eighty guineas that it contained; and obſerving an eagerneſs in their countenances at the ſight of the coin, which I had little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:045437_0396_101FFC97984DA630"/>
among Indians, and that the women, in particular, ſeemed to have taken a ſtrong fancy to it, I preſented them with a guinea each; for which they expreſſed their ſatisfaction, by laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the only method among the ſavages of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing every ſentiment of that nature.</p>
                  <p>However, I was determined, at all events, to ſave the people, if any of them remained alive, though the Indians ſhould be ever ſo exorbitant in their demands; and made an agreement with them, at laſt, that they ſhould ſet off the next day, which was the ſecond of March, and that they ſhould receive twenty-five guineas at their departure, and the ſame ſum on their return. This being adjuſted, they immediately went to work in making a proper number of mawkiſins and ſnow-ſhoes, for themſelves and for the men; and three of them went off the next morning, having received the ſum of money agreed for.</p>
                  <p>After theſe people knew that I had money, my ſituation among them was not near ſo comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as before; for they became as mercenary as they had hitherto been charitable, and exacted above ten times the value, for every little neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they furniſhed for myſelf and the reſt of my companions. Beſides which, I was under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant apprehenſion, leſt they ſhould be incited, by this extraordinary paſſion for money, to plunder us, and leave us in the ſame deſtitute condition in which they found us. The only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, on which I founded my hope of better treatment from them, was their religion: for, as I mentioned before, they were Chriſtians, and rigid Catholics, having been converted by the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:045437_0397_101FFC9920431FF0"/>
French, before we got poſſeſſion of the iſland. But, perhaps, it was this very circumſtance of their communication with Chriſtians, that had inſpired them with that vehement love of money. They ſhewed, indeed, every mark of attachment to their faith, being very aſſiduous at their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both night and morning; and frequently gave us cauſe to wiſh they had not been quite ſo devout, by diſturbing us with their pſalm-ſinging the whole night. I was very much afraid, at times, if they had learnt that tenet of their ſect, of keeping no faith with heretics, that their profeſſion of Chriſtianity would be of little ſervice to us. My ſervant, being an Iriſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic, they were exceedingly fond of him, and heaped their favours upon him very profuſely. He joined them, for the moſt part, in their roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for I cannot, with propriety, call it ſinging, and in their prayers; though he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a word of either. Indeed, I queſtion much whether they themſelves underſtood them, for they were the moſt confuſed jargon I ever heard, compounded of their own and the French lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with the mixture of a few broken Latin phraſes, which they had picked up from their converters, the Jeſuits.</p>
                  <p>Theſe inſular ſavages bore, in general, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act reſemblance, in their perſons and manners, to thoſe on the continent of America. The principal points in which they differed were, in having their hair long, which is peculiar to the women alone among the continental Indians, and in wearing caps and breeches. Their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was very different from that of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:045437_0398_1020299CE47CC260"/>
or tribes, which I was acquainted with; though I doubt not but it might have a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to ſome other upon the continent. I found afterwards, when we got into a part of the iſland where it was to be had, that they had the ſame ſtrong propenſity to ſpirituous liquor, ſo univerſal among the Indians.</p>
                  <p>It was ſome time before we had recovered any degree of ſtrength, or could digeſt any ſubſtantial food: The only kind we could get from the Indians, was the fleſh of mooſe-deer, and ſeal oil; on which they ſubſiſt entirely, during the time of hunting. Notwithſtanding that we found ourſelves, after our late miſeries, pretty comfortably ſituated among thoſe ſavages, yet I was anxious to get away, on account of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches I was charged with, which I thought might be of the utmoſt conſequence to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſervice; particularly, as I knew that the duplicates were loſt. I continued, however, in ſo weak a condition, that it was impoſſible for me to move for ſome time; and found, as well as my fellow ſufferers, that ſuch a ſhock to the conſtitution, was not eaſily to be repaired.</p>
                  <p>After being abſent near a fortnight, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans arrived with three men, who were the only ſurvivors of the eight, who had been left behind at the hut. They were in a very reduced and miſerable condition, and informed me, on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the particulars of their tranſactions from the time we left them, that, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed all the beef, they lived, for ſome days, on the ſkin of the mooſe-deer, which we had left entire, not thinking it worth while to make a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:045437_0399_1020299FDD364D50"/>
partition of it. This being conſumed, three of them died, in a few days, of hunger, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were under the neceſſity of ſubſiſting on the fleſh of the dead men, till they were relieved by the Indians. One of the remaining five was ſo imprudently ravenous, when the Indians came to their aſſiſtance, as to eat ſuch a quantity of meat, that he expired in a few hours, in the greateſt agonies imaginable; and another, ſoon after, ſhot himſelf, accidentally, with one of the Indian's guns. Thus was our number, which originally conſiſted of nineteen perſons, reduced to nine; and I rather wonder, how ſo many perſons could, for the ſpace of three months, go through ſuch complicated diſtreſſes, from exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cold, fatigue, and hunger.</p>
                  <p>We all remained another fortnight among the Indians, during which, I was obliged to pay, as before, a moſt exorbitant price for our diet, and for every neceſſary that we were provided with. By this time, my health being ſomewhat re-eſtabliſhed, and my money, at the ſame time, very much reduced, I was reſolved to poſtpone my own convenience, to the good of the ſervice, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o proceed, as faſt as poſſible, with General Haldimand's diſpatches, though it was now the moſt unfavourable ſeaſon of the year for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. I therefore made an agreement with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, to conduct me to Halifax; for which I was to pay them forty-five pounds, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with proviſions, and all neceſſaries, at every inhabited place, on our way.</p>
                  <p>It was ſettled, that I ſhould depart on the 2d of April, with two Indians, for Halifax, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:045437_0400_102029A167F15F50"/>
by Mr. Winſlow, a young gentleman who had been a paſſenger on board the veſſel, and was one of the three ſurvivors at the hut, together with my own ſervant. The Indians were to conduct the remainder of our party, to a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement on Spaniſh river, about fifty miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, where they were to remain till the ſpring, when an opportunity might offer for them to get by ſea to Halifax. Previouſly to parting, I gave the captain caſh for a bill on his owner at New-York, to provide for the immediate ſubſiſtence of himſelf and the ſailors; which bill was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards proteſted by the owner, on the pretence, that the ſhip being loſt, neither maſter nor crew were entitled to any wages.</p>
                  <p>We accordingly ſat off on the day appointed, each carrying four pair of Indian ſhoes, or maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſins, a pair of ſnow-ſhoes, and proviſions for fifteen days. The ſame day, we got to a place called, by the Engliſh, Broad-Oar, where we were detained, the following day, by a ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorm. On the 4th, we again proceeded through the woods about five leagues; and, on the 5th, arrived at a place named Broad-Deck, which lies at the entrance of a very fine ſalt water lake, called Lake St. Peter. This lake communicates, by a narrow inlet, with the ſea, from which it is diſtant about ſixteen leagues. At this place, we met with two families of Indians, who were hunting there, and purchaſed of them a bark-canoe, for five pounds; the Indians having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that ſome parts of this great lake are never frozen, and that it was requiſite to have a canoe to paſs over thoſe places; and as
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:045437_0401_102029A45659D510"/>
we were to travel over the ice in other parts of it, I was obliged to purchaſe two Indian ſleighs, in which we were to place the canoe, and drag it after us.</p>
                  <p>Having remained two days in this place, and provided ourſelves with a few other neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, we proceeded on the 7th, for a few miles along the lake; but the ice being bad, we were ſoon obliged to take to the wood. A thaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſoon after, with rain, made the ſnow, which lay to the depth of ſix feet in the woods, ſo ſoft and heavy, that we could travel no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on our ſnow-ſhoes, the ſnow ſticking to them in large quantities. We were therefore obliged to make a fire, and remain here; and the thaw continuing for the ſpace of four days, made us very apprehenſive leſt the ice ſhould give way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: for the ſpring was now too far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to travel any longer upon the ſnow, unleſs during a froſt. We ſhould then have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of waiting till the ice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cleared off the lake; which would have taken at leaſt a fortnight or three weeks from the time of its breaking up; in which caſe, we might have been reduced to a condition, equally diſtreſſed, with that we had been in after our ſhipwreck, except that we were provided with arms and ammunition.</p>
                  <p>However, the froſt returned on the 12th, and the next day we ſat off, and travelled about ſix leagues; ſometimes on floating pieces of ice, and at others, in our canoe, where the lake was open. On the 14th, our proviſions being nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, I propoſed going in ſearch of ſome
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:045437_0402_102029A8A4EF0848"/>
game, as the country abounded with deer: for the Indians, in general, never think of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the next day's wants, but eat on, without reflection, whilſt they have a morſel of food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. I accordingly went with one of the Indians into the woods. We had not been three hours on the hunt, before we diſcovered a very fine mooſe-deer; and the Indian ſhot him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hour after. We ſkinned this animal, which weighed about ſix hundred pounds, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves with ſome of the beſt parts of its fleſh, as well as the blood, which the Indian took care to collect, putting it in the bladder of the beaſt: and returned to our canoe. We then ſent the other Indian, Mr. Winſlow, and my ſervant, for ſome more of the meat, of which they brought about an hundred pounds.</p>
                  <p>Being now well ſtocked with proviſions, we had no reaſon to apprehend that we ſhould want, in caſe a return of mild weather ſhould render it impoſſible for us to travel either upon the lake or in the woods. On the 15th, we ſat out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early in the morning, and purſued our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney about ſix leagues, in the ſame manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The greateſt inconvenience that we felt, was the want of bread, which the Indians of this country never make uſe of whilſt they are hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and being now much wearied with travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, our ſtrength having been greatly exhauſted by our paſt fatigues, we agreed to make a halt for a day or two, in the woods. What renders the travelling through the woods, in theſe cold climates, more tolerable than might be ſuppoſed during the winter ſeaſon, is the number of pine-trees,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:045437_0403_102029AA304160D8"/>
and other ever-greens, which are interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in different parts; the branches of which ſerve, not only to lie upon, but alſo as a ſhelter from the ſeverity of the weather. We choſe a ſpot abounding with theſe trees; and it is almoſt inconceivable, in how ſhort a time the Indians made us a comfortable habitation of the boughs, called in their language, a <hi>wigwam.</hi> Their method of conſtructing them is as follows; having choſen the ſpot for their fire, they firſt clear off the ſnow, throwing it up into a bank in a circular form, leaving a vacant ſpace, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to leeward: and it is to be obſerved, that the more ſnow there is on the ground the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it makes the beſt part of the ſhelter. They then cut branches of pines, of a proper length, and placing the thicker ends of them in the bank of ſnow, bend and interweave them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the top. Theſe branches are croſſed by others, and interwoven with ſmaller ones, in ſuch a manner, as to afford a ſufficient ſhelter from the wind, and from the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing ſnow. The fire is made in the middle of the wigwam, and the ſmoke of it goes out by the paſſage to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The wigwams thus made, are very comfortable, even in the coldeſt weather, and are proof againſt any thing but a heavy rain; beſide which, a change of wind is the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience they are liable to.</p>
                  <p>We proceeded again on our journey, on the 18th, and, during that and the following day, travelled ſeveral miles, without meeting with any thing remarkable. I had now leiſure to obſerve the beauties of this lake, which was one of the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:045437_0404_102029AD78328D08"/>
fineſt I ever ſaw in America; though at this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, it could not appear to the beſt advantage. As far as I could judge, it is about twenty leagues in length from north to ſouth, and eight wide from eaſt to weſt. A number of ſmall iſlands are ſcattered about in different parts of it, and give it ſomewhat the appearance of the lake of Killarny, and other freſh-water lakes in Ireland. Theſe iſlands have never been ſettled on: yet appear to be very fruitful, and muſt be a moſt delightful reſidence in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, except for the want of freſh water; which, perhaps, may be the reaſon they have never been inhabited. Had the lake been properly frozen, we might have ſaved ourſelves the trouble of travelling ſeveral leagues, by croſſing over from point to point, and from one iſland to another: but, this not being the caſe, we were obliged to travel round the greateſt part of the bays on one ſide of it.</p>
                  <p>On the 20th, we arrived at a place called St. Peter's, where there are four or five French and Engliſh families ſettled. I was here received very politely, and entertained at the houſe of a Mr. Cavanaugh, a merchant, who was ſo good as to take my draught for two hundred pounds upon my father, though I was a perfect ſtranger to him. To this harbour veſſels of the greateſt burthen can come with ſafety, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fiſhery was formerly carried on here, till, on the breaking out of the preſent war, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican privateers put a ſtop to it. The force of theſe privateers, even taken collectively, is but trifling; and it is much to be regretted, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:045437_0405_102029B1ED0AB360"/>
cannot ſpare a veſſel or two of force, to cruize about here, and protect the fiſheries; which, together with ſome other branches of trade, might be carried on with as much vigour, and much more benefit, than before the war. This Mr. Cavanaugh, but a ſhort time before I arrived, was plundered, to the amount of three thouſand pounds, by two privateers from Boſton; who came in at their leiſure, and took what they wanted out of his ſtores. Theſe American pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers have likewiſe driven all the ſettlers away from Louiſburg, who had alſo ſubſiſted by the fiſhery; and it is ſomewhat remarkable, that this place, which was, during the two laſt wars, ſuch a bone of contention between us and the French, has not, at the preſent moment, ſo much as a ſingle inhabitant.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have taken a ſhallop or fiſhing-boat from this place, and gone to Halifax by ſea, but that there was almoſt a certainty of being taken by ſome privateer along the coaſt. This lake, St. Peter, is but half a mile from the ocean; to which, we were to carry our canoe through the woods, and to proceed, by water, to the gut of Canceau. While the French were in poſſeſſion of the iſland, they had formed a deſign of cutting through this narrow neck of land, and opening a communication on that ſide, between the ocean and the lake, in order to bring in their large ſhips of war, to lie during the winter, in the lake of St. Peter; for there is a ſufficient depth of water in the harbour of St. Peter, for the largeſt ſhips of the line to ride in, though there is not water enough in the inlet, by which the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:045437_0406_102029B37B510730"/>
lake communicates with the ocean, to enable them to paſs up to the harbour.</p>
                  <p>After ſtocking ourſelves, therefore, with as much proviſions, and other neceſſaries, as we had occaſion for, we ſat off, on the 22d, in our bark canoe, and arrived the ſame day at a place called by the French, Grand Grave; where there is a family or two of that nation. The wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, we were obliged to remain here all night; and, on the 23d, proceeded along the coaſt to a ſettlement called Diſcouſſe, where we were detained another day, by ſome floating ice.</p>
                  <p>On the 25th, we got to a place called Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſhoc; where we were as hoſpitably entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as we had been at St. Peter's. I here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed the remains of my regimental coat, for a brown ſuit of clothes, intending to paſs for the maſter of the ſhip, in caſe I ſhould happen to be taken by any of the American privateers at Canceau; and as the inhabitants of this place gave me to underſtand, that the people of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau were very much diſaffected to government, I took every precaution to diſguiſe the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an officer.</p>
                  <p>We proceeded in our canoe, on the 26th, to the point of Iſle-Madame; intending to croſs the great paſſage of Canceau. This paſſage is called the Gut of Canceau, from an Acadian ſettlement of that name on the continent; and ſeparates the Iſland of Cape-Breton from Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, or, as it is now called by the Engliſh, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Scotia. The iſland of Madame lies in the middle of the Gut, but rather nearer to Cape-Breton
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:045437_0407_102029B673405C80"/>
than to the main; and the paſſage to this iſland is called the Small, that from the Iſland to Canceau, the Great Paſſage. On mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point of Iſle-Madame, we found that there was ſtill a great quantity of floating ice in the Great Paſſage, and, not thinking it prudent to venture in our frail veſſel among it, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Narraſhoc, in order to procure a ſmall ſloop or veſſel that could reſiſt the ice.</p>
                  <p>Having accordingly provided one, we embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked our little canoe in it, and, on the 27th, the wind being as favourable as we could wiſh, got acroſs the paſſage, which is eight leagues, in three hours. The men, who navigated the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to the other ſide, were very apprehenſive of ſome American privateers lying in the harbour of Canceau, having ſeen ſeveral is the bay two days before. Upon this intelligence, I gave my diſpatches and papers to one of the Indians, knowing well, that they never attempt to ſearch or plunder any of theſe people. We were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo fortunate, as to ſee no privateers on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the harbour.</p>
                  <p>On landing at Canceau, I went to the houſe of a Mr. Ruſt, who is the principal man at this place, and acts as a juſtice of the peace under go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for which he receives about 100<hi>l. per annum.</hi> The inhabitants on the other ſide, as well as the people who brought us over, having informed me, that this gentleman always ſupplied the New-England-cruizers with every neceſſary that his ſtores could afford; I was determined, to be very cautious in every thing I ſaid, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Having paid the perſon who brought us
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:045437_0408_102029BAC64D8A68"/>
over the gut, and thanked him for his private intelligence, I was conducted to the houſe of this Mr. Ruſt, to whom I paſſed myſelf for the captain of the ſhip. He aſked me a number of queſtions, the tendency of which I could eaſily perceive; and therefore, gave him as evaſive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers as poſſible. I found that he had a brother-in-law, who was a firſt-lieutenant on board a ſixteen-gun-brig, belonging to Boſton, which had gone out of the harbour of Canceau the day before.</p>
                  <p>We remained in this place till three o'clock the next morning, when, being apprehenſive of treachery, on the part of our pretended friends; we ſat off, without any intimation of it to Mr. Ruſt. Prom this gentleman I had purchaſed a piece of ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> pork, and about eight pounds of biſcuit, which he ſaid was as much as he could ſpare, and for which, I was obliged to pay him at leaſt thrice its value. We were now to proceed in our canoe, along the coaſt to Halifax, and had reaſon to fear that we ſhould be again diſtreſſed for proviſions. However, we were ſo lucky as to find, as we coaſted along, plenty of lobſters and other fiſh, which the Indians caught with prodigious dexterity, killing the flat fiſh with a pointed pole, and the lobſters with a cloven one. We were ten days going from Canceau to Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax: during which interval, we did not meet with any ſettlement, and ſaw nothing worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except a number of picaroons on various parts of the coaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Indians remained, for a few days, at Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax; when, having received the balance due to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:045437_0409_102029BC50ABCE98"/>
them, they took their departure for the iſland. I was obliged to continue here for two months longer, till an opportunity ſerved for a paſſage in the Royal-Oak, to New-York; where I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my diſpatches (in a very ragged condition) to Sir Henry Clinton.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of my fellow-ſufferers in the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, ſoon after arrived at Halifax, in a ſhallop from Spaniſh-River. The captain, conſcious of the reception he would meet with, did not think proper to go to his owner at New-York, to give an account of the loſs of his veſſel; but took his paſſage in a ſhip from Halifax to London, and now ſerves as a pilot on the Thames. The mate was, on account of his good conduct du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole of our tranſactions, appointed, by a gentleman in Halifax, to the command of a ſhip bound to the Weſt-Indies.</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR EMILY,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>HAVE you then forgotten your promiſe to come down to the country, and ſpend a few days with me in the beginning of ſpring? Perhaps the fine folks in town, do not ſuppoſe that the ſpring is come yet. I can account for their miſtake. Nothing but the ſun can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of its approach; and they keep themſelves ſo mewed up in their apartments, that they think very little of conſulting him. As for us, we enjoy his kindly beams already. The country, which was ſo dull for ſome months, has reaſſumed all its charms. The trees, have ſhaken off winter's ſqualid dreſs; to put on, once more, the livery of the ſpring. The birds, returning in crowds, form the moſt agreeable concerts; while they hide their neſts under the thick foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the groves. What can you be doing in town? Were you to paſs the whole day at your window, breathing the freſh air, would you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that you enjoyed the ſpring? Caſt your eyes round you, what do you ſee? A ſky clouded with ſmoke, dirty ſtreets; in ſhort, the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that you have ſeen all the winter. The
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:045437_0411_102029C3A0879748"/>
houſe-tops, it is true, are no longer covered with ſnow and icicles, but your dun tiles, even with this advantage, afford no very brilliant proſpect. Do you ſee, as I do, the ſun's riſing beams deck the freſh leaf with purple and gold; do you ſee the dew-drops ſhine like pearls, before his warmth dries them up; do you ſee him, when he emerges from behind the hill, inundate the vaſt horizon with a torrent of light? I ſuppoſe your town idlers, who have ſtuck ſo long to their fire-ſides, begin to truſt themſelves, at length, to the park, though they ſtill ſhudder with the cold that they have felt; but look at them attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you will find that one winter has made them old. Here, on the contrary, every thing ſeems to have grown young again. The brooks have purged their muddy waters; the meadows are enamelled with new flowers; the pale primroſe adorns every bank; and even the prickly haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, prepares to dreſs itſelf in the bloſſoms of May, in order to ſoften its rugged aſpect. How pleaſing, after the dull ſilence that reigned through all nature, to hear the bleating of the flocks, that are ſeen climbing up the green ſlopes; and the clamorous joy of the children and youth, who come out to enjoy their accuſtomed ſports in the fields. Our houſe is built upon an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, expoſed to the earlieſt beams of the ſun. I might, if I choſe, receive his morning viſits in my chamber; but I like better to riſe with the dawn, and pay him my reſpects in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> upon the top of the hill; and thither I repair in the evening alſo, to take my leave of him.</p>

Theſe, my dear Emily, are ſome of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that the country affords; but, I feel the want of a friend to enjoy them with me. Make haſte, therefore, and come down. Do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that whatever time you ſpend here, will be loſt to your improvement: I learn here a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things, of which I am aſhamed that I have hitherto been ignorant. Our little accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too, I am very ſure, will not contract ruſt in this air. The ſweet ſongs of the nightingale will remind us of cultivating our voices more attentively. The little lambs, that bound and friſk round their mothers, will give us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of eaſe, grace, and agility; while the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, varying before us at every ſtep, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us, to exerciſe our pencils, and vie with the colouring of nature: ſuch rivals as theſe, may, perhaps, humble our vanity, but they take no pride to themſelves, from our inferiority; and therefore, we can forgive their excelling us. Try to prevail upon your mama to come down along with you: we expect you both, with the moſt earneſt impatience. Adieu, my dear Emily. The moment, that I can ſuppoſe my letter to have reached you, I will go and poſt myſelf at the end of our avenue, to wait your coming. You will do wrong, to let me moan there long, like the turtle for its abſent mate. Once more, adieu. Believe me unalterable in the friendſhip which I have vowed to maintain for you, while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE not forgotten the promiſe that you mention, my dear Julia, and if I have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, I am pretty ſure, when you hear the reaſon, you will not think me deſerving of your reproaches. I choſe rather to appear deſerving of them, than to wound your tender breaſt with my ſorrows. Theſe I can now impart to you, as they are at preſent totally diſſipated. You know how tenderly I love my worthy mother. Well, my dear friend, I have been upon the point of loſing her for ever; and ſhudder ſtill at the thoughts of my danger. Since the death of my papa, her health had been conſtantly on the decline; but I flattered myſelf, that the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the country, your mama's agreeable company, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ch high ſpirits, of the pleaſures that we were to enjoy in the ſpring. The firſt approaches of this charming ſeaſon revived in my mind the moſt delicious ideas. I was buſy, the other day, preparing for our jaunt; and mama,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:045437_0414_102029CDDA131450"/>
with her uſual good nature, ſeeing my impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was as earneſt on her part, where, as ſhe was packing up her things, a bundle of letters of my father's, which ſhe has always preſerved, fell into her hands. It was late in the evening; ſhe therefore ſent me to bed, that ſhe might peruſe them more at her eaſe. I have ſince learned that ſhe was reading them the whole night. They muſt have agitated her ſpirits moſt powerfully; for, in the morning, a fever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on her in all its violence, and reduced her in two days to the laſt extremity. Judge what I muſt have ſuffered in ſeeing her delirious the whole time, and hearing her pronounce my papa's dear name with a voice ſcarcely audible. I trembled, every moment, leſt I ſhould loſe her as well as him. What would have become of me, deprived of that dear mother, who ſeems to care for life on no other account than that of her affection for me? I had ever been ſenſible of her fondneſs, but at that moment how much did I feel my love and gratitude increaſe! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her ſituation rendered her unconſcious of my care and tenderneſs, yet, I exerted myſelf in the melancholy office, as much, as if ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid me by her fondeſt careſſes. My father, whoſe image was ſo ſtrongly painted in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſeemed to thank me for her. I never left her bed-ſide a ſingle moment, and I have now the pleaſure to ſee her recover per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly. I cannot expreſs to you, what new ſentiments this revolution in my mother's health has given birth to, in my breaſt. The names of mother and daughter, ſound in my ears with a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:045437_0415_102029CF6245ED00"/>
ſweetneſs, that I never found in them before. Whatever reminds me of the tender ties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, excites in my ſoul more melting emotions than I have ever hitherto experienced. Of this I had a proof yeſterday, which I ſhall long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
                  <p>Mama took me, to ſpend a day out of town, at Lady D—'s, who had teſtified the ſtrongeſt concern for her, during her illneſs. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heard this lady mentioned, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of reſpect and affection, but my age's levity had hindered me, from making remarks upon her character with any attention. I now reſolved, however, to ſtudy it obſervantly. We found her at our arrival, in a company of near twenty viſitors; ſome of whom, were united to her, by the ties of friendſhip, others, common acquaintances, who had occaſionally, matters of buſineſs to tranſact with her huſband. Her countenance, which was conſtantly brightened with a ſmile of candor and good nature, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged even ſtrangers to be at their eaſe, in her company. I admired, with what eaſe ſhe could addreſs all by turns, in the very ſtyle which their ſeveral circumſtances made the propereſt, forgetting no perſon in ſo numerous a company, and yet, in the midſt of all theſe various atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, overlooking her young family with the care of a mother, though ſhe did not appear in the leaſt engaged with them. In the evening, when the company was retired, mama yielded to the requeſt of her friend, who preſſingly entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, to prolong the pleaſure that ſhe enjoyed, in being once more in her ſociety. Lady D—
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:045437_0416_102029D14E9B8468"/>
had juſt received agreeable news, from two of her ſons, who were on their travels. Her huſband was returned the ſame day, from a ſhort journey into the country. Theſe two circumſtances, threw her into a moſt delicious frame of mind; and her happineſs, was equally painted in the ſmile that hung upon her lips, and in the ſweet drops that bedewed her eyes. It ſeemed, as if her ſoul, replete with love, feared to contract her joy within herſelf, and would therefore dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it upon all around, to make them partners in her happineſs. The impreſſion was ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you could not avoid cheriſhing it, as your own proper ſenſation. Her feelings had the ſame effect, as a fine evening, in which, nature, takes pleaſure to breathe into every boſom, the ſweets that ſhe diſpenſes. A light and lively chearfulneſs, quickly ſucceeded to this tender mood, and from that air of nobleneſs, that character of dignity and good ſenſe, which was to her ſo natural, and which ſhe had ſupported, to ſo much advantage, in the general conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the afternoon, I ſaw her with the ſame grace, deſcend to the moſt playful good humour, and the moſt intimate familiarity. Mama was touched with the affectionate part, that ſhe took concerning the happy return of her health; I confeſs, I myſelf was touched with the flattering inſtances of friendſhip, that I received from her lips; but I know not how, ſhe found the ſecret of making her own pleaſure, become ſtill more ſenſibly intereſting to us. Sometimes, by careſſes, ſhe would encourage her daughter, to diſplay before her father, the accompliſhments, which
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:045437_0417_102029D442105DB8"/>
ſhe had acquired in his abſence: ſometimes by ingeniouſly irritating her, as it were, ſhe would elicit from her daughter's vivacity a thouſand ſtrokes of native wit and delicacy. Amiable artifice of maternal tenderneſs, that endeavoureſt to adorn children, in all their graces, before the eyes of a delighted father, in order to render him, in his turn, more dear to his children, by the increaſe of his affection! How well didſt thou become that pure, ingenuous ſoul, which was ſo much a ſtranger to artifice of every other kind!</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the evening, was ſpent in a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of little amuſements, and I entered into the ſpirit of them more, I think, than I ſhould have done, in any other houſe, becauſe they generally appear, to be no other than expedients, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the weariſome time away, whereas the chearfulneſs, ſpirit and cordiality, with which they are ſeaſoned by Lady D—, renders them real and genuine pleaſures. At length, however, the moment of our departure arrived, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, not without coſting me a very lively regret. We had hardly been ſeated in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when, deareſt mama, cried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, throwing my arms round her neck, how much do I thank you, for having made me a witneſs, to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that reſpectable family! I know, I ſhall love you ſtill more for it, than ever I have. You ſee, my Emily, anſwered ſhe, preſſing me tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her boſom, how much the ſweets of nature and of friendſhip, excel all other pleaſures. My heart felt the ſame impreſſion, and ever does, when I am in the company of my worthy friend.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:045437_0418_102029D89D693878"/>
I never leave her, but I find myſelf more inclined to practiſe my duty, and better inſtructed by her example, in the means of ſucceeding. Ah, mama, how delightful are thoſe duties, and how eaſy do they appear, from the manner in which Lady D—performs them. I think, to be in her company one ſingle day, would be a ſufficient inducement to any woman upon earth, to ſeek the ſame happineſs. You are right, my dear, ſuch is the charm of true virtue, that at ſight of her, all ingenuous ſouls feel the moſt willing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, to follow her example. But many are ſoon diſheartened by ſome difficulties, which wear a formidable aſpect, and this merely for want of a ſufficient ſteadineſs of principle. Lady D—, had the courage, to form her principles in her earlieſt youth, and never to ſwerve from them, during the reſt of her life. With all the pleaſing qualities and accompliſhments, that were capable of making her ſhine in the world; a fortune, ſufficient to ſupply even thoughtleſs diſſipation; and, in ſpite of the examples which ſhe might have pleaded in her excuſe, ſhe was early ſenſible that her own eſteem, that of her huſband, her family, and her friends, were of more ſolid value to ſuch a mind as her's. All her thoughts, all her actions, have been directed by this virtuous determination. Her efforts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every day eaſier to her, and the ſucceſs of them was the beginning of her reward. The more ſhe has taſted the happineſs of this reward, the more lively dread ſhe has felt of loſing it, were ſhe to deviate a ſingle moment from her plan of rectitude. Hence her courage has never
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:045437_0419_102029DB90AAD498"/>
been daunted at any difficulty. All her children have been brought up at her own breaſt. They have never been ſick, but her embrace conſoled them. She formed their earlieſt ideas, their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt ſentiments; ſhe has inceſſantly watched over the minuteſt particulars of their education; and even at this day, their happineſs is her only ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude: to that, her generous affection would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the deareſt conſiderations of her own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and, from the calm, in which ſo many ſubjects of inward ſatisfaction ſuſtain her mind, in the midſt of all its activity, proceeds that air of ſerenity and chearfulneſs, that candid ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, which gains your eſteem at the firſt look. Being, therefore, always certain of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with good will and reſpect from others, as ſhe finds nothing in herſelf unworthy of theſe ſentiments, ſhe needs only to purſue the natural bent of her diſpoſition, in order to be ſure of pleaſing: and to theſe means of pleaſing, with which nature has endowed her, ſhe has united all thoſe that are in the gift of reaſon, cultivated by reflection, reading and experience. It ſeems, as if nothing were beyond the reach of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in the ſame manner as there is nothing which her feelings do not intereſt. Her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is as touching as inſtructive. One would ſay, that all her ideas paſs by her heart, and there clothe themſelves in the expreſſion of the moſt noble and delicate ſentiment. An unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able equality of temper, an amiableneſs ever new, bind her huſband's affections to her in the ſweeteſt captivity, nor ever allow him to wiſh for other relaxation from his cares, than he finds in
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:045437_0420_102029DD1AA0F888"/>
her company. In effect, what ſight can he find, when from home, capable of engaging him ſo much as his own houſe; when he ſees his friends, fatigued amid the buſtling ſcenes of the world, come to this aſylum of peace and honour, to ſeek the pleaſure which thoſe ſcenes could not afford them? The air of frankneſs and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty that you find in this houſe, diſpoſes all hearts to become ſuſceptible of generous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and ſtill farther to open themſelves with the moſt unreſerved confidence. You are there ſafe both againſt others and yourſelf, as in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where every thing inſpires the reſpect and love of a beneficent Deity, whom we ſhould dread to offend even in our moſt ſecret thoughts. Inſtead of the jealouſies and claims of precedence which raiſe diſcord among other women, thoſe whom ſhe has choſen for her acquaintance, only feel, in her preſence, the deſire of meriting her eſteem daily more and more; and this, being equally the buſineſs of all, attaches them to each other by new ties, and leads them to offer her their united tribute of gratitude and friendſhip: thus every thing conſpires, to afford her the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimeſt happineſs that a ſoul, endowed with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, can taſte. Happy as a wife, happy as a mother, happy as a friend, all around her forms an empire, as it were, the ſubjects of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their hearts to her governance, that ſhe may fill them with virtuous ſentiment and emulation of her noble qualities.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the vivacity with which my mother delivered me this portrait of Lady D—, it made ſo powerful an impreſſion on me, that I

have found it again this morning, quite freſh in my memory. I haſten to ſend it to you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting you, at the ſame time, to ſhew it to your mother. I confeſs to you, I ſhould be happy to ſee it in the hands of all honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nay, I think, we owe this public homage to virtue, that we ſhould paint the pleaſures which it beſtows, both in order to encourage thoſe who practiſe it, and to invite others to do ſo by the hopes of the ſame happineſs. The only perſon from whom I ſhould wiſh to conceal it, is, my Lady D—herſelf, and that for fear of offending her modeſty; if, after all, this very quality would permit her to diſcover her own reſemblance in the picture. Her friends alone would be ſtruck with the likeneſs, and would thank me for having <hi>given</hi> them <hi>back the image</hi> of thoſe ſentiments which they all entertain of her in their hearts. Honeſt people, in general, would applaud me for having ſhewed by a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pattern, that virtue is not a ſtranger upon earth: that it may be allied to the moſt amiable character, and enjoy the pureſt bliſs that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humanity is capable of taſting.</p>

                        <p>AFTER having laboured ſo hard during the beſt part of our lives, thus at laſt to fall into poverty! To what purpoſe is it, that we have
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:045437_0424_102029E919CD4D08"/>
never ceaſed our cares and pains for a ſingle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to breed up our children with credit? If they were but of an age to earn their own bread, it would be ſomething! My dear children, it is not for myſelf, it is for you that I ſhed tears; in loſing our cattle we have loſt our all. What remains, is far from being ſufficient to pay our landlord. What is to become of us? if my good huſband did not ſupport my ſinking courage, I ſhould die with grief. But how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a character he is! What a man! How tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, in the midſt of our misfortunes! Were I not ſure, that affection makes him conceal the greateſt part of his troubles, from the fear of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting me, I ſhould believe he were inſenſible to them. "Why doſt thou weep, Martha, he often ſays, when I can no longer reſtrain my tears? We have had a loſs, it is true; but who knows what Providence has in ſtore for us! I, for my part, make that my dependence." Alas, though never rich himſelf, he was always a friend to the unfortunate. How many families in this village has he ſaved from miſery, by his advice and aſſiſtance! There is not a better man on earth; and I ſtill poſſeſs what many women want in the midſt of riches, a worthy huſband, and children, whoſe good diſpoſitions fill our hearts with joy. Whilſt I think on theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, I feel that Providence watches over us, and my griefs become lighter. Take courage then, Martha, enough is left to conſole thee in thy affliction. <stage>(She advances to the door, and calls)</stage> Jenny, Jenny.</p>

You replied with an embrace, that you would be the firſt to ſet the example.

Oh, my child, you have made me feel the happineſs of being a mother. What earthly good can equal the joy which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of your tender duty has given me! But be comforted. I have reſerved the remainder of this for you, and you may, at leaſt to-day, eat your bread as uſual: it is neceſſary that you ſhould get ſtrength, in order to earn ſomething

                           <p>Well then, my good Thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good, ſaid Mr. Parks, what news? Very bad, anſwered I: I have loſt all my cattle, in the ſpace of eight days; by a diſeaſe, brought on by the drought of the ſeaſon. I am ruined, and I am come to inform you of it, that you may be at liberty to let your farm to another tenant. I come alſo to offer you all that I have left in the world: it is a great trouble to me, that I have not ſufficient to ſatisfy you; but I promiſe, on the word of an honeſt man, to labour night and day, till I can do ſo. I ſhall eat of the bread of bitterneſs till I have paid my debt, to the utmoſt farthing.</p>

                           <p>Oh, certainly, we will do it readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What did Mr. Parks ſay to this?</p>

                           <p>I was already acquainted with your loſſes, honeſt Thorowgood, ſaid he, and am heartily ſorry for them. I pity you alſo, ſaid madam, with her ſweet voice: I pity you with all my heart.</p>

                           <p>I do not come here, ſaid I, to excite compaſſion, I have no occaſion for it, as I am able to work. My great concern is, that I cannot acquit myſelf of my debts to you: I own, I feel for my wife and my young family: I, who would have ſhed my blood to preſerve them from want! You who are rich, and without children, know not what it is to ſee thoſe ſuffer to whom we have given life. Ah, if you had ſuch children as I have; if you loved them with all your ſoul, and were beloved by them as I am! In ſaying this, grief made me hide my face; and when I lifted up my eyes again, I ſaw Mr. Parks was no longer looking at me: he had turned toward his wife; their eyes were filled with tears, and fixed on each other. Pity was not the only ſentiment which then affected them; I plainly ſaw, that ſomething, which more nearly concerned themſelves, occupied their minds.</p>

                           <p>I had not the courage; but as I continued to talk of my children, Mr. Parks ſtrove to change the diſcourſe. I perceived clearly that ſome private affliction was the cauſe of this; and therefore, haſtened to quit the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:045437_0435_10202A09FAC3DA90"/>

                           <p>Quite the contrary; he bid me not deſpair. Go home to your wife, ſaid the good gentleman, I will order my horſe, and be with you preſently, when we will ſettle every thing. I have always looked upon you as an honeſt man, therefore I will do nothing in this buſineſs, without your concurrence.</p>

                           <p>Why all that we can do now, is to collect together our houſhold-goods and farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-utenſils, and ſell them, to pay our landlord: we will keep nothing but what is on our backs: we can then ſhew ourſelves before him with a clear conſcience.

He thanked me in ſo affecting a manner, that I wiſhed to give him ſome proof of my good will, upon the ſpot. You muſt know, juſt before the diſorder appeared, we had made a joint purchaſe of twelve cows at a neighbouring fair. It is true, I advanced two-thirds of the money; but upon his conſenting to graze them, for a certain time on his farm, (which was an excellent bargain for him, in point of money, as we ſettled it) I told him that, whatever of the herd ſhould eſcape the mortality, we would divide equally between us. At that time I had no reaſon to think, that this arrangement would turn out in my favour; and now, though it has, I ſhould be far from taking advantage of it, if it regarded myſelf alone; but I am no longer maſter of my own. I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to give up all my remaining property to my landlord.

And you, my dear mother, can you forget the many tender careſſes that you have laviſhed on me, at the very time when I was eating the bread of your children? You alone received me, when abandoned by all the world; and ſhall I now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon you?

                           <p>I told you this morning that we ſhould not be able to pay our rent; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our duty to give you up what we have, and you ſee it collected here. With the ſale of our furniture, clothes, and corn, we mean to pay you as far as we can. Whatever may be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, we will endeavour to earn by our labour, till we have paid to a farthing. I hope, Sir, you will at preſent be ſatisfied with this on account, and have a little patience for the reſt.</p>

                           <p>You know, as well as myſelf, Sir, that I had drained the marſhes in order to make them fit for paſture, and they were in a thriving way. All the money that we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining laſt year, we laid out in cattle, in order to fatten them for ſale. Twenty head of good cattle was a little fortune which promiſed fair to pay our rent, by ſending a few of them off to

market. A drought came on; there was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a blade of graſs in my fields. I fed my cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with the ſtraw of my bed, the thatch of my barn, and ſometimes with the vegetables that were for my family's uſe. When I wanted to get rid of them, I could find no purchaſer, owing to the ſcarcity of fodder. A murrain got among them, and I loſt them all; I owe nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to any body but to you, Sir. Come and look at your grounds; you will ſee whether I have neglected to cultivate them; you will ſee if my own labour, with that of my wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, may not enable me one day to pay all my debts; I can, however, give you no other ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than my own word: but as I have always been punctual, till now, in my engagements with you, I ſhould hope that you would have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on my promiſe.</p>

                           <p>No, Sir, begging your pardon; the latter are ſtill more ſo; the former are knaves, but the others are monſters. When a ſtranger hath relieved us in our diſtreſs, are we not in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bound, whilſt we have a drop of generous blood in our veins, to relieve him in turn, if he ſhould want our aſſiſtance! and children, who owe every thing to their parents, have coſt them ſo much anxiety, care and toil, ſhall they not act in the ſame manner? I ſhudder at the bare thought of ſuch a thing: were I to ſee my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incapable of paying what he owed, though he had not left me a penny, I ſhould ſtill think myſelf bound to fulfil all his engagements. I ſhould conſider it, as a duty of inheritance, in me, to acquit his memory, and preſerve the integrity of his name. Though I were to live upon bread alone, to the laſt hour of my life, and be obliged to work the fleſh from my bones, I would endeavour to pay all his debts; and when I had done ſo, I would go to his grave, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs him thus: Father, now reſt in peace, thou oweſt nothing.</p>

Do you remember, Martha, how happy the good old man uſed to be? My children, he would ſay, this wine ſtrengthens and chears me; but your affection, which makes you deny yourſelves comforts for my ſake, ſtrengthens and rejoices my heart ſtill more. He was ſometimes ſo much affected, that the tears flowed down his cheeks.

                           <p>Come, Sir, and I will tell you the reaſon: do you ſee, near yonder hedge, an old apple-tree that has ſcarcely any leaves on it? My mother was ſaying, this ſpring, that ſhe was very ſorry that the froſt had injured it ſo much, for ſhe had never eat ſo good apples as it bore, in her life, and that the tree was likely to die; the next morning, before ſhe was up, my brother and I went to pick out the moſt flouriſhing buds we could ſee, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft them on other trees in the orchard, that in
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:045437_0503_101FFDB6A677CF10"/>
caſe the old tree ſhould periſh, my mother might ſtill have ſome good apples: had we left the farm, it would have been a ſad thing; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe would have come into it, and in time, have eaten of the fruit, which we had engrafted.</p>

                           <p>Nothing could be eaſier, than for you to have taken them with you, and then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body would have been benefited by your labour.</p>

                           <p>Thorowgood, you have no idea of the emotion that I feel this day, I ſee plainly; that children are the choiceſt bleſſings of heaven.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Thorowgood.</speaker>
                           <p>Yes, when they are like ours; then indeed they are real bleſſings; and parents enjoy in them, a treaſure ineſtimable. Oh, Sir, you cannot imagine how much the calamities of life are leſſened, when our children aſſiſt us in ſupporting them, <stage>(clapping Mr. Parks on the ſhoulder.)</stage> Only cheer up your heart, Sir: in whatever part of the world your ſon may be, I firmly believe, that he will make your latter-days the happieſt of your life.</p>

                           <p>Ah, were he but ſtill alive, and of the happy diſpoſition of your children! But why ſhould I flatter myſelf with any ſuch vain hopes? No, I have no longer any ſon to comfort me, in the decline of life. Happy Thorowgood, you may grow old; you will enjoy the delight, of ſeeing yourſelf revive in the five children, to whom you have given birth.</p>

                           <p>Five children did you ſay, Sir? No; pardon me, only four. <stage>(He reckons them on his fingers.)</stage> The little one that is aſleep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the curtain, Lucy, George, and Jenny; theſe are all I have.</p>

for him, all that I could have done for a child of my own; and the worthy lad is deſerving of all my tenderneſs: he loves us as much as if we had given him birth, and he works for our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as if he were the eldeſt of my little family.</p>

                        <sp>

                           <p>That, we are as much ſtrangers to, as you are; we ſaved his life when he was an infant, in the cradle: my wife ſuckled him, and he has always lived with us. He muſt not have been of common origin: he had round his neck, a coral, adorned with gold and jewels; and the linen he had on, was of the fineſt kind.</p>

                        <sp>

                           <p>You preſerved his life, you are ignorant of his family, and he is not of vulgar race! Ah, my dear Thorowgood, quickly tell me, how he fell into your hands.</p>

                           <p>It is a melancholy ſtory: we then lived in the north of England; I rented a little farm there, on the banks of a river; it was an excellent ſituation, and the land yielded abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; no thanks to the care of the former ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, though—</p>

                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Mr. Parks.</speaker>
                           <p>Paſs over theſe circumſtances, pray, and only tell me all that relates to Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; that alone, inflames my curioſity.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Thorowgood.</speaker>
                           <p>Well, Sir, to come to the point at once: you muſt know, that one night we were rouſed from our ſleep, by the water's ruſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our houſe on all ſides; we had hardly time to get upon the roof, to wait for relief there; in the morning, a boat came to our aſſiſtance: the whole country was under water; the river was covered with the ruins of houſes and furniture,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:045437_0507_101FFDBFB24B2710"/>
carried away by the force of the current. I was endeavouring to comfort my wife, who lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loſs of our cottage, but ſtill more that of her ſon, who was ſtifled in the water before we awoke; in the mean time, I ſuddenly perceived a cradle, toſſed about in the flood, which was running rapidly, and threatening every moment to ſwallow it up. I could not bear the fight: I threw off my clothes, and, regardleſs of danger, I plunged into the river, ſwimming with all my might towards the cradle. I was driven back ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and almoſt exhauſted with fatigue; but the cries of the child, which I heard as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, inſpired me with freſh ſpirits and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: in ſhort, after much difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I got up to it, and brought it to the bank, a good way lower down. My wife followed me, creeping, more dead than alive, along the ſide of the river. I preſented the infant to her, which continued crying, until ſhe gave it the breaſt. Poor Martha fancied that ſhe had recovered her loſt child. We then made all poſſible enquiries to ſee if we could diſcover the parents, but we never could get any information: our affliction at length ceaſed; we continued to look upon him as our own ſon. I have related the whole ſtory to the boy himſelf, a hundred time: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it, indeed, from my own children, to let them enjoy the pleaſure of thinking him their brother, and to avoid all occaſion of jealouſy. I have had him inſtructed like the reſt. He does his work, as well, as I can myſelf. He talks as if he were reading out of a book; and he can read and write as well as our ſchool-maſter.</p>

                           <p>About fifteen years and a few months, as well as I can remember. But hold, I can tell you to a minute, for I had a memorial drawn up by the magiſtrate of the place, ſigned by the rector, and atteſted by the people, who were witneſſes of the event. When I quitted the country, I took care to carry it with me. Go fetch it, Martha.</p>

That idea would have imbittered your life; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, you have now, in me, a friend that will ſtand by you on all occaſions. It will give me the greateſt pleaſure to ſerve you. I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this moment.

                  <head>ANTHONY AND HIS DOG.</head>
                  <p>ANTHONY was the ſon of a poor labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a very honeſt man, but ſo extremely poor, that he ſcarcely poſſeſſed any thing in the world beſides the few tools of huſbandry, with which he earned a miſerable ſubſiſtence. His wife was lately dead, after a lingering illneſs, which had been the ruin of his affairs. The grief that he felt on this occaſion, would have broken his heart, had he not poſſeſſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of having ſtill an only ſon, whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved exceedingly, as the child was gentle and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and in every reſpect endowed with the moſt amiable and happy diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Young Anthony was paſſing one day before the door of a gentleman's houſe, when a ſervant perceiving him, called him into the court-yard, and aſked him, if he was diſpoſed to earn ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Yes, with all my heart, anſwered the poor child: What muſt I do for that?</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                     <p>You muſt take one of our dogs, put a ſtone round his neck, and throw him into the river.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                     <p>Poor thing! why do you want to kill him? Has he bit any body?</p>

                     <p>No, that is not the caſe: you ſhall ſee the reaſon preſently.</p>
                     <p>So ſaying, he conducted Anthony into the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſhewed him in a corner, lying upon a wiſp of ſtraw a little dog that ſeemed juſt expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: his hair was all fallen off, and his whole body ſeemed to be covered with a horrible mange.</p>

                     <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, the poor creature! He is in a very bad way indeed.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                     <p>And for that reaſon, my Lady wiſhes to be rid of him: there are other dogs in the houſe, and ſhe is afraid that they may catch his diſorder. If you have a mind to earn your ſix-pence, you have only to take him and drown him. I would not touch him myſelf for five pounds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                     <p>But why throw him into the river? Perhaps he may be cured.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                     <p>There is no likelihood that he will ever recover it. My lady's doctor has given him over.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, no matter, ſtill one may try.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Servant.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                     <p>But ſhall I have the ſix-pence?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Servant.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not aſk it for myſelf, but for the poor dog. If I was rich, I could do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but I am far from it: I have not always bread enough for myſelf, and he ſhould not want while he is ſo ill.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="196" facs="unknown:045437_0528_101FFF6E0A1FACC0"/>
                     <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                     <p>Come, it is a bargain: here is your ſix-pence.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Anthony ſaw an old baſket, that ſeemed to be thrown careleſsly about the ſtable, and aſked the ſervant to let him have it: he laid the dog in it, upon a wiſp of ſtraw, and haſtened to his father, who was at work in a field at ſome diſtance.</p>
                  <p>As he went, he turned his eyes now and then on the baſket. The diſguſting appearance of his patient almoſt made him ſick, but at the ſame time it excited his pity. Poor little creature, ſaid he, you muſt be in great pain. Ah! I wiſh I may be ſo lucky, as to make you well: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, take my word for it, whether you live or die, I ſhall never throw you into the river.</p>
                  <p>His firſt care was to buy a ſmall hot roll, of which he moiſtened the ſoft part, to make it the nicer; but all that the poor dog could do, was to lick it with the tip of his tongue: however, this refreſhment, ſmall as it was, ſerved to keep up the ſtrength of the ſick animal, and the hopes of his little doctor.</p>
                  <p>Anthony's father was going to ſcold him, for not having come out ſooner: but, when he learnt what it was that had detained him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being angry with his ſon, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to ſee, that he had ſo compaſſionate a heart, and he kiſſed him for his good-nature.</p>
                  <p>Near the field, where he was at work, there was a pleaſant meadow; thither, Anthony carried the little dog, ſhuddering with ſickneſs, and laid him at the foot of a tree, to baſk in the ſun. His diſorder proceeded only from a ſuperabundance of humours, occaſioned by the great quantity
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:045437_0529_101FFF72A46D5140"/>
of food, with which he had been uſually ſtuffed. As ſoon as the ſun had revived him a little, he crawled about the meadow, ſearching by his ſmell, for thoſe herbs, which inſtinct pointed out to him, as proper for his cure: he had ſcarcely eaten them, before they relieved him conſiderably. Anthony quitted his work for a moment, to ſee how his dog went on: he was ſurprized, not to find him in the place where he had ſat him, and ſtill more rejoiced, to ſee him upon his legs: he took care to carry him to the ſame meadow, for eight or ten days ſucceſſively, at the end of which, the poor animal was completely recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He had never had ſo good an appetite in his life, as then. Anthony's ſix-pence was long ſince ſpent, in feeding him while ſick, but now that he ſaw him re-eſtabliſhed in perfect health, he did not grudge to ſhare his own bit of bread with him. He had given him the name of <hi>Bonny,</hi> and perceived with ſatisfaction, that <hi>Bonny</hi> grew handſomer every day. His eyes, before ſo dull and languid, now ſparkled with new life: his limbs recovered their uſual nimbleneſs, and very ſoon his coat became as ſleek, and as ſoft as velvet, and withal as white as the ſnow, when its virgin hue is heightened, by the dazzling beams of the ſun.</p>
                  <p>The lady, to whom he had originally belonged, did not fail to hear very ſoon of his recovery and reſtored beauty: ſhe ſent her footman to offer Anthony two guineas, if he would let her have him again. Oh! no, replied Anthony, to the meſſenger; my lady would ſentence him, to be thrown into the river again, if he ſhould
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:045437_0530_101FFF75275E04A8"/>
happen to fall ſick, but I will never forſake him. What are your two guineas, in compariſon to the pleaſure that I have, in ſeeing him faithful and affectionate to me? We are too fond of each other ever to part. Anthony was in the right. He would not have given his dog for an empire, but in return, his dog would not have quitted him, for the greateſt monarch upon earth. He conſtantly followed his maſter, or elſe friſked before him, performing a thouſand little gambols to amuſe him. Whenever An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony after helping his father to dig, quitted his ſpade for a moment, and ſat down under the hedge to take a ſlight repaſt, he had only to make a ſignal, <hi>Bonny</hi> forgot all his own pleaſures, and ran to him full-ſpeed: there ſtanding upon his hinder legs, and wagging his tail to expreſs his joy, he took from Anthony's own lips, the half of each bit of bread that he put into his mouth. Anthony, was often obliged to put up with a thouſand wants, but he was never a whit the ſadder on that account; his little fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed-friend continued to give him new amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every day, and kept him always in ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Alas! he was ſoon to experience a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. At the end of autumn, the little boy ſell dangerouſly ill: his father, laid out what money he had ſaved from his earnings, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his ſon the medicines, that were indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary for his diſorder. This ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pittance was ſoon exhauſted; he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the conſiderable ſum which had been offered Anthony, by the lady, for his dog: two guineas would be to him a treaſure, in his preſent
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:045437_0531_101FFF76B0F86080"/>
circumſtances. He reſolved, therefore, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this propoſal again to his ſon, but ſcarcely had he heard it, before he cried out, never, never; and his fever, redoubled the agitation, which ſo painful an idea excited in his mind.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, his diſorder grew worſe, every day; violent fits of the cholic came on in addition to his fever, and increaſed his pains conſiderably. The anguiſh that he ſuffered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted the moſt piercing cries from him, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned him to twiſt his body, and roll himſelf upon his wretched mat, for hours ſucceſſively. On theſe occaſions, his little dog would come, and crouch cloſe by him, and fix his eyes on him, with the moſt ſignificant air of compaſſion, as if he would have ſaid, Ah! my dear maſter, I pity thee! Anthony, on the other hand, would look at him with reciprocal tenderneſs; and when his pains allowed him to ſpeak, My dear <hi>Bonny,</hi> he would ſay, I muſt ſoon leave you: Alas! I ſaved your life, and you, poor creature, can give me no relief. Saying theſe words, he would ſhed a flood of tears, which <hi>Bonny</hi> would come and lick off from his burning cheeks.</p>
                  <p>There lived a gentleman in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of the name of Denniſon, who was both very rich and very humane. This gentleman, hearing of the boy's ſickneſs, and the father's extreme poverty, came himſelf to viſit them, in order, to aſſure himſelf, of the truth of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that he had heard concerning them, and at the ſame time, to relieve their diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>When this excellent gentleman came to the the labourer's cottage, little Anthony was in a
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:045437_0532_101FFF78402B78E8"/>
moſt violent fit of his diſorder; his father ſat cloſe by him, overwhelmed with grief. Hunger gave him no concern, though he had for ſeveral days before, lived upon very ſlight nouriſhment, barely ſufficient to keep him alive. The ſight of his ſon's ſufferings, hindered him from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to his own. He endeavoured to comfort him, by kind and ſoothing words, and with his arm ſupported the child's drooping head, while the little dog ſtanding over him, moaned pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſtrove by a thouſand fond tricks, to catch a look from his maſter.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Denniſon ſtood ſome time at the cottage-door, contemplating this ſad picture. At length he advanced toward them, and was already at the foot of the bed, before they perceived him, or even, before the dog turned to bark at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and when Anthony and his father, lifted up their aſtoniſhed eyes, they ſaw his ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in tears.</p>
                  <p>My good friends, ſaid Mr. Denniſon, I am ſorry to ſee you in this melancholy ſituation: I am told, Anthony, that you are not able to furniſh the expence of ſupporting your ſon, as he ſhould be, in his illneſs. That is only within theſe two days, anſwered the father: till then, I have been able to give my child bread, but now there is nothing left in this poor cabin, that I can part with for his ſupport, unleſs, I ſell the wretched mattreſs, that he lies on.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words, little Anthony ſtretched out his trembling hand upon his dog, and ſighed heavily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:045437_0533_101FFF7AC78504B0"/>
Poor child, ſaid Mr. Denniſon, do not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy; I will take care of you. Anthony, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, addreſſing himſelf to the father, your cabin is damp, and it will do your ſon no good to remain here while he is ill. Will you truſt him with me? I will take him home with me, and have him cured. Truſt him with you, Sir? Yes, that I will, and thank you for your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. It reſtores both of us to life again.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Denniſon repeated his promiſe, and ſqueezing the little boy's hand affectionately, he took his leave, and went home to give orders for Anthony's reception. In half an hour after, came a ſtout footman, who, wrapping up little Anthony in a good warm coverlet, carried him in his arms to Mr. Denniſon's houſe: his father followed him, with a countenance, in which, hope and joy ſeemed faintly endeavouring to diſperſe the long ſettled traces of his melancholy. As to the faithful <hi>Bonny,</hi> his countenance was fully expreſſive of the moſt unequivocal ſatisfaction: he jumped along, with his head held up, and his eyes conſtantly fixed on his young maſter, who, from time to time, opened his covering a little, to have a look at him.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to the generoſity of Mr. Denniſon, and the care of an able phyſician, little Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's illneſs was ſoon cured. During the whole time that he was confined to his bed, his faithful <hi>Bonny</hi> kept him company: it was in vain that they would invite him to take a turn in the fields, if it were only for the ſake of the air; he would not quit his maſter's chamber. All the ceremony that he would vouchſafe even to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony's
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:045437_0534_101FFF7F3567E000"/>
father, was, to attend him when he was going away, as far as the firſt ſtep of the ſtairs; then, all at once, he wheeled about, and came ſcampering into the room, and making a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand capers round the boy's bed.</p>
                  <p>At the end of a fortnight, little Anthony was able to ſet out for his father's. Mr. Denniſon had given him new clothes from head to foot. Any one elſe would have found it difficult to know him in his new finery, but the eyes of <hi>Bonny</hi> were not to be deceived, and it may eaſily be ſuppoſed how great was his joy, when he ſaw his maſter walk out to the fields, and could friſk and gambol about him at his eaſe, once more.</p>
                  <p>The firſt word that old Anthony ſpoke, when his ſon came home, was the name of Mr. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon. Oh! my dear child, ſaid he, had it not been for that worthy man, I ſhould have loſt you for ever: you ſee how happy he has made us: What ſhall we do to prove our gratitude to him?</p>
                  <p>Oh! father, I have already thought of that, but I can talk no more upon the ſubject at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and, ſo ſaying, he turned away his face, to hide the tears that guſhed from his eyes.</p>
                  <p>He went to bed very early, yet ſleep was a ſtranger to his eye-lids; he did nothing but toſs about in his bed, and ſigh heavily the whole night.</p>
                  <p>Next morning his father aſked him what way he propoſed to acquit his obligation to Mr. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon: the poor boy had not power to anſwer him, but pointed with his fingers to <hi>Bonny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="unknown:045437_0535_101FFF81B4E561C0"/>
He immediately put his new clothes on, and went out, but it was viſible, from the inward ſtruggles which this effort of reſolution coſt him, that his whole ſtock of courage was exerted to put it in practice.<hi>Bonny</hi> accompanied him; he had never been ſo playful as that day: he friſked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſuch ſportive agility as to attract the looks of every paſſenger. Many envied little Anthony the happineſs of poſſeſſing ſo handſome a dog; but the more joy and vivacity he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more was Anthony dejected and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. Ah! ſaid he, you would not be ſo full of ſpirits, if you knew that we were going to part for ever: I choſe rather to bear my illneſs, than ſell you to procure myſelf medicines; I would ſooner have died: but now, I muſt give you up to another, unleſs I chuſe to ſhew myſelf ungrateful. Ah! my poor <hi>Bonny,</hi> my poor <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe melancholy reflections, he found himſelf before Mr. Denniſon's houſe; he croſſed the court-yard, and entering, requeſted admiſſion to that gentleman, who happened to be in the parlour. While he ſtood in the hall, his heart throbbed ſo violently, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the accidental delay of a few moments (owing to Mr. Denniſon's being otherwiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged) for the recovery of his ſpirits. At length being called for, he took <hi>Bonny</hi> up in his arms, and entered the parlour. Worthy Sir, cried he, at the ſame time ſobbing violently, I owe you my life: I have nothing that I can offer you in return but my poor dog: here I have brought him, Sir: it is not without regret that I give him
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:045437_0536_101FFF83782058E0"/>
to you; but you would make me ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy by refuſing to accept him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Denniſon, had a heart ſuch as all men ſhould have, who wiſh their own happineſs, or that of their neighbours. The ingenuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the little boy made him ſmile; but he was not the leſs ſtruck with the greatneſs of the ſacrifice that he ſaw him prepared to make to his gratitude. He took him therefore by the hand, and ſaid, No, my dear Anthony, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe you; I accept your preſent with all my heart, and eſteem myſelf fully repaid for every thing that I have done to ſerve you: but now that we are both quit, I make you a preſent of <hi>Bonny;</hi> he is your's, in return for the ſatisfaction that your gratitude affords me.</p>
                  <p>How, Sir—cried the boy, who was unable to proceed.</p>
                  <p>Yes, my little friend, replied Mr. Denniſon: but one thing I requeſt of you, and that is, not to inſiſt any more in oppoſition to my deſire: aſſure yourſelf, I am better ſatisfied than you can poſſibly be, at having it in my power to make you happy once more.</p>
                  <p>Anthony, who the minute before had been ready to ſwoon away through the violence of his grief, was now, on the contrary, almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by his exceſs of joy: he viewed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor with an air of aſtoniſhment; he preſſed by turns, his dear <hi>Bonny</hi> and Mr. Denniſon's hand, which was ſtill in contact with his. He wept, but his tears were thoſe of joy and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="unknown:045437_0537_101FFF8627A0CE50"/>
Mr. Denniſon did not bound his kindneſs here. A place became vacant among his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics; he beſtowed it upon old Anthony: as to his ſon, he had him carefully educated, and gave him a good trade. <hi>Bonny</hi> lived happily in the family. Ah! ſaid Anthony to him, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when he fondled him, perhaps I owe all my happineſs to thee. He loved him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more and more, and, when the inhabitants of the village where he lived would ſpeak, to this day, of two good friends, the names of Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and his dog <hi>Bonny,</hi> are ſure to be the firſt that occur on the ſubject.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Domville.</speaker>
                     <p>Hear me one word. Do you think, my dear, that it does not hurt me to ſee you in pain! when you were ſo ſick, do not you remember that I loſt all deſire of ſleep or food, and that I was more unhappy even than your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? you may ſuppoſe then, when you ſee me determined on making you ſubmit to a painful operation, that I have a very forcible reaſon for it. This is my reaſon. I ſhould be ſorry, while my children were young, that their teeth ſhould grow irregularly, and ſo be obliged to be drawn at a time when they would never have any others, to ſucceed them. This is a matter of ſome concern to a mother who loves you, but I think it ſhould be ſtill more ſo to you, ſince it touches you more nearly. The matter is no leſs than, whether you are to have, all your life, a ſtraggling and irregular ſet of teeth, or neat and well ordered. Felicia, do you underſtand what I have been ſaying to your brother?</p>
                  </sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Domville.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot tell you exactly how much it will hurt you: this I know, that it is in your own power to make it much more ſupportable. Shall I tell you how?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Domville.</speaker>
                     <p>It is, by not making an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual reſiſtance, but ſubmitting to the operation with a good grace: your brother talked of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mouth ſhut, if you ſhould take it into your head to ſhut your's alſo, do you think that Mr. Enamel would not find a way to open it? You may aſſure yourſelf before-hand, that the more you would ſtruggle, the more he would be obliged to hurt you. If tears and complaints could leſſen one's pain, though they are marks of weakneſs, yet they would be excuſeable; but when they are of no uſe in the world, and may even contribute to make the pain worſe, I think it is a great diſgrace, and the extreme of folly, to yield to ſuch weakneſſes.</p>

                     <p>There is nothing more eaſy: I only aſk you to ſit quiet for a minute, and the whole buſineſs will be over: you were by, the other day when your father had a tooth drawn, did you hear him cry out?</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. Domville.</speaker>
                     <p>True; but on the other hand, his tooth held twenty times faſter to his jaw than your's do. A large full-grown oak is much more difficult to root up than a young oak-plant.</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. Domville.</speaker>
                     <p>He would gain more by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you even thoſe that are decayed; for then you would be obliged to have frequent recourſe to him, either to clean them, or to keep them in order: whereas, with a little attention to them every day, you will perhaps never have occaſion that he ſhould touch them again.

                     <p>Women have no leſs occaſion for courage in ſupporting pain: nay, perhaps, the weakneſs of their frame requires to be ſtrengthened with a greater degree of patience and fortitude. In order to be ſure of finding this fortitude, when the greater evils of life oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, it is neceſſary to have it put to the trial on occaſions of ſmaller conſequence. I have taken early care to fortify you againſt the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of life, ſuch as bruiſes, or falls, or ſtrains. It is time to fortify yourſelf againſt more acute pains. After all, I do not think, that on the preſent occaſion you will ſuffer very much: your teeth are not firmly enough rooted to require a very violent effort to diſlodge them. They are like a ſlender ſtalk of graſs, that holds to the earth by very ſlight roots, and can eaſily be drawn up without damaging them. I thought it beſt to ſpeak to you, without reſerve, of the pain, whatever it may be, that will attend the operation; that if you find it more ſevere than you expected, you may have no right to accuſe me of endeavouring to deceive you.</p>

                     <p>YOU permit me to write to you, my dear mama. What a conſolation is this to my heart! Alas, I have much occaſion for it, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as I am from you.</p>
                     <p>Here am I, in London, and in perfect health; nevertheleſs, I am ſad, very ſad, I aſſure you. You will, perhaps, call me a ſilly child, when I tell you that I wept during our whole journey, whilſt I thought on the laſt kiſs that you gave me when we parted. But come, I will no longer trouble you with theſe complaints. I know how much you love me, why therefore ſhould I afflict you?</p>
                     <p>What a fine city this is! and how populous! We have no town in Holland ſo large by one-half. I find every thing in this place very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but I do not find mama here. Ah, that ſpoils all.</p>

You might well boaſt of your friend Mrs. Grandiſon. She is ſo good and ſo gentle, that one muſt love her as ſoon as one ſees her. She held forth her arms to receive me at my arrival, juſt in the ſame manner as you do when you are pleaſed with me; and then Mr. Grandiſon! I cannot expreſs to you how amiable he is. He ſhall be my model; and then I am ſure, when I grow up, I ſhall be eſteemed by every one. My papa was, doubtleſs, ſuch another; for you have often told me how worthy a man he was. Ah, would I poſſeſſed ſuch a parent now! how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py I ſhould be! I would then, like young Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, obey him in every thing: my whole heart ſhould be filled with love for him, though I would not love you the leſs. But heaven has not permitted this. However it has left me a mother, and ſo good a mother!—Come then, I am not ſo much to be pitied; there are few children ſo happy. Every day do I thank God for this bleſſing, and implore him to preſerve you to me: but, adieu, my dear mama; adieu, my little ſiſter. I encloſe for you, in this letter, a thouſand kiſſes, and as many affectionate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances. Think of me ſometimes. You are ever in my thoughts. Oh, when ſhall I ſee you again! When ſhall I embrace you! How long will this year appear to me! and how ſwiftly did time fly when we were together!</p>

                     <p>YOUR letter, my dear ſon, has given me the moſt lively pleaſure. The affliction which you manifeſt at our ſeparation, proves to me that you have a heart of ſenſibility. The child who can bear an abſence from his mother without concern, cannot love her: we muſt, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, liſten to reaſon. We cannot always live together; and to abandon ourſelves without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to a fruitleſs grief, is a weakneſs, at which we ought to bluſh; learn therefore betimes to arm yourſelf with courage againſt the various events of life. The moſt happy lot is chequered with innumerable troubles, which we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom ourſelves to bear from our earlieſt youth. Whenever you feel your ſpirits dejected, becauſe I am not with you, you have only to think of the pleaſure that we ſhall both have when we meet at the end of the year, and this thought will afford you conſolation: in the mean while we will write to each other as often as poſſible. To write, is almoſt to ſpeak. You ſee by this, the benefit of thoſe improvements, which your diligence has acquired. What would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you now, had you neglected your ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies! we ſhould have been ſeparated, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to converſe with each other.</p>

You perceive Mr. Grandiſon is an eſtimable man, and wiſh to make him your model! You delight me, my dear child. Such a choice is the beginning of virtue. Yes, your father was ſuch another man; and I am well aſſured that you know how to render yourſelf worthy the name of his ſon; and this is the ſweeteſt conſolation I have in my affliction for his loſs.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, my dear William; embrace Mrs. Grandiſon for me. Give me a faithful account of all your occupations, and all your pleaſures; but always write to me as if you were ſpeaking: a letter ought to be natural, ſimple, and unſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Your little ſiſter regrets your abſence: ſhe enquires after you a hundred times in the day; and complains that I am not ſo good a play-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to her as you were.</p>

to Mrs. Grandiſon. What an excellent mother you have, ſaid ſhe, after having read it? Yes, madam, anſwered I, ſhe is another Mrs. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon; upon which ſhe embraced me. My dear little boy, added ſhe, ſince your mother has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to write to her, and enjoins you to give her an account of every particular which concerns you, you ought to omit nothing. Tell her of your ſtudies, and of your amuſements; and recount to her your converſations with my ſons and my daughter: this will ſoften the pain of your abſence. But, madam, ſaid I, mama has always ſtrictly forbidden me to ſpeak of what paſſes in the family of another; ſhe therefore only meant that I ſhould ſpeak of myſelf. Well, well, anſwered ſhe, I permit you to tell her eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that paſſes in our houſe. I have not a dearer friend in the world than your mama. I ſhould myſelf confide all my ſecrets with her; and I charge you to do it for me. Oh, mama, how much pleaſure does this permiſſion give me! How many things ſhall I have to tell you of my friend Charles! Yes, it is of him that I wiſh moſt to ſpeak. You know how he abounds in underſtanding, in wit, in ſentiment, in goodneſs: we are always together. I love him each day more than the preceding. His brother Edward, who is older by two years, is by no means ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable; but the little Emily, their ſiſter, Oh what a charming young lady!</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Grandiſon is juſt going to write to you, mama: ſhe has aſked for my letter to encloſe in her's. I am ſorry that I cannot chat longer with you: methinks I ſhould never be tired of

writing to you. I find as much difficulty in quitting my pen as I have pleaſure in taking it up. Adieu, my dear mamma; be careful of your health. Continue to me your wiſe leſſons, and, perhaps, I ſhall become as amiable as my friend Charles.</p>
                     <p>I tenderly embrace my little ſiſter. I regret alſo that I have her not here to play with me; and the more, as I find that ſhe liked me ſo well for a play-fellow.</p>

You ſee, from this, what we gain by good conduct, and by fulfilling our duty: we are beloved and eſteemed by all the world. Edward, from infancy, has diſcovered ſomething untractable and ſavage in his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but, my dear boy, take notice of his bad

old, and he is thirteen. This makes the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a whole year, in which time, I hope to improve much. Nothing would be wanting to complete my felicity, if you were but here, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, to ſee how happy I am. All our ſtudies are but ſo many different pleaſures. We learn drawing, dancing, and muſic; and we walk eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day into the country, to acquire the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of plants.

I am every day more ſenſible what a ſad thing it is to be ignorant: there is ſo great an advantage in cultivating the mind! and we have only to make our ſtudies an amuſement to us. Never fear; I ſhall not loſe my time in this houſe: I have too good an example in my friend Charles. An emulation reigns between us, which does not leſſen our friendſhip; but, on the contrary, we love each other the better for it. But I muſt leave off writing, for I am called to breakfaſt. Depart, then, my letter, and tell my dear mamma that I love her with all my heart. Say that I embrace her a thouſand and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times.

                     <p>WHAT obligations do I owe you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, for having ſent us your ſon! You have given me, by ſo doing, a friend for life. If you did but know how much he delights in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you, and with what tenderneſs of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſpeaks! He talks to me often alſo of his father. When he deſcribed his death to me, we wept together: how happy, ſaid he to me yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, are you, to have ſtill a father. How much is a poor child to be pitied, who is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his! Alas, it is to loſe his deareſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and beſt friend. How does it ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that there ſhould be children in the world who diſobey their parents, and give them afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their vices! For my part, had I ever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my father the leaſt ſubject of complaint, I ſhould never more have known a day of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But you have yet a mother, anſwered I. Yes, he replied, I have one who cheriſhes me as tenderly as I love her. She has redoubled her cares for me ſince the death of my father; can I therefore fail to feel for her a double portion of
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:045437_0553_10202AD25B82A5F8"/>
reſpect and love? Why, am not I already grown up? I would partake with her of her labours; I would aſſiſt her to ſupport her griefs. So long as I live, will I convince her, by my tenderneſs, that I am not unworthy of her's. I was too much moved, to be able to make any anſwer: I could only embrace my friend. Ah, madam, he who honours his parents ſo truly, muſt needs be a faithful friend.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deſcribe to you how diligent he is in all his ſtudies. Mr. Bartlet is aſtoniſhed at the progreſs that he makes: you muſt not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuppoſe that we are always ſerious. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, we know very well how to amuſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and pleaſure never appears ſo agreeable to us, as after buſineſs.

Our leſſons, our exerciſes, and our pleaſures, have all their ſtated hours; and I can aſſure you, they are well filled up.</p>
                     <p>I know not what you will think, madam, of the liberty that I have taken in writing you ſo long a letter; but I flatter myſelf you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, ſince the ſubject of it is ſo dear to you: I will not, however, encroach too far on your complaiſance.

With what bounty, has heaven ſupplied to you the loſs which you might have ſuſtained, by your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's want of means to give you thoſe acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuited to your birth.

                     <p>HERE we are, my dear mamma. What a pretty country-houſe! charming walks all around us. The park is very extenſive; and from my windows I ſee a landſcape, the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of which, are too diſtant for the eye to take in diſtinctly. The gardens are laid out with a neatneſs which charms you at firſt ſight. Charles has one to himſelf, in which he is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſow and plant whatever he pleaſes. He ran to it as ſoon as we arrived. And do you know what he has done, mamma? It is impoſſible for any one to be more noble or generous. He has given half a guinea to the gardener who took care of his garden during his abſence. It was not neceſſary, to be ſure, for him to make this preſent, as his father pays him handſomely: but the man has ſix ſmall children. He is poor, and Charles is beneficent; I think therefore he did right: but Edward, it ſeems, thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I muſt relate to you their diſcourſe on

                        <p>True, brother; but ſee what care he has taken with my garden. He deſerves a little recompence: beſides, the man is not rich, and he has a large family. We ſurely ought to take pity on the diſtreſſed.</p>

                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>

                        <p>But it concerns them, brother, and that is ſufficient. Heaven forbid that we ſhould only think of our own wants, and take no care about thoſe of others. Ah, dear brother, let us always pity the poor. They are our fellow-creatures.</p>
                        <p>Edward could not ſay a word in anſwer to this; but quitting us abruptly, began tormenting a cat that he ſaw aſleep on the graſs, a little way from us.</p>
                        <p>What do you ſay to all this, mamma? I am aſhamed for Edward, and I love Charles more than ever. Mrs. Grandiſon, I am ſure, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more pleaſure from the generoſity of her ſon, than ſhe could have had from all the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works in the world. Oh, if ever I ſhould be rich, I will take care not to ſhut up my purſe from the poor. It muſt be ſo great a pleaſure to aſſiſt a man when he wants it. Adieu, my dear

                     <p>I AM charmed with your laſt letter, my dear ſon. You have good reaſon indeed to prefer Charles' way of thinking to that of Edward. What pleaſure muſt his good heart have felt in the joy of the honeſt gardener! a pleaſure which will be renewed as often as he ſees the ſhoes on the feet of the poor children. The beſt way to merit riches is, to employ them for the happineſs of others. Mrs. Grandiſon has juſt ſent me one of your drawings. I am charmed to ſee you ſo much improved by the inſtructions that you have had. If fortune ſhould prove unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to you, painting is an honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not beneath the ſon of a colonel. It will, at leaſt, be an amuſing occupation, which, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving you from idleneſs, will, at the ſame time,

preſerve you from thoſe vices that idleneſs leads to. A love for the fine arts is the beſt guard in youth againſt the paſſions. The wiſh which you have ſo often expreſſed to receive ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from your ſiſter, has put her upon many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. O mamma, ſaid ſhe to me laſt night, what a pretty thing it is to know how to write! When you read my brother's letters to me, it is juſt as if he were with us, as if he were talking to us. Pray, dear mamma, let me ſoon have a writing-maſter, that I may write to my brother; then it will be as if I were with him, as if I talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. She preſſed me ſo much, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her a maſter next month. She threw her arms round my neck; Ah, mamma, how learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I ſhall be! Yes, I will deſerve this favour. But what ſhall I do in return for it? Learn well, my child, ſaid I. But, mamma, to learn well is not for your benefit, but for mine. Then it is for mine alſo, anſwered I; is not the happineſs of my children the ſame as my own? Ah, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, replied ſhe, but when ſhall I do ſomething which ſhall be for you alone? Is not this pretty from a child of ſix years old? I took her in my arms, and preſſed her to my heart. I embrace you, my ſon, with the ſame tenderneſs.</p>

                     <p>AH! mamma, a great misfortune has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us. Edward has had the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to fall into the water. He is very ill, and ſo is Mrs. Grandiſon alſo. We are all full of grief; but you will ſee that Edward ſuffers from his own fault: he is very happy in having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Had it not been for timely help, he muſt certainly have been drowned. Yeſterday, after dinner, not having finiſhed his morning taſk, Mr. Grandiſon ordered him to ſtay in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to finiſh it: but behold his diſobedience! he came down, notwithſtanding theſe orders, and came after us: but I will relate the affair exactly to you as it happened.</p>
                     <p>We had been gone out about a quarter of an hour, intending to regale ourſelves with ſome warm milk at a little farm-houſe not far off. We ſoon heard Edward, who ran after us, out of breath; we ſtopped to wait for him, concluding that he had obtained permiſſion to be of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he joined us; and after having walked a
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:045437_0565_10202AF7047098C0"/>
few paces together, we met a little boy wheeling a barrow, in which there was a caſk of vinegar. He was civilly turning out of our way, but by ſo doing, he overturned the wheelbarrow, and the caſk of vinegar fell to the ground. The poor child was in ſad perplexity, becauſe he was not ſtrong enough to put it back into the barrow, and he ſaw no grown perſon at hand to aſſiſt him. Charles, the good Charles, immediately ran up to him: Come William, come Edward, cried he, we muſt help this good little boy; we may ſurely find ſtrength between us four to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place his caſk. Oh yes, truly, ſaid Edward, it would become us mightily to employ ourſelves in ſuch an office. And why not? ſaid Charles: methinks it is never unbecoming to do a good action: but, however, you may ſtand by if you pleaſe; you ſhall ſee that we three will do it. We immediately went to work, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the barrow was ſet upright, and the caſk placed upon it, though Edward did nothing all the while, but ſing, and laugh at us. The little boy was overjoyed, and after thanking us, went his way. Why Charles, ſaid Edward, this is wonderful; it gives me pleaſure to ſee that you would make an excellent vinegar-merchant. Well brother, ſaid Charles, if I ſhould be one, and ſhould ever have the misfortune to let fall my caſk, I ſhall be very glad to find any one good-natured enough to aſſiſt me. Well, you may laugh, ſaid Edward, but what do you think papa would ſay, if he knew what you had done? He would love his ſon the better for it, ſaid Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Papa is good-natured, and had he been in
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:045437_0566_10202AF88DC55460"/>
Charles' place, he would have done the ſame. Fie, ſaid Edward, I bluſh for you both; it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretty indeed for perſons of our condition to meddle with the affairs of common people! Oh, ſaid Charles, if they want us ſometimes, we have much more occaſion for them. We have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this little boy, but who knows but his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may be one day neceſſary to us?</p>
                     <p>You will ſee preſently, mamma, that Charles was in the right.</p>
                     <p>We were ſcarcely got to the farm-houſe, when Edward propoſed to us to go into a little boat, which was there floating in a ſmall pond. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Charles refuſed, ſaying, that their papa has expreſſly forbidden them. Pſhaw, he'll know nothing of it, ſaid Edward. But brother, anſwered Charles, we ought never to do any thing which our papa ſhould not know. Very well, ſaid Edward, then I will go and take a run in the meadow, for it is no diverſion to me to be here. We thought that this was his deſign: but would you believe it, mamma, inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he had ſaid, into the meadow, he made a turn round the houſe, and then went into the boat: about half an hour after this, we heard one cry out for help: we ran along with the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and his ſon; but what was our conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we ſaw the boat overturned, and the unfortunate Edward hidden under the water. A little boy was dragging him by the ſkirt of his coat, but had not ſtrength to get him out of the water: it was he who cried for help. The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer immediately plunged into the water, and got them both out; but Edward was without ſenſe
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:045437_0567_101FFD12C0D2B568"/>
or motion. Emily cried moſt pitifully. As for my part, I was ſo ſtruck, that I could not ſpeak. Charles was the only one who preſerved preſence of mind: he immediately gave orders to have his brother carried into the farmer's houſe, in order to recover him from his ſwoon. He then begged his ſiſter to compoſe herſelf. I will go back to my papa, in order to prevent his being told abruptly of this unhappy accident. In the mean while take care of my brother.</p>
                     <p>Do not you admire theſe wiſe and tender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, mamma?</p>
                     <p>But what were the agitations of his parents when they heard his recital! Mrs. Grandiſon fainted: Mr. Grandiſon, after having given her the neceſſary aſſiſtance, ran to his ſon. They had juſt carried him into the houſe: every one thought him dead. In ſpite of all his firmneſs, Mr. Grandiſon could not forbear ſhedding tears. Oh! how well does a good father love his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? he forgets all their faults, when he ſees them in danger. After much pains, Edward was at length brought to himſelf: but he is ſtill in bed in a high fever. Thus has he been puniſhed for his diſobedience; he has been at the point of loſing his own life, and of being the death of his parents. This will ſerve as a leſſon to me, to be always docile and ſubmiſſive. Adieu, my dear mamma, you ſhall ſoon hear from me again. How many things have I to ſay to my little ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on the affecting ſcene ſhe had with you, but I will reſerve them for our correſpondence.</p>

                     <p>MRS. Grandiſon is much better: Edward is nearly recovered, and I hope that this adventure will render him more wiſe in future. I told you in my laſt letter, of a little boy who ſaved Edward, by holding the ſkirt of his coat, but I forgot to tell you, that it was the little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar-carrier, whom we had juſt aſſiſted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing his caſk on the barrow. Charles ſaid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right, when he obſerved, that we know not what occaſion we may have for the aſſiſtance of others. It muſt have been all over with Edward, if we had not chanced to aſſiſt this little boy; for had we left him in the road with his wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow overturned, he would not have been in the way to have ſeen the accident which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened afterwards to Edward, nor to have thrown himſelf into the water to ſupport him, whilſt he called out for aſſiſtance. But I muſt relate to you a converſation which we had on the ſubject, yeſterday, after dinner, whilſt we were with Mr. Grandiſon in the ſick-chamber of Edward.</p>

                        <p>That is very true, had it not been for that brave little boy, it would have been all over with me.</p>

                        <speaker>Mr. Grandiſon.</speaker>
                        <p>I am very glad to hear you make this reflection, my dear: you now ſee, as Charles obſerved to you, that we cannot foreſee how ſoon we may have occaſion for the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſeems to ſtand moſt in need of us.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>
                        <p>You are right, papa, and I feel much regret in not having aſſiſted this little boy, who was afterwards to do me ſo great a piece of ſervice.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Grandiſon.</speaker>
                        <p>I am well ſatisfied, my child, that you are convinced you were wrong: you have only now to bear in mind your deliverer, and it may one day be your turn to render him a benefit. Till that time arrives, you may in ſome ſort acquit yourſelf towards him, by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe whom you ſee in diſtreſs. You may alſo draw this very uſeful leſſon from your misfortune, never to deſpiſe thoſe who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us in rank. What would a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman have done for you, had he been in the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:045437_0570_10202B031D0C7278"/>
place of our little vinegar-carrier? He would, no doubt, have contented himſelf with calling out for help, without giving you any himſelf; and for fear of wetting his foot in the pond, he would have ſuffered you to periſh before his eyes. Our little boy, on the contrary, more courageous and more compaſſionate, boldly threw himſelf into the water after you, at the hazard of his own life. You had a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before, refuſed him a little ſervice, which would have coſt you but a ſlight effort; and notwithſtanding your unkindneſs to him, he was not afraid to riſk his own life to ſave your's. You have never yet, and perhaps never may know another action which equals this. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parents, a brother, a ſiſter, a friend, all owe to this poor boy a beloved object which they were on the point of loſing: ſociety owes to him one of its children, who may one day be of uſe to it. Let us take care then not to deſpiſe our fellow creatures, in whatever rank fortune may have placed them, ſince little people may ſometimes be of greater uſe to us than great ones.</p>
                        <p>My eyes were filled with tears, my dear mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, during this diſcourſe of Mr. Grandiſon: I felt all he ſaid, at the bottom of my heart. Oh! yes, I have often had occaſion to obſerve, that the lower claſs of people are by much the moſt helpful when any accident makes their aſſiſtance needful: and thoſe cannot be bad, who are thus diſpoſed to ſuccour their brethren.</p>
                        <p>Adieu, my dear mamma, we are to dine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow with Mr. Grandiſon's ſiſter: it is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:045437_0571_10202B04A708BCA0"/>
miles from hence. I am obliged to leave off. We muſt go to bed early to-night, in order to be up betimes in the morning. Edward cannot go with us, for which he is ſo ſorry, that I really pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty him: here again is another puniſhment for his fault. I will give you an account of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. Write to me, pray, my dear mamma; at leaſt till my little ſiſter is able to be your ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>

                     <p>WE have had a great deal of pleaſure, my dear mamma, at lord and lady Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pley's. I wiſh you could have ſeen how well my friend Charles behaved in the midſt of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous company. Another young boy, about his age, was there alſo: what a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Charles and him! the latter ſtiff and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, perpetually bowing and admiring his clothes, at the ſame time ſo aukwardly baſhful, that he could not look any one in the face. Charles, on the contrary, has a noble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:045437_0572_10202B079C04ED88"/>
aſſurance, together with the greateſt eaſe and civility. He liſtens to others with attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſpeaks but little; but what he ſays is full of grace and juſtneſs, and every one hears him with pleaſure. He diſtinguiſhes, to a nicety, what is due to every one in company. Reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful towards his ſuperiors either in rank or age, polite to his equals, and affable to his inferiors. He pays the moſt delicate attention to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appearing ceremonious. I will give you an inſtance of this. We went to take a walk in the garden, a young lady of the company had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten her hat; ſhe ſoon found the ſun very troubleſome. Charles quickly obſerved this, and before ſhe could return back to the houſe for her hat, ſhe perceived Charles bringing it to her: he aſked her leave to put it on her head himſelf, which he did with all imaginable politeneſs: yes, I aſſure you, he is like a grown man, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. After dinner he played a very difficult piece on the harpſichord, and received the applauſes of all. Oh! if I were but as amiable as he is, how happy ſhould I be! were it only that I ſhould give you more pleaſure, mamma. The two daughters of lady Campley are very well brought up. The eldeſt, whoſe name is Charlotte, ſings admirably: Emily loves her tenderly; they have engaged to write to each other.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt not forget to tell you of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us on our return. Mr. and Mrs. Grandiſon, with Emily and a lady who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them, went in the firſt carriage: Mr. Bartlet, Charles, and I, in the ſecond: we had ſcarcely gone two miles, before we ſaw a poor old
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:045437_0573_10202B0BEE948B98"/>
man at the foot of a tree. Charles made the coachman ſtop, and turning to Mr. Bartlet, ſaid, look, I pray you, Sir, at this old man: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be blind, and there is no one near him: What will become of the poor wretch? Will you permit me to go and aſk him a few queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? With all my heart, my dear, anſwered the worthy Mr. Bartlet. Charles immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from the carriage, and ran to the poor man. Who are you, friend, ſaid he; and how came you to be alone in this ſolitary place?—Alas! anſwered the blind man, I live above two miles from hence: I went out this morning to aſk charity in a village ſomewhere hereabouts, I don't know on which ſide: and my guide, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naughty boy, refuſed to lead me home again, becauſe I had not gathered money enough in the day to pay him as I uſed. I have no other hope but in Heaven, who perhaps, will ſend ſome one to my relief. But, ſaid Charles, it is juſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and it will ſoon be night, and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you here? I muſt periſh then in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, anſwered the blind man: No, replied Charles, I will be that perſon whom heaven has ſent to your relief. Oh! Mr. Bartlet, ſaid he, coming back to us, do not deny me the delight of ſaving a miſerable poor old blind man, who is on the point of periſhing if we do not take pity on him. Night approaches; What will become of this poor creature if nobody aſſiſts him? He lives but two miles off, what hinders our taking him in our carriage? Yes, Charles, ſaid Mr. Bartlet, follow the dictates of your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:045437_0574_10202B0D79915DA0"/>
heart. Charles had no ſooner received this anſwer, than he took the old man by the hand, and put him into the coach. Any other beſides my friend might perhaps have felt ſome falſe ſhame in riding by the ſide of a poor man in tattered clothes, but he, on the contrary, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think himſelf honoured by it. We had no occaſion to go far out of our road to put this poor man into his cottage. I ſaw Charles ſlip ſome money into his hand as he went out of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and we parted after receiving from him a thouſand bleſſings. On our return home, every body beſtowed praiſes on this act of humanity. But, ſaid Emily, this man, with his long beard and his rags, muſt have an odd figure in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. Ah! ſiſter, ſaid Charles, I had ſo much pleaſure in giving relief to a diſtreſſed creature, that I did not think about his accoutrement. Mr. Grandiſon could not refrain his tears: he held out his arms to his ſon, who threw himſelf into them; whilſt he tenderly preſſed him to his heart. Oh! mamma, my eyes were filled dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this affecting ſcene. This chariot, will ever appear to me like a triumphal car to my friend.</p>

                     <p>I THANK you, my dear mamma, for your kind letter: it is a long time ſince you have written to me; I feared that you were diſpleaſed with me. Do you know what I do? I always carry the laſt letter that I receive from you in my boſom, that I may have it at hand to read over again the good leſſons which you always give me, and I ſeem to myſelf the better every time I read it.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday was Mrs. Grandiſon's birth-day; Charles roſe very early; he was much longer at his devotions that day than uſual; he was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt, for his dear mamma, as I do for you on your birth-day. He appeared to us dreſſed in a new ſuit; you would have been charmed with his fine air: but before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I muſt go back a little in my narrative.</p>
                     <p>It is near a month ſince Edward and Charles had each of them a new ſummer-ſuit, which they had choſen themſelves. Edward put on his the firſt day, but Charles continued to wear
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:045437_0576_10202B14E2DD8D68"/>
his old one, which was ſtill however very neat. His father aſked him the reaſon of this; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he reſerved his beſt dreſs for a viſit of ceremony. Do not you perceive, mamma, that this viſit of ceremony is that which he is to pay his mother this morning. How amiable is Charles! and what a fine turn of thought there is in every thing he does. Emily had already knocked at our door, and was waiting for us impatiently. We went down together, and found Mr. and Mrs. Grandiſon at breakfaſt in the ſaloon. Charles was the firſt who congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his mother on her birth-day: he knelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, and reſpectfully kiſſed her hand. Oh! if I could but recollect all that he ſaid! but I was too much moved to remember the words. Emily followed, and wiſhed her mother joy in the moſt pleaſing and graceful terms. Mrs. Grandiſon preſſed her two children to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, kiſſing them with tenderneſs. Their father then embraced them, whilſt I made my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the beſt manner I could: they were at leaſt ſincere, for I truly love my worthy benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Edward came in juſt after: I know he loves his mamma: Who, indeed, does not love her? but yet his manners do not pleaſe me like thoſe of Charles. The one does every thing in a more agreeable way than the other. Mrs. Grandiſon made every one of us a preſent. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received a pretty pair of bracelets, Charles and Edward had each a watch. Would you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, ſince yeſterday only, Edward's is already out of order! as for me, my dear mamma, I have a fine microſcope: this is of more value to
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:045437_0577_10202B17D1972898"/>
me than all the toys in the world. Oh! the good Mr. Grandiſon! how have I merited this gift?</p>
                     <p>In the evening we had a large company from all the neighbouring houſes: Charles did the honours of the table like a grown man. He carved the meat, he filled the glaſſes, he ſerved the ladies; in a word, he acquitted himſelf of this employment to admiration. Here is a very long letter, mamma, but I am talking of my friend, and to you: no wonder then, that I know not when to conclude; and I cannot do it now, without ſending a tender embrace to my ſiſter, which ſhe ſhall give back to you.</p>

                     <p>EVERY day here brings new pleaſures with it, my dear mamma. Your ſon is now become a gardener. Will you lend me your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſaid my friend to me the other day? I want to turn up afreſh the ground in my garden: the flower-ſeaſon is paſſed, and I have a mind to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:045437_0578_10202B1AC506DD80"/>
ſow ſome ſallad to regale my mamma during the remainder of the ſummer. Will I? ſaid I, yes, certainly; you always oblige me when you give me an opportunity of doing any thing for you. We dreſſed ourſelves in light waiſtcoats, and each being equipped with a ſpade, we cleared the garden that very evening. We gathered up with care all the roots, in order to put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground before we went away. Yeſterday we roſe at five in the morning: we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ourſelves to ſleep late, becauſe we cannot tranſplant any thing during the heat of the day. This morning we returned early to our work, and had the pleaſure to finiſh it before breakfaſt. We only wait now to ſee our roots and our ſeeds ſpring up, and we ſhall employ this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in extirpating the weeds. What pleaſure we ſhall have in ſeeing our plants grow up! Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have, like other children, ſeen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature without paying any attention to them: But Charles has taught me to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on all that I ſee. I will give you an example of this, in a converſation which we held yeſterday. I do not know whether I ever told you that Charles had a pretty aviary filled with all ſorts of birds, which he takes care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                        <p>True, they have not; but they are not unhappy in their cages.

                        <p>Why, we ſhould think that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to be at liberty, and a very ſad thing to be a priſoner. But theſe birds have no idea of this difference; provided you give them ſufficient to eat and drink they are content. They enjoy what they have, without thinking of what they have not.</p>

                     <p>CHARLES, Edward and I, dined yeſterday at Mr. Friendly's. He has a ſon about our age, with whom we were very happy.

                     <p>MR. and Mrs. Grandiſon are gone to ſpend a few days at a friend's houſe; and Mr. Bartlet is juſt ſet off for London: we remain, therefore, my dear mamma, by ourſelves, with only an old waiting woman, and a ſmall number

of the domeſtics. Emily manages every thing in the abſence of her mother: yes, indeed, ſhe gives orders to all, and with as much diſcretion as if ſhe were twenty years of age. Is not this very pretty in ſo young a lady? She is not yet twelve years old, and the ſervants reſpect her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as if ſhe were their miſtreſs. Do you know why? it is, becauſe ſhe always treats them with kindneſs, without deſcending to familiarity. She follows in this the example of her brother Charles. You cannot imagine how much he is beloved and honoured by all the people in the houſe. Edward, on the contrary, is always at play with them, and yet they cannot bear him. It is true, he is continually playing them malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tricks, and frequently treats them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable haughtineſs. Oh, that he had but gone with his papa and mamma: now that they are no longer at hand to check him, there is no keeping him in order. Charles, Emily, and I, follow our agreeable ſtudies in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as if Mr. and Mrs. Grandiſon were here: but Edward takes advantage of their abſence to ſpend the day in trifling, and running about the fields. Nay, he even tries to divert us from our ſtudies, as if he thought our application a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to idleneſs. We were all yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one corner of the room buſy at our draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Edward amuſed himſelf with a fly at the end of a thread; and under pretence of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, came up to us, and jogged our chairs, in order to hinder our buſineſs. Emily, carried away by her vivacity, was going to rebuke him ſmartly, but Charles prevented her; and addreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

They were hardly got to the end of one of the walks, before a heavy ſhower fell, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged them to come in again, to the great regret of Edward. Charles, in order to conſole him, propoſed that we ſhould amuſe ourſelves in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little ancient hiſtory.

                     <p>Edward made a face at his ſiſter, and wanted to oblige us to play at puſs-in-the-corner, and to take John to make a fifth. But Charles, who, with all his ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, is capable of the greateſt firmneſs, anſwered him, No, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was not my fault juſt now, that I did not gratify your humour, but the rain prevented it. I then propoſed to you another amuſement, which you might have been ſatisfied with, but you did not approve it, though my ſiſter and my friend are very well pleaſed; I think, therefore, I may give way to a reaſonable taſte rather than to your caprices.</p>
                     <p>Edward, who knows very well that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not eaſily turned from his reſolution, left the room grumbling; and, in ſpite of the rain, ran into the court to play with a great maſtiff, whom he is grown very fond of, for the ſake of teazing him. He did not return in leſs than an hour, almoſt wet to the ſkin, and covered from head to foot with dirt. As for our part, during
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:045437_0587_101FFD112EF149C8"/>
this interval, after having read the life of Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas, which had given us infinite pleaſure, we had time alſo to take up our drawings and finiſh them. An opportunity happened after dinner, to ſend them to Mr. Grandiſon, and this morning we have had the pleaſure of hearing that he was very well pleaſed. But what muſt he think of Edward, who has ſent him nothing? I am quite afflicted at this. I would give any thing in the world that he were as good, as amiable, as diligent as his brother; then nothing would be wanting to complete the happineſs of his parents. I ſee with regret how much pain he cauſes them. Oh, my dear mamma, may I never ſee the day in which I ſhall give you pain! No, no, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I never can, whilſt I think of your tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me. I am too ſenſible of what I ought to be, to render myſelf worthy of it. I dare even promiſe that I will never give you cauſe for any thing but ſatisfaction: I expect that my little ſiſter will give you the ſame aſſurance, and I embrace her tenderly for this good reſolution. Adieu, my dear mamma.</p>

She could not reſt till ſhe had ſeen her take it entirely, becauſe it was ſtrictly ordered by the phyſician. One would think to ſee her, that it was a beloved ſiſter whom ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. How amiable it is in a young lady, to have ſo much humanity! Edward, as uſual, had ſome fault to find. It becomes you much, ſaid he, to wait upon your own ſervant. And why not, brother, anſwered Emily? do not you play at nine-pins with them? If it be their duty to ſerve us whilſt they are in health, it is equally our's, to take care of them in ſickneſs: beſides, poor Peggy has frequently watched over me du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ailments of my infancy. What I now do for her is at leaſt no more than ſhe has done for me: and I think of the pleaſure that I
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:045437_0589_10202B3A18533FC8"/>
ſhould feel, were I in her place, in every mark of attachment ſhewn me. Edward felt himſelf aſhamed, and left the room haſtily. Ah! ſaid I to myſelf, Emily does not know what I have ſeen my dear mamma do. When our poor Nanny had a fever, it was mamma that took the whole care of her: but this recollection brought a ſorrowful thought with it. There is ſuch a number of ſervants in this houſe! and you, my dear mamma, have but one to do every thing for you. How unfortunate is this! You muſt needs be forced to do a number of things very ill-ſuited to the widow of a colonel. And then, if my ſiſter were but big enough to aſſiſt you! But no, ſhe only encreaſes your trouble: and I, what do I do here; inſtead of being with you to comfort and ſupport you with all my power? This reflection cuts me to the heart. There is only one thing which ſoftens it; it is the hope, that by attending to my education, I may, one day, be in a ſituation to put an end to your troubles. What new courage does this ſweet hope give me! Adieu, my dear mamma. I embrace you with tears of joy and ſorrow.</p>

                     <p>HOW I love your young Emily! Yes, my dear ſon, there is no virtue more amiable than humanity. It were much to be wiſhed, that every young lady would follow this fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and inſtead of tormenting the ſervants, would learn to treat them with goodneſs. How is it poſſible to be inſenſible to the pleaſure of being beloved by thoſe who ſurround us?</p>
                     <p>But why are you afflicted, my dear ſon, at my having but one ſervant? it is no happineſs to have a multitude of domeſtics; there is more of ſhew than real uſe in it. Every ſervant in a houſe announces ſome additional want in the maſter or miſtreſs of it, and ſubjects them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional cares. Had I the means, I ſhould, no doubt, have about me thoſe attendants which my ſituation in life would require. I ſhould look upon this as a duty, as it would be the means of giving ſupport to many poor people, who might otherwiſe want employment. But ſince Heaven has not thought fit to afford me riches, I do not think that I am to be pitied for having
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:045437_0591_10202B416D953468"/>
only a ſingle domeſtic: it is as much as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. I have no occaſion for more attendance than her's.</p>
                     <p>And now, my dear child, tell me what are thoſe occupations which you ſay do not become the widow of a colonel! You certainly did not reflect on what you were ſaying. There is no diſgrace in ſerving ourſelves, when we are not in a condition to pay for the ſervices of others. Will it not be better, after my death, that you ſhould have it to ſay; my mother herſelf prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſimple repaſts; our clothes were the work of her hands; ſcarcely could ſhe procure for us what was neceſſary, but nevertheleſs, ſhe owed no one any thing; than to have this reproach thrown on you; your parents, it is true, lived according to their rank and birth; they had a ſuperb houſe, magnificent furniture, a train of domeſtics, but all this is left unpaid for. What, in ſuch circumſtances, would be the ſon of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel? a deſpiſed young man, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own innocence, would be ſtigmatized for the faults of his parents, whilſt a man of honour, of the moſt common birth, would ſcarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him as his equal. What I have now ſaid to you, will, I hope, put an end to your concern on my account, becauſe it will ſhew you that I am perfectly ſatisfied with my deſtiny.</p>
                     <p>As for the reſt of your letter, my dear ſon, the ſenſibility of your heart, and thoſe affecting marks of tenderneſs with which it is filled, made me ſhed tears of joy. Were I ſtill poorer than I am, I ſhould think myſelf rich in the poſſeſſion

                     <p>WE have been in the greateſt conſternation this night, my dear mamma. The houſe of our neighbour, Mr. Falſton, is entirely burnt down. What dreadful flames! The ſky was as red as blood. My heart beat: I wept. It is ſuch a melancholy thing for the father of a family, to loſe all his ſubſtance! What ſtrict precautions ought we to take againſt fire, ſince one moment may produce ſo terrible a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune! It was the Miſs Falſtons who were the cauſe of this. Yeſterday evening, unknown to any one, they got ſome lighted coals out of the kitchen, and carried them up into a little ſpare-room, in order to toaſt a crumpet, which they had procured in ſecret. A little while after, they heard their papa call them: haſtily eating up their half toaſted-crumpet, they ran down to him. Their bed hour ſoon came, and they went up into their apartment, without thinking any more of the lighted coals, which they had left in the little room. The fire, doubtleſs, firſt
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:045437_0594_10202B6DB0EB25C8"/>
took hold of the wainſcot, and from thence the floor and the furniture. In ſhort, about two o'clock in the morning, whilſt all the family were aſleep, the whole houſe was in flames. See, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, how heaven has puniſhed them! For the ſake of eating a paltry crumpet, they have reduced their father's houſe to cinders! Now they lament; they aſk pardon: they are almoſt dead with grief: but does all this avail? The fire has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed their whole property: they could neither ſave furniture, papers, or money. Scarcely could the young ladies eſcape with only a ſlight cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them: and Mr. Falſton himſelf, was near loſing his life. He is terribly burnt in many parts of his body; and muſt have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt of the flames, had it not been for the courage of one of his ſervants. What will now become of the pride of theſe young ladies? Yeſterday ſo rich, to-day ſo poor! They treated the peaſants with contempt, becauſe they had not fine houſes. To-day they feel it as a favour, that theſe very peaſants will, out of pity, receive them into their cottages. In how ſhort a time may pride be humbled! Oh ſurely, it is a ſad thing not to treat our inferiors with affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when we are liable ourſelves to ſtand in need of the compaſſion of the loweſt of them!</p>
                     <p>This letter is already ſo long, that I fear to be troubleſome to you, my dear mamma: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, though I hardly dare tell you what I have done, I have yet ſomething to ſay to you. Will you pardon your Emily? Oh, yes, you are ſo good and ſo compaſſionate! The poor Miſs Falſtons have loſt all their clothes in the

I could wiſh to have ſent her more; but all that I poſſeſs belongs to you; I therefore cannot diſpoſe of it, without your conſent. I muſt entreat you to approve of the liberty that I have taken; and I promiſe in future to be the better oeconomiſt for it. You have no occaſion to replace what I have given. Thanks to your goodneſs, I have enough left. Adieu, my dear mamma. Embrace my papa for me: and both of you be aſſured of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and tenderneſs.</p>

                     <p>You have been informed, by Emily's letter to mamma, of the cruel misfortune which has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen Mr. Falſton; but not the whole of it.

Emily could only tell you of the houſe and effects; but he is alſo on the point of loſing his laſt ſhilling. He has creditors, who forbore to preſs him, whilſt he was rich; but now that his ſecurity ſeems doubtful, they inſiſt upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without delay, and have already threatened him with a ſeizure of, all his property. On a viſit, which I paid him, I heard him ſay to Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the attorney, that all his debts did not amount to more than two hundred pounds. This is but a ſmall ſum. Muſt he, for want of this, after having ſuffered ſo terrible a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, be deprived of the only means left him of breeding up his family, and be himſelf a prey to want, in his old age? Heaven forbid that we ſhould ſuffer it! Now, papa, I'll tell you what I have thought: the legacy which my uncle left me, is, you know, five thouſand pounds. I think this a great ſum. It is in your hands, and you may diſpoſe of it. I ſurely may give up two hundred pounds to extricate an honeſt man from ſuch an embarraſſment. I ſhall be rich enough after, as you have the goodneſs to add, every year, the intereſt to the principal of this legacy. I entreat, papa, that you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe my requeſt. It gives me a thouſand times more pleaſure than the two hundred pounds ever can. Oh! if I ſhould but preſerve from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence an unhappy man, and his two children, what a happineſs this will be for me! Permit me to reſemble you on this occaſion, you who are ſo beneficent. Do not you inſtruct me to be ſo? If you were here, I would throw myſelf at your feet: I would ardently ſupplicate—

                     <p>OH! my dear mamma, poor Charles has met with a ſad accident! his leg is ſcalded ſo badly, that he is not able to walk: it is all owing to Edward's aukwardneſs; he threw a tea-kettle of boiling water over him. Never, no never, was ſeen ſuch patience and goodneſs as my friend diſplayed on this occaſion. Any one elſe would have been in a paſſion with his brother, and have loaded him with reproaches; but Charles, on the contrary, only ſought to conceal the pain which he felt. Do not afflict yourſelf, Edward, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, ſaid he, it is not very bad: but we ſoon perceived that he ſuffered more than he was willing to confeſs, for his leg became ſo much ſwelled, that we were obliged to cut off his ſtocking with a pair of ſciſſars. Emily burſt into tears:
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:045437_0602_10202B83D55D5470"/>
ſee, ſaid ſhe, to Edward, what you have done by your heedleſſneſs; you have, perhaps, lamed your brother for the reſt of his life. I wiſh this misfortune had befallen you, inſtead of him. It had better have happened to no one, ſaid Charles, interrupting his ſiſter. But come, my dear Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is not worth ſo much concern. I ſhall ſoon be cured: Edward did not do it by deſign; it is a misfortune; but had it been ſtill greater, we muſt have conſoled ourſelves. No, replied Emily, I cannot forgive his want of care: look at him too; he ſtands there like a poſt, inſtead of flying to ſend for a ſurgeon. There is no occaſion for one, ſaid Charles; give me only a cloth and ſome cold water to bathe my leg, and in a few days it will be well. But, ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to Emily and me, Mr. Bartlet will ſoon be here; I beg you will not tell him that Edward had any hand in this accident; and you, my dear brother, give me your hand; your affliction is more painful to me than this little burn, of which I now ſcarcely feel the ſmart.</p>
                     <p>What a happineſs it is to be thus maſter of one's ſelf! We may well admire Charles, when he can behave in this manner: at the ſame time, I feel, how uſeleſs it is to fret and be impatient, and that being tranſported with anger will not remove the evil.</p>
                     <p>But the pleaſure which I have in writing to you, makes me forget that Charles has intreated me to keep him company. Adieu, my dear mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; permit me to leave you to return to my friend. I ſalute my little ſiſter, and conjure her

                     <p>Emily aſked him yeſterday, if he did not find himſelf very ſad, under his confinement. Why ſhould I make myſelf ſo, anſwered he, it would only aggravate the pain that I ſuffer; I had much rather amuſe myſelf with the hopes of being ſoon cured: beſides, would it not be a ſhame if I could not comfort myſelf under ſo ſmall a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune as this? I have reaſon to expect many greater in the courſe of my life, and theſe ſlight accidents will teach me, in time, to exerciſe my courage and reſolution againſt the approach of greater. But it is very hard though, ſaid Emily,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:045437_0604_10202B8B25D14640"/>
to be forced to ſuffer ſo much for the fault of another. It is true, anſwered Charles, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it had been by my own, for then my brother would not have had ſo much uneaſineſs about it.</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>But are you not weary of ſtaying ſo long in your chamber, without daring to move?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>How can I be wearied, when I have the happineſs of receiving ſo many affecting proofs of your kindneſs to me?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>It is your goodneſs, my dear brother, which makes you pay attention to them: but you have narrowly eſcaped loſing your leg by this accident.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>This ought to conſole me under it. I have much reaſon to complain, indeed, when I ſee ſo many people condemned to walk on crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es their whole lives!</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>I really believe brother, you would have found out the ſecret of comforting yourſelf, even if it had been neceſſary to cut your leg off.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>It is needleſs to ſay that I ſhould have been much afflicted at ſuch a misfortune, but as it could not have happened to me unleſs by the will of heaven, I ſhould have endeavoured to ſubmit my own to that, in order to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſtrength, to ſupport me under the affliction.</p>
                        <p>What do you ſay, mamma? to think like Charles, is not this the only way to combat mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune? I yet remember the fatal day on which I loſt my father. You wept; I was inconſolable; but our tears and lamentations could not bring him back to life. You took me by the hand, and ſaid, Come, my ſon, let us pray to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and he will comfort us; I ſoon ſaw that
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:045437_0605_10202B8CB9335B38"/>
you became more tranquil; and I found alſo my own heart relieved by prayer. I found this a ſure means of alleviating diſtreſs; I will ſubmit therefore to the decrees of Providence, whatever evils may befal me; and hope that I ſhall bear them with conſtancy, when I reflect that it is the will of God which inflicts them; of that God to whom I ſay daily, "<hi>thy will be done.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>But why do I remind you of theſe ſad events, my dear mamma; you, in whom I would wiſh to excite no ſentiments, but thoſe of joy?—If I have afflicted you, I know but of one remedy; it is to take my little ſiſter in your arms, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs her, and tell her of your tenderneſs and of mine for her; I am ſure that her ſweet ſmiles will give you back to peace and happineſs.</p>

                     <p>MR. and Mrs. Grandiſon are juſt arrived, my dear mamma: we are all overjoyed; even the very ſervants are tranſported with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Is not this a good ſign, when domeſtics
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:045437_0606_10202B92751E30B8"/>
rejoice at the return of their maſters? When I grow up, I am determined, I will be as humane as Mr. Grandiſon, ſince there is ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in making one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s ſelf beloved. But I muſt return to my friend Charles. Mr. Bartlet aſked us this morning after breakfaſt if we would take a turn in the park; tho' Charles finds himſelf much recovered at preſent, he begged to be excuſed being of the party. My burn is not entirely cured, ſaid he; and I wiſh that my papa and mamma, at their return, ſhould not perceive that any thing ails me. If I ſhould walk now, perhaps my leg may ſuffer from the fatigue, and my parents will not fail to obſerve it. This will afflict them, and I would rather deprive myſelf of the pleaſure of a walk than cauſe them the leaſt uneaſineſs. You are in the right, ſaid Mr. Bartlet, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this foreſight; it does honour to your heart. Charles remained in his chamber, and Edward, Emily and I walked till noon.</p>
                     <p>At our return we found Charles waiting for us in the parlour below: we were a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at this, as he had told us that he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend quitting his chamber. He had ſuffered ſome pain by coming down ſtairs, but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of meeting his papa and mamma ſomething the ſooner by it, was, ſaid he, well worth that. He had ordered the dinner earlier, that we might be more at liberty to receive them. With what alacrity did he fly down the ſteps, when he heard their carriage enter the court-yard! With what joy did he throw himſelf into the arms of his father and mother! Scarcely could he force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:045437_0607_10202B9402E02908"/>
from them, to give place to us. You would have been aſtoniſhed, had you ſeen with what grace he gave his hand to his mother, to conduct her into the parlour: it put me in mind, my dear mother, of the joy that I ſhall feel when I return to you: it will be as lively as that of my friend Charles, I promiſe you. But I muſt recount to you a converſation which has juſt paſſed between him and his brother: you will judge whether it be to his honour, or not, without my anticipating.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Grandiſon were retired to their apartments to put off their riding-dreſſes, whilſt Edward, Charles, and Emily, and I, remained in the parlour. Charles had deſired his ſiſter to play us a piece on her harpſicord, Emily had readily complied, but ſcarcely had ſhe began when we were interrupted, by the fall of a piece of china, which was broken into a thouſand pieces.</p>

                        <p>He will do very well then, brother: when you commit a fault, are not you very glad to have a friend to ſpeak for you? How many puniſhments has Charles ſaved us both? Do put yourſelf in the place of the poor ſervant.</p>

                        <p>What they pleaſe, do you ſay? I believe there never were ſervants who broke any thing by way of amuſement: it is always by accident, and in that caſe, they ought to meet with allowance.</p>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>How, Edward! juſt now you were quite eager to inform our parents of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and now you wiſh to conceal it from them, only becauſe you were the occaſion of it yourſelf. Is this juſt? You will eaſily obtain your pardon; the caſe is a very excuſeable one. But let it teach you not to be ſo ſevere on a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for an inadvertency, when we are ſo often liable to the ſame ourſelves.</p>
                        <p>Charles had ſcarcely ſaid this, when Mr. and Mrs. Grandiſon came down. He related the adventure of the china-plate with ſo much wit and addreſs, and gave ſuch a turn to the whole affair, that they found more to laugh at than to
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:045437_0611_10202BA0324483D8"/>
be diſpleaſed with; and as for Edward, he was delighted to be ſo well rid of the buſineſs. Oh! mamma, what a happineſs it is to have a brother like my friend! I hope I ſhall alſo have as good an advocate in my little ſiſter, if ever I ſhould need her eloquence on a like occaſion.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE nothing new to tell you of to-day, my dear mamma, but I expect, that to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will afford many intereſting things to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with: it is the birth-day of Charles. Edward tells me, that we are to be entertained like kings, becauſe it is his brother's cuſtom to give a treat to all the young people of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood on that day. Emily, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſays, that he will invite no one this year; and that he has already formed the reſolution of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the money which his father will give him, in buying books of inſtruction and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. I, for my part, wiſh he may do this laſt: for the company will leave us when the
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:045437_0612_10202BA1C1761D70"/>
day concludes, but the books will always remain with us.</p>
                     <p>I think I do not betray his confidence, when I tell you that he has privately trained up a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtarling, which he intends as a preſent to his ſiſter, until ſhe receives one which her aunt is to ſend her. He has accuſtomed it already to eat out of his hand, and to fly out of its cage. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does not expect this preſent, and ſhe will be ſurprized when ſhe receives it. The bird be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins already to repeat her name very prettily. I will alſo train up one which ſhall continually repeat to me your's and my ſiſter's: not that I have occaſion for this to make me think of you, for happy as I am here, this is the chief pleaſure that I enjoy whilſt ſo far removed from thoſe whom I love the beſt in the world.</p>

                     <p>We roſe this morning very early: our cuſtom is, to read every day one or two chapters from the Old Teſtament, before we come down to breakfaſt.

                        <p>After placing an armed chair for his father, he reſumed his book, and read with a diſtinct voice. When he had done, Mr. Grandiſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed much ſatisfaction in his manner of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it is a talent, added he, much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to acquire than is commonly imagined. The generality of readers pronounce their words either with a ſnuffle or a whine, without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſenſe of what they read, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tireſome to their hearers. One ought particularly to read hiſtory in a natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected tone, as if the recital were made by

But come, this is a day of happineſs, and it ſhall be ſpent joyfully. I give you what you will find in this paper to make uſe of, if you chuſe, in entertaining your young friends. It is already near nine o'clock; finiſh dreſſing, and come down with William: your mother waits for us. Farewel: I will go forward, and tell her that you are coming.</p>
                        <p>Oh! mamma, what a heartfelt ſatisfaction there is in thus rendering one's ſelf worthy the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of a good father. How delighted did Mr. Grandiſon appear to be with his ſon, whilſt tears of joy and tenderneſs filled his eyes! On the other hand, how much muſt good parents ſuffer whoſe children are unworthy of this love! Oh! I will always follow the example of my friend, whom God himſelf muſt love. How many things have I to ſay to you, if my letter were not already too long; but you ſhall loſe nothing by it: I will keep them all for another, which I will begin to-morrow morning, as ſoon as I riſe. How much do I wiſh to be with you, to expreſs my duty and affection to you as I ought. My letters, I always fear, are inſufficient for that purpoſe. Oh! if my little ſiſter could but ſay this for me, ſhe who has the happineſs to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you! My deareſt mamma, think that I am careſſing you whenever ſhe is. We will have but one heart between us, which ſhall be filled with love for you.</p>

                     <p>I BEGIN this letter, my dear mamma, where I left off yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>Before we went down to breakfaſt, Charles opened the paper which his father had given him. He found four guineas in it: he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ſeen ſo much money at once. After conſidering over it a little, he turned to me: William, ſaid he, I ſhould like to know your opinion: there are few young people in our neighbourhood, whoſe ſociety will give us much pleaſure; they are for the moſt part ſo fond of noiſe and racket, that their company is inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Young Friendly, is the only one whoſe character is at all ſuited to mine; and he has been gone theſe three days to London with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What do you adviſe me to do with this money? Were I in your place, ſaid I, I would keep it, in order to purchaſe ſomething uſeful: three or four hours of playing and dancing will ſoon paſs away, but ſome books or prints will be a daily amuſement to us. But will not you
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:045437_0617_10202BB230596548"/>
be diſappointed, ſaid he, if we ſpend this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ordinary way without company? No, ſurely, anſwered I, I am happy enough in your ſociety. If that be the caſe, ſaid he, taking me by the hand, I may follow my firſt idea. By this time we were at the entrance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Mrs. Grandiſon embraced her ſon with tenderneſs, and gave him her bleſſing. After breakfaſt we remained alone with Mr. Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Charles took his father by the hand, and ſaid to him, may I aſk you one queſtion, papa?</p>

But do you know whom I have choſen to celebrate it? they are the poor of our neighbourhood. I have procured a liſt of all the honeſt and neceſſitous families around us. How much will theſe poor people be rejoiced at the little feaſt which I ſhall prepare for them! The ſons of our rich neighbours whom I might have invited, enjoy ſuperfluities every day as I do; but thoſe, whom I mean to regale to-day, often want a morſel of bread. How joyful they will be over the feaſt which I ſhall give them! and I ſhall have more pleaſure in their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than I ſhould have had in all the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I might have taken with my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                     <p>YESTERDAY, my dear mamma, Charles gave his entertainment to the poor people of the pariſh. They were feaſted with plenty of roaſt beef, plumb-pudding, and the vegetables of the ſeaſon. I never had more pleaſure than in ſeeing theſe good people regale themſelves. Joy and gratitude were painted on their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances. They drank our healths in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beer, repeating at every draught, Long life and happineſs to Charles Grandiſon! The eyes of Charles were frequently filled with tears. During dinner-time, he took notice of a poor man, almoſt blind with age, who, he fancied, was not ſufficiently attended to by the reſt: he called
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:045437_0620_10202BB83B4C8AC0"/>
to a young one, who ſat next him, ſaying, take care of that good man; he is one of my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal gueſts; I want to ſee him eat with a good appetite. Father, ſaid he, you deſerve the firſt place in my feſtival. The young ones ought to honour your old age, that they themſelves may be honoured in their turn, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old.</p>
                     <p>When the repaſt was ended, Charles divided the remainder of his money among his gueſts. Yes, mamma, he gave them all that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his father. You will readily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what bleſſings they beſtowed upon him. He was ſo moved with tenderneſs, that he could not contain himſelf. He took me by the hand, and we went off together, without being able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us to ſpeak a word. It was not till we had entered the houſe, that he ſaid to me, Well, my dear friend, can there be a greater pleaſure than in comforting the unfortunate? Oh, no, anſwered I, throwing my arms round his neck, you could not have given me a more delightful entertainment. I felt myſelf as much affected as my friend. Alas! thought I, how much are the poor to be pitied! They often want the firſt neceſſaries of life, whilſt we are ſeated every day at tables, covered with delicacies, where our only trouble is how to chuſe the moſt delicious. I ſhall, from this day, be the more grateful to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whom we receive theſe favours, as well as more compaſſionate to thoſe who ſuffer for the want of them.

We expected to paſs the evening among ourſelves, in our ordinary amuſements; but what was our ſurprize, when, on returning to the houſe, we found there a large company! Mr. Grandiſon had invited all the gentlemen of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, with their children, to celebrate the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of his ſon. We had a pretty concert; and after it, a ball. Charles and his ſiſter did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. How much I wiſhed that I could ſing and play as they did; but you know, mamma, it is not my fault that I cannot. You were not able to give me the advantage of maſters. At preſent, I partake of that benefit, with my friends, and I hope to profit ſo much by it, as to be able one day to equal them.</p>
                     <p>I am obliged to break off here, my dear mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, being juſt called upon to partake of a little tour into the country. I expect a great deal of pleaſure from this tour, which I will not fail to give you an account of in my next: but I forgot to tell you, that Charles made his preſent yeſterday to his ſiſter, of the little ſtarling, in return for a pocket-book which ſhe had preſented him with. Emily is already quite fond of her bird. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw ſo diverting an animal. I wiſh my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could ſee all the care that Emily takes of it; but I wiſh, yet more, to be with her, for then I ſhould alſo be with you, my dear mamma.</p>

                     <p>WE had not ſo much pleaſure yeſterday as we expected, my dear mamma. The weather was very fine at our ſetting out; but a violent ſhower of rain coming on, obliged us to take ſhelter, in a very indifferent little inn, whilſt the ſtorm laſted. Edward grumbled, and put himſelf out of humour. Emily was vexed: and, as for me, I muſt confeſs to you, I was not very well pleaſed. Charles, who is always maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of himſelf, was the only one of us, whom this little accident did not diſconcert, as you will perceive by the following dialogue.</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>
                        <p>How unlucky it is, that this rain is come; all our pleaſure is at an end now.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Perhaps not: we will have our tea here, and by that time the rain may ceaſe. If it ſhould not, we can eaſily ſend for the coach, that my ſiſter may not be obliged to walk through the wet.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>I thank you, brother, but I would much rather it were dry.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>I do not doubt it; a walk would have been more agreeable to you. But our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:045437_0623_10202BC27B415B78"/>
was wiſhing for rain this morning, becauſe the plants and trees have need of it. Now, whoſe wiſhes do you think ought to prevail, his or your's?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Edward, </speaker>
                        <stage>(with a contemptuous ſmile.)</stage>
                        <p>Oh, thoſe of the gardener, no doubt.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, truly, I think ſo too; for without rain, the trees muſt ſuffer much from the drought; and would you not be very ſorry if we ſhould have no fruit? And what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the poor, ſhould the heat deſtroy the corn, and if a bad harveſt ſhould raiſe the price of bread?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>Oh! they will be ſadly to be pitied.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Let us rejoice then at the rain, which may prevent theſe evils. Beſides, if it deprives us of the pleaſures of our walk, it will afford us others in return: we ſhall behold the verdure more freſh and brilliant, and the flowers in our parterre will bloom with redoubled luſtre.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>Enough, brother; you have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me. I am no longer angry at the rain. Let it fall if it will, I ſhall find no fault.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>
                        <p>One day longer would have made no great difference: it would have been better for us, if it had not fallen before to-night, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, and then we might have had our walk to-day.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>But thoſe who happen to be obliged to travel either to-night or to-morrow, had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould fall now. Would you have the weather governed according to your fancy?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>Charles is in the right; the deſires of different people are ſo contradictory to each other, that it is impoſſible all the world ſhould be pleaſed.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Believe me, we ſhould be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy if all our prayers were granted us: but to return to the weather. What a ſmall matter it is, that we ſhould be deprived of our pleaſures for one day, in compariſon to the good which this rain will produce to others, as well as to ourſelves.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>But look at the poor birds; I cannot help pitying them.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>They know where to ſeek ſhelter when the rain incommodes them: beſides, as my papa ſays, there is a kind of oil in their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which repels the wet.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>I am glad of that: it ſeems to me, that every thing around us is very wiſely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>The rain now became more violent; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Mrs. Grandiſon did not forget us; the carriage was ſent, and we were ſoon conducted back to the houſe. Emily amuſed herſelf with her ſtarling. Charles and I made a party at ſhuttle-cock, to ſupply the exerciſe of a walk. As for Edward, he remained in the dumps, and could find out no way of conſoling himſelf, but by teazing his dog. I have learned a good leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from him to-day, for I ſee, when we ſuffer our humours to get the better of us, on every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſappointment, we are ſure to be very often unhappy. Well then, I will do my beſt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate myſelf to every miſchance, that may
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:045437_0625_10202BC9C4329D90"/>
befal me. There is one, however, to which I cannot be inſenſible; it is that of being ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from you and my little ſiſter. I ſtretch forth my arms, to embrace you; without the power of doing it. A thouſand times in the day, I fancy that you are doing the ſame by me; but, alas! we can only draw near to each other by our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. But what then, are not <hi>they</hi> ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lively and tender to re-unite us?</p>

                     <p>We had ſcarcely been half an hour in bed, when we heard a great noiſe. What is it, ſaid I, to my friend? I know not, anſwered he. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſaid I, ſome thieves may have broken into the houſe. At this inſtant, we heard Edward cry out violently. Charles immediately leaped out of bed, haſtily threw ſomething over him, and ſeizing his ſword, Follow me, William, ſaid he, it is in Edward's chamber. I lighted a candle
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:045437_0626_10202BCB4F26DC48"/>
at our lamp, and we went up into his brother's room, to ſee what was the matter. Charles did not diſcover the leaſt ſign of fear; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth to you, I trembled all over. On entering the room, we ſaw Edward lying on the ground under a table, which had fallen on him, with all his books and papers. After having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in raiſing him up, Charles ſaid, What is the matter, brother? what has happened to you?</p>

                        <p>No, indeed; I was quite awake.</p>

                        <p>It was thus: you know, I do not like to ſleep with a light in my chamber; I had juſt put out my candle, and got into bed, when I heard ſomething tread ſoftly on the floor; I roſe up on my ſeat, and drawing aſide the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſaw clearly in the corner of the room, two lights, which appeared ſometimes great, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmall, and which moved about.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>

                        <p>The dazzling of my eyes, indeed! I tell you it was a real object; I ſaw it as plain as I ſee you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, and what followed?</p>

                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>
                        <p>I remained perfectly ſtill, hardly daring to breathe; at length the lights were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and I heard ſomething trot about the chamber, and then throw itſelf violently againſt the door.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>
                        <p>How could I? terror had ſtopped my mouth. For a moment all was ſtill: then
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:045437_0629_10202BD426470E98"/>
I heard ſomething glide againſt the wall; and by the pale light of the moon, I ſaw a great phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, all in white, ſtanding againſt the window-curtain. It ſeemed every moment to become taller and larger. I put my hand before my eyes, left I ſhould ſee ſomething ſtill more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I crept ſoftly out of bed, in order to eſcape out of the chamber; but the phantom, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, began to leap about, and then came up cloſe to me: in my fright, I fell againſt the table, which I overturned upon me, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the ſame time, a loud cry, which was what you heard. But huſh, I think I hear it again.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>Charles immediately began ſearching into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner; under the bed, the bureau, and the drawers; at length he cried out, Here is the ghoſt; I have found him. And what at laſt was this ghoſt? you will never gueſs, my dear mamma: it was no other than a great white cat, belonging to the tenant, which had ſtolen into the houſe, and ran into Edward's chamber. At the ſight of it, we all three burſt into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Charles rallied his brother on his creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the cat made her eſcape as ſoon as ſhe ſaw the door open: Edward appeared, however,
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:045437_0630_10202BD713EB22E8"/>
a little confuſed at this adventure. I cannot comprehend, ſaid he, how this cat could appear to me of ſuch a formidable ſize. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>fear,</hi> anſwered Charles, to repreſent things falſely, and to magnify them to our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. But the two flambeaus which I ſaw? They were the eyes of the cat, which appeared, either large or ſmall, as ſhe opened or ſhut her eye-lids. Believe me, all the ſtories that we hear of apparitions are like this of our cat. Could we trace them to their ſource, we ſhould find their cauſes quite natural.</p>
                     <p>After this converſation, we returned to our beds, and ſlept very well the remainder of the night. This morning at breakfaſt, we diverted Mr. and Mrs. Grandiſon with our night-alarm: they beſtowed great praiſes on the coolneſs and reſolution of Charles. I muſt confeſs, I never ſaw his preſence of mind fail him on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As to Edward, and me, we were not the laſt to laugh at our own weakneſs: indeed, I am aſhamed not to have ſhewn more courage. I hope, that this little hiſtory will ſerve to amuſe my ſiſter, and to inſpire her with more boldneſs on a like occaſion, than has been ſhewn by her brother.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, my dear mamma; you do not write to me ſo often as I deſire, or as I have occaſion for. Emily talks to me frequently of my ſiſter: ſhe wants to know, if you are as well ſatisfied with her as ever. Write particularly about her, I beſeech you, both to gratify my own affection, as well as the enquiries of my young friend, who
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:045437_0631_10202BDB642CE128"/>
vouchſafes, to intereſt herſelf for a little girl whom I love ſo much. Embrace her for me, and convince her how tender the regard is, that I bear her.</p>

                     <p>I SENSIBLY feel your tender reproach, my dear ſon, that I do not write to you often enough: were I at liberty to give myſelf up to it, no occupation would be more pleaſing to me; but you may eaſily conceive how much my time is engaged by the affairs of my family, and the attention that I think it neceſſary to pay to your little ſiſter: I am obliged, you know, to inſtruct her myſelf, not having a fortune ſufficient to procure her the inſtruction of different maſters. But my cares are well repaid by her happy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: ſhe learns every thing with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt facility; her induſtry is not to be repulſed by any difficulty; and I am every day aſtoniſhed, at the rapid progreſs of her underſtanding; nor, do
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:045437_0632_10202BDE546AE208"/>
her ſentiments afford me leſs cauſe of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It would be difficult to conceive, a heart, of more rectitude and ſenſibility. All that you have written, to me, from time to time about E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, pleaſes her infinitely. The pretty letter which this young lady wrote to her mamma, on the ſubject of the poor people who ſuffered by a fire, and of which you ſent me a copy, has made a lively impreſſion on her. She finds ſomething to ſay about it every day. Oh! my dear mamma, ſaid ſhe to me yeſterday, had I been rich, I would have done like Emily; how much pleaſure muſt ſhe have had in relieving thoſe poor Miſs Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons! Yes, my child, ſaid I, ſhe has reaſon to be happy, and I am ſo alſo, in ſeeing you capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of taking part in the troubles of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it is a proof of a good heart: and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition gives you a right to expect the ſame ſympathy, in others toward you. Theſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate ſentiments, are neceſſary among mankind, for the mutual conſolation of their troubles. This is very true, mamma, ſaid ſhe, for when I ſuffer any uneaſineſs, if my little friends appear afflicted for me, it leſſens the evil by one half, at leaſt; beſides, I am ſure to love them the better for it, and that is always a pleaſure. Is not this a very delicate ſentiment, my dear ſon, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether charming for its ſimplicity? I hear ſuch, continually, from her, which excites in me the tendereſt emotions; nor am I leſs affected, by thoſe which you diſplay in your letters: I feel that they come from the bottom of your heart; and it is with joy that I receive them back into mine. They ſoften my afflictions, and prove to
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:045437_0633_10202BDFF8FFE758"/>
me that I have not loſt all that I poſſeſſed on earth, when I loſt my huſband, ſince my children remain to cheriſh me with as much tenderneſs as I have love for them. Yes, it is to you and your ſiſter that I commit the care of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It will not be a painful one to you; for to ſee you made happy by your virtues, will not fail to render me ſo.</p>
                     <p>All Mrs. Grandiſon's letters to me are filled with the moſt flattering accounts of you. The friendſhip which has long united us, has, no doubt, its ſhare in theſe encomiums: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I am willing to believe that you have ſo lively a ſenſe of her goodneſs, as to guard you from doing any thing which may juſtly incur her reprehenſion; it would indeed be ſhameful in you to deſerve it, having before you ſo perfect a model as Charles. We never love thoſe long whom we cannot eſteem: continue then to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good example of your friend. A young man endowed with ſuch noble qualities, ought to inſpire you with a laudable emulation; and there is no way, by which you can repay his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, but by endeavouring to make yourſelf worthy of it.</p>
                     <p>I ſee how much you ſuffer in not being able to imitate his beneficence. What pleaſure ſhould I feel, could I put it in your power to exerciſe this attractive virtue! cultivate it, nevertheleſs, in your breaſt, againſt the moment that fortune may enable you to follow theſe generous emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; in the mean time, my dear, receive the trifle that I ſend you: I wiſh it were more, but
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:045437_0634_10202BE450A43160"/>
it is all that the preſent ſtate of my affairs will permit. I have tranſmitted to Mr. Grandiſon whatever is wanting for your neceſſaries: what I ſend you, is deſtined for your pleaſures: and theſe, I know, conſiſt in ſuch things as are moſt worthy of a ſenſible and generous heart. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well my ſon. I embrace you with all the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of a mother, whoſe felicity depends on the tenderneſs and virtues of her children.</p>

                     <p>A THOUSAND thanks to you, my dear mamma, for the preſent which you have ſent me. A trifle do you call it! permit me to contradict you, in this; I, for my part, think it a great ſum. You are not rich, and yet you make me a preſent of two guineas for my pleaſure: ten times as much, were you poſſeſſed of a large fortune, would be leſs to me. But alas! I fear that you may have put yourſelf to ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, in order to enrich me; and this thought interrupts the joy that I feel in receiving theſe
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:045437_0635_10202BE5D8DF1C78"/>
marks of your bounty. Be at leaſt perſuaded, that I am ſenſible of all the value of this gift, and that I know how to employ it, in a manner with which you will be ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>I muſt own to you, that I felt a little proud when I related to Emily what you wrote to me of my ſiſter. I ſeemed, as if I valued myſelf more on her perfections, than on thoſe which I might acquire myſelf. Emily appeared flattered that her conduct had merited your approbation. She becomes every day more ſenſible and more amiable. Since my little ſiſter knows ſo well how to profit by what I write to you concerning my friend, I will relate to you another adventure which has lately happened to her. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs freely, that ſhe was a little in fault at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but the concluſion does her ſo much honour, that I cannot forbear relating the whole to you as it happened. The poor child was yeſterday in the parlour with Edward; they amuſed themſelves by turns, in playing little tunes on the harpſichord. You know, there is in this parlour, a japan cabinet, filled with very valuable china. Emily had the curioſity to open it, to look at ſome Chineſe figures which Mrs. Grandiſon had lately preſented to her. She took one in her hand in order to examine it nearer. Edward, who is ever at ſome unlucky trick, cried out, ſuddenly, mamma is coming. Emily, fearing to be caught in the fact, haſtily put back the china into the cabinet; but in her fear and precipitation, threw down a cup, which broke into a thouſand pieces. She was ſeized with conſternation. It was a cup of great value,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:045437_0636_10202BEA95F3FAD8"/>
which ſhe knew her mamma preſerved with the utmoſt care, as it made part of a ſet, which was only uſed on particular occaſions. Edward quitted the harpſichord, on hearing Emily cry; and this is the converſation which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>

                        <p>Emily was juſt going out, when ſhe ſaw her mamma enter the room: ſhe trembled, and changed colour; and before ſhe was able to ſpeak, burſt into a torrent of tears. She expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſharp reproach: what then was her ſurprize, when Mrs. Grandiſon, who had overheard all that had paſſed, took her tenderly in her arms, and careſſing her, ſaid, you are a good girl, my dear Emily, I do not know what it is that you have broken, but if it be the moſt valuable piece of china in my cabinet, I forgive you, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of your courage and frankneſs. As for you, Sir, continued ſhe, addreſſing herſelf to Edward, go up into your chamber, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the leſſon that your young ſiſter has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you.

The relation of this adventure will not, I think, be uſeleſs to my ſiſter; not that I ſuſpect her of ever being capable of deceiving you.

                     <head>LETTER XII. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</head>
                     <p>I CONGRATULATE myſelf, my dear mamma, on having it in my power, to make you acquainted with a new inſtance of the moderation and generoſity of my friend. No, I cannot often enough repeat it. There is not, I believe, in the whole univerſe, a young man of ſo noble a character.</p>
                     <p>The earl of—made him a preſent, a few days ago, of a fine dog, of a very rare and uncommon kind. Young Falkland, one of our neighbours, had before this, aſked the earl ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times to give it to him, but he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it of him, becauſe this young man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for his ill-treatment of his dogs. He
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:045437_0640_10202BF4F3D98770"/>
has no other pleaſure than in tormenting them; either by the moſt cruel diſcipline, or by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them to fight till they tear each other to pieces. He has already above a dozen in his houſe: you will think, perhaps, that this was ſufficient; but no ſuch thing: he has beſides a collection of all ſorts of animals, particularly cats, monkies, and parrots; and with theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he paſſes one half of the day. He muſt have, methinks, a moſt contracted mind, thus to laviſh his time in ſuch a miſerable occupation, inſtead of devoting it to the ſtudy of the arts and ſciences. Notwithſtanding the multitude he has of theſe beaſts about him, he was quite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged when he found the earl had given his dog to another, after refuſing it to him. What was the conſequence of this? Charles had ſcarcely been five days in poſſeſſion of it, when the poor creature was found dead in a corner of the houſe. It was not till yeſterday that we diſcovered, by means of one of Falkland's ſervants, that he had contrived to get him poiſoned, out of ſpite and jealouſy. What monſters are there among mankind! I ſay monſters; the term is not too ſtrong. Yes, my dear mamma, I call him a monſter, who can deprive another of what he cannot poſſeſs himſelf, with no other view than to give him pain. But the following converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which paſſed between Edward, Charles and me, as we were walking in the garden yeſterday, will ſhew you how my friend revenged this piece of knavery.</p>
                     <p>

I was lamenting the death of the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I am very much afflicted, ſaid he, alſo: I could hardly have believed that the loſs of a dog would have given me ſo much trouble: but this was an animal of ſuch ſingular beauty, and he was already become quite attached to me.</p>

                        <p>It was a ſhocking action on the part of Falkland, to poiſon him: I would never forgive him as long as I lived, were I in your place.</p>

                        <p>I do not hate him, but I deſpiſe his character; and I pity him yet more for being the ſlave of ſuch violent and deteſtable paſſions; to deſtroy an innocent animal with no other view, than to deprive another of it.

                        <p>Pſhaw; this is not enough. Shall I cut off his ears, Charles? you have only to ſay the word.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>I'll take care then how I ſay that word: his ears will not bring me back my dog.</p>

                        <p>Well then, I have another ſcheme. Falkland has a dozen ſpaniels and greyhounds; we have nothing to do but to poiſon them in our turn; he deſerves this revenge.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>That is not my affair, I ſhall not take his puniſhment upon me; it is enough for me to leave him to his conſcience.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall be curious to know what my papa will think of this adventure. I do not wonder now at his always being ſo careful to keep us from too ſtrict an intimacy with this young profligate.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>It is a proof to me, that my father underſtands the heart; and I learn from it, that we ought to conſult our parents in the choice of our friends: as they have more experience than we have, they know better how to diſtinguiſh characters: by their wife advice, I hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve myſelf from dangerous connexions, by which I might be corrupted. But, Edward, I think, we ought not to acquaint my father with this baſe action of Falkland's.</p>

                        <p>Juſt then the gardener brought us a ladder. Charles climbed into the tree himſelf, and found the parrot entangled with his wings between two branches, and held faſt: he ſoon diſengaged him, and immediately charged one of the ſervants to carry him to young Falkland.</p>

                     <p>WE aſſiſted yeſterday, my dear mamma, in gathering in the fruits of autumn. The air was mild, and the ſky ſerene: nothing was heard on all ſides but ſprightly ſongs, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the fife and violin. It was a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight, to behold between the trees young boys climbing to the higheſt branches to gather the fruit, whilſt the women and girls received them below in their aprons, in order to fill their baſkets. We too were employed, in ſtripping
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:045437_0646_10202C08239738A8"/>
thoſe branches which hung within our reach. All theſe labours carry with them an air of feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which fills the heart with pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved ſome little country girls, meanly dreſſed, earneſtly look at us over the hedge. When we had finiſhed our buſineſs, one of them beckoned to the gardener, and we could perceive her talking to him in a ſupplicating manner, at the ſame time, caſting frequent looks at my friend. Charles perceived it, and when ſhe had done ſpeaking, called the gardener to him. I will give you their converſation, which will be the beſt way of relating the thing.</p>

                        <p>I will tell you, Sir. Every body here knows the goodneſs of your heart. She has been aſking me to beg ſome fruit of you, for her mother, who is ſick at home.</p>

                        <p>Does ſhe aſk it for her mother? She is a good girl for that. Go and give her as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apples as ſhe can carry. It will be a pleaſure to me, to reward her for loving thoſe to whom ſhe owes her life.</p>

                        <p>It is true, Sir, we have hardly room to hold all our hoards.</p>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>

                        <p>Ah, my dear young maſter, it is not without reaſon that you are ſo beloved and honoured. You are a bleſſing ſent to us by heaven. I will punctually obey you, for I know full-well, whatever you do will be approved by your parents.</p>
                        <p>Upon this, the gardener went to execute Charles' orders. Edward, having heard what had paſſed, came up to his brother, and ſaid; I don't diſapprove of your good-nature, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear to ſee the common people always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome petition to you.</p>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>But, my dear brother, if they did not aſk of us what they want, ſhould we be otherwiſe ſo attentive to their wants? We aſk our parents every day for a thouſand ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things; ſuffer then the poor, at leaſt, to lay before us their urgent neceſſities.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                        <p>Charles is very right. Would it not be a ſad thing, that we ſhould have ſo much more than we want even for our pleaſures, and that the poor ſhould be without even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries of life? I will tell mamma this evening of the ſituation of this little girl's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I am ſure ſhe will ſend her ſome aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Mr. Bartlet, who was juſt then coming up to us, overheard what Emily had ſaid, and praiſed her for her humanity.

                     <p>I DO not yet know, my dear friend, what our journey to London will produce; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our expedition has not been the moſt happy. A ſuperſtitious mind might look upon this as a bad preſage; but you and I, my dear William, thanks to the good-ſenſe of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, are in no danger of being diſturbed by vain prognoſtics. We had ſcarcely gone a few miles, before one of our horſes ſtopped ſhort, and would not advance a ſtep farther. The poſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thought to get on by exerciſing his whip, which I could not ſee without pain; I cannot bear that ſo gentle and uſeful an animal ſhould be treated hardly. However, we ſoon perceived

that the poor creature had met with a hurt in his foot, and that it was not his fault. We were therefore obliged to go gently on to the neareſt inn, where we provided ourſelves with horſes, and purſued our rout with renewed expedition, till an unlucky accident ſtopped us. In a rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged part of the road, the axletree of our chaiſe ſuddenly broke: happily we were none of us hurt; but we were obliged to get out of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and there being no houſe within a good diſtance, we had no other courſe left us, but to walk on foot. I ſhould have made myſelf very eaſy under this accident, had it not been for my concern on account of our worthy friend Mr. Bartlet: I feared much le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At length, after a half-hour's walk, we perceived to the right, a ſmall houſe at a little diſtance from the road. We were let in by an honeſt labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bowed down by the weight of years and hard work, and his wife, who appeared to be as old. We were hoſpitably received by this worthy old couple and their children. The eldeſt ſon ran to fetch a wheelwright in the neighbourhood, and then went with him to aſſiſt the poſtillion in mending the chaiſe as well as they could; which they could not complete till the evening was far advanced. As it was then too late to purſue our journey, we reſolved to paſs the night in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hut, which, under theſe circumſtances, I found as comfortable as the moſt ſuperb palace.

one of the daughters was preparing for us a ſimple repaſt, gentlemen, ſaid the old man, do not be uneaſy, we will give you up our bed, in which you may refreſh yourſelves after your fatigue. It was with difficulty that Mr. Bartlet was perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to agree to this propoſal, but at laſt, the preſſing entreaties of our hoſt and his wife pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. They had placed but two covers on the table. Mr. Bartlet perceiving it, ſaid, Have you already ſupped, my good friends?</p>
                     <p>No, Sir,</p>
                     <p>Well then, we muſt eat together; our meal will be the heartier for it.</p>

Plain as this repaſt was, I never made a better ſupper in my life, and ſlept ſo ſoundly after it, that Mr. Bartlet had ſome difficulty in waking me the next morning. I have juſt now ate an excellent breakfaſt, and take the opportunity, while Mr. Bartlet is thanking our hoſts for their hoſpitality, to write you this.

Major Arthur, whoſe life was ſaved by Charles, had repreſented your ſon to his majeſty in ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a manner, had ſpoken ſo highly of his good ſenſe, his acquirements and goodneſs of heart, as to inſpire the king with the deſire of ſeeing him; and it was after his firſt interview with him that he conferred on him theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                     <p>The earl, who introduced Charles to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and was preſent at the audience, declared that he never ſaw any one received ſo graciouſly. The king himſelf, after ordering his children into his preſence, vouchſafed to preſent them to him. Your amiable ſon anſwered all queſtions put to him with a reſpectful freedom, and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of expreſſion quite aſtoniſhing for his age. The young princes were deſirous that he ſhould from that moment remain about them. But he repreſented to them the occaſion there was for his remaining yet ſome time in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, in order to profit by his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to render himſelf more worthy of the high office allotted him.</p>
                     <p>He owned to me afterwards, that he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon for aſking this delay: it was, that his friend William having only three months more to ſpend in England, he much wiſhed to paſs the remainder of that time with him. Thus you ſee, his preſence of mind never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes him; nor can the ſeductions of fortune make him forget the duties of friendſhip.</p>

The earl gave yeſterday a grand entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in honour of your ſon. Charles received the compliments of all the company with as much grace as dignity. The many praiſes beſtowed on him, excited not in him the leaſt emotions of pride; and he left the company all captivated by his amiable qualities. Do not think, my dear friend, that the enthuſiaſm with which I ſpeak of your ſon, is the effect of that partiality which I feel for your family: you will find the ſame teſtimonies in his favour in the letter which Lord—has written you.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall be detained about ſix days longer here, and then I hope to bring back to your arms the worthy object of your tenderneſs.</p>

                     <p>I WAS ſo impatient, my dear mamma, to ſend you my friend Charles' letter, and that of Mr. Bartlet, that I had not time to give you thoſe reflections which the good fortune of my friend have given birth to in my mind. Indeed, were I to attempt to ſay all that I think on this ſubject, my letter would not be finiſhed to-day. I will therefore confine myſelf to the more eaſy and delightful taſk, of attempting to deſcribe to you, how ſenſible I am of his faithful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our friendſhip. What then! Could he, for the ſake of my ſociety, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my ſtay here, reſiſt the deſires of the young princes, and ſacrifice all the pleaſures of a court! Ah! he has not made this ſacrifice to an ungrateful friend. You will witneſs for me, mamma, how much I ever loved him, that all my letters were filled with expreſſions of my tenderneſs for him. Well then, he is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thouſand times more dear to me. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

his abſence, I have been made too ſenſible how neceſſary he is to my happineſs. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the careſſes of Mr. and Mrs. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, notwithſtanding the friendſhip of Edward and Emily, I find that I miſs him every hour in the day. I ſeem, as if I were but half myſelf, without him. I have no other reſource, but to employ myſelf continually in doing ſomething for him. Yes, mamma, all the buſineſs that we did when we were together, I now do alone, in order to render his abſence leſs tedious to me. I have cultivated his garden, and ornamented it with the flowers of the ſeaſon, that he may ſee, at his return, what care I have taken, of all that he is intereſted in. I have continued to copy a ſet of deſigns in architecture which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: they are not, it is true, ſo well drawn as he would have done them, but they are better than if I had done them for myſelf. I am ſure that his friendſhip will excuſe the weakneſs of my pencil, and that he will ſee them in his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection with pleaſure. I have alſo tranſcribed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his muſic-books, all the new airs which we have had ſince his departure. I have arranged the books in his library; I have fed his birds; I have given ſomething to his poor people: in ſhort, I have attempted to do all that he would have done himſelf. It is at theſe times, that I have more than ever felt the force of that maxim, which you have ſo often repeated to me, that application to buſineſs is the beſt means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the mind under grief or uneaſineſs. Ah! had I been condemned to idleneſs during this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of my friend's abſence, how ſhould I have
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:045437_0660_10202C3078057228"/>
been to be pitied! I have laboured not to leave a moment in the day vacant, leſt I ſhould fill it with my ſadneſs. As a proof of this, I ſend you a little piece which I have juſt tranſlated, on the advantages of induſtry.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, my dear mamma; now that my friend is ſo far from me, I doubly feel the pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo from you. I have no conſolation but in knowing that you love me, and in feeling how much I love you.</p>

                        <head>THE ADVANTAGES OF INDUSTRY.</head>
                        <p>MR. Dorville, a rich manufacturer, was the moſt inveterate enemy to idleneſs. He not only dedicated the whole day to labour himſelf, but took care alſo, to have every perſon of his family employed in the ſame manner. Liberal to all whom age or infirmity had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of work, but implacable toward thoſe idle vagabonds, who, with the advantages of health and ſtrength, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>me to beg at his door. He would aſk them why they did not work; and if they excuſed themſelves, by ſaying that they could get no employment, he would offer it to them in his manufactory; but after once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:045437_0661_10202C3367911EB0"/>
it, they dared never more approach his preſence.</p>
                        <p>He never ſuffered a bale of goods either to be packed up or opened, without obliging his two ſons Francis and Robert, to put their hands to it. He had a large garden behind his houſe, in which he made them both work, under the direction of his gardener: and during winter, he would employ them in turning, and other works of ingenuity. His three daughters, alſo, had not more time allowed them for idleneſs. They had the charge of the domeſtic oeconomy; with every other occupation ſuitable to their ſex.</p>
                        <p>The better to excite their induſtry, Mr. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville paid each for his work; and thoſe among them, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their activity, had an extraordinary reward. Theſe little perquiſites, they had the liberty of laying out in their own pleaſures and amuſements.</p>
                        <p>No quarrels or ill humour were ever heard in this family. They enjoyed perfect health, and each day brought with it new pleaſures, by making them taſte the ſweets of their own labours.</p>
                        <p>If the boys preſented to their ſiſters a noſegay of carnations or hyacinths, they received from them in return either embroidered ruffles, purſes, or ſtrings for their canes or watches, all, the work of their induſtrious hands. If their deſſerts were furniſhed by the fruit of their young trees, which they had planted and grafted themſelves, they had the ſatisfaction to hear their parents
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:045437_0662_10202C37CA5700D0"/>
praiſe them, by acquainting their gueſts, to whom they owed their regale; at which, each would take his glaſs, and the company in chorus, drank to the health of the little gardener.</p>
                        <p>Seven days in the year, were celebrated as feſtivals in the family; theſe were the birth-days of each of the children, and thoſe of their father and mother. Pleaſure and mutual tenderneſs reigned on thoſe occaſions: particularly on the birth-days of their parents, when they generally gave an entertainment to the children, to which they invited their young acquaintance. The feaſt always ended in a ball, at which youthful vivacity, heightened by muſic, animated every look and motion, whilſt their fond parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, with tranſports of joy, their playful gaiety and natural graces.</p>
                        <p>Who would believe, that theſe children ſhould ever grow weary of a way of life ſo full of pleaſure? This was, however, the caſe. Francis one day went to pay a viſit to his young couſins: he returned home with a ſorrowful contenance. His father, from ſome indirect words which he let fall, comprehended at once the cauſe of his chagrin: he, however, did not appear as if he obſerved it: In the mean while, as Francis wore the ſame face of ſadneſs the next day, Mr. Dorville having engaged him to take a walk with him after dinner, over his plantations, they had together the following converſation.</p>

                           <p>What, my dear child, is this all that afflicts you? nothing can be eaſier, than to ſatisfy you in this buſineſs. God forbid, that I ſhould make you work againſt your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; you are at full liberty to take your reſt, and not to return to your work again, till you yourſelf deſire it.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <p>Francis, happy to enjoy his liberty with the conſent of his father, ſpent the reſt of the day, in loitering about here and there, ſometimes in the houſe, ſometimes the garden.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dorville always roſe early; and when the weather was fine, generally amuſed himſelf with a walk into the country, and took with him thoſe of his children, who the day before had been moſt diligent and attentive to their work. The next morning after this diſcourſe, the early dawn promiſed a moſt beautiful day; Mr. Dorville was preparing to go out; Francis heard him; and though he was very ſenſible that he had not deſerved the indulgence, he nevertheleſs haſtened up, and aſked his father's permiſſion, to accompany him. Mr. Dorville willingly conſented. They went together, and ſeated themſelves at the top of a hill, from whence they had a view of the ſurrounding country. It was in the early part of the ſpring. The meadows, which but a month before were buried in ſnow, now diſplayed the moſt lively verdure. The woods were covered with tender foliage, and the fruit-trees adorned with the gayeſt bloſſoms. The harſh whiſtling of the north-wind, no more grated on the ear;
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:045437_0665_10202C3F31712290"/>
nothing was heard around, but the ſweet warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of birds, Young lambs, and playful colts were ſeen ſporting in the rich paſture-grounds. Echo reſounded with the cheerful ſong of the labourer, as he trod the furrowed land The roads were filled with troops of country-people; ſome conducting their waggons loaded with corn, wine, and other merchandize; others carrying on their ſhoulders baſkets filled with herbs and flowers. The young milk maids ſeemed to walk in cadence: all bent their ſteps toward the city, the gates of which were juſt opened to receive them. Francis, affected by this ſcene, felt his heart ſo elated with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that throwing himſelf into the arms of his father, he exclaimed. Oh! papa, I have you to thank for the pleaſure which this moment affords me!</p>

                           <p>I think, it appears from your own account, that play only amuſes the preſent moment, and that it does not even always do that in proportion to our expectations; and that work, on the contrary, after having agreeably occupied us, leaves behind it ſome uſeful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After twenty years are paſt, you will have a renewed pleaſure in gathering fruits from the trees which your hands have planted, though you will, by that time, forget all your fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous paſtimes. Decide therefore, yourſelf, which affords the moſt ſolid pleaſure, uſeful labour, or vain amuſement.</p>

                           <p>How ſhould I know? this man is the whole day with his body bent over his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and he has been accuſtomed from his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt youth, to wield a hammer, which I can ſcarcely lift with both hands.</p>

                           <p>This is a farther proof, then, that labour ſtrengthens the body. Here is a blackſmith who uſes more violent exerciſe than I do, and yet he is more robuſt. You uſe more violent exerciſe than your couſins, and you are

                           <p>Even ſo; for inſtance: if I ſhould lay it out in giving you uſeful acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which would make you independent of all reverſes of fortune; you then would be, in whatever ſituation chance might throw you, able to procure the neceſſaries of life. You un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand accounts and book-keeping; you know every thing belonging to the cultivation of trees; you are a tolerable turner; your brother and ſiſters have alſo their particular talents: it has coſt me a great deal of money to have you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in theſe things. I will ſacrifice yet more, to make you complete; and then, I ſhall look upon you as poſſeſſing more riches, than thoſe who have a great inheritance; for we may loſe our fortune, but uſeful knowledge remains with us for ever.</p>

                           <p>A young gentleman in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many paid his addreſſes to a very amiable lady, and aſked her in marriage of her father. The father ſaid to him, I will give you my daughter very willingly, but have you a good trade to maintain her and her children? A trade, Sir, anſwered the young gentleman? are you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that I poſſeſs a large country-ſeat in your neighbourhood, with a conſiderable eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides? All this is nothing, replied the father of the lady; your houſe may be burnt, your land may ſuffer devaſtation; beſides this, many other ruinous accidents may happen to you, which I cannot foreſee. In a word, if you wiſh to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my daughter, you muſt learn ſome trade, or I ſhall not be ſatisfied. It is the abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our alliance. It was in vain that the young gentleman remonſtrated: the father would not recede. What was to be done? he loved the lady too paſſionately to give her up. He put himſelf apprentice therefore to a baſket-maker, the eaſieſt buſineſs he could think of; and it was not till after he had made a very neat baſket, and ſome other pieces of workmanſhip, before the
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:045437_0678_10202C556064D4D8"/>
eyes of her father, that he could obtain the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <p>During the firſt years of his marriage, he laughed inwardly at the foreſight of his father-in-law, and the whimſical condition which he had impoſed upon him; but he had ſoon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee the matter in a much more ſerious light.</p>
                        <p>War was declared: the enemy entered his province. They ravaged his lands; cut down his foreſts; demoliſhed his caſtle; pillaged his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and obliged him and his family to take flight: our rich gentleman found himſelf all at once reduced to indigence. At firſt he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deplore his ill-fortune, living with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty on the little money that he had ſaved: but this reſource ſoon failed him. He then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of the trade which he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His ſpirits began to recover, and he gave himſelf up to work with the more ardour, as he had taken refuge in a city where his name and rank were unknown. His wife, between the intervals of her domeſtic occupations, comforted him under his labours. The children were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſell the baſkets which he made. In this manner, he provided decently for the ſupport of himſelf and family, until the happy moment arrived, which by the return of peace, reſtored him again to the poſſeſſions of his fortune.</p>
                        <p>This ſtory made a lively impreſſion on Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. He related it himſelf to his brother and ſiſters, who were alſo as much taken with it. It put them upon making a number of reflections on the wiſdom of providing reſources againſt the
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:045437_0679_101FFD1ADE65A590"/>
unexpected turns of fortune. Alas! they did not then foreſee that they ſoon would have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to apply this to themſelves. A little time after, a fire broke out in the night in one of Mr. Dorville's magazines; and all the buildings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his manufactory were conſumed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any aſſiſtance could be got to ſtop the flames. Another man might have been caſt down by this diſaſter; but, on the contrary, it ſerved only to fortify his reſolution, and redouble his activity. All his friends were eager to ſupport him. His induſtry made the beſt uſe of theſe advantages, by labouring to repair his loſſes. Nor did this reverſe of fortune prevent his daughters from being ſought in marriage by the richeſt and moſt ſenſible men; becauſe they knew, that, in them they ſhould find women capable of conducting the affairs of their houſe, with oeconomy and prudence. As for his two ſons, they applied themſelves with ſuch indefatigable ardour to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that, in a few years their affairs were not only re-eſtabliſhed, but carried to a degree of proſperity, which they had never known before that misfortune which ſeemed to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown them for ever.</p>

                     <p>O MY dear mamma, what danger my friend Charles has been in! Alas! I have been within a little of loſing him! I tremble yet whilſt I think of it. What would have become of me if he had been as brutal as his adverſary; if he had either loſt his life, or taken away that of his antagoniſt, and been obliged to fly his country? Happily all has terminated to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; whilſt he is preſerved to his family, and to his friend, he has given us freſh reaſon to love and eſteem him. But I am too long without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying your curioſity: read, pray read the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Mr. Grandiſon has juſt received from Mr. Bartlet. I have ſpent the whole evening in tranſcribing it in order to ſend it to you. Oh! my dear mamma, how many times has my heart beat whilſt I was taking this copy! But it is not of me that it ſpeaks; forget me, I pray you, for a few moments, that you may be the more at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to attend to my friend.</p>

                     <p>I CAN never ſufficiently congratulate you on the happineſs of poſſeſſing ſuch a ſon as your's. I was witneſs yeſterday, without his knowing it, to an adventure which does him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite honour. But why ſhould I be aſtoniſhed at his conduct, when I only ſee, in it, the effect of the good example and wiſe leſſons which he has received from you! We fell in company yeſterday with a Mr. Stukely, ſon to Lord G—, a young man of a moſt violent and brutal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: though he is but eighteen years of age, he is devoured by ambition and envy. I had already obſerved, that he was jealous of the poſt which your ſon had obtained. He threw out many ſpiteful ſarcaſms, which Charles, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſelf-command, paſſed over in ſilence. They engaged in a game of piquet together. Stukely, like a bully, took advantage of your ſon's moderation, pluming himſelf on a falſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:045437_0682_10202B4BD1A2E098"/>
He took occaſion to quarrel with him at play, in ſo pointed a manner, that Charles could not refrain from ſhewing his indignation, by his looks. I will give you their converſation, word for word.</p>

                        <p>Very true. There is very little pleaſure in playing with people who underſtand nothing of the game.</p>

                        <p>It is very poſſible, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it ſo well as you, by a great deal: I do not play ſo much.</p>

                        <p>I do not look upon the ſcience of gaming to be abſolutely neceſſary, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But let us talk of ſomething elſe, if you pleaſe. You have a very pretty ſnuff-box.</p>

                     <p>Stukely roſe up haſtily, putting his hand to his ſword: Charles calmly laid his in an armed chair, and followed Stukely with a firm air. I waited till they were out of the room, intending
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:045437_0684_10202B4EE6F25A28"/>
to follow them, as I perceived, plainly, that Stuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant to pick a quarrel. They walked at ſome diſtance from each other, toward a little grove at the farther end of the garden. I went a ſhorter way to the ſame place, and hid myſelf behind a clump of trees, where I could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently liſten to their converſation, which was as follows.</p>

                     <p>After having embraced, the two young men returned back together into the houſe. Nobody knew any thing of this adventure. It redounds as much to the honour of your ſon, as to the diſgrace of his adverſary; had he not in ſome ſort repaired it, by the laſt part of his behaviour. Throughout the whole of this delicate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Charles manifeſted a courage, without raſhneſs, and moderation, without weakneſs. Though young and unarmed, he knew how to bring his adverſary to terms, by the force of his reaſons. In a word, I know not which the moſt to admire in him, his prudence, or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity.</p>

                     <p>MY friend Charles is at length returned, my dear mamma. What was our joy at ſeeing him again. The moment of his return ſerved as a ſignal for a feaſt. Without ſaying any thing to Mr. Grandiſon, the young boys of the village had erected, with the boughs of trees, a triumphal arch at the entrance of the avenue. The young girls, in their beſt attire, waited with baſkets of flowers, which they ſtrewed before him. It was by a cry of, Long live Charles Grandiſon, that his approach was firſt announced to us. We immediately ran to meet him, Mrs. Grandiſon leading the way. He threw himſelf out of the carriage into the arms of his parents. Mrs. Grandiſon preſſed him to her heart, bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with her tears; and Mr. Grandiſon, as he embraced him, ſtrove in vain to conceal his. As for Emily, her arms ſeemed faſtened round his neck; and Edward, alſo, was much rejoiced: though the eldeſt, he ſeemed to look up to his brother with a kind of reſpect. But, mamma, I
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:045437_0689_10202B5EF88D6EA8"/>
cannot deſcribe to you what I felt. I wept, I ſighed, as if I had been in trouble; whilſt my heart was filled with the moſt lively joy. Ah! when it came to my turn to embrace him, how cloſely did I hold him in my arms! I thought of you at the ſame time. Ah! ſaid I to myſelf, if I could but this moment carry my friend into the preſence of my mamma! The ſervants ran backward and forward, crying out with joy. They would have given the world to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and kiſſed him as we did. No one was ever beloved like him; nor was any one ever ſo worthy of it. All the country-people came yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday evening, and danced under our windows; and to-night, there was a general illumination throughout the village.</p>
                     <p>Charles has received this morning the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the neighbouring nobility. What an honour at his age! But he is not rendered proud by it: on the contrary, he is more modeſt than before. Is not this the beſt proof in the world that he is worthy of his dignity?</p>
                     <p>Juſt as we were ſitting down to table, the old gardener (Matthews) came in: he is the huſband of Mrs. Grandiſon's nurſe. He lives about three miles off, on a penſion allowed him by Mr. Grandiſon, upon which he paſſes a happy old age. He advanced ſlowly on his crutches to pay his compliments. Charles ſaw him at the end of the avenue, and ran to meet him. He took him by the hand, and brought him to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He made him ſit down to table next to himſelf. You ſee, mamma, that honours have not changed the nature of my friend. A young
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:045437_0690_10202B61EF1DF360"/>
of honour makes an old gardener ſit by his ſide, and ſerves him all dinner-time! Not that I ſaw any thing ſo extraordinary in this, but I could perceive, that Edward was inwardly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at it. I do not know how it is, ſaid he to his brother after dinner, but this viſit of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews ſeemed to give you more pleaſure than all the reſt. It is true, anſwered Charles: the words of this honeſt man are not made up of vain compliments; they come from the heart. He would not, at his age, have walked three miles on his crutches to congratulate me, if he had not been ſincerely rejoiced at my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and beſides, ought I not to love him who had the care of dear mamma's infancy? I am ſure, he loves her as if ſhe was his own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Charles was in the right; for during the whole meal, I had my eyes fixed upon this good old man; and though he was in the gayeſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, I could frequently obſerve his eyes filled with tears, when he turned them toward Mrs. Grandiſon. The worthy Matthews wiſhed to return home early, becauſe of the length of the walk; but in order to enjoy his company long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Charles eaſily prevailed on his father to ſend him back in his carriage.</p>
                     <p>You may well imagine, my dear mamma, that I could not be witneſs to all theſe ſcenes, without figuring to myſelf the happy day on which I ſhall return to you. Alas! I ſhall have no place or dignities to bring back to you, but I ſhall at leaſt have done all in my power to bring you back a heart leſs unworthy of your affection. No illuminations will celebrate my return; but
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:045437_0691_10202B6377C32D50"/>
I ſhall ſee your eyes, and thoſe of my ſiſter, ſhine through their tears with all the brightneſs of joy. I ſhall receive no flattering compliments on the advancement of my fortune, but I ſhall receive from your mouth the words of love; I ſhall receive your kiſſes and careſſes. I do not envy my friend the favours beſtowed on him by the bounty of heaven: I feel, that be deſerves them better, than I. But when I ſee him in the arms of his mother, I aſk why am not I in thoſe of my dear mamma. I have nothing but you to love on earth, and I am far from you. You are all my riches, and I poſſeſs you not. Oh! mamma, my dear mamma? I muſt break off: I muſt not give myſelf up to theſe cruel reflections! I ſhould have ſtrength enough, perhaps, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them for myſelf alone, but not for you. It is not my own grief which I fear, it is your's. I ſhould not dread afflictions, were it not for the fear of afflicting you.</p>
