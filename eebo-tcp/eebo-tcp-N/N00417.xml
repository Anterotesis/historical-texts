Of Pardon Tillinghast, who pleadeth for water-baptism, its being a Gospel-precept, and opposeth Christ within, as a false Christ. To which is added, something concerning the supper, &amp;c. II. Of B. Keech, in his book called, A tutor for children, where he disputeth against the sufficiency of the light within, in order to salvation; and calleth Christ in the heart, a false Christ in the secret chamber. III. Of Cotton Mather, who in his appendix to his book, called, Memorable providences, relating to witchcraft, &amp;c. doth so weakly defend his father Increase Mather from being justly chargeable with abusing the honest people called Quakers, that he doth the more lay open his father's nakedness; and beside the abuses and injuries that his father had cast upon that people, C.

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the beginning of thy work, thou dost not fairly state the Question; <hi>first,</hi> that thou takest no notice of my plain and express words in my book, pag. 184. where I say expresly as followeth, <hi>If any were raised up by the Lord as</hi> John <hi>was, and could prove and instruct their being sent to baptize with Water, as he was, these to whom they should be sent, ought gladly to receive it; but to do it by bare imitation, or a meer pretended Call, which they cannot prove to be either mediate or immediate, is great Presumption, yea, Superstition.</hi> This one short section is enough to overthrow thy whole Work, and yet thou hast made no Reply to it, nor given the least notice of it in thy book; and all that thou hast said for <hi>Water-baptism</hi> doth not in the least give any ground for thy <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> thou and thy brethren set up in your vain Imaginations, without any call, either immediate or mediate from God; so that your work i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> your Water-baptism is a Will-worship. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou dost not fairly cite my words, in thy stating the Question, saying, <hi>That I affirmed, that the Apostles practiced it</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. <hi>Water-baptism, Only by permission, &amp;c.</hi> The word [<hi>Only</hi>] is thy addition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is not in my book: but my words are these following, <hi>The Apostles generally thought fit both to use and tolerate th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> use of Water-baptism, that belonged to</hi> John, <hi>and divers other things of the Law, which was by permission for a time, and not by any Gospel standing Commission, &amp;c.</hi> Now the word [<hi>Only</hi>] being added, doth derogate from my words, as if I did understand that the Apostles only bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by a bare, dry or naked permission; whereas I did understand, and so I do still, that it was not a meer or bare permission, but they they thought fit both to use it,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000516_0008_0FA6B39271B8AB10"/>
and tolerate the use of it; and that which made them think and judge it fit to use it for some time, was really the Spirit of God in them, that gave them, not only a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and chearful freedom to use it for some time, but let them see a great service and conveniency in it for som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time, until men began to contend about it, and lay more weight on it, and other things of the like nature, than they ought to have done; for as in the change of an outward form of Government, or a new admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>stration of worldly and civil Laws, the former Laws and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of them, cannot in an instant be removed, but gradually otherwise great inconveniences would follow; as when a house is to be supported with new Pillars, the old Pillars must not be first removed, else the House would be in danger of falling; but the new Pillars must first, in great part, be well placed and fixed, and then the old are by degrees safely and wisely removed: Even so <hi>Iohn's</hi> Baptism and other things of like nature, were not presently and suddainly to be removed, because many, both <hi>Iews</hi> and proselited <hi>Gentiles</hi> laid great stress and weight on them; And therefore, I say, the Apostles, not by a meer bare and naked permission, but in the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and counsel of God used Water-baptism for a time; and yet all this will not prove that it is a Gospel Precept, or a standing Gospel Ordinance that was to continue in the Church to the end of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Nor art thou more successful in managing this <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy</hi> about Water Baptism, than in stating it; for almost throughout thou fight'st against thy own shadow, and takest much pains and usest many Arguments to prove many things no wise denyed by me; as <hi>first, That the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form and inward Power of Godliness may not be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, many of you <hi>Baptists</hi> affirm, <hi>That men may be called of God both to preach and baptize, and yet have no true Piety or Holyness:</hi> Which a <hi>Baptist</hi> Teacher affirmed to me in the hearing of divers witnesses last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But further, how many Hypocrites and vain persons do ye baptize with Water, that no real signs do in the least appear in them, that the inward power of godliness was joyned with their being baptized with Water: Now the thing that thou shouldst have proved, was, that your Water baptism, taken up by you, without any true command, or so much as a true inward liberty by the spirit of God in your hearts, is a Gospel-Precept. But this the Apostles wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, when <hi>Peter</hi> baptized, or caused to be baptized, <hi>Corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Priests under the Law, that circumcised and sacrificed; and Christ gave both the Law and Gospel, and was the Mediator under both, and the Minister of both; for without Christ, the Word, that was in the beginning, by whom all things were made, neither Law nor the Prophets could have been. But the thing thou shouldst have proved, That Christ, as the Mediator of the New-Covenant, in the pure and perfect Dispensation of the Gospel, in the last administration of it, ever commanded Water Baptism; or that Christ after he rose from the dead, commanded Water Baptism, which thou dost not do in the least. Thou seemest to lay great stress on these words, <hi>Acts</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this I have answered already, and I say further, this doth not prove that Water Baptism is a Gospel Precept, but only that that second Dispensation being not yet vvholly abolished, <hi>Peter</hi> savv a service in it, in the Wisdom of God, revealed in him, and therefore he might vvell command it for that time, tho' no Gospel Precept.</p>
            <p>But vvhereas thou sayst, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and the Apostles did command in Christ Iesus, the Lords Name, Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> is a thing utterly false, the Scripture saith no such thing; but <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord</hi>; so that the Name of the Lord is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their being baptized, &amp; not to the command, and their being baptized in the Name of the Lord doth plainly signifie, that their being baptized vvith Water vvas som outward sign, that they became the Lords, and were true believers in him. Next, vvhereas thou sayst, <hi>I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Water Baptism was at that time an abolished Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>

is false, I said no such thing; <hi>It was beginning to be abolishing and decaying, and was decreasing, as</hi> John <hi>said in respect of his Baptism, I must decrease, but Christ must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease:</hi> But that it vvas then totally abolished, I say not; for it could not be safely abolished all at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and after some time, as I have above demonstrated. And novv that I call this third and last Dispensation, that began to take place after the Death and Resurrection of Christ, the <hi>pure and perfect Dispensation of the Gospel,</hi> I understand it not, as if the first and second Dispensations before and under <hi>Moses,</hi> or before and under Christ, as he vvas present in the flesh, had any mixture or impurity of sin or evil, nay, far be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from me; but I call it pure and perfect as having none of these Figures and Types of the Lavv mixed vvith it, as formerly. And though the Apostles, after the giving of the holy Ghost, did grovv up into the attainment of this most pure and perfect Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel state and Dispensation; yet many <hi>Christians</hi> vvho had a measure of sincere Faith in Christ, vvere short of it, and for the cause of such vvho vvere vveak, and but as Babes in Christ they savv it meet in the Wisdom of God to use it for some time. But after the days of the Apostles and their Successors, about three or four hundred years there-after, the true Gospel Spirit was generally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lost (a Remnant excepted of hidden ones, who in some measure retained it) and the inward Power of Godliness departed from, and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Water Baptism, and many other things belonging to the outward form, became as a dead thing and was more fit to be buried than to be used. And none ought to presume to raise it up again, unless it could be said, That the Power of God had raised it, or renewed it in the users or practisers of it, and that they could sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely

say and prove, that God had sent them, or given them Authority to use Water Baptism, and other the like things; but this I do not find that any called <hi>Baptists</hi> so much as pretend unto, and if they did pretend to it, their bare pretence, without some real and effectual prooff, were not to be believed. And that <hi>Peter</hi> caused Water-baptism to be administred to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> doth not prove it to be a Gospel Precept; for under the Law the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who became Proselites of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> so called, were generally baptized into Water, as well as Circumcised, long before <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, as the <hi>Iews</hi> Books plainly declare, and as may be gathered from Scripture, and as divers Christian Writers relate from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and particularly <hi>Thomas Godwin</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>That,</hi> thou say'st, <hi>if Water Baptism had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in</hi> Paul<hi>'s Commission, then he had done evil in bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tizing

so many.</hi> I Answ. It doth not follow, any more than that he did evil in circumcising <hi>Timothy</hi>; for things may be done upon occasions without a Command from God, and that not only by a bare or simple permission, but in a sweet heavenly freedom of Gods holy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly revealed, which is the only chief and principal Rule of every true Christians freedom, as well as of their Obedience. How many good Christians joyn in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, having no command so to do, but knowing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying an inward Liberty by the Spirit of the Lord so to do, and therein receiving the blessing of the Lord; and many other the like cases might be mention'd.</p>
            <p>Thou givest a very strange and exceeding strained Gloss upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>That he was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, to wit, that Water Baptism was not so bound to</hi> Paul, <hi>or any other sent to preach the Gospel, that they with their own hands must needs perform that Work of Baptizing; and</hi> Paul <hi>and the other Apostles had such and such for their Ministers, as</hi> John, Timothy <hi>and others.</hi> But what then? what <hi>Paul</hi> commanded other Disciples to do, is all one as if he had done it himself, as thou ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guest in another case, but not to thy purpose; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be reasonably judged, that if <hi>Paul</hi> had been sent to baptize, either by himself, or making use of others to assist him in that work, he would have said, <hi>He was not sent to baptize</hi>; for that would imply a plain Contradiction, to be sent, and not to be sent. But this thy strein'd gloss on <hi>Pauls</hi> words is grounded upon a meer sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of thine, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>was sent to baptize with Water,</hi> which thou hast not in the least proved, nor art ever like to do; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. saith nothing of Water.</p>
            <p>Thy similitude betwixt <hi>Solomons Temple</hi> and the <hi>Gospel-Church,</hi>

as thou dost apply it, is exceeding vain &amp; foolish, and proceedeth from great Ignorance, as if the <hi>Stones that were the Foundation of</hi> Solomon's <hi>Temple, cut out of the Mountains, and the Timber-work, did signifie, that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God's Spiritual House should be Water-Baptism.</hi> But this is plain contrary to Scripture, that saith, <hi>The Church is built on the Foundation of the Prophets &amp; Apostles, Iesus Christ himself being the chief Corner Stone</hi>; And thou that sets up Water-Baptism as the Foundation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Church, preachest another Foundation than Christ Jesus, and another Gospel. If <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple had been built on the Waters, thou mightst have had some slender pretext or colour to use such a Comparison; but what Resemblance Stone and Timber hath to Water Baptism, I do not understand. And if Water-Baptism be the Foundation of the Church, then the Church hath had no Foundation for many Ages past; for <hi>Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> by sprinkling, ye <hi>Baptists</hi> do not acknowledge to be any true Baptism at all, but a meer fiction or invention, and yet for many Ages there hath been no other Water-Baptism used, but that of sprinkling Infants; for that party or society of People called <hi>Bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And as concerning the Allegorical and Spiritual signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fycation of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Temple,</hi> it is very well understood without your Water-Baptism; for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Temple,</hi> as it was a figure of <hi>Christs Body,</hi> which was crucified and rose again, and ascended into Glory, so also it was a figure
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000516_0021_0FA6B3A5870B19C0"/>
of the Gospel Church under the pure Gospel Dispensation, the Foundation whereof is Christ Jesus, as he came in the likeness of sinful flesh, and took upon himself the form of a Servant, and humbled himself unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death, even the Death of the Cross, made of a Woman, made under the Law, the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> I say, Christ thus come in the flesh, and crucified for our sins, as the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of him is inwardly revealed by the holy Spirit in the hearts of all true believers, in respect of his thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himself, and taking hold of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may well be compared to the Stone &amp; Wood of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, which were but mean, and not very costly Materials, but the fullness of the Godhead, that dwelt in Christ Bodily, and his being anointed with the holy Spirit without measure, being the only begotton Son of God, full of Grace and Truth, of whose fullness all true believers do plentifully receive, and Grace for Grace, and the many most rich and excellent divine Virtues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both Christ and his Church are most richly endued, and adorned, are well signified by that great plenty of Gold and Silver, and other precious Furniture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was beautified. But it is much thou didst not make the Sea in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Water-Baptism; possibly some of thy Brethren may judge this a great omission or neglect in thee; but hadst thou brought it, it could have made nothing for thy Water Baptism; for that Sea in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple was not a figure of outward Water (which it self was but a figure) but of these spiritual Waters of the Sanctuary, mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 47.1, 7, 8, 9. and by <hi>Iohn,</hi> c. 4. v 6 and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1.</p>

               </gap>postles saw meet to baptize into Water; but yet that Water baptism was not the Milk where-with they were fed, but rather as stilts or Crutches that these babes or lame Persons used for some time And whereas thou further sayst, <hi>That we called</hi> Quakers <hi>are born Monsters, not Babes to be fed with Milk, as the Saints heretofore.</hi> Here thy scornful Spirit, full of bitterness and prejudice, doth plainly appear: How many thousand babes in Christ have been, before ever baptism with Water was in being, and since it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its burial? and whoever seek to raise it again, or restore it in their own self-will, and meer imaginations, from what they falsly infer or draw from the Letter of the Scripture, they but raise a dead thing, that is not the sincere Milk; for the Milk of Babes, is <hi>the sincere Milk of the Word,</hi> and that is not Water-baptism And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou alledgest, <hi>That to pretend to the Power, and deny the Form of Godliness, is as Hypocritical as the other is Formal:</hi> This we agree unto; but it remaineth as yet to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Water baptism is any part of the Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, since the form and practice of it hath generally ceased, since the Apostles, for many Ages past, and but again is raised up by the meer will of Man, without any divine Call or Authority, so far as ever I could yet learn; for I never yet heard that any in this Age, or since the Apostacy began, did pretend to an inward divine Call for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000516_0026_0FA6B3ABA1674CD0"/>
Water Baptism. But whether when the Gospel shall have it free course to be yet preached to all Nations, any shall be raised up to baptize with Water, by a divine Authority, belongs not to the present debate.</p>
            <p>And thus I hope it will appear to the impartial Readers, that I have sufficiently answered to thy Objections and pretended Reasons, from plain Scripture, which thou hast but grosly wrested and perverted.</p>
            <p>In the close of thy book thou sayst, <hi>I strike as well at the Lords Supper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And first, as to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> I say, where Christ is not inwardly and spiritually seen, tasted and fed upon, by his inward Revelation in mens hearts, there is not the Lords Supper, altho' they gather together with ever so great a Solemnity, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, to eat outward Bread and drink outward Wine in remembrance, as they pretend, of Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is neither Number of Persons, nor any set Times appointed by Christ, in relation to the outward eating and drinking, which ye call the Supper; and therefore as the Church of <hi>England</hi> use it once Quarterly, and some <hi>Baptists</hi> Monethly or perhaps some Weekly, why may not others, with as good reason, use it daily; and seeing the Number of Persons is no essential part, as ye must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, then why may not two or three, as well as some hundreds, use it with equal Solemnity and religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <hi>viz.</hi> eating and drinking together, both with a holy fear and chearfulness, remembring the Lords Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

even until his last coming, as wel as until his more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant inward spiritual Coming into their hearts.</p>
            <p>And whereas I queried in my last book, <hi>Wherein we are behind you, or wherein we fall short of you, or what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, worth or value hath your Supper above and beyond ours?</hi> To this thou hast not answered one syllable, nor hast thou shewed any one particular instance wherein your eating and drinking excelleth ours, and therefore I return it again unto thee to be answered. And I thus further query, Is tho difference about the bear <hi>Name,</hi> that ye call it <hi>The Supper of the Lord,</hi> and we have no freedom to call the bare outward eating and drinking, unless Christ be inwardly enjoyed, the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> but where Christ is inwardly enjoyed and fed upon, together with the outward eating and drinking, as most frequently is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, to God's praise, that we can freely call the Lords Supper? Or, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Is the difference, because ye have some Priest, or Pastor, or gifted Brother, to consecrate the Bread, and make it more holy than our Bread that we eat, even when we use Prayer and Thanks-giving before eating, either vocal or only mental, and frequently both? Or, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or, 4<hi>thly,</hi> Is it because the eating and drinking that was among the Saints, called by thee and others, the <hi>Supper,</hi> was never intended for satisfying hunger, as thou hintest? And what if I should say the same, thou gainest nothing; for it is not the simple eating and drinking that I call a <hi>holy Remembrance of Christs Death,</hi> but the holy and religious way and manner of performing it; and yet thou canst not prove, that the Saints, when they did eat

And why are ye not as zealous for wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one anothers feet, and anointing the sick with Oyl?

But seeing he hath granted, <hi>That there are some sins that they are guilty of, that the first Covenant in them doth not convince them of,</hi> it followeth most necessarily, that there is some Law or Light of the new Covenant in them: And thus it doth plainly appear, that the snare or net which this <hi>Benj.

But we can most clearly prove from Scripture, that the Light that is generally in men, the <hi>Heathens</hi> not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath in it some small degree of a discovery or revelation of the New Testament or New Covenant; 1<hi>st,</hi> Because it revealeth to men generally <hi>the goodness of God that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Repentance,</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. yea, <hi>the Riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering</hi>; and therefore it revealeth in men universally, that God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, as well as just, and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000516_0035_0FA6B3B9B21F8330"/>
Light in men teacheth them, that God is a gracious God, and one that <hi>pardons Iniquity,</hi> otherwise he could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be the <hi>best beeing</hi>; for seeing among the Children of men many men have that goodness that inclines them to forgive the greatest Trespasses, upon their Repentance and asking forgiveness; therefore God himself is infinitely more gracious and ready to forgive. 2<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> of the better sort, who have not heard Christ outwardly preached unto them, have offered up Sacrifices unto the only true God, as well as the <hi>Iews</hi>; and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> tho' a <hi>Heathen,</hi> did affirm, <hi>That i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Keech</hi> confesseth, was a spiritual and shadowing Ministration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> given in mercy unto men, to discover and hold forth unto them the glorious and great Sacrifice and Attonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, the same may be said of the Sacrifices of these <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who sacrificed unto the only true God And if it be said, <hi>The</hi> Gentiles <hi>who did so Sacrifice,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> and others, <hi>did it, being taught by some outward means:</hi> I answer, allowing it so to be; so did also the <hi>Iews</hi> and People of <hi>Israel;</hi> but as among the <hi>Iews,</hi> so among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Light of God in them did accord in Harmony with the outward means of their Instruction. 3<hi>dly,</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly declare, <hi>That the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>who did the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law, had their thoughts excusing them</hi> (or <hi>apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing,</hi> as the Greek hath it) and therefore there is some Light or Illumination in them, other than that of the first Covenant, <hi>that only condemneth,</hi> as <hi>B.

his state; and that he was not singular, or the only man in the World that was sincerely devout, and that knew not Christ as come in the flesh, <hi>Peter</hi>'s words plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, how that <hi>in every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him.</hi> And if it be said, that <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is to be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that the holy Spirit, throughout the Scripture, doth signifie, not the Spirit of God abstractly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as influencing men with a peculiar holy or san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying influence and operation: and these are only such who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>Now let us hear his Arguments against the Sufficiency of the Light within, so much as to begin the least good Work of God in the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 1<hi>st,</hi> he saith, <hi>It cannot discover unto thee that there is a Redeemer, who suffered Death without the Gates of</hi> Jerusalem. 2dly, <hi>Tho' it convince of many sins, yet it cannot cleanse thee from them.</hi> 3dly, <hi>It cannot make Satisfaction for the sins that are past.</hi> 4thly, <hi>It cannot lead thee into Evangelical or Gospel Truths.</hi> 5thly, <hi>It cannot teach thee the Righteousness of God, without the Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the Righteousness of God by Faith of Iesus Christ, unto all &amp; upon all that do believe.</hi> 6thly, <hi>It leaveth thee under the sentence of Death and Misery, without affording any d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rections or help for thy Recovery,</hi> (Note these words, whereby it plainly appeareth, he taketh away from it all sufficiency, so much as to begin any good work in men, as having the least tendency to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000516_0040_0FA6B3C0B9DEF4E8"/>
begin the work of Salvation, <hi>or prepare thereunto.</hi>) 7thly, <hi>It cannot give thee</hi> (he saith) <hi>eternal Peace and Salvation, as these Miserable men</hi> (meaning the People called <hi>Quakers) do affirm.</hi> Thus he argueth.</p>
            <p>In Answer to these his Arguments, I say, it is really a degree of Blasphemy to say, that there is no Light, or Principle, or Being in men, that can do these things; for God and Christ can do all things, and both God and Christ are in all men, not only as to that general presence in all the Creatures, but in a special way of Revelation, as being the Off-spring o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God, as <hi>Paul</hi> declared to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But it is one thing what God and Christ can do, and far another thing what they commonly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally do. Now it is readily granted, that God and Christ do not commonly reveal unto men the knowledge and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith of Christ crucified, &amp;c. without the Scriptures Testimony, or some outward Teaching; but this doth not prove that the Light in men hath no preparatory ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, use or tendency, in order to receive the knowledge &amp; faith of <hi>Christ crucified,</hi> as we see it hath, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is clear in the case of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and in the Parable of the good ground, that signified the good and honest heart, even before the Seed of the pure and perfect evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Dispensation was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own in it. And at this rate he might as well argue against the Light in the best Saints or Christians, in these Ages of the World, as being insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give eternal Life and Salvation; for the ordinary and usual way of God to beget in all true Believers the true <hi>knowledge and faith of Christ crucified,</hi> is by some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of <hi>Preaching, Reading,</hi> or <hi>Hearing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read,</hi> and not without them, the inward Light and Grace of God mightily co-opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000516_0041_0FA6B3C248A1ABC8"/>
with the outward means of the Scriptures preached, read or heard. And whereas he directeth his Book ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to these called Christians, many of whom are of his own Profession, if his Doctrine be to be received, none of his own Brethren, nor any Christians whatsoever, have any saving Light or Grace in them; for he maketh no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betwixt <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> but saith gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all, <hi>That they have no saving Light in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the better understanding of the whole matter, let it be considered, that the Light in men hath a two fold sence and signification; 1<hi>st,</hi> It may and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h signifie some divine inward Illumination and Revelation of God and Christ in men, which hath also a quickening and cleansing operation in it. Now admitting that the divine Illumination and Revelation of God and Christ doth not at first reveal or discover these peculiar Mysteries of the pure Gospel Dispensation, as <hi>Christ crucified,</hi> and <hi>Faith in him,</hi> yet it doth suffice that I have proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it can begin, and doth really begin a good Work of God in them that are diligent to obey it; and where this good Work of God is begun in any, they cannot perish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altho' they dye in that state: for as no Unrighteous Soul can (while such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> go into Heaven, so none that are in any the least degree Righteous by the Work of God in their hearts, (while such,) can go to Hell, or finally perish. But to determine at what precise time, and how this work of God begun in honest <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is perfected in them, and at what precise time the knowledge and faith of Christ is wrought in them, is not a difficulty that is singular to us the People, call'd in scorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> but doth equally urge

and pinch our Adversaries; yea, I suppose generally the <hi>Baptists</hi> themselves; for <hi>first,</hi> They acknowledge, <hi>That many Infants dying in infancy, belong to Gods Election, and are saved:</hi> 2<hi>dly, That not only Infants, but others come to Age, may belong to God's Election, who are born Deaf and Dumb</hi>; and many will acknowledge also, <hi>That God hath his Elect among the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>who have not heard Christ out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly preached, and shall be saved, God working by his Spirit when, where, and how he pleaseth,</hi> as the <hi>Presbyterian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith</hi> owned by <hi>Baptists,</hi> doth expresly declare. Now it is plain, the Difficulty is equal to them, with us, and is a great secret, known (perhaps) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

true Believers feel their continual need and want of a new and fresh supply of Gods Grace and gracious Assistance, both to think, to will and to do any thing good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God.

We know many wicked People, whose Souls the Devils possess (and that is worse than a meer Bodily Possession) may read both our Books and the Scriptures also, yet as this is no discredit to the Scriptures, so no more to our books; yea, the Devil could and did cite Scripture to Christ, and could use the outward names of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iesus.</hi> And thou grantest that <hi>that Girle possessed,</hi> as thou alledgest, <hi>Bodily with the Devil, did read the</hi> 59 <hi>Psalm</hi>; And what may be concluded from this, according to <hi>Cotton Mathers</hi> pretended Logick, that tho' the Devil would not suffer the Girle to read some <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Books,</hi> but gave her liberty to read some of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer,</hi> or other <hi>Episcopal Books,</hi> and <hi>Quakers Books,</hi> and also the 59 <hi>Psalm,</hi> that all these are of the like quality?

Answ.</hi> That I have travelled in many places both by Sea and Land, to turn People unto the Lord, and from Darkness to Light, I am not ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for so did many of the Servants of God in former Generations, and not like <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> and his Brethren generally, who creep into one certain place or House, and there continue to preach for hire, and rarely remove, but when the motive of a greater Sallary doth invite them: And as for mens applause, I regard it not, whether great or small; I seek not honour of men, but the honour that cometh of God, that doth satisfie me, and the good and Christian esteem that I have in the hearts of many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as well as my honest Report among men, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know me, which hath not been wanting to me in New-England as well as in other places where I have travell'd; and as for <hi>Success in my Ministry,</hi> and being made instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to convert some, and build up others in the most holy Faith, through the Grace of God, I need not bear witness to my self, but if need were, many can bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to it, even in New-England, so that my labour in <hi>New-England</hi> hath not been in vain, and I hope yet to see more the fruit and effect of it, through the blessing of God. Next, whereas thou sayst, <hi>At my return to</hi> Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania, <hi>I bless the World with a little Volumn of Heresies and Blasphemies against the Protestant Religion.</hi> Here thy scoffing airy Spirit appeareth, as oft else-where; how can the world be blessed with a Volumn of Heresies and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies? But that my book containeth either Heresie or Blasphemy, thou hast not yet showed, far less proved: Thou callest my Book, <hi>Some further improvements of Non-sence, than the Abilities of the</hi> Quakers <hi>had heretofore helped

Craft and Non-sence seldom go all along together. And that thou sayst, thou supposest, <hi>I will not be long without the Castigations of a full, though short Answer, &amp;c.</hi> I fear not this menacing; if any such pretended Castigation come forth (tho' thou callest me a <hi>Fly</hi>) I doubt not, but if I live, God will enable me to detect the vanity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency thereof, or if removed by Death, that he will raise up some of his Servants to do it. But that thou sayst, <hi>The twelfth Article I charge on you, is directly contrary to what ye assert, and maintain, and preach every day</hi>; and then add'st scoffingly, after thy wonted manner, <hi>This was his Inspiration then!

hath writ a large Book to prove the self-evidencing Power and Authority of the Scriptures, and denyeth that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth its evidence from the inward Revelation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the holy Spirit in mens hearts; yea, thou thy self scoffest at Inspiration in this very place, and else-where. and tho' in words ye seem to own the inward Testimony of the Spirit, yet in Deed ye disown it, while ye deny true divine Revelation, and Inspiration, properly so call'd. 3<hi>dly,</hi> If ye did indeed believe the Scriptures for the inward Evidence and Testimony of the holy Spirit, then ye would acknowledge it to be the principal Rule of Faith, but this ye do not; for ye say in your Confession, <hi>The Word of God contained in the Scriptures is the only Rule, &amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I said in my Book, <hi>That when some of</hi> T.

            <p>Next, as to the story in old <hi>England,</hi> taken from <hi>H.

thou, <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> to this? doth it not here plainly appear, that the Devil in this possessed Damsel did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to be the Servants of the living God, and consequently, that the Religion they professed was the true Religion? Doth it therefore follow, that Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Possession in this Damsel did incline her to be of <hi>Pauls</hi> Religion? Doth not both thy Fathers weakness and thine also manifestly appear in this Charge? for if either thou or thy Father had lived at that time, when the Devil gave that Testimony to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to <hi>Paul,</hi> and to <hi>Silas,</hi> by your Argument, the Christian Faith and Religion was not true. Thou and thy Father also are very ignorant of the Devils devices, if ye know not, that he can transform himself as an Angel of Light, and incline or dispose men to any outward form or profession whatsoever, and also to confess to the Truth it self, but not to live and walk in the Truth.

            <p>There is another Passage in <hi>Cotton Mathers</hi> Appendix, which though I could easily have passed by altogether, without any just Reflection on us, yet because it showeth how foolish and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate he is, to accuse others for that, which these of his own Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety have been sufficiently liable to, I shall take some notice of it. He saith, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>fall out among themselves, is but a natural Consequence of their Tempers, and Errors, which cannot be otherwise than incoherent; and sometimes their Credit forces them to explode in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what they (wish they could, but) can't excuse. Answ.</hi> That we have denyed <hi>Thomas Case</hi> and all his ungodly Crew and Followers, is not the least proof that the <hi>Quakers</hi> fall out among themselves; for tho' they or others may falsly call them <hi>Quakers,</hi> as being of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Society, yet it doth not follow, any more, than that many of the most Wicked, called <hi>Christians,</hi> are of the true Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or are <hi>Christians,</hi> because falsly so called. But in this thou actest more like <hi>Celsus,</hi> and others in antient times, who upbraided the sincere Christians, yea, and the Christian Religion it self, with all the vile and gross Heresies &amp; wicked Practices of some Apostates, and other vile and lewd Persons, who called themselves Christians, and were not. We have better learn'd Christ and Christianity, than to judge any to be of our Religion or Society, because of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Name whatsoever. But if thou hadst any common discretion, thou wouldst have spared these words, to upbraid the People call'd <hi>Quakers, with falling out among themselves, and that their so falling out, is but a natural consequence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And even in <hi>New-England</hi> it self, <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> cannot be ignorant what Quarrels, Disputes and Fallings out have been among these call'd Ministers and Teachers in <hi>New-England:</hi> There are divers yet alive, who were both eye and ear Witnesses to the hot Contentions and Fallings out among some call'd Preachers and Ministers in <hi>New-England</hi> of the Congregational way, and particularly that great Opposition and Falling out that was betwixt old <hi>Iohn Cotton</hi> of <hi>New England</hi> (of whom this <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> is descended) and some of his Brethren; the said old <hi>Iohn Cotton</hi> being accused severely by his pretended Brethren of the Ministry, for false Doctrine, though that Doctrine for which he was accused, was not false, but true, and agreeable both to the Scriptures Testimony, and to what the honest People, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> are raised up to witness unto, as namely, <hi>That not only the Graces and Operations of God, of Christ, and of the holy Spirit, are in all true Saints and Believers, but that God, and Christ, and the holy Spirit, together with these Graces and Operations, are really present and in-dwelling in the hearts of all true Saints and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:</hi> And <hi>Iohn Owen</hi> hath asserted in some of his Books printed in Old <hi>England,</hi> to wit, <hi>That the holy Ghost doth really dwell in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, together with his Graces and Virtues:</hi> The which Doctrine both of old <hi>Iohn Cotton,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Owen,</hi> an <hi>Independent</hi> Preacher in <hi>Old England,</hi> hath been judged by others of their Brethren, not only

But whether it was so or not, I am little concerned (to enquire) further, than to take notice, that <hi>C.

But I have both read &amp; heard as great, or rather greater instances of evil Spirits and Devils being cast out of some by <hi>Popish Priests,</hi> which doth no more prove either the truth or worth of Pope or Papacy, than this pretended or supposed Ejection, and casting out, or perhaps the going out of the Devil, without any force, but on his crafty design to make <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> imagin it to be so, and others of the like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
