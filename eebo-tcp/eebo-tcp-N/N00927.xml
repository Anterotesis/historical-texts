            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN this my Anſwer to the Book, falſly called, <hi>Proteus Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> lately publiſhed at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I have not followed the Method and Order of his pages, who compoſed it; for it is as void of good method as it is of true matter, and abounds with what is falſe. But I have drawn up what I thought fit to Reply to, and briefly, as I well could, under the following Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. I</hi> His miſrepreſenting the chief Controverſie, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan betwixt the <hi>Quakers</hi> and me here at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> about the year 1691. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fully detected.</p>
            <p>Sect. II. His Calumnies and falſe Accuſations againſt thoſe worthy Perſons, the eight Miniſters, who atteſted to the truth of my Quotations in my Third and Fourth Narratives, collected out of the <hi>Quakers</hi> chief Authors, as well as againſt me and D. L. are diſcovered and repelled, and the Quotations in the broad Sheet, called, <hi>The ſerious Call,</hi> which he had moſt unjuſtly excepted againſt, I have proved to be true, according to the true correct printed Copies; and that there were no other faults in any of the moſt uncorrect Copies, but what were Typographical, and of ſmall moment, is plainly proved.</p>
            <p>Sect. III. I give ſome Inſtances of his and his Brethrens moſt ſhameful and deceitful way of ſtraining the Quotations out of the Quakers Books, thereby to cloak and hide them.</p>
            <p>Sect. IV. I have in my juſt Defence anſwered to his Inſtances brought by him to prove me varied in Fundamentals, which he
<pb facs="unknown:001110_0004_0FB042A1A3FC4F90"/>
falſly chargeth on me, that they are acknowledged by my ſelf to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>Sect. V. I have alſo cleared my ſelf from the unjuſt Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he hath caſt upon me, as touching my blaming the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for their perſecuting me and my Friends in the Year 1692. as alſo from his falſe and invidious Charge of rendring me guilty of Perſecution; with ſeveral other Falſhoods and Calumnies of his againſt me, rejected and diſproved.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Friendly Reader,</hi> Why is it, think ye, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> neither here nor elſe-where can be moved to meet me face to face, to debate ſo much as matter of Fact with me, as touching the truth of the Quotations, which they ſay are falſe, and I ſay are true (but the truth can never be ſo well found out as by having the Authors Books openly produced, and the Quotations publickly read and ſeen in the preſence of both parties?) Surely there can be no cauſe imaginable why they refuſe this, but that they are ſelf-conſcious of their being guilty of the things charged upon them, and they are afraid to have their deeds brought to the Light.</p>
            <p>They ſay, as this Author alſo ſaith, <hi>That a Heretick</hi> (ſuch as they think I am) <hi>ought to be Rejected after the firſt and ſecond Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and not diſputed with</hi> by word of Mouth. But that's a meer Evaſion, why do they ſtill diſpute with me in Print, and yet refuſe all Diſpute with me by word of Mouth, but that they know they cannot be ſo eaſily detected in writ, and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>The Paper will not Bluſh,</hi> becauſe not one of many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, though they ſhould read the Quakers Defences in Print, when they deny that there are ſuch Paſſages in their Books, either have, or know how to have the Books out of which the Paſſages are quoted, whereby to examine the truth of them.</p>

The firſt and chiefeſt Controverſie I had with them at that time, was, <q>Whether to preach Faith in Chriſt without us, (as both God &amp; Man) &amp; alſo Chriſt within us, (as he is God the Eternal Word) was to preach two Chriſts?</q> which <hi>William Stockdale,</hi> one of their chief Preachers did accuſe me of, and which they could never be drawn to condemn. And whether my aſſerting, <q>That the Light within men was not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe, was an Error, and a Denyal of the Fundamental Principle of Truth;</q> which <hi>Thomas Fitzwater,</hi> another of their chief Preachers accuſed me of. And after that, <hi>John D' Lavall,</hi> one of their Magiſtrates and a Preacher, did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Bank-Meeting on a firſt Day of the week, at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> accuſe me of being guilty of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> for aſſerting, That the Light within every man was not ſufficient to Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſomething elſe.</hi> By that [ſomething elſe] I oft told them, I meant the Manhood of our bleſſed Saviour, and his Death and Paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at that very Meeting it was, where <hi>Samuell Jenings</hi> told the Auditory, The Queſtion betwixt the Quakers and Me, was not, <hi>Who was the beſt Chriſtian?</hi> but, <hi>Who was the beſt Quaker?</hi> Of this divers now living in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> can give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; as alſo, how at a Monthly Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſpeak concerning the <hi>Principles</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if that Faith be only Neceſſary to any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is preached or declared in the Scriptures, it would follow, That if men let alone the preaching of it to their Children and Poſterity, ſo as not to let them hear or read any thing of that Faith, and ſo (which God forbid) to deſtroy the Bible, they ſhould do a kindneſs to their Children, by preaching only Faith in and Obedience to the Light in them, for Salvation, and that to be ſufficient without any thing elſe.

But we find no ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered in the holy Scriptures, that any Faith or Obedience, either of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as he came in the Fleſh without, is ſufficient to Salvation; neither is there any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation to ſuch, but on the contrary St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove, That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> are all under ſin, and none of them can be juſtified by their Works without <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> conſidered as he is the promiſed Seed, as he outwardly was to come, and ſo did accordingly come in the appointed time.

And it is very apparent, that C. P. is in the ſame Error with both <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> by his arguing, <hi>And was not he the Son of God, that was before</hi> Abraham <hi>was! And was not he glorified with the Father before the World began?</hi> But we do not read that the outward Body was before the World began, nor before <hi>Abraham.</hi> But to this dull Sophiſtry, I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Son of God, the true Chriſt was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and before the World began; but he was not both God and Man, the Word Incarnate, before he took Fleſh in the Virgins Womb; and Chriſt thus entirely conſidered, as both God and Man, is the entire and compleat Chriſt and Saviour, and therefore it is, that his Blood is called, <hi>The Blood of God, Act.</hi> 20.28. though this is denyed by G. W. as <hi>I</hi> have ſhowed in my Narratives, as alſo, that he has denyed, that Chriſt hath a created Soul (ſee G. W<hi>'s Divinity of Chriſt, 2d part, p. 18.</hi>) And <hi>I</hi> further prove, That G. W. in the ſame Book, p. 35. has denyed the <hi>Generation of the Son of God to be Eternal,</hi> or <hi>from Eternity,</hi> in anſwer to T.

And was the Fathers begetting the Son a perſonal Act? However</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was it not an Act in Time? If ſo, how ſays</hi> T. V. <hi>That the Generation of the Son muſt be Eternal? What diſtracted confuſed Work is here!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judge Reader, if this Diſcourſe of G. W. be not as plain a denyal of <hi>Chriſts Eternal Generation,</hi> and ſo of his being <hi>God equal with the Father,</hi> even as <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And many ſuch Caſes might be inſtanced, none of which doth oppoſe the Attributes of the divine Wiſdom and Omnipotency; for when we ſay, God can do this or that, which his Wiſdom thinks not fit to do, we abſtract, by a mental Abſtraction, from Gods ſecret Decrees, and alſo from his Revealed Will delivered us in the holy Scriptures, but reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, it is moſt true, that God cannot any wiſe contradict his Will either ſecret or revealed. And it being Gods revealed Will that we ſhould obtain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who dyed for us, and by his Death, Blood and Paſſion, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> than the Light within, taken in the higheſt ſence; and therefore I ſtill ſay, The <hi>Light within,</hi>(call it God, or Chriſt (as God) in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſence, by a <hi>Metonyme,</hi> as when <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord is my Light and Salvation, i. e.</hi> the Author both of my Light and of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet) <hi>it is not ſufficient to Salvation without the Manhood of Chriſt, and his Death and Sufferings, Reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi> for neither God nor Chriſt can contradict the Revealed Will of God, which is, not to ſave us (1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 5 9, 10) without the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>Christ,</hi> but by it, with other concurring Cauſes and Means, all in excellent Harmony. And though it is not Gods Revealed Will to teach all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind all that is needful to their Salvation, by any Light within them, without the holy Scriptures, or ſome outward Means of Inſtruction equivolent, yet we know not but ſome he may teach ſo, as he taught <hi>Adam</hi> and the firſt Prophets, who had none before them. Again, it is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001110_0027_0FB042B461F50610"/>
one thing to ſay, God by his internal Word or Light can teach, or is ſufficient to teach Us and all Men what is Neceſſary to Salvation, if he had ſo pleaſed; but we find he hath not been pleaſed ſo to do; And it is far another thing to ſay, God or Chriſt in Men is ſufficient to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without any thing elſe; for this placeth mens Salvation wholly upon God and Chriſt as within men, and wholly excludes the Manhood of Chriſt, and all that he hath done and ſuffered for us, and his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in Heaven, from being concerned in our Salvation, as any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe thereof. And indeed, as this was the chief Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Quakers</hi> and me here at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> about eleven years ago, ſo <hi>I</hi> find it hath been the chief Difference betwixt the <hi>Quakers</hi> and all Orthodox <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who have oppoſed them. And it is a palpable Contradiction in C. P. as well as in G. W. and many others of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to ſay, <hi>The Light within is ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe,</hi> and yet to ſay, <hi>Not without reſpect to Chriſt conſidered as he ſuffered and dyed for us;</hi> for if that reſpect be abſolutely neceſſary, it neceſſarily infers, that the Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation without <hi>Christs Death and Suffering, &amp;c.</hi> and if they mean, it hath a reſpect to the ſame, but not an <hi>abſolutely neceſſary reſpect to Chriſt</hi> as he came outwardly and dyed for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſtill cheat all that hear them as well as their own Souls; for in ſo doing, they make the Light within the intire compleat Saviour and Chriſt, and Chriſt <hi>God-Man</hi> without us meerly <hi>Acceſſary,</hi> and at leaſt but Neceſſary to the facilitating our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avtion, but not to the very being of it, or rather indeed not at all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſo much as to facilitate it; for if the <hi>Light within</hi> be the <hi>entire Christ and Saviour,</hi> it were a much more eaſie way to obtain Salvation by Obedience to the Dictates of the Light within only, than by Faith and Obedience to all the poſitive Precepts of Chriſt in the Scripture, as well as to the Dictates of the true Light within.</p>

But that the chief Authors and Writers of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly G F. G. W. F. H. &amp; W.

and being received, Overthrows the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> But his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a meer Sophiſm and Fallacy, and proves him as ignorant in true Logick, as he is in true Divinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his Syllogiſm has four Terms in it, contrary to that Infallible Rule in true Logick, That every true Syllogiſm ought to have but three Terms, and each of theſe three terms ought to have but one Signification in both Propoſitions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Terms are four, or more, and not three; whereas the middle term, <hi>That one God,</hi> in the firſt Propoſition, ſignifies the Father; but in the ſecond Propoſition it has another ſignification, and ſignifies the Son. For tho' the <hi>One God</hi> is the <hi>Father,</hi> yet that one God is not the Father <hi>Only,</hi> but alſo <hi>the Son</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> and therefore to make his Syllogiſm in due form, it ſhould be thus,</p>

                  <l>The One God is the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost.</l>
                  <l>The Son is the One God;</l>

               <p>Here it is evident, that <hi>the One God,</hi> in the firſt Propoſition, ſignifies all the Three, but in the ſecond Propoſition, it ſignifies only the Son; therefore, as I have ſaid, the Syllogiſm hath four Terms, and is a meer Sophiſm and Fallacy. If this detection of W. P<hi>'s</hi> Sophiſm exceed the Millers (<hi>viz. C. Puſey</hi>'s) capacity, <hi>I</hi> am not to be blamed, but he muſt blame himſelf for medling in a matter that he doth not underſtand; for I write not this Obſervation to him, but to them who can underſtand it; and as the Shoe-maker ſhould not go beyond his Laſt, ſo by as good Reaſon this Miller ſhould not go beyond his Mill, unleſs he was a good Logician, as well as a Miller. He has charged me in his <hi>Proteus</hi> with ſeveral Contradiction, which only his Ignorance, aſſiſted with his Malice, hath prompted him to do; for he little better underſtands the true nature and properties of a Contradiction than the Mill-ſtones of his Mill do. But however ſhort he is in true knowledge either in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals or Spirituals, he as much abounds in Uncharitableneſs, and moſt uncharitable and bitter Expreſſions, notorious Falſhoods, Lyes and Slanders, as is obvious to any that reads his Book.

               <p>But this C.

For <hi>I</hi> having again and again aſſerted in that very Book <hi>the Reſurrection of the ſame Body for Subſtance,</hi> that is, <hi>the true Body of Man</hi> that dyeth, leaving nothing behind but Droſs and Corruption, that is no more any real part of the true Body, than the Droſs in Gold Oar is a part of the true Body of Gold, No Man but ſuch who is as Ignorant and full of Prejudice as C.

               <p>In pag. 27. C.

               <p>He who cannot prove me varied in one Fundamental of true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> cannot prove me an Apoſtate,</p>

               <p>But that he thinks it gravels me ſo much to be called an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> by him and his Brethren, he and they are greatly Miſtaken; I am ſorry indeed for their Ignorance and Prejudice againſt me, on their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but ſince I have the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, and the Spirit of God bearing witneſs with and in my Conſcience that I am <hi>No Apostate,</hi> but a <hi>True Chriſtian,</hi> having the true Chriſtian Faith, which (I thank God) I feel to be lively and operative in me, I rejoyce to ſuffer Reproaches for Chriſts ſake, believing the Truth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That ſuch are bleſſed, and ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>

But a man may be guilty of twenty Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in points Circumſtantial and remote from Fundamentals.

For it is not what men think to be Fundamental, that is always ſo, but what men think ſo from the certain knowledge they have that they are ſo, by warrant from the holy Scriptures. Nor hath C.

Penn, That the</hi> Quakers <hi>differ from the</hi> Church of England <hi>in Fundamentals, and that therefore</hi> G. K. <hi>is an Apoſtate,</hi> I Query then, What muſt all Perſons of the <hi>Church of England</hi> be, with whom G. K. is one in Doctrine and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (Our gracious Queen <hi>Anne</hi> not excepted, and all other the moſt Virtuous Perſons of that Church) but <hi>No true Chriſtians</hi> at beſt? But will C. P.<hi>'s</hi> Diſtinction that he gives in his Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 46. betwixt the <hi>Queens Religion</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Clemency,</hi> reſolve the Queſtion? I ſay, Nay; for whoever have not the true <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> have <hi>no Chriſtian Vertue,</hi> and conſequently nor <hi>Chriſtian Clemency,</hi> which is a great <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vertue.</hi> Perſons who have not the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> may have Moral Virtues, and among the reſt that of <hi>Clemency,</hi> but theſe Moral Vertues, in Perſons who have not the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Moral Heathens,</hi> are not <hi>Chriſtian Virtues,</hi> but widely differing, becauſe not ſpringing from a <hi>Chriſtian Root</hi> and <hi>Principle,</hi> nor regarding the great Object of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> the Root of all the <hi>Chriſtian Vertues</hi> being <hi>Faith in Jeſus Christ,</hi> conſidered as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man, &amp;c.</hi> the great End and Object being the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> not only in the Work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo and moſt eſpecially and chiefly in the Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>But to go round again, both according to <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> as well as many other <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Religion of <hi>Moral Gentiles</hi> and the Religion of the beſt <hi>True Chriſtians,</hi> differ not in kind or ſpecie, but are one and the ſame, as I have ſufficiently proved out of their Books,

in my <hi>five Narratives,</hi> and particularly W.

P. and they ſay; and whoſe Religion is one, their Fundamentals are one, for one and the ſame Religion cannot have differing and contradictory Fundamentals in differing Perſons; and therefore not one of the <hi>Nine Fundamentals</hi> above charged againſt me by C. P. nor any other Fundamentals but what are commonly received by <hi>Jews, Heathens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who are Moral perſons, are Fundamentals of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and conſequently (on ſuppoſition that I denyed all other Principles but what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Moral <hi>Jews, Heathens</hi> and <hi>Turks) I</hi> am No <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> by W.

               <p>But to make it appear that I am a true Chriſtian, as really now as when under the Profeſſion of a <hi>Quaker</hi> [and a much better Chriſtian now] it is generally agreed among all true Chriſtians, That the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed,</hi> for the <hi>Simpliciter Credenda,</hi> contains all the Fundamentals of Faith; The <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> (reſpecting what is Moral in the fourth contain all the Fundamentals of Practice, for the <hi>Agenda;</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> contains all the Fundamentals for Devotion and Worſhip, being uſed in Faith, and in the Name of our bleſſed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and through him, by the help of the holy Spirit, in reſpect of the <hi>Pretenda;</hi> and all this I held ſincerely when I was under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and endeavoured to practiſe accordingly, as well as to believe and worſhip God and Chriſt in Truth and Reality.

               <p>The one is, <hi>My charging the Quaker Magiſtrates in</hi> Pennſilvania <hi>to be guilty of Perſecution, in their proceedings againſt me at</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>in the year</hi> 1692. and that not only a little, as their Fineing me five Pounds in their Court at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for calling <hi>S.

               <p>After Twenty eight <hi>Quaker</hi> Preachers had given forth a formal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Excommunication</hi> againſt me at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> without any hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tryal or conviction, for my Oppoſing their vile Errors,<hi>I</hi> appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their next yearly Meeting, that was to be at <hi>Burlington</hi> in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1692. which Appeal was printed, and many of them yet to be produced, which contained Twelve Queries, the foul laſt of which did ſo offend the <hi>Quaker</hi> Magiſtrates and Juſtices, that they publiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now that the ground of this Offence may appear altogether Unjuſt, upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle, I will here ſet down the ſum and ſubſtance of thoſe four Articles for which they pretended their Offence, and they are as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nineth Query,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether the Twenty eight Judges had not done much better to have paſt Judgment on ſome of their Brethren, who hired men to fight, and recover a Sloop (that was ſtollen) by force of Arms, and ſome of them, being Juſtices, gave a Commiſſion ſo to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tenth Query.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether to hire Men thus to fight, and alſo to provide the</hi> Indians <hi>with Powder and Lead to fight againſt other</hi> Indians, <hi>be not a manifest Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of our</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>Principle againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Carnal Sword and other carnal Weapons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eleventh Query.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether it be according to the Goſpel, that Miniſters ſhould paſs Sentence of Death on Malefactors, as ſome pretended Miniſters here have done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Twelfth Query.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether there is any Example or Preſident for it in Scripture, or in all</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>that Miniſters ſhould engroſs the Worldly Government, as they do here, which hath proved of a very ill Tendency?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe four above-ſaid Querys, they gave out, as is ſaid, their Proclamation againſt me, ſigned by three of their Miniſters, who were alſo Juſtices, <hi>viz. Arthur Cook, Robert Ewer</hi> and <hi>Samuell Jenings,</hi> and other two, <hi>viz. Arthur Cook, Robert Ewer</hi> and <hi>Samuell Jenings,</hi> and other two, <hi>viz.

For what I writ, and we all ſix ſigned, in the printed Sheet, called, <hi>An Appeal,</hi> was becauſe that we found that the <hi>Quakers</hi> who had hired men to fight, and did paſs Sentence of Death on Malefactors, had treſpaſſed their own profeſſed Principle, eſpecially as to fighting, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> generally have profeſſed to deny, ſo much as in Self-Defence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not to defend themſelves againſt <hi>Robbers</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi> by any Carnal Weapons, and therefore not by <hi>Gibbots</hi> or <hi>Gollows.</hi> And whatever our Adverſaries thought in the caſe, it was a matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to us, at that time, in no case to uſe a carnal Weapon. And that this was the Principle of <hi>G. F.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, appears not only from R.

P</hi>'s <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> pag. 284. Now there can be no Sacrifice that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth the Wrath of God towards Men, but that alone Sacrifice which was offered upon the Croſs, and had his Blood ſhed. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> have deviſed an inward Sacrifice of Chriſt in men; whoſe Blood is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhed in them, to quench the Wrath of God, and who is crucified and buried in them. All which contradicts the holy Scripture, and is altogether derogating from Chriſt, that alone Propitiatory Sacrifice, when he offered himſelf upon the Croſs, who, as he is the alone Sacrifice, ſo was but once offered, and there is no other Sacrifice Propitiatory, but that alone that was offered without us; it being the nature of a Propitiatory Sacrifice, that properly and really it muſt be ſlain, and the Blood thereof ſhed, which to affirm of any inward Sacrifice, is an overthrowing of the Chriſtian Faith, as much, if not more, than the Popiſh unbloody Sacrifice in the Maſs.</p>

L. did not ſo think, but to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand two Propitiatory Sacrifices, by way of Merit to attone for ſin, is moſt contrary to Scripture; for this inward Sacrifice is not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from the outward, that W P. has ſet up, but Manifold, even as many as there are Saints, at leaſt, and as many Chriſts. Beſide, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be Propitiatory Sacrifice for ſin, but what was really Man. Now unleſs Chriſt be really M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Sacrifice of Incenſe was not to attone nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate, nor was it to be any thing that could be ſlain, or have Blood to be ſhed, but did preſuppoſe the Attonement already made, and that the Life and lively Breathings of the Spirit of Chriſt in the faithful, is as a ſweet Incenſe before God, in that ſence as true and right Prayer and Thanks-giving is, that is ſpiritually performed, I ſtill aſſert; but this doth nothing defend W. P<hi>'s</hi> vile Errors.</p>
               <p>Now that neither W. P. nor G. W. did own Chriſt as he was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly crucified, and his Blood outwardly ſhed, to be a real and proper Sacrifice, Propitiatory, for ſin, is evident from their words faithfully quoted in my <hi>first Narrative. W. Penn</hi> in his <hi>Chriſt. Quaker,</hi> p. 97, 98. firſt Edition, ſaith, <hi>One outward thing cannot be the proper figure or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of another; nor is it the way of holy Scripture ſo to teach us. The Outward Lamb ſhews forth the inward Lamb.</hi> Here it is evident W. P. will not allow the Man Chriſt, that was outward, to be the Lamb that was ſacrificed for us, but the inward Lamb. <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Light within.</hi> And <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 56, denyeth that Blood whereby God did purchaſe his Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. to be outward Blood, but inward and ſpiritual. <hi>Now the Blood of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or that Blood that rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

P. <hi>off from calling Chriſt, as Man,</hi> Finite <hi>and</hi> Impotent <hi>only?</hi> This ſeems to me a free Confeſſion of <hi>C. Puſey,</hi> That <hi>W. Penn</hi> did call our

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly,</hi> and I remember not that D. L. doth ſo charge it with the word <hi>Only.</hi> Now though Chriſt, as Man, is <hi>Finite,</hi> as the beſt of created Beings are Finite; yet to call him <hi>Impotent, I</hi> think is very Unwarrantable and Irreverent, if not Blaſphemous. Chriſt indeed, ſimply as Man, is not Omnipotent, yet it will not follow, that becauſe he is not <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> ſimply as Man, that therefore he is <hi>Impotent;</hi> for it implyeth ſome great Defect or Imperfection: There is a midſt betwixt <hi>Omnipotent</hi> and <hi>Impotent,</hi> viz <hi>Multipotent,</hi> and ſuch our bleſſed Saviour, no doubt, was, even as Man, having all Power given him in Heaven and Earth. Beſide, W. P<hi>'s</hi> falſe and ſophiſtical Reaſoning in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> pag. 20, 21, <hi>That Chriſt neither did nor could ſatisfie divine Juſtice, either as God, or as Man, nor as God and Man,</hi> is a great undervaluing of our bleſſed Saviour, and renders him (which is horrid think!) an Impotent Saviour; for without his making Satisfaction to the divine Law and Juſtice, he could be no Saviour to Men; and yet <hi>W. Penn</hi> affirms he could not make Satisfaction <hi>as God, nor as Man, nor as God and Man.</hi> Its true, he could not make Satisfaction ſimply <hi>as god,</hi> though the Reaſons given by W. P. are not good, nor rightly ſtated. The true Reaſon why he could not make Satisfaction, ſimply <hi>as God,</hi> is, becauſe the Perſon who ſhould make that Satisfaction behoved to ſuffer and dye, that being the Penalty of the Law, for the ſins of Men; but had Chriſt been only God, he could not have dyed or ſuffered, God being an infinite Spirit, and infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect every way, without Body, Parts or Paſſions, according the firſt Article of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And it is also true, that Chriſt could not make that ſatisfaction [<hi>As Man</hi> ſimply] becauſe had he been meer Man, what he did or ſuffered could not have been of full and ſufficient Value to make that Satisfaction which the Juſtice of Gods Law required. But W. P<hi>'s</hi> reaſon why Chriſt could not ſatisfie, as both God and Man, is extream weak and falſe. His Reaſon is this, <q>For where two Mediums (ſaith he) or middle Propoſitions are ſingly incoſiſtent with the nature of the end, for which they are at firſt propounded, their conjunction rather does augment than leſſen the difficulty of its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this (he ſaith) he is perſwaded muſt be obvious to every unbyaſſed Underſtanding.</q>

                  <hi>I Anſw.</hi> Firſt, the words of his Argument are in very improper
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001110_0063_0FB042DC2D448BF8"/>Terms, as <hi>two Mediums</hi> or <hi>middle Propoſitions,</hi> which in the preſent caſe are neither Logical nor Grammatical, and far leſs Scriptural; for if he allude to a Syllogiſm, every true Syllogiſm can have but one Medium, and but one middle Propoſition; and what other he means by two Mediums, or two middle Propoſition; and what other he means by two Mediums, or two middle Propoſitions in the caſe, as I do not underſtand, ſo nor (as I think) can the beſt Univerſity Scholar in <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge;</hi> for to ſay the truth, being apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the preſent caſe, they are plain Non-ſence: for, who that ever was but ordinarily well ſtudied in Divinity, did ſay or think that Chriſt, as both God and Man, are two Mediums or middle Propoſitions? The Scripture ſaith, <q>There is one God and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</q> But this Mediator is both God and Man, and not two Medators, nor two Mediums. But if W. P's intent in this argument is this, That where two Cauſes, diſ-junctly or ſeperately conſidered can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce the Effect intended, that therefore when they are conjoyned &amp; operate conjunctly, the cannot produce that effect, the Argument is apparently falſe, as is obvious to every ordinary Underſtanding, whereof many Examples can be given to prove the contrary, but at preſent I ſhall only produce this one; The Body can neither eat nor drink the Meats and Drinks proper to it, without the Soul, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Soul being ſeperated from it; nor can the Soul eat or drink the ſaid Meats or Drinks without the Body, but doth it therefore follow, that the man, who is the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Soul and Body, vitally united, can neither eat nor drink? ſurely nay.</p>
               <p>And as weak and impertinent are W.

And ſeeing the Son only was Incarnate, and was both God and Man, and not the Father, nor the holy Ghoſt, therefore the Son only being both God and Man, could make the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, tho' the divine Decree and Appointment, whereby that Satisfacton was made, and the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice and Power, whereby that Decree was executed, was of the whole Trinity.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> as impertinent is his other Argument, <q>That if man, or ſuppoſe a Prince or King can pardon, without a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction any great Crime, as Murther, Rebellion, &amp;c. that therefore God doth pardon mens ſins without a ſatisfaction to his Law:</q> For, firſt, ſome ſins, as willful Murther, Adultry, and the like hainous ſins ought not to be pardoned by the greateſt King on Earth, without ſatisfaction to the Law of God; the ſin of Murder requires Life for Life by Gods Law ſtill in force; nor was there any Sacrifice for thoſe hainous ſins under the Law, without due ſatisfaction to the Law.
