            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Hiſtory of ELIZABETH ANDREWS.</head>
            <p>SHE was born, June 28th, 1767, in the town of <hi>Weſt-Stockbridge,</hi> (Maſſachuſetts,) of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parents. Her father, Mr. LAMBERT BURG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HARDT, was of Dutch extract, and an early ſettler in the town. ELIZABETH was his fourth child, and the eldeſt of five daughters, being the firſt perſon born in the place. The country being new, ſhe had few or no advantages of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This diſadvantage was, however, in a great meaſure remedied by her diligent application, after ſhe came to years of underſtanding. When about nine years of age, ſhe was deprived of her mother, after which ſhe payed conſtant attention to her younger ſiſters.—Her father, however, marrying again, after awhile, ſhe was in a great meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from this burthen. At a ſuitable age, ſhe went as an apprentice to the Tayloring buſineſs, in which ſhe made a very decent proficiency. Her occupation calling her abroad, ſhe thereby formed a more general acquaintance with the world, which, joined with a frank and generous diſpoſition, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her an agreeable member of ſociety. She was remarked likewiſe for induſtry, prudence and economy. Naturally agreeable in her perſon, ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036837_0003_100B1D2912326E98"/>was equally modeſt in her deportment and reſerved in her behavior.</p>
            <p>IT will not be improper here, to ſay ſomething of her moral character.—Her natural temper was haſty and violent, but ſhe had ſo far cultivated it as to appear almoſt uniformly of a mild and eaſy diſpoſition. She had a heart to feel for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of others, though ready to reſent any injury offered her. She was a ſtrict obſerver of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and its ſacred inſtitutions; and on theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward moral duties, ſhe reſted her hopes of future happineſs, tho' at times ſhe appeared not fully ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied with her ſituation. She, at times reflected on eternal things, and in converſation, with a ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mine, was heard to ſay that ſhe wiſhed ſhe was a Chriſtian, as ſhe believed they enjoyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better than any other people.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1791, ſhe became my companion. She remained this year, in an eaſy, unconcerned ſtate, during which, we had a child beſtowed on us, which ſhe conſidered as a very great bleſſing.</p>
            <p>SOME time in Autumn, 1792, Mr. OLIVER AYER, then a candidate in the miniſtry, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to preach among us on probation. He tarried through the winter, in the courſe of which he made us ſeveral viſits. Diſcourſing frequently with my wife, he endeavored to convince her of the importance of true religion, and of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death. He further obſerved, that it would be indeed deſirable, if ſhe and her ſiſters ſhould ſo live in this world, as hereafter to meet, and be happy together in Heaven.<note n="†" place="bottom">This obſervation originated from ſome converſation reſpecting a ſiſter of hers, who had lately become hopefully converted to the truth.</note> She was
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036837_0004_100B1D2C59DB33A0"/>deeply affected with his diſcourſe, and began to view her ſituation as truly dangerous. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and weighty arguments which he brought to enforce the duty of repentance, had thoroughly ſmitten her heart. Her conviction at length, however, turned to a ſpirit of oppoſition and envy. She was greatly oppoſed to the way of ſalvation as it is pointed out in the Goſpel. Her heart roſe againſt the doctrine of total depravity. She could not endure the idea that the creature can do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meritorious. In the heighth of her oppoſition, ſhe was even led to regard revelation, itſelf, as a mere human invention.</p>
            <p>SHE thus continued her oppoſition till the latter end of May 1793, when Mr. AYER was ordained to the paſtoral charge of the Church and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this place. He ſoon after came to board with us, by which means he had opportunity of frequently converſing with her on the important doctrines of ſalvation. He labored aſſiduouſly to convince her of the propriety of the Goſpel-plan of redemption by a mediator, and of the divine ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty.—He told her that unleſs ſhe was brought to view things in a very different light, ſhe would moſt certainly be damned. She paſſionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſhe did not care if ſhe was. He then told her, that he feared thoſe very words would ſeal her deſtruction. She appeared greatly agitated—burſt into tears, roſe up, and left the room. Struck with her raſh and daring reply, he avoided ſaying any thing further to her on the ſubject. But, ſhe find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had given her over, began to ſear that God would do likewiſe—She would frequently open a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036837_0005_100B1D2E87B66168"/>door for converſation, by aſking him ſome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—but he cautiouſly avoided giving her any direct anſwer. This gave her ſtill greater uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>OUR Rev. Paſtor being occaſionally viſited by the neighboring miniſters, they would frequently direct their diſcourſe to her, propoſing ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion. She would immediately attack them on the doctrine of divine ſovereignty, and hold up the inconſiſtency of their preaching "that the creature can do nothing of himſelf, and that he would nevertheleſs be damned, if he ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his ſalvation." The Rev. Mr. C—was one with whom ſhe contended, with the greateſt engagedneſs. He pointed out the danger of her preſent ſituation, and ſhewed her that while ſhe continued to oppoſe God's law and government, ſhe was at enmity with him, and conſequently He was an enemy to her. He told her that God had threatened to pour out his wrath upon his enemies and to execute his vengeance on them that know Him not. She, however, diſregarded all theſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous admonitions, and her heart continued to ſwell with the moſt violent and increaſing oppoſition. She remained in this frame of mind until towards the cloſe of the year, when her health began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and a ſettled melancholy gradually ſucceeded. That ſtate of mind was followed by its natural conſequences: ſhe would frequently obſerve, that ſhe had not long to continue in this world; that ſhe was ſtrongly perſuaded death would ſoon enter her family, and that in all probability ſhe was to be the victim. Having realized the loſs of a kind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036837_0006_100B1D300DFD67D8"/>in her tender years, ſhe expreſſed great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and anxiety for her little daughter, who, ſhe imagined was about to be bereaved of her mother. Although ſhe kept about her daily buſineſs, yet ſhe declined faſt; her mind was ſtill gloomy, her nights were reſtleſs, and her ſleep was diſturbed with diſmal and terrific apprehenſions. I endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to expel the cloud that hung over her mind, by telling her that her apprehenſions were all to be attributed to her indiſpoſition of body, and a too great depreſſion of ſpirits, but I argued in vain; ſhe perſiſted in the belief that her end was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and her fears were fully confirmed by an inſtance of mortality which happened in our neighborhood. About the firſt of January, 1794, Mrs. R— a diſtant relation of hers, died. She attended the funeral of the deceaſed, was greatly affected, conſidered it as a ſpecial warning, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to realize more ſenſibly than ever the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the laſt enemy. Her repoſe was now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed with ſtill more awful apprehenſions. She would frequently relate to me her dreams, and never failed to draw from them, ſome ominous and unfavorable concluſion. The peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that attended her, had probably no ſmall influence on her mind, as ſhe frequently obſerved, that ſhe ſhould not ſurvive her approaching ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. On the 26th of the ſame month (January) however, ſhe was brought to bed, and ſurvived. During the few firſt days ſhe was comfortable; but was ſoon after ſeized with violent and diſtreſſing pains, which kept her very weak and low for about a fortnight; after which, ſhe began again to recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036837_0007_100B1D31C41CB430"/>and in a ſhort time became able to walk about the houſe. Her melancholy, notwithſtanding, ſtill continued. She could not perſuade herſelf but that ſome great and awful event awaited her. Not long after, ſhe perceived a weakneſs to affect the two fore-fingers of her right hand, which, however trifling at firſt, ſoon rendered her hand wholly uſeleſs. This alarmed her and increaſed her fears. One day at the duſk of evening as ſhe lay on the bed immerſed in gloomy apprehenſions, ſhe appeared to have lively views of God's wrath. She thought he was then preparing his thunder to deſtroy her—ſhe roſe haſtily, came ruſhing forward to the fire where we were ſitting, and ſat down with us, as if to avoid the impending ſtroke. But He, from whoſe preſence none can fly; ſtill purſued her, and ſtruck her into a fit. She ſhrieked out and fainted. We called a phyſician, who at firſt view, intimated that he thought her dying—he, however, gave a medicine which had the deſired effect.—She in a ſhort time revived and expreſſed herſelf thus; "Oh! muſt I die, and go to hell? how can I bear the torments of hell? how can I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure eternal burnings." And with ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſhe continued through the night, without one moments ſleep, tho' as ſhe afterwards told us, ſhe felt diſpoſed for it, but feared, if ſhe ſlept, ſhe ſhould wake in hell. This ſhock removed the diſorder as far up as her ſhoulder, and left her arm entirely uſeleſs. She remained in a bewildered ſtate, the whole of the ſucceeding day, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that her mind was much confuſed. Night came on, and ſhe, being weary and nearly exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036837_0008_100B1D33F10BCD28"/>(having a high burning fever,) fell aſleep and well until morning and felt herſelf greatly refreſhed.</p>
            <p>THIS day (being the Sabbath, Feb. 16th) was a day of reſt to her troubled ſoul. A day in which God was pleaſed, wonderfully to diſplay his power and mercy in recovering to himſelf one of his ſinful, deſpairing creatures. When ſhe awoke her mind appeared calm and compoſed, but her fears ſoon returned with renewed weight. Her convictions were very powerful; ſhe appeared to have lively views of God's righteous indignation, directed againſt her. She preſented a truly affecting ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, exclaiming that "God had turned his face from her, and would not hear her prayers."— On being aſked if our miniſter ſhould intercede for her, publicly, at the throne of grace; ſhe replied, "it will be all in vain, it will do no good;" but did not object. When the divine ſervice of the day was ended, a conſiderable number of people croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in to ſee her, as her ſingular caſe had excited univerſal attention. It was told her, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary petition had been put up for her, ſhe ſaid, "it would avail nothing, for God would not have mercy on ſo vile a wretch as ſhe was, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' her heart was violently oppoſed to his ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty, yet ſhe was ready to acknowledge his juſtice in condemning her." She was in great agony thro' moſt of the day, writhing her body, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ſenſible emotions of anguiſh. We could ſay nothing that would alleviate or comfort her. The ſcripture promiſes, which we repeated to her, ſerved only to heighten the ſenſe of her
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036837_0009_100B1D37365948C8"/>guilt and increaſe her terror. On this occaſion we called a new phyſician to counſel and adviſe with our former one. But neither of them could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter any thing to her relief. Her diſorder lay beyond their reach. Our new phyſician, being a ſerious and candid man, endeavored to comfort her. He held up to her the juſtice and mercy of God, and the infinite merits of the divine Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. He prudently warned her againſt giving way to the ſuggeſtions of a diſordered imagination, the effects of which, he obſerved, might prove fatal, by turowing her into a delirium. On being told there was yet a proſpect of her recovery, the rephed, ſhe did not wiſh to be reſtored to health with the ſame wicked diſpoſition which ſhe then poſſeſſed, leſt ſhe ſhould ruin her family, enhance her guilt, and aggravate her condemnation.</p>
            <p>ONE of her ſiſters, (a profeſſor of religion, before mentioned) being preſent, ſhe cried out "dear Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do pray for me for God will not hear my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers." She remained in this condition till towards night. I had occaſion for being abſent a ſhort time, and when I returned I ſound a very ſenſible alteration in her. She was cheerful; a tranquil joy appeared in her countenance. On my coming to the bed-ſide, ſhe addreſſed me thus—"Are you willing to part with me? I am now willing to part with you and my dear children and all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world, for Chriſt's ſake, who, I hope, has redeemed my ſoul." The peace and joy which ſhe felt, ſhe was unable to expreſs. At the ſame time rather doubting the reality of what ſhe experienced, as being from God; "Oh," ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036837_0010_100B1D38C1B4F360"/>"how is it poſſible that ſuch a vile wretch as I ſhould become a ſubject of God's grace and favor!" A great change, ſhe found, had been wrought in her mind, tho' ſhe knew not how it was effected; it appeared as ſomething wonderful, of which ſhe could give no account. She ſaid, ſhe had been ſeeking her own deſtruction, as ſhe had been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated wholly by ſelfiſh motives; but that God had joyfully diſappointed her. She expreſſed herſelf moſt feelingly of the divine mercy and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, in interpoſing with his Almighty power to reſcue her ſinking mind from deſpair, and her ſoul from eternal ruin. And indeed, it was a moſt aſtoniſhing diſplay of divine mercy. She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her wonder that God had not withdrawn his mercy and utterly caſt her off. Her heart and voice were conſtantly in the moſt lively exerciſes of gratitude, which ſhe continued thro' the day and evening, until ſhe was nearly exhauſted. Her countenance which had been ſo lately diſtorted with pain and anguiſh, had become ſerene and placid. Her tempeſtuous mind was now calm and cheerful, and it was with difficulty that we prevailed on her to take a little repoſe, which ſhe ſo much needed. During the remainder of the night, ſhe reſted comfortably, and ſpent the next day in the moſt lively and joyful exerciſes.</p>
            <p>SHE now began to reflect with ſorrow and deep contrition on her paſt life, and acknowledged in preſence of Mr. AYER and others, her folly in ſo raſhly and wickedly oppoſing the doctrine of God's ſovereignty and the depravity of his creatures. She wondered that God had not taken her at her
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036837_0011_100B1D3BCF4F0588"/>word and ſent her immediately to deſtruction. She deſired that her confeſſion might be drawn up and ſent to the Rev. Mr. C—to expreſs her grief and contrition for her former raſh diſcourſe to him; to aſk his forgiveneſs and prayers.</p>
            <p>(TUESDAY morning, Feb. 18th) I awoke and found her awake alſo. I aſked her if ſhe had reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comfortably? She anſwered, "I have not—for the Devil has been lurking about me all night to diſturb my peace—but I deſpiſe him for his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I wonder that any one will have any thing to do with ſo mean a fellow." She now found ſhe had to reſiſt the attacks of the Arch enemy; but through Divine aid, ſhe was enabled to withſtand his power.</p>
            <p>SHE now gave an account of the exerciſes of her mind, previous to her being ſtruck into a fit, as before related, which was as follows: "Whilſt on the bed, in the duſk of the evening I ſaw, to appearance, the Almighty God directly over where I lay, clothed in majeſty and a flaming counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He ſeemed to be very angry at me, and ready to thunder out a mixture of his wrath and fiery indignation upon me; and I, being ſtartled, with ſurpriſe and horror at the awful appearance, inſtantly roſe and fled to the fire, and fat with the family to avoid the danger. But imagining my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf purſued, and finding no way of eſcape, my ſpirits ſunk within me and my nature ſeemed to die." After thus minutely relating the above, ſhe gave ſome account of the laſt ſtruggles of her mind before ſhe received comfort, which was as follows; "when," ſaid ſhe, "I had exerciſed myſelf in every
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036837_0012_100B1D3E89748070"/>way I could deviſe to make God take ſome notice of, and ſhow me mercy, but finding all my efforts vain, and to no purpoſe, I thought that ſentence was already paſſed on me, and no reprieve was to be had, but that I muſt go to immediate deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My heart then roſe to a ſpirit of malice againſt God and his authority, and ſince hell was to be my portion I was determined to go with a ſtout heart. I therefore ſet about fortifying my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with reſolution, I thought I could bear the torments of hell as well as others, and expected ſoon to join the helliſh crew. I alſo felt great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs againſt thoſe who were reputed Chriſtians, and even the preſence of my ſiſter C—(who profeſſed religion) was highly offenſive to me.</p>
            <p>IN the midſt of theſe exerciſes, when I thought myſelf prepared to go to deſtruction, a thought ſtruck me that I could not endure the preſence of God; me-thought I could abide the preſence of all the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed race, could I but fly the face of Him, I had ſo highly offended. The ſhame I thought I muſt feel in reflecting that God would be knowing to my frailties and weakneſs, operated ſo upon my proud heart, as at once to fruſtrate all my purpoſes.</p>
            <p>WEARY and ſunk almoſt in deſpair, I reſolved to make one more ſtruggle to obtain Heaven, as if by violence, though in direct oppoſition to God, when He was pleaſed to interpoſe and bow my ſtubborn will. I became nothing, and leſs than nothing, and He was pleaſed to pour the light of His countenance into my benighted ſoul. Oh! who would not take ſhame and reproach to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and lie low in the duſt, and ſet up God as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036837_0013_100B1D40ABDB7290"/>the ſupreme object of love and adoration in their hearts." Thus ſhe finiſhed her relation. Her phyſicians again met in counſel, and ſpoke favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of her diſorder. They ordered ſtrict attention to be paid to her hand and arm, which appeared in danger of periſhing. But ſhe ſeemed to have little concern about her natural body; ſhe ſaid that her lame hand would do her turn as well as the other in a ſhort time, and added ſhe choſe rather her right hand ſhould forget its cunning workmanſhip than ſhe ſhould forget her God and Redeemer. Her mind was now filled both night and day with the moſt lively exerciſes. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated with great pleaſure the wonders of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love, and the marvellous condeſcenſion of a Saviour, in coming into the world to reſcue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ſinners from deſtruction. Inſtead of being diſturbed in her ſleep as formerly, her mind was filled with the moſt pleaſant and agreeable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. Theſe exerciſes, which ſhe frequently rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, exhibited a ſurpriſing contraſt with her form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gloomy and deſponding ſtate.</p>
            <p>ONE morning after reſting quietly ſhe awoke with joy in her countenance, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated what had paſſed in her mind, when aſleep. She ſaid ſhe had had an interview with her deceaſed neighbor Mrs. R— (who has been before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in this relation) that ſhe appeared to her in a ghoſtly form, in a beautiful carriage, all glittering with gold, and ſaid ſhe had come for her; that ſhe Mrs. R—took her by the hand and aided her into the carriage, which appeared to be drawn by an inviſible hand: that they ſlew with the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036837_0014_100B1D4232F73DC0"/>greateſt ſwiftneſs thro' the fields of Ether, fur round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with celeſtial brightneſs, and entertained with melodious muſick and the moſt raviſhing conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from her friend, reſpecting the glories and beauties of the country to which they were going; and while they were thus flying, as ſhe thought to the regions of felicity, her companion ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, leaving her alone, and a ſtranger to the way, at which ſhe ſuddenly awoke. The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which ſhe gave of this dream, was, that ſhe ſhould not long continue in this world; ſuch an event, however, ſhe obſerved, was what ſhe had ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery reaſon to expect, from the diſorder that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. She now appeared to decline rapidly, and for the moſt part was confined to the bed. The thoughts of death were conſtantly in her mind, and ſhe ſcarcely ſpoke of herſelf, but ſhe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething of the ſolemn and intereſting ſcene of dying, which, as it reſpected her, ſhe viewed to be near.</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time ſhe deſired that a letter might be written in her name, to my mother in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and dictated the two following ſentences; "When I go hence I ſhall leave behind an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate companion, your ſon, and my two dear lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle infants, whom I commend to the care of a kind Providence, who is able to do more for them than I, or all the world beſide. I wiſh you to have a watchful eye over my dear children, while you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this troubleſome, tranſitory world, and ſee that they are brought up in the fear of God, their Creator."</p>
            <p>PROVIDENCE never more permitted her to ſee
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036837_0015_100B1D43EAA04AE0"/>my aged mother, though ſhe lived for ſome time after. Her diſorder appeared to be of the chronic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al kind, ſlow, but ſure and deciſive in its effects: ſhe would ſometimes appear to be in a recovering ſtate, but no ſooner did we begin to take encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, than a ſudden relapſe would blaſt our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hopes. The effect which this produced on mind may be worth remarking. When her health at any time, appeared to be on the decay, ſhe ſeemed not only cheerful, but animated with the proſpect of her approaching diſſolution, to which ſhe appeared to look forward with ardent expectation. On the other hand, when any flatteding hopes of her recovery appeared, her ſpirits ſunk, and all her cheerfulneſs was buried in ſorrow and deep melancholy. Soon after this, ſhe was ſtruck with a paralytic fit, which we feared, would put an end to her life, and indeed we thought her really dying. This was very afflictive and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and gave her the moſt ghaſtly appearance. This ſtruck the diſorder almoſt thro' her right ſide; ſoon after the had another of the ſame kind which leſt one hall of her feeble frame entirely uſeleſs. Under all theſe trials, ſhe appeared ſubmiſſive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigned, rejoicing in God in the midſt of her afflictions.</p>
            <p>APPREHENSIVE that her end was night, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to me ſuch advice as ſhe thought moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, reſpecting myſelf and our children, and after preſenting ſome triſting articles of her clothing to her ſiſters, as tokens of her affection, "now," ſaid ſhe, "I have ſet my houſe in order, and now, by the aſſiſtance of God, I ſhall be ready to go when called for."—She obſerved that ſhe had been hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036837_0016_100B1D475F1FF0F8"/>her buſineſs forward as faſt as poſſible, for ſome time, previous to her ſickneſs, but that ſhe had misjudged in laying out more than ſhe was able to accompliſh, and acknowledged her folly and madneſs, in being more concerned about the affairs of this world than of her ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 22d. At her requeſt, a letter was written to a brother and ſiſter of mine in Connecticut, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the tendereſt concern for their eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Being unable to take care of her child, ſhe ſent it away to be nurſed. The thought of parting, perhaps never to ſee it more, brought floods of tears from her eyes. The idea of leaving her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren was a great trial to her. She obſerved that, formerly ſhe ſhould have rejoiced to take them along with her, but that ſhe was now ſenſible of her great wickedneſs; that ſhe hoped they would live, ſhould it be God's will, be ſubjects of grace and bleſſings to ſociety. Her daughter's name ſhe altered from CHARLOTTE to ELIZABETH, to bear up her own name, and for the ſame reaſon, propoſed to have her ſon called after my name, with the addition of BURGHART, which was done at their baptiſm, previous to her death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lords day, Feb.</hi> 30.] SHE appeared very gloomy and deſponding, tho' ſhe contented that I ſhould attend meeting. When I returned I found her in tears, the cauſe of which ſhe related. The many doubts, fears and temptations, which perplexed her mind, had almoſt overcome her. I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to her the words which had been the ſubject of our forenoon's diſcourſe, Heb. 12.2. "Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036837_0017_100B1D48E36B0058"/>who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God."—This proved a ſeaſonable cordial to her wounded ſpirit; it reminded her that the was to look to Chriſt as her Redeemer, ſupport and comfort, under all her afflictions.</p>
            <p>SHE continued in a weak and diſtreſſed ſituation till towards the end of March, having frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of fits, tho' they grew lighter; ſhe gradually regained ſtrength, ſo far as to be able to walk out, and in a meaſure recovered the uſe of ſpeech.</p>
            <p>ONE Sabbath day, as ſhe obſerved the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from meeting, ſhe ſays, "O, what a bleſſed opportunity have thoſe who are in health, to go and hear the word of God, but I fear that many of them improve it to as little advantage, and make as light of it as I did while in health."</p>
            <p>SHE now ſet apart a day for private faſting, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and prayer, and could not be perſuaded to taſte any thing from evening to evening, except medicine; but ſaid, ſhe had reaſon to faſt and mourn for her paſt ſins, and for every moment which ſhe did not ſpend with a view to God's glory.</p>
            <p>WE now began to be conſiderably encouraged, ſhe continued gaining ſtrength, but ſhe ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that ſhe ſhould not recover. When a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of health appears, the influence of religion is apt to abate; but it was not ſo with her; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made on her mind, when weak, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtreſſed, appeared rather to acquire ſtrength with the body, than to loſe their force.—She would conſtantly inculcate on all around her,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036837_0018_100B1D4A68B860A0"/>the importance of religion, the neceſſity of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the folly and madneſs of putting off a work of ſuch infinite moment to a ſick bed. The ſevereſt trials which ſhe had at parting with this world, was the idea of leaving her tender offspring without a mother, expoſed to all the enſnaring temptations of the world. Hard, indeed, it was for her to become reconciled to the thought that ſhe muſt part with them forever; fain would ſhe have lived, had it been God's will, for their ſakes. Her attachment to her ſiſters was too great not to make the idea of a ſeparation from them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intereſting and painful. To the ordinary ties of nature in ſuch a near relation, were added the endearments of a moſt friendly and intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance from their earlieſt infancy, as being the eldeſt, to her had been committed, in a great meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, their education, which in an eminent degree, appeared to have mutually inſpired maternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, on the one hand, and filial love and reſpect on the other: conſiderations which, perhaps, of all others, render the ſubjects of them the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly endearing. She counſeled them to aſſiſt each other in their journey through life, and walk as real ſiſters in the paths of virtue.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the middle of April ſhe became able to ride out in a carriage, which ſhe did frequently, and by the laſt of the month, ſhe had recovered her ſtrength, ſo far as to be able to walk to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, about a quarter of a mile. The proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of her recovery now appeared ſo favorable, that I ſlattered myſelf that ſhe was ſtill to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, a comfort, and a bleſſing to her family;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036837_0019_100B1D4CEBF22328"/>and obſerved to her that I thought ſhe was likely to be diſappointed, and that I hoped all her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous ſigns would fail. She replied, that ſhe ſhould not certainly be diſappointed, and caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me againſt flattering myſelf with the proſpect of her recovery, as my diſappointment and trial, at our ſeparation would be the greater.</p>
            <p>ONE day as I carried her abroad, we paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in view of the burying place, "there," ſaid ſhe, "I ſhall ſhortly be laid." Nothing could be more ſtrong than the impreſſion on her mind that ſhe was ſoon to leave this world; ſhe appeared to enjoy herſelf beſt, when meditating on death, and was unwilling to have her mind diverted from the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy pleaſing ſubject. Having ſo far recovered as to be able to read, the peruſed the ſcriptures with great attention and delight. She obſerved that, when in an unrenewed ſtate, the word of God appeared dull and unintereſting, but that now ſhe found it a delightſome and profitable book, full of the moſt conſoling, and animating truths. Her attachment to reading, became at length, ſo great, that we found it was detrimental to her health, and were obliged for a while, to prohibit her entirely the uſe of books. About this time ſhe expreſſed a deſire to become a member of Chriſt's viſible Church, ſhe was accordingly propounded. This, altho' ſhe was convinced it was her duty, was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs, a great trial. She expreſſed ſome fear, leſt, from a want of ſelf-knowledge, ſhe might be left to diſhonor that cauſe in which ſhe was about publicly to engage. She manifeſted a very feeling ſenſe of the unmerited goodneſs and mercy of God
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036837_0020_100B1D5038FD33F0"/>and appeared to view herſelf as an humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent creature, and even unworthy to be numbered with the family of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 3.] THIS was a day of peculiar trial, her fits returned, accompanied with the moſt agoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing diſtreſs and fainting. We were almoſt ready to deſpair of her life. A new phyſician was called, who preſcribed ſome powerful means, which had the deſired effect. She revived a little, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared cheerful. Altho' her pain was exceſſive, yet ſhe manifeſted patience and reſignation; the hand of the Lord was heavy, yet not a complaint eſcaped her lips. She ſaid that ſhe ought cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to accept of all that was laid upon her, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's pleaſure, and juſtly due to her for her diſobedience.</p>
            <p>SHE remained in a low and diſtreſſed ſituation, till about the 15th of May, when ſhe was able to ride out again. I carried her to her fathers'; we had not been long there, when it began to rain. She was very deſirous of returning, but by my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and thoſe of the family, ſhe was at length prevailed on to ſtay. She then obſerved that ſhe had come to her fathers' houſe to die. The weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was rainy for ſeveral days, during which time ſhe decayed very conſiderably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord's day, May</hi> 20.] SHE was taken with a cough attended with raiſing blood, which was followed by a continual diſcharge of ulcerated matter from her lungs. By this ſhe was deprived of the uſe of ſpeech for about a week. We now agreed with her in the opinion that ſhe would not recover. This relieved her from thoſe anxieties which her
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036837_0021_100B1D525D0ADC38"/>phyſicians and friends had raiſed in her mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting her recovery. Altho' ſhe cheerfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the direction of her phyſicians, yet ſhe uniformly declared, that ſhe did it not from any hope of its being beneficial, but from a ſenſe of duty. We now diſcontinued the uſe of medicine altogether. She continued diſcharging a nauſeous and ulcerated matter, which was attended with ſuch violent convulſions of body that we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought her dying. In thoſe turns, ſhe would ſometimes obſerve, "O, how offenſive and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is this body, in which, I once ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. It has become offenſive even to my friends, and is rotting and waſting while I am yet alive, and robbing the worms of their food."</p>
            <p>HER grave cloaths were prepared at her requeſt, and brought into her preſence. She was not in the leaſt affected at the fight, but ſaid ſhe delighted in them more then in any dreſs ſhe had ever worm and lamented that ſhe had ſpent ſo many of her youthful days in ornamenting her body, which was but a fleeting ſhadow, in compariſon with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal part. Thus ſhe continued, a conſtant prey to her diſeaſe, expecting every day and hour to be introduced to the "untried ſcenes" of anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er world. Being aſked one day, by a miniſter who came to ſee and pray with her, what petition he ſhould put up in her behalf; ſhe replied, "pray to God for ſinners, and that my patience ſail not."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lords day, June</hi> 1ſt.] IN the morning ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared almoſt exhauſted, having ſtept but poorly through the night. She obſerved that it was with her in a meaſure, as with the Rev. David Brainard,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036837_0022_100B1D54068D5670"/>and ſhe could ſay as he did, that ther natural birth was on the Sabbath, the Sabbath was alſo the day of her new birth if ſhe had ever experienced any; and ſhe hoped, if it was God's will, that this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath might be the day of her death. She often expreſſed great anxiety to depart and be with Chriſt. The day and night following were paſſed by her, in the greateſt diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, June 2d.]</hi> Towards night, I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to leave the room a while, and when I returned I found her in tears; I enquired the cauſe; ſhe ſaid that ſhe had heard the people in the other room, ſay that ſhe was likely to continue two or three weeks yet, that if this ſhould be the caſe, ſhe feared her patience would fail. I aſked her if ſhe had ever been impatient or uneaſy with her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: She anſwered, that ſhe hoped ſhe bad not been guilty of that particular ſin, tho' ſhe feared ſhe was not ſo well reconciled to her trials as ſhe ought, and prayed fervently that God would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſtrengthen her, and give her patience to wait her appointed time. And altho' ſhe lingered during ſix weeks, for the moſt part in great diſtreſs, yet ſhe was never heard to complain, or repine at the dealings of God, but on the contrary, often ſpoke of his goodneſs and long-ſuffering with the moſt ſenſible emotions of gratitude. In all her diſtreſs, ſhe was ſeldom heard to groan, but now and then a deep ſigh forced its way from her heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breaſt, which was enough to pierce, even a heart of ſtone.</p>
            <p>HER anxiety for her children, as has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved was great, ſhe frequently had them
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036837_0023_100B1D566350AA28"/>brought into her preſence and would embrace them with the moſt tender affection, commend them to the mercy of God, and expreſs the extatic joy ſhe ſhould feel, if hereafter, ſhe might meet them in Heaven. Previous to her converſion, ſhe was very deſirous of having our firſt child given up in baptiſm according to the ritual of the Church of England, (ſhe having been baptized, herſelf in the ſame way, when in infancy) but I remonſtrated ſtrongly againſt it, and kept her from her purpoſe. She expreſſed her gratitude, that ſhe had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from taking what, ſhe now conſidered, as a very erroneous meaſure.</p>
            <p>IN this weak and declining ſtate ſhe remained until June 18. During which, her diſtreſs contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with very little intermiſſion to prey upon her, and it could be perceived that ſhe grew weaker. She frequently diſcharged large quantities of putrid matter from her vitals. Her mind was variouſly exerciſed; ſometimes ſhe appeared full of joy and animation, at others, almoſt overwhelmed with a ſenſe of her vileneſs. Scarcely could ſhe perſuade herſelf, that where there was ſo much ſin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption in the heart, there could be any ſaving grace. She was many times almoſt ready to deſpond and think that God would caſt her off forever. So great was her ſenſe of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity and juſtice of God, and of her own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, that ſhe feared, He would pour out his wrath upon her, as the vileſt of his enemies. She would frequently exclaim, "O! how is it poſſible that ſuch a vile wretch as I, ſhould think of going to Heaven, to live with holy beings, and join that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036837_0024_100B1D59B3597E18"/>bleſſed company of Saints and Angels, who ſurround the throne of God."</p>
            <p>SHE was exceedingly fond of company, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of Chriſtians. She delighted much in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing on Heavenly and divine things, and tho' naturally reſerved in her deportment, (particularly before ſtrangers) yet ſhe now appeared to throw off all reſerve, and to uſe the utmoſt freedom in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and ſeemed to exert her whole ſtrength in the ſervice of the Redeemer, endeavoring to convince thoſe around her, of the reality and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of eternal things. It ſeemed as if ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized that ſhe had much to do and but little time in which to do it, and would frequently obſerve, that it appeared to her as though ſhe made no progreſs in religion, but grew worſe and worſe.</p>
            <p>ONE day as a Chriſtian friend, an elderly and experienced gentleman came to ſee her, ſhe ſays to him, "Come tell me ſome Chriſtian feelings, that I may know how Chriſtians feel." After ſome converſation had paſſed between them, he obſerved to her, "you will have the advantage of us if you die now, as you will begin an eternity of happineſs before us." After a ſhort pauſe, ſhe replied "If it ſhould be God's will that I ſhould land ſafely, I would not return for a thouſand ſuch worlds as this."</p>
            <p>SHE was anxiouſly concerned reſpecting her feelings at the laſt trying ſcene, leſt the Adverſary ſhould throw in her way ſome troubleſome tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and cauſe her to doubt, and diſhonor the cauſe of religion. "Oh! ſaid ſhe, that God would ſend his guardian Angels to defend me from Satan,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036837_0025_100B1D5B38F02430"/>and conduct me ſafely to the manſions of his Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly reſt."</p>
            <p>A DEEP ſenſe of her dependence appeared ever to lie with weight on her mind. Reſting her troubled ſoul on the merits of the Redeemer, ſhe gave over all hopes of obtaining eternal life, by any other way than through his mediation. But, (as has been before obſerved) her feelings were not at all times the ſame. Clouds would often gather and diſturb her peace. Doubts and fears would ſpring up and threaten her hope. She ſometimes ſeemed ready to deſpond under theſe trials, and even wiſh for the faith of aſſurance, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to her the ſecret counſels of his will. Yet, on reflection, ſhe would retract her raſh deſire, and acknowledge that her immortal ſtate was wiſely hidden from her. She confeſſed ſhe had never done any thing to merit ſalvation, but if ever ſhe was ſaved it muſt be by free and ſovereign grace. Whenever ſhe meditated on the doctrines of the goſpel, and the efficacy of the atonement, her heart found reſt. She expreſſed an univerſal regard for her fellow creatures, more eſpecially for thoſe that belong to the family of Chriſt, who, ſhe ſaid, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dearer to her than her natural relatives. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſo agreeable to her as Chriſtian ſociety, ſhe delighted much in the company and converſation of Chriſtians with which ſhe was often favored.</p>
            <p>ONE day, addreſſing Mr. AYER, ſhe ſaid "little did I think when I firſt ſaw you, that you would ſo ſoon be called on to preach my fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſermon as it now appears you will."</p>
            <p>SHE was again ſeized with another of that kind
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036837_0026_100B1D5CC480ADF0"/>of fits to which ſhe had been ſubject, her feeble frame was affected with the moſt violent convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This made her look forward with terrifying anxiety to the time when ſhe might be deprived of her reaſon. Her fit laſted about an hour, but the cramp ſucceeded, which threw her body into the moſt violent contortions. No poſition in which ſhe could be placed, afforded her any relief. We were obliged to uſe the ſevereſt means to prevent her injuring herſelf. She would frequently cry out for help, and four perſons were employed to attend her. This diſtreſſing ſcene continued for about twenty-four hours.</p>
            <p>NEXT morning being Sabbath, a brother of mine came into the room, when ſhe obſerved to him, that ſhe had become an object of diſguſt, as her countenance was diſtorted by recent diſtreſs. "O!" ſaid ſhe, "I long to have the time come, when I ſhall be relieved from all theſe diſtreſſing feelings and go home to my Heavenly Father." In the courſe of the day, ſhe aſked me how I thought I ſhould feel, were I ſenſible that I was about to die, and appear in the world of ſpirits. I told her that ſhe could beſt anſwer. She replied, "it is a greater thing to die than is generally thought;" and turning towards me with an anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious look, ſaid, "Oh! what dreadful feelings I find within my breaſt, how juſtly is death ſtiled the King of Terrors! the fear and diſtreſs, which I feel at the thought of death, I cannot deſcribe." Towards the cloſe of the day I found ſhe grew more reſtleſs. I aſked her if I ſhould read a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Bible for her conſolation? ſhe ſaid ſhe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036837_0027_100B1D5FD8D4B080"/>did not feel ſit to hear reading. I then aſked her if I ſhould invite the ſingers in after meeting to amuſe her with ſinging? ſhe replied that ſhe felt unfit to hear ſinging, or any thing that was good; that ſhe looked upon herſelf as the worſt being in exiſtence, and that God would do her juſtice to ſend her inſtantly to deſtruction. I then aſked her, if ſhe doubted the ſufficiency of Chriſt? "Oh, no;" ſaid ſhe, "Chriſt is all-ſufficient, ready and willing to ſave, but this wicked heart of mine what a ſink of filth and iniquity it is! I however endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to comfort her by reading a paſſage in St. Paul's Epiſtle to the Hebrews, and remarked that he found cauſe to mourn on account of the remains of indwelling corruption, notwithſtanding, he was ſo eminent a Chriſtian. This ſeemed, for awhile, to eaſe her mind.</p>
            <p>A MINISTER from a neighboring town officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with us this day, and meeting being out, he came to inquire after her health. I aſked her if ſhe would have him come in and pray with her; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe would. I then covered her face leſt his appearance, being a ſtranger, ſhould frighten her. After he came in ſhe deſired to ſee him, but ſhe was ſo affected with the interview, that her cramp returned, and threw her into ſuch violent agitation, that he thought beſt to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; but when he was about to leave the room, ſhe, in broken accents deſired him to ſtop and pray with her. He then aſked her if ſhe had any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular requeſt for him to make at the throne of grace? She replied, "yes, pray that the clouds of darkneſs may be diſpelled from my mind, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036837_0028_100B1D6200DD5040"/>that my patience may be continued to the end." As he began, ſhe fixed her eyes attentively on him, and before he had finiſhed his prayer, the cramp had entirely left her, and her countenance became compoſed. He then converſed with her and ſpake a few words for her conſolation. At her requeſt he told her the feelings and exerciſes of a Chriſtian, and recited to her that paſſage of St. Paul's Epiſtle to the Romans, Chap. 7. verſe 24th. "O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!" He obſerved to her that the Apoſtle's wretchedneſs conſiſted in the ſinful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of his heart, and the in-dwelling ſin that ſtill remained, as in this life we are ſanctified only in part. When he had ended his converſation, he retired; and her grief was then turned into joy. "O, ſaid ſhe, how does my heart rejoice! How I feel the love of God ſlow through my whole frame, which warms my very ſoul. O Jeſus how lovely art thou in my ſight!"</p>
            <p>BUT her cramp ſoon returned, and her tongue was ſo benumbed, that it was with much difficulty that ſhe ſpoke. She could only utter a few broken accents, ſaying, "peace, peace, O what peace I enjoy, O that I could ſpend the ſew remaining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have to ſtay in this world, in this peaceful and happy frame."</p>
            <p>SHE remained in this ſituation for ſeveral days, and many times we thought her dying, and often called in the neighbors to ſee her expire. Once, in particular, her breath appeared nearly gone, and her aged Grandmother ſtanding by, endeavored to cloſe her eyes but ſhe revived a little, and ſpoke
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036837_0029_100B1D641E4B2850"/>in a low faltering voice, ſaying "Pray, Madam, do not cloſe my eyes until I have done breathing." Thus ſhe continued, expecting ſoon to be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an endleſs ſtate of being, and expreſſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus, "I am going ſoon to try my faith; I ſhall ſoon appear before my Judge, there to hear my ſentence, I ſhall ſoon know whether I am a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt or of Satan. Oh, ſaid ſhe how it ſhocks me, to think that my naked ſoul muſt appear before God, there to render an account of all my conduct in life; how can I ſtand before ſuch a holy being? But I hope that Chriſt will appear for me and plead my cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 25th.] THIS day ſhe was much affected with the cramp and fainting turns, together with a continual diſcharging of matter from her lungs. It appeared as if nature had almoſt done ſtruggling with her diſorder, and that her end could not be far diſtant. Yet under all theſe afflictions, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have the exerciſes of humility and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. "O," ſaid ſhe, "what reaſon have I to be thankful and adore the ſovereign mercy and goodneſs of God, that he has made me ſo greatly to differ from many of my fellow creatures, who are as good by nature as myſelf, and yet have no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of any thing but to plunge into endleſs rain as ſoon as their breath ſhall ceaſe." In this manner ſhe paſſed three days and nights with very little reſt and ſcarcely taſting any food. I being alone in the room with her was about to call the family. as I thought her dying. She ſaid to me, "pray do not call them in, I wiſh not to be diſturbed by company, I hope you are not afraid to have me die alone with you."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:036837_0030_100B1D66706DA4E0"/>
AN elderly Chriſtian friend before mentioned, who had frequently viſited her in the courſe of her confinement, coming in, obſerved to her in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar manner, "why then you are yet alive; It appears you cannot die when you would." She replied "Yes, I am ſtill alive, God is able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, to endure all that he is pleaſed to lay upon me, and will lay no more on me than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve." She now ſet about ſelf-examination. She found ſhe ſaid, ſuch a ſink of ſin and corruption, in her vile heart, that ſhe was almoſt ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſhe was not a child of God. She was afraid that her heart, would, after all deceive her, but rejoiced that God knew her heart, better than ſhe, and relied wholly on his ſovereign mercy. She was often obſerved to weep, becauſe ſhe could not live more to God's glory. "O," ſaid ſhe, "how beautiful and lovely does Chriſt appear! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worthy of the higheſt affection and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his creatures." She was fearful that ſhe ſhould loſe her ſenſes and be wholly deprived of reaſon, as her nervous complaints appeared chiefly to affect her head; but ſaid, ſhe was ſenſible, ſhe ought to give herſelf no anxiety about that, for God had a right to do with her as he pleaſed, and deſired that he would treat her in ſuch a manner as would be moſt for his own glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 28th.] IN the morning ſhe appeared great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtreſſed having had no reſt the preceding night, ſhe had turns of fainting and the moſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing pain. "This" ſaid ſhe, "is the day of my birth, this day I am twenty-ſeven years of age. I am an old ſinner. God has permitted me to live,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036837_0031_100B1D68155EA460"/>and commit a great deal of ſin, but i hope it is his will that I ſhould this day be with Chriſt in glory. She however revived a little, and her ſpeech appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more eaſy. She eſteemed it as an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty, at all times to admoniſh all, with whom ſhe had opportunity of converſing. As ſhe had herſelf experienced the danger of delay with regard to religion, ſhe exhorted all to ſecure an intereſt in the Saviour. She enforced the importance of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly piety, and of relying wholly on the merits of the Redeemer. Even Chriſtians met with her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and reproofs. She exhorted them to walk orderly before the world, that ſinners might not ſtumble over them into deſtruction. She warned them not to let their hearts deceive them. To beware of building on a ſandy foundation. Her relations and friends were repeatedly and moſt feelingly exhorted by her, to become acquainted with the beauties of religion. The cauſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at large, ſeemed to lie near her heart. She prayed earneſtly for the ſucceſs and proſperity of the Church.</p>
            <p>IN the more favorable intervals, when moſt free from pain, ſhe was frequently queſtioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the affairs of her family. She ſaid ſhe ſubmitted all thoſe things to the judgment and care of her ſiſter E—(who had lived with us from the time of our firſt keeping houſe) and that ſhe was determined to know nothing amongſt us, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 29th.] Her diſtreſs ſtill continued. To her ordinary pains, was added a moſt violent coughing and diſcharge of matter from her lungs,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036837_0032_100ADC812A3CE978"/>as had been the caſe ſome time before.) One of her ſiſters ſtanding by, while thus exerciſed with extreme pain ſhe addreſſed her as follows: "Dear Siſter, we have formerly expreſſed a wiſh that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhould be called to leave this world, we might die with the conſumption, it being a linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſorder; and we ſhould conſequently have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to prepare for death. I have my wiſh, you now ſee me agonizing in extreme pain; but rely on it, a ſick bed is a miſerable place to do this important work."</p>
            <p>THE cramp in her jaws increaſed, and affected her with pain almoſt inſupportable. Her mind appeared to be in a confuſed ſtate. She was borne down with the complicated diſtreſs, both of body and mind. She ſaid, ſhe had a craving deſire for ſpiritual food, and hungering and thirſting after holineſs. Her Siſter C—, laſt mentioned, came again into the room, and after converſing with her a ſhort time on the important ſubject of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhe deſired her to deſiſt, and not interrupt her; and after lying in a ſilent, muſing poſture for ſome time, ſhe broke forth into the moſt lively ſtrains of joy, "O," ſaid ſhe, "where am I! how happy do I feel, what a raviſhing proſpect have I of Jeſus." She appeared to be carried away with the proſpect of Heavenly bliſs, and her ſoul was again filled with the rich bounties of a Heavenly feaſt. Not unfrequently, when almoſt overcome with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, ſhe would be revived by religious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would converſe with the greateſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and animation, on the doctrines of divine grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:036837_0033_100B1D6DD4C67370"/>
SHE began now to have a craving appetite for food, eſpecially for fruits which were brought her by her friends, and ſhe made the moſt thankful acknowledgments for every favor; ſpoke much of the kindneſs of her neighbors, and obſerved that ſhe did not think it poſſible for any one, in her ſituation, to have greater attention paid them than ſhe had experienced during her ſickneſs. She longed to haſte away and be at reſt, and would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enquire what were the laſt ſymptoms of the conſumption. On being told, ſhe would compare them with her own feelings. Not being fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the diſorder, I had ſtill a ſecret hope of her recovery. I applied again to the phyſician who formerly attended her. He came, left ſome cordial medicine and gave directions what to do. But ſhe was ſurprized that we ſhould attempt to do any thing more for her, and ſaid, "it appears as if you are fighting againſt God, for while he is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take me out of the world you ſeem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined he ſhall not."</p>
            <p>MANY times, when Miniſters and Chriſtian friends came to ſee and pray with her, ſhe would expreſs an unwillingneſs that they ſhould pray for her continuance in this world. She obſerved it was painful to her as it appeared to be contrary to God's will.</p>
            <p>MY hopes, however were ſoon blaſted. She had a relapſe which it was not expected ſhe would ſurvive. Her children were brought once more, for her to ſee, as we thought for the laſt time. This was an affecting ſcene to behold. A kind mother bidding an affectionate adieu to her belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036837_0034_100B1D6F5B6828B8"/>offspring—about to leave them in a young and helpleſs condition, in a world of ſin and temptation, expoſed to every danger—not knowing whether ſhe ſhould ever meet them in a happier. To her, this ſcene was ſevere and trying. She em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them with the utmoſt affection, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe was about to leave them in the ſame condition in which ſhe herſelf was left, tho' in a ſtill more helpleſs ſtate. She ſaid that ſhe hoped God would take them under his protection, fit them for his ſervice, and diſpoſe of them to his glory." She exhorted me to bring them up in the fear of the Lord, and impreſs on them the infinite importance of religion, and whenever their underſtanding would permit, to remind them of the tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which their dear mother expreſſed for them in her laſt moments.</p>
            <p>SHE, however revived a little, and appeared comfortable. A ſiſter of mine, mentioned in the former part of this relation, came from a diſtance to ſee her. They had a joyful and happy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. They anticipated, with the moſt pleaſing rapture, their future meeting in Heaven, of which each had good reaſon to hope. My ſiſter being in a weak and declining ſtate concluded ſhe ſhould not ſurvive her long, which proved to be the caſe, for ſhe died of a child-bed ſickneſs a few months after my companion.</p>
            <p>BUT to reſume my narrative; her cramp abated conſiderably, and ſhe converſed with more eaſe. She obſerved that nine perſons of her acquaintance, had been called out of time in the courſe of her fickneſs, "How much longer, ſaid ſhe, I have to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036837_0035_100B1D71D75FCF78"/>continue here, God only knows." Having been at her fathers, ever ſince the middle of May, it was propoſed to carry her home, on account of its being more retired, and ſhe being a little revived, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſented to it. Her removal was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected without much difficulty. She appeared pleaſed that ſhe had once more got back to the place where her trials commenced. Her appetite now grew ſtronger, and we began again to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome hopes of her recovery. Her mind ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite compoſed, and ſhe appeared to enjoy her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well. Our family was ſmall, Mr. AYER being one of the number. She expeſſed great regard for him as he had ſhewn ſo much concern for her ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual welfare. She enjoined it ſtrongly on him to have an eye to her children in caſe of my death.</p>
            <p>SHE being thirſty, called to a young ſiſter of mine to bring her the glaſs, meaning the one which contained her drink, but through miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the looking-glaſs was brought. She took it, and with a ſmile ſhe ſays, "You have made a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but I will ſee how differently I appear from what I did while in health. Previous to her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe was a very fleſhy perſon and of a healthy countenance, but was now reduced to a mere ſkel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eton. She was not in the leaſt ſurprized at her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable appearance, and ſignified that ſhe was fit only for worms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 8th] BEING four days previous to her death; the Church convened at my houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her as a member of their body. This filled her with joy and gratitude to God, that He had continued her life and reaſon and enabled her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036837_0036_100B1D7556759A70"/>to conſecrate herſelf to his ſervice before ſhe left the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 9th.] THIS day ſhe had another fit, which though ſevere, as uſual, did not laſt long, and left her tolerably comfortable. As ſome of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors came in to ſee her, ſhe appeared cheerful and converſed with caſe. Her youngeſt child, which ſhe had never again expected to behold, was bro't home. She ſeemed highly gratified to ſee him once more, and paid great attention to him. She obſerved that he was an agreeable child; "But," ſaid ſhe, "by giving him life I ſhall be deprived of my own."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, July</hi> 10th.] IN the morning ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared cheeful, and obſerved that ſhe had reſted comfortably; and ſaid further, that ſhe did not know but ſhe ſhould ſtill recover—that if it were God's will, ſhe believed ſhe could be reconciled to it as her friends appeared ſo much to deſire it.</p>
            <p>DOMESTIC concerns for awhile occupied her attention. She gave ſome advice reſpecting our family, and intereſted herſelf ſo much in the affairs of life that ſhe appeared as one reſtored from the dead. It was not long however, before ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſhe ſhould continue but a ſhort time in this world, and felt, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe had done wrong in ſlattering herſelf with the hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering. A burying place was by her appointed where ſhe choſe to be laid,<note n="*" place="bottom">A pleaſant ſpot of ground near the meeting-houſe, where ſhe was depoſited, and it has ſince become a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic burying place.</note> and all that ſhe now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired reſpecting herſelf, was, that God would give
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036837_0037_100B1D7773D77430"/>her an eaſy paſſage and be with her through the dark valley of death, which ſhe had ſo long dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But ſhe poſſeſſed, in an eminent degree, that hope which is the ſoul's ſure anchor, which diſeaſe cannot impair, nor death deſtroy.</p>
            <p>ON being aſked whether ſhe had not a remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſh to recover, ſhe replied, "let God's will be done; I wiſh not to chooſe for myſelf, but that he would chooſe for me." She paſſed the day comfortably, tho' ſhe complained of wanderings of heart, which ſhe imputed to the unguarded hope, ſhe expreſſed in the morning that ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and added, "The Lord has been pleaſed to try me both with mercies and judgments; He is merciful, in that he has been pleaſed to relieve me in a meaſure from bodily pain, before I go hence to be here no more. But Oh, how ready is my heart to wander from God and cleave to the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of time." At night ſhe obſerved, ſhe had not paſſed ſo comfortable a day, as to her health, for five months paſt; and we could not but be flattered with the proſpect; but how ſoon were our hopes blaſted. Her appetite appeared to be good and ſhe ate heartily. But, in the courſe of the evening, ſhe complained of a pain in her head; it was of the nervous kind, affecting the back part of her neck and the upper part of her head. The pain became extreme. We did every thing in our power for her relief, but to no purpoſe. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was ſeized with puking, which ſo affected her vitals, that to appearance, ſhe ceaſed breathing. But after remaining in this ſtate, for a ſhort time, Mr. AYER, who was ſtanding by, examining her,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036837_0038_100B1D78F9E5DE70"/>diſcovered appearance of life, while her friends ſtood round weeping and waiting with anxiety for her returning breath. We applied to her mouth ſome powerful drops, when ſhe, by degrees revived, and her ſenſes being probably blunted by the loſs of her reaſon, the appeared to be in a meaſure uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of her extreme anguiſh. She continued in a kind of delirious ſtate through the night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 11th] THIS day ſhe lay in a bewildered ſtate, her eyes, for the moſt part cloſed, tho' ſhe would frequently open and fix them attentively on thoſe around her; but ſeldom ſpeaking or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering if ſpoken to. Death, the fatal meſſenger of Heaven, appeared to be at no great diſtance, and ſhe ſeemed quietly to wait his approach. Oh, ſaid ſhe, I hope I ſhall ſoon go where there is no more ſighing, nor ſorrow nor weeping. Where nothing can diſturb my felicity."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The following queſtions and anſwers which paſſed between us, it may not be improper to inſert; ſhe ſpoke with much difficulty and with a weak and faltering voice.</hi>

I TOLD her I hoped ſhe had his preſence with her. She then caſt a wiſhful look upwards with joy painted on her countenance, and extended her withered arms as though ſhe would embrace her deſired object, and cried with an elevated voice, "O, come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, come" She then cloſed her eyes and lay to appearance, compoſed. This was the laſt converſation I had with her; though it is evident her reaſon was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as ſhe knew her father and others who came into the room, which ſhe diſcovered by ſigns.
