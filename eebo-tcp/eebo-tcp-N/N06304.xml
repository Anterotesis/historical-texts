            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they were independent on the divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there was no Law eſtabliſh'd, for the Puniſhment of Vice, the Reward of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. They expect to be happy, without ceaſing to be criminal; and would enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, without fearing it's appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Conſequences.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>this their Way is their Folly.</hi> The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Monarch of the Univerſe, ever atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Felicity of his Creatures; has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared, that a ſacred Regard to his Laws, is the only Foundation of ſolid and abiding Proſperity.—What elſe means the pathetic Deſire of my Text, <hi>O that there were ſuch an Heart in them,</hi> &amp;c. This is the Voice of God to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ſerious Attention of this honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>IN my following Diſcourſe, I propoſe to vindicate the Ways of God with Man; and ſhew the Advantages of Piety, not only to particular Perſons but public Communities—and then apply it to the Occaſion of the preſent Day.</p>
            <p>I AM FIRST, to ſhow the Advantages of Piety to public Communities—That to <hi>fear</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007991_0006_102E113E7AD6D9D8"/>
               <hi>God and keep his Commandments,</hi> is the only
Way to ſecure the Proſperity of a People.</p>
            <p>MEN of Libertine Principles, take Pleaſure to repreſent Religion in the moſt diſagreable Light, as an Enemy to the Peace and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Mankind: They would perſwade us, that the Candidates for an heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, muſt quit every Claim to the Honors and Advantages of Earth. Many who do not openly eſpouſe the Cauſe of Infidelity, ſeem to think, Artifice generally prevails over Chriſtian Candor, and the Man who diſmiſſes all Scruples of Conſcience as imaginary Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, has a fairer Proſpect of Advantage, than thoſe who ſtrictly adhere to the Laws of Truth and Righteouſneſs.—They therefore conclude, that Provinces and Kingdoms, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flouriſh in Wealth and Grandeur, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the Precepts of Equity; and deſerting the Diſcipline of the CHURCH of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>BUT in vain does the World ſpeak evil of that, with which they are unacquainted—In vain do they miſrepreſent the Deſign of Religion, to affright Mankind from a Submi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion to it's Empire.—I know that temporal Proſperity is not the higheſt Object of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007991_0007_102E117034ACECA0"/>
Chriſtian Ambition; the People of God aſpire after ſublimer Happineſs, than can be obtain'd in theſe tranſitory Abodes of Guilt and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.—But I know, that temporal Bleſſings deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end from above, and the common En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of Life, acquire a juſt Value, when they are the Gifts of God, and uſed with Sobriety.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>great Doctor of the Gentiles</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all Things.</hi> Our divine Maſter promiſes to thoſe that <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God</hi> an Addition of every Thing elſe. In Conformity to theſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we find, God often diſtinguiſhes in the Courſe of His Providence thoſe Perſons, who pay a voluntary Submiſſion to the Laws of His Government, and crowns with earthly Honors thoſe illuſtrious Heads for whom are reſerv'd Diadems of immortal Glory.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever Darkneſs may appear upon the Face of Providence, with reſpect to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons; yet this is certain, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Vertue, is generally attended with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Proſperity—Peace and Plenty reign in thoſe happy Countries, where Piety and Juſtice flouriſh in the greateſt Perfection and Purity.—To eſtabliſh this important Truth we may
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007991_0008_102E114283B4E210"/>
conſider—The Nature of Religion—the Conduct of Providence—the Experience of all Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST.</hi> CONSIDER the Nature of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and you will find it has the higheſt Tendency to promote the general Good.</p>
            <p>VICE is the grand Diſturber of public Happineſs—the guilty Criminal, that cauſes all manner of Diſorders in Civil Society. <hi>Like a devouring Lion,</hi> it ravages the Earth, and would ſoon cover the Face of Nature with Cruelty and Violence, if not kept in Chains by the Authority of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>WHAT is it that renders Government, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally deſigned for the Good of Mankind, an Inſtrument of Fraud—Oppreſſion—and Injuſtice?—Is it not, when Perſons clothed with the venerable Character of Magiſtrates, are more zealous to promote their private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, than the public Welfare, or make their own capricious Inclinations the Rule of their Conduct, and extend their Authority beyond what is permitted by the Laws of the Commonwealth?—Is it not, when they form into Cabals, and are more forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Deſigns of a Party, than to advance
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007991_0009_102E1171CF3BF2B8"/>
the Good of the Whole!—Is it not, when they are more careful to oblige their Friends and Favorites, than introduce well-qualified Men into Poſts of Honor and Profit?</p>
            <p>WHAT is it that ripens a People for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and opens a Door for Tyranny to enter in, with all it's attendant Train of Evils? It is—When that dear-bought Liberty, which they derive, an Inheritance from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, degenerates into Licenciouſneſs; and an Impatience under the Diſcipline of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws, precipitates them into Riot and Rebellion—When their public Elections are carried on by Intrigue; and their invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Privileges intruſted with Men, whoſe Hearts are deſtitute of the Fear of God,—whoſe Hands are ſtained with the <hi>Wages of Unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREVER theſe Vices prevail, among Magiſtrates and People, they deſtroy the good Order of the Community, and evidence it's political Conſtitution to be under a melancholy Decay, if not haſtning to it's final Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>BUT on the contrary, the Fear of God is the nobleſt Preſervative of civil Society, and lays the firmeſt Foundation for the Proſperity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007991_0010_102E114418BAB428"/>
of all Orders and Degrees of Men.—It equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extends its Influence to thoſe appointed to command, and thoſe who are called to obey—It forms at once the faithful Magiſtrate, and the peaceable Subject.</p>
            <p>WHAT can be more finely adapted, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the Rulers of Men with Moderation and Fear; than frequently to meditate on the Greatneſs of God, and conſider that they are the Subjects of an Almighty Sovereign, in whoſe Preſence the Princes of Earth, are but contemptible <hi>Worms of the Duſt,</hi> at whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Bar they muſt give an Account of their Adminiſtration?</p>
            <p>I MAY further obſerve, the Piety of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, ſupports his Authority, encreaſes his Reputation, and by this Means extends his Power. The Enſigns of State with which he is attended, do not render him ſo reſpectable, in the Eyes of the People, as the Splendor of his Virtues.—How amiable does that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority appear, to which we ſubmit, not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a Senſe of Duty, but of Choice and Inclination?—How chearfully do we pay Obedience, when we eſteem the Perſon, more than we fear his Power; and reverence the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007991_0011_102E1174E3BA3998"/>
Goodneſs of the Man, more than the Dignity of the Magiſtrate.—But Vice when ſeated <hi>in high Places,</hi> is odious in every Eye, and renders a Government weak and contemptible. How can Rulers expect Obedience, to thoſe Laws which they wantonly violate? With what Decency can they puniſh Criminals, when they are Companions with them in their Crimes?</p>
            <p>THOSE Rulers alone ſupport the Dignity of their Character, and diffuſe Happineſs among the People,—who honor God that has advanc'd them to their elevated Stations, and ſubject their derived Power, to the Laws of his Sovereign Empire—who ſeek with greater Ardor the Kingdom of Heaven, than the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this inferior Earth—who eſteem themſelves not Maſters, but Fathers of the Common-Wealth—who pardon with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but puniſh with Regret—who take more Care to ſubdue their Corruptions, than extend the Bounds of their Power—who had rather be extenſive Bleſſings to Mankind, than tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over proſtrate Nations of Enemies—who go on in this ſhining Courſe, not from a Deſire to enjoy the vain Phantom of human Glory, but a lively Hope of eternal Felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:007991_0012_102E114669335148"/>
IF Religion is ſo eſſential to the Character of a good Magiſtrate, it is equally neceſſary to form an obedient and loyal People—A People always prepar'd to ſupport and aſſiſt the State, and ſubmit to lawful Authority, as the Appointment of Heaven:—And this not thro' a ſlaviſh Fear of Puniſhment, which is a weak and inconſtant Motive, but from a Principle of Conſcience, which operates, at all Times, in all Places, and is ſuperior to all worldly Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>THE Fear of God, then, is the Parent of Order, and unites the ſeveral Parts of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity together, by ſtrong and indiſſoluble Bonds—It moderates the Power of Princes by Goodneſs, ſecures the Fidelity of the Subject from a Senſe of Duty.—Magiſtrates of this Character—are <hi>like Gods,</hi> diffuſive Bleſſings upon Earth: And the People will eſteem them Miniſters of Heaven ordained for their Good. From this mutual Agreement ariſes the Strength and Beauty of Society, and public Proſperity is the native Conſequence.—</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add—The Fear of God renders a People happy, as it inſpires them with a Spirit of Union and Charity. It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

us to regard each other, as the Offspring of the ſame Father—Subjects of the ſame King—Members of the ſame Body—Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame Spirit—Heirs of the ſame Glory. It inſtructs Particulars, to ſubmit their Intereſt to the general Welfare; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their proper Bounds; and employ their various Talents, for the common Advantage. God who created all Things by His omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Arm, diſpoſes them in beautiful Order; whoever departs out of the Circle, in which he is plac'd by Providence, diſturbs the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Repoſe: Whoever deſerts his Station, and invades the Province of another, rebels againſt the ſupreme Governor, and introduces exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Confuſion.</p>
            <p>THE Goſpel is ſtiled the <hi>Goſpel of Peace,</hi> not only becauſe it is <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> and creates Peace in the Conſciences of Men; but alſo becauſe it is <hi>a Law of Love,</hi> and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Harmony and Concord in Society. It ſweetens the Tempers of Mankind, corrects their Paſſions—mortifys their Luſts, which render them uneaſy at Home, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Abroad. It ſeverely condemns Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Avarice, Hatred and Revenge, which are the Cauſe, of that Enmity and Diviſion,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007991_0014_102E1149CBDD2BA0"/>
which make this World emphatically <hi>a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Tears.</hi> It forms in our Breaſts thoſe amiable Vertues of Humility, Meekneſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Charity, which if univerſally practiſed, would transform this Earth into an Image of Heaven.</p>
            <p>How inviting would be the Charms of a Society, regulated according to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel. Every one content with his Lot, would rejoice in the Proſperity of his Neighbour.—The Great would command without Haughtineſs, and Inferiors ſubmit without Murmuring—The Rich would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their ſuperfluous Wealth, to relieve the Miſeries of the Poor; and the Poor gratefully acknowledge the Kindneſs of their Benefactors—Envy would be baniſhed from among E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, and Contentions finiſhed by mutual Conceſſions. There would be no Infidelity in Friendſhip; no Cenſuring in Converſation. Every one by mutual good Offices become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and agreable to each other. This People would enjoy a Tranquility which would be a bright Reſemblance of that, which is poſſeſs'd by the Saints above.—We might hope no Enemies would diſturb their Repoſe—if they ſhould—God would be their Protector and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007991_0015_102E1179F360F828"/>
Friend, and encompaſs them with <hi>His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as with a Shield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS naturally leads me to ſay</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> THE Equity of divine Providence aſſures us, that the only Way to ſecure the Proſperity of a People, is to <hi>fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Conduct of Heaven towards public Bodies of Men, is very different from that which God obſerves, in puniſhing the Vices, and rewarding the Vertues of private Perſons. The Equity of the divine Diſpenſations to particular Men, is often concealed: <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs</hi> ſurround the Throne of his Juſtice; diſtinguiſh'd Vertue is ſometimes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Reproach, and triumphant Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs crown'd with Applauſe: The faithful Servants of Chriſt, confin'd in Dungeons, and their bloody Perſecutors advanc'd to Thrones of Dignity. We can't judge who are the Favourites of God, or the Objects of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, by the Proſperity or Adverſity they meet with in this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:007991_0016_102E114B683B3990"/>
THIS is no Diſparagement to the Juſtice of the great Lord and GOVERNOR OF THE WORLD: For particular Perſons are immortal; the Time appointed to reward or puniſh them, is reſerv'd for a future State: Then the Juſtice of God will be vindicated, the Myſteries of His Providence unveil'd, the Majeſty of His Government ſupported, His loyal People bountifully recompenced, His implacable Enemies ſeverely puniſhed: The proud Oppreſſors of Mankind, ſhall expiate their Crimes in eternal Flames; the humble Diſciples of JESUS, triumph in boundleſs Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and Glory.—We ought not, then, to be ſurprized, if the Wicked proſper upon Earth; while the Righteous are expos'd to a Variety of Trials.—<hi>Thro' much Tribulation</hi> the one enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Glory:</hi> by flowery Paths the others deſcend to a <hi>World of Darkneſs and Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT this is not the Caſe of public Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, they are of a ſhorter Date. Thoſe Motives which now form Men into Societies, will have no Exiſtence in a future State. Kingdoms and Common-Wealths will be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd forever: Communities of Men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can only be rewarded or puniſh'd in this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007991_0017_102E117BD54EB258"/>
World. Upon this Account, God, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Courſe of His Providence, diſtinguiſhes a wiſe and vertuous People, by temporal Bleſſings; and bears Teſtimony againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Iniquity, by public and general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. To expect Proſperity, meerly from worldly Policy; above all, to pretend to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it upon Fraud and Injuſtice; is impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to affront the Government of GOD, and defy that ALMIGHTY ARM which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſooner or later, pour out all His Wrath, upon thoſe Combinations of Men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe His Authority and violate His Laws.</p>
            <p>GOD may, indeed, defer the Puniſhment of a corrupted People, till they have <hi>filled up the Meaſure of their Iniquities,</hi> and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for immediate Deſtruction. He may viſit an holy Nation with His paternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, to purify their Graces, and fit them for more ſignal Favors; but in the common Courſe of His Providence, we ſhall find that <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation:</hi> Public Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is the Reward of public Vertue.</p>
            <p>THIS Conduct is neceſſary to humble the Pride of Men,—reſtrain the Prevalence of Vice,—and manifeſt the Power of the <hi>moſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007991_0018_102E114E7B4848E8"/>
High.</hi> Among Men, the Multitude of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals ſometimes obliges the Magiſtrate to wink at their Crimes. <hi>Wickedneſs in high Places,</hi> eſcapes with Impunity, becauſe there is no Power to puniſh it. But the <hi>Throne of God is above all;</hi> a Frown of His Countenance humbles the proudeſt Monarch; a ſingle Act of His Will deſtroys Millions of Criminals.—And has He not threatned—Has He not declared—that He will proceed in righteous Severity, againſt a rebellious and unreformed People?</p>
            <p>HEARKEN with awful Reverence, to the Denunciations of His Wrath againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> His once favorite <hi>Inheritance. It ſhall come to paſs, if thou wilt not hearken to the Voice of the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD, <hi>to obſerve all His Commandments and Statutes; Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and curſed ſhalt thou be in the Field,</hi> &amp;c.—Say not, This is the Language of the Law, which was a Diſpenſation of Rigor, and not agreable to the Goſpel, which is an OEconomy of Grace and Compaſſion.—Is not God <hi>the ſame Yeſterday, To-day, and forever?</hi>—Is not Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to His Laws, equally offenſive in the preſent, as in former Ages?—Has He deſcended from the Throne, quitted the Reins
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007991_0019_102E117EE916D838"/>
of Government, and abandoned all Nations to their own Conduct?—No my Brethren—Let us</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> Conſult the Experience of all Ages, and it confirms the Truth of my Text.</p>
            <p>THE Heathens themſelves were ſenſible, the Proſperity of a People, depended, not ſo much on the Number of their Armies, the greatneſs of their Courage; as upon a ſtrict Obedience to the Laws of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth, and a careful Attendance on the Duties of Religion. If we conſult the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all Nations, we ſhall find that they ſunk in Reputation, when they degenerated in Morals; the Prevalence of Pride, Luxury and Debauchery, has ever been a fatal Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic of approaching Ruin.</p>
            <p>To exemplify this—let us conſider the State of <hi>ancient Rome,</hi> in it's Riſe—Progreſs—Decay.—By what Art did that City e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge out of its original Obſcurity, lift up its Head among the Nations, and finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Miſtreſs of the Univerſe?—By what wonderful Secret, did a ſmall Number of Fugitives, advance themſelves to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007991_0020_102E1150D3BEBBB8"/>
of Heroes and lay the Foundation of an Empire, to which the greateſt Princes paid the moſt ſubmiſſive Homage.—Their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates gave a conſtant Attention to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the People; and renounced their private Intereſts for the general Good—Their Laws were ſo ſacredly obſerved, that the Fathers of the Common-Wealth, offered up the Offspring of their Bodies Sacrifices to public Juſtice—Their Frugality was ſo great, that victorious Generals, deſcended from their triumphal Chariots, to cultivate the Earth with their own Hands, and live upon their paternal Inheritance, without Pomp or Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.—Their OEconomy was ſo exact, that it was high Treaſon againſt the State, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy its Revenues to any other Purpoſe, than to adorn and ſupport the Republic. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Exerciſe ſtrengthned their Bodies for the ſevereſt Toils—A warm Love of their Country, inſpir'd their Breaſts with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage—An invariable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Ceremonies of their Religion, fluſh'd them with Expectation of certain Victory.</p>
            <p>THUS <hi>Rome</hi> from inconſiderable Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, encreas'd and proſper'd, till all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

were fill'd with its Glory: The Fate of Kingdoms, depended on the Voice of its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; its Eagles triumph'd to the Extremities of the Earth.</p>
            <p>By what Fate did this mighty Empire fall from its envied Height, and become a Prey to Troops of undiſciplined Barbarians?—Unlimited Ambition, uſurp'd the ſupreme Dignities of the Common-Wealth, without ſeeking to obtain them by Merit.—The <hi>Aſian</hi> Luxury, diminiſh'd the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ngth and debas'd the Courage, of their once victorious Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—Inſatiable Avarice plundered Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kingdoms, to ſupport the Pride and Extravagance of particular Perſons—. As their Vices encreaſed, the Spirit of Patriotiſm decay'd: The People became venal, the Magiſtrates deſpotic. Diſſention reign'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Orders of Men.—Their Generals inſtead of defending their Country, employed their Force to ſubdue it. ROME fell a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ROMAN Arms. The Capital of the Univerſe, was delug'd with the Blood of her nobleſt Sons. That People, who gave Law to diſtant Nations, and eſtabliſh'd Kingdoms according to their Pleaſure, meanly bow'd their Necks to the Yoke of a Conqueror,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007991_0022_102E115329292F88"/>
and became the Slaves of every ſucceſsful Uſurper.</p>
            <p>BUT we need not ſearch any further into the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> The Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews</hi> is a convincing Evidence of the ſame Truth: Their Vertues or their Vices form'd the Proſperity or Adverſity of the State. When they kept the Covenant of their God, they triumph'd over their Enemies: When they renounc'd His Government they were carried Captive into diſtant Lands and became Servants, to the moſt arbitrary and cruel Maſters.—But on this I need not enlarge—The Conduct of Providence to the People of the JEWS, we are acquainted with from our Infancy. From what has been ſaid, we may certainly conclude, that Impiety and Vice, are the Deſtruction of every People. But on the contrary, if we <hi>Fear God and keep His Commandments, it will be well with us and our Children forever.</hi>
