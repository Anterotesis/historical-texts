            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe Gentleman concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Paper being assured, That he is not the only One that needs these Instructions, and that the Benefit he reaps by them, would not be the less by their being Publick, has so far befriended the World as to Expose them to the View of
<pb facs="unknown:000745_0004_0FAA52841DFC4118"/>
all: But it being the peculiar Fate of Letters, to be at the Dispose of those to whom they are sent, This has not, perhaps, those Advantages and Accessions which would have been given it, had the Inditer been the Publisher: Yet as it is, all kind of</hi> Readers <hi>will be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, from the</hi> Usefulness <hi>of the</hi> Subject, <hi>The</hi> Variety <hi>of the</hi> Matter, <hi>The</hi> Freedom <hi>that is taken, and the</hi> Conciseness <hi>of the</hi> Suggestions, <hi>which will further oblige them to measure the</hi> Words, <hi>not by their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but Weight. If this be perused by Men that live up to the Advices proposed,. They cannot but be Confirmed and Gratified, to find themselves
<pb facs="unknown:000745_0005_0FAA528533BC4B10"/>
so luckily Transcribed And if This falls into the Hands of</hi> Novices, <hi>(and such are all once, if Experience must make men Wise) this little</hi> Vade Mecum <hi>shall suddenly Enrich them with a</hi> Treasure <hi>of</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, <hi>which they may hourly imploy, and continue to do so, even while they live: Nay, all must be Gainers here, when they find the</hi> good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>reconciled to the</hi> good Companion, <hi>and the</hi> Scholar <hi>Taught to be a</hi> Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It hath been observed, That Elaborate studied Discourses have not been so Contributive to Wisdom, as the Memories and private Remarks of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="unknown:000745_0006_0FAA5285C0218220"/>
and Conversing Persons. And it is to be wished, That they would communicate their Experiences a little more, and that some would insist on this Subject so minutely, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the Particulars of</hi> Behaviour, <hi>that befits men in their several Qualities and Professions, This would be a greater Kindness to all Societies than that which is intended them from the Experiments and modern Improvements that are now the Boasts and Triumphs of some</hi> Vertuosi's.</p>

            <p>YOU have been infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely advantaged by your Education in the University, which will have a perpetual good Effect upon you, and give you <hi>Lustre</hi> in the Eyes of the World: But that you may be further <hi>Useful</hi> and <hi>Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to Mankind, you must <hi>pare off</hi> something you have contracted there, and <hi>add</hi> also to your own Stores from <hi>Observation</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000745_0008_0FAA5286EAA4DAD8"/>
a way of Learning as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that by <hi>Precept,</hi> as the Knowledge of a Traveller exceeds that which is gotten by the Map.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Ackademick Life</hi> is an <hi>Horizon</hi> between two Worlds, for men enter upon it Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and as such they must judge and act, though with Difference according to their own Pregnancy, the Ingenuity of their Teachers, and the manner of their being taught; and when they pass from thence, they launch into a <hi>New World,</hi> their <hi>P</hi>assions at high Water, and full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as Young Men are wont to be, and such as are dipt in unusual Learning,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000745_0009_0FAA528955F14388"/>
and if they go on so, they are lost: Besides that, there is a Husk and Shell that grows up with the Learning they acquired, which they must throw away, caused, perchance, by the Childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their State, or Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Place, or the Ruggedness of Retirement, the not considering of which hath made many a great Scholar unserviceable to the World.</p>
            <p>To propound many Rules for the manage of your self, were to refer you back to the Book again, and there is even a <hi>Native Discretion</hi> that some are endowed with, which defends them from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000745_0010_0FAA528AAAC0AFD8"/>
               <hi>gross Absurdities</hi> in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, though there be none but may be helped by some Admonitions.</p>
            <p>I suppose you understand the nature of <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:</hi> I suppose you likewise what I know you to be, <abbr>viz.</abbr> To be <hi>Advisable, Observant</hi> and of a <hi>sedate Temper;</hi> Therefore you will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently instructed with a few Intimations: For he that reflects upon himself, and considers his Passions, and accommodates himself to the World, cannot need many Directions. I suppose you also to be <hi>principl'd</hi> with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> which is to be valued before any
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000745_0011_0FAA528B6C8114E8"/>
               <hi>Learning,</hi> and is an ease and pleasure to the Mind, and always secures a firm Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, let the World be never so Wicked. No man ever gains a Reverence for his <hi>Vice,</hi> but <hi>Virtue</hi> commands it. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Men</hi> indeed have been <hi>Popular,</hi> but never for being so, but for their <hi>Virtues</hi> annexed: They administer their Imployments <hi>well</hi> and <hi>wisely,</hi> They are <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>obliging,</hi> They are free and <hi>magnanimous,</hi> They are <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>couragious.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways some <hi>brave Thing</hi> that recommends them to the good Opinion of the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Advices</hi> I here lay down are rather <hi>Negative</hi> than
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000745_0012_0FAA528C63F8DCC0"/>
               <hi>Positive;</hi> For though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not direct you where you are to fail throughout your whole Course, yet I may safely shew you where you must not split your self.</p>
            <p>And the first <hi>Rock</hi> I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, on which Young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars shipwrack themselves, is <hi>vaunting</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> concerned in their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I therefore advise you to be sparing in your Commendations of your Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, Colledge, Tutor, or the Doctor you most there admire; for either all is taken for granted, or you only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your Affection and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialty, or you impose your Judgment for a Standard to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000745_0013_0FAA528CF17D1140"/>
others: You discover what you think, not what they are. An early kindness may make you as blind as an unjust Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and others will smile to see you confident of that which it may be, they know they can confute. This holds in all kinds of Commendations, which should be modest and moderate, Not <hi>Unseasonable,</hi> not <hi>Unsuitable,</hi> not <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical;</hi> for an Excess here creates Envy to the <hi>P</hi>erson extoll'd, and is a virtual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from others you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with, and your own Understanding is measured by it. Nay, it is a presumption in some to commend at all; <hi>for he that praises another, would
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000745_0014_0FAA528DB7F750F8"/>
have him valued upon his own Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is a Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be commended by a Fool, except he concurs with the Vogue, or speaks from the Mouth of another; you must indeed, when you speak of mens Persons (which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out provocation should never be) represent them candidly and fairly, and you are bound to give your Friend his due Elogy, when his Fame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or you are required to do it, or may do him a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in it. But remember, that when you give a Person a particular Character, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its estimate from your
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000745_0015_0FAA528E808DD498"/>
Wisdom, be Temperate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as Just.</p>
            <p>When you come into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, be not forward to show your <hi>Proficiency,</hi> nor impose your <hi>Academical Discourses,</hi> nor glitter affectedly in <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> which is a <hi>vanity</hi> indesent to Young Men that have Confidence, and hear of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Nor on the other hand must you be <hi>morose</hi> or <hi>difficult</hi> to give an Account of your self to <hi>Inquisitive</hi> or <hi>Learned Men;</hi> let your Answers be <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>concise.</hi> It is both your <hi>Wisdom</hi> and your <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to come to the point at first, only in Conferences or Debates, speak not all you have to say at once, in an
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000745_0016_0FAA528F52EE4870"/>
               <hi>entire Harangue,</hi> but suffer your self to be broached by degrees, and keep an Argument for reserve. What you say at first may perhaps give Satisfaction, however you gain Respite for Recollection; and when all is out at last you will be thought to have more in store.</p>
            <p>And because the <hi>Mouth</hi> is the Fountain of our <hi>Weal</hi> or <hi>Wo,</hi> and it is the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>P</hi>rudence to rule that little Member, the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and he indeed is <hi>a Perfect Man that offends not in a word;</hi> for all our Follies and Passions are let out that way. There are many things to be observed in the managing of Discourse, I only say in general, That you
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000745_0017_0FAA528FE8600770"/>
must not speak with <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> nor with <hi>Reflection</hi> upon mens <hi>Persons,</hi> nor with <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Self-praise.</hi> No Man therefore should be his own <hi>Historian,</hi> that is, Talk of his own <hi>Feats,</hi> his <hi>Travels,</hi> his <hi>Conferences</hi> with <hi>great Men; &amp;c</hi> nor boast of his <hi>Descent</hi> and <hi>Alliance,</hi> nor recount his <hi>Treasure,</hi> or the manage of his <hi>Estate,</hi> all which wearies out the greatest <hi>P</hi>atience, and <hi>without a Provocation</hi> expresses an intollerable <hi>Vanity</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a believing that others are <hi>affected</hi> and <hi>concerned</hi> in these things as much as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The like weakness is in talking of ones <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> to those that neither
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000745_0018_0FAA5290AFB539F0"/>
               <hi>mind</hi> nor <hi>understand it.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the Company be all of one piece, their debating any thing that relates to all, may be <hi>Useful;</hi> but it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in mixt Company to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your <hi>Skill</hi> or <hi>Inclination.</hi> In like manner, he is not to be brook't, that over a <hi>Glass of Wine</hi> will turn <hi>States-man</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> perplex good Fellows with <hi>Intreagues of Government, Cases of Conscience, or School Controversies.</hi> which are <hi>too serious</hi> and <hi>too sacred</hi> to be the Subjects of <hi>Common Talk.</hi> Let no Mans <hi>Vice</hi> be your <hi>Theam,</hi> nor your Friends, because you love him; not your Enemy's, because he is so, and in you it will be expounded <hi>P</hi>artiality

and Revenge; not of any other, because you are certainly unconcerned in him, and may possibly be mistaken of him.</p>
            <p>Let not the <hi>Lapses</hi> or <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Accidents</hi> or <hi>Behaviours</hi> of Men in <hi>Drink,</hi> or in <hi>Love</hi> be taken Notice of after, or upbraided to them in jest or earnest; for no man loves to have his <hi>Folly</hi> remembred, nor to have the consequence of <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Passion</hi> imputed to him; and he cannot but like you worse, if he finds they have left an Impression upon you. <hi>Every Mans Fault should be every Mans Secret,</hi> as he sins doubly that publishes his own shame, for he adds scandal to the sin, so does every Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

            <p>When you <hi>carve out Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> for others, let your Choice be rather of <hi>Things</hi> than of <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Historical matters,</hi> rather than the <hi>present Age,</hi> of things <hi>distant</hi> &amp; <hi>remote,</hi> rather than at <hi>Home,</hi> and of your <hi>Neighbours;</hi> and do not, after all these Restrictions, fear want of Discourse; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World but you may speak of it <hi>Usefully</hi> or <hi>Pleasantly.

heart. I think this Rule fails not, that that kind of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that lets men into your Soul, to see the goodness of your Nature, and Integrity of your Mind is most accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for be assured, every man loves another for his <hi>Honesty;</hi> To this every <hi>Knave</hi> pretends, and with the <hi>show</hi> of this he deceives; nay, the sensual love of bad men is founded upon this. Nothing loves a Body but for a Soul, nor a Soul, but for such a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> as answers to that Idea of goodness which is in the Mind.</p>

            <p>This makes a <hi>starcht formal Behaviour</hi> Odious, because it is forced, and unnatural, and assum'd as a <hi>disguise</hi> and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not the Soul to shine clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely through the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions.</p>

            <p>Be not <hi>over Critical</hi> about <hi>eating,</hi> for an Epicure is very Troublesom; though this <hi>Luxurious Age</hi> hath made it a piece of <hi>Learning,</hi> yet methinks 'tis much below a brave Man to be anxious for his Palate, and to have his Thoughts and Pleasures confined to a Dish of Meat.
