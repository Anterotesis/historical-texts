            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ONE of the <hi>Best</hi> Things, that can be done for other men, by any man, who would make it his Business to Do <hi>Good</hi> unto all, is to suggest and supply Good Thoughts unto them. Tho it may be disputed, whether this be the <hi>First Proposition,</hi> whereof any man can be certain, as a New <hi>Philosophy</hi> has taught us, <hi>I think, therefore I am;</hi> yet it is no <hi>New Divinity</hi> to teach, that <hi>As Men Think, so they are.</hi> That Noble Faculty of <hi>Thinking,</hi> wherewith a man is enabled, and enobled above the <hi>Beasts of the Field,</hi> being well or ill employ'd, will either turn men into <hi>Fellows</hi> for <hi>Angels,</hi> or make men worse <hi>than the Beasts that perish.</hi> The Infinite <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, the Wonderful <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, the amazing <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the Future State, the various <hi>Preparations</hi> of men in this world, and other <hi>Circumstances</hi> referring to that <hi>State;</hi> the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious <hi>Operations</hi> of the Almighty both in Creation, and in Government; and His various <hi>Dispensations</hi> towards our Selves in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001067_0008_0FAEF2381DF77E58"/>
particular; such things as these, are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and worthy, and useful for a Rational and a Renewed Soul to <hi>Think</hi> upon. And a man full of <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Right Thoughts</hi> upon these <hi>Great Themes,</hi> will be a <hi>Good man,</hi> and furnished for the Doing of much <hi>Good</hi> unto many others.</p>
            <p>Meditation is therefore a Duty of so much Evidence and Consequence in <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that they can be no <hi>Christians,</hi> nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in the least measure with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles, who do not confess their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations unto it: And yet it must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, That one grand cause why <hi>Christianity</hi> so much Languishes, is because that so few <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains</hi> duly practice it. Our Bible very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently commends unto us, Consideration, and a <hi>Meditating</hi> on <hi>God,</hi> and on His <hi>Laws:</hi> And thro' the want of this <hi>Meditation</hi> it is that all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and all the <hi>Providences</hi> of God, are so ineffectual unto the most of men, and they continue so much without <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> all their dayes, and at last perish among those who do not <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Latter End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One main Objection, which the <hi>Slothful</hi> Hearts of men make (tho' indeed their <hi>Sloth fulness</hi> be the main Objection!) against the Exercise of Meditation, is, their Ignorance of a good <hi>Method,</hi> for the Exercise. Now for a more Fired meditation, there is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001067_0009_0FAEF23967E0FFE8"/>
room in Truth for a vast variety of <hi>Method.</hi> For a <hi>Rumination</hi> on the <hi>Word</hi> of God, after the <hi>Reading</hi> or the <hi>Hearing</hi> of it, (which if we use not, what sort of <hi>Creatures</hi> are we?) there needs no other <hi>Method,</hi> but only that of the <hi>Word</hi> it self, which we have <hi>Read</hi> or <hi>Heard.</hi> But then there is a further <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for which a Christian should now and then <hi>Retire,</hi> that he may therein Enjoy a glorious Conversation with the <hi>God of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all Flesh:</hi> and there is one <hi>General Rule,</hi> to be offered about our proceeding in it. That is This; Let the <hi>Meditation</hi> be sure to consist of <hi>Two Parts:</hi> Let the first part be, to <hi>Inform</hi> our selves, and let the second part be to <hi>Affect</hi> our selves. In the first part, of our <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> we may either Handle a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ert, or we may Answer a Case, in both of which, the <hi>Method</hi> is only, to speak unto it as well as we can; or else we may Discourse on a thing, whereon if we would manage our Discourse to purpose, we may observe, In the first place. The nature, (or Definition) of the Thing; and the Titles which the Scripture puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Next the Destribution of the Thing; Thirdly, the Causes of it; Fourthly, the effects of it; Fifthly, the Subjects of it; Sixthly, the Adjuncts of it; Seventhly, the Opposites of it; &amp; Eighthly, the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it. In the Second Part of our <hi>Meditation,</hi> Let there be always these three
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001067_0010_0FAEF239F4A3C8C8"/>
Steps First, An Examination, of our own <hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> relating to what we are upon: Secondly, An Expostulation with our selves to Quicken our Better Conduct; Thirdly, A Resolution of a Better Conduct in certain special Instances of Obedience. Let numberless <hi>Ejaculations</hi> be intermixed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Exercise; &amp; then let all Expire in a more <hi>Set Prayer,</hi> for such <hi>Graces</hi> of Heaven, as may be most agreeable to our <hi>Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Christian, that would conscientiously maintain a course of such <hi>Meditation,</hi> [Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for the most part, a Quarter of an Hour, or more, every Evening,] would find incredible Advantages arising from it. The Advantages would be such, that from a sense of them, I remember with what a <hi>Pathos,</hi> the famous Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> concludes his Exhortation of his Reader to the chearful practice of it; <hi>Let him Curse me upon his Death Bed</hi> (says he) <hi>if looking back from thence, to the bestowing of his former times, he acknowledge not these Hours, placed the most happily in his whole Life; if he then wish not, he had worn out more Dayes in so profitable and Heavenly a work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then there is another sort of more Transient Meditation, wherein the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that shall accustome himself unto it, will find a <hi>Lasting Satisfaction.</hi> All the <hi>Creatures of</hi> God about us, are so many <hi>Preachers</hi> from God unto us: and there is <hi>no Speech nor Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001067_0011_0FAEF23A8B22A1B8"/>
where their voice</hi> might not be <hi>heard,</hi> if men who <hi>have Ears to bear,</hi> would but <hi>hear it.</hi> As there are <hi>Footsteps</hi> of the Divine <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to be seen upon all the Creatures, <hi>Praesentemque docet quaelibet Herb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Deum;</hi> so there are also Numberless Lessons of <hi>Morality,</hi> which by the Help of the <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> between the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> World, (that, if we may use a Jewish phrase, are <hi>both Sealed with the same Seal,)</hi> we may learn from them. That passage of the Psalmist. Psal.119. 99. <hi>I have more understanding than all my Teachers, for thy Testimonies are my Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> I remember, in the <hi>Pirke Avoth,</hi> one <hi>Ben Zoma</hi> so reads it, <hi>I learn understanding from all my Teachers.</hi> Truly, we have a world of <hi>Teachers</hi> about us; and if we were duly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto <hi>Meditation</hi> on the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of God, it would be a Delight unto us, to be <hi>Learning understanding from them all.</hi> To fetch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and enriching <hi>Instructions</hi> out of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> that surround us, is most certainly one of the <hi>Highest Uses</hi> that we can put them unto; Yea, we are in a inexpressible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Candidates</hi> of the <hi>World to come,</hi> when we put the <hi>Creatures</hi> unto such <hi>Blessed Uses:</hi> And we have this <hi>Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> that whoever be the <hi>Possessors</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> we may even without asking the <hi>Owners leave,</hi> or breaking the <hi>Eighth Commandment,</hi> thus <hi>use</hi> all that we <hi>see,</hi> and make it perhaps a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001067_0012_0FAEF23B69A35CE0"/>
times more serviceable unto us, than it is unto him that <hi>possesses</hi> it. It can't but be a great <hi>Sign,</hi> and <hi>Cause,</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Mindedness</hi> in a Christian, to have a mind set upon <hi>Spiritualizing</hi> the most <hi>Earthly Objects</hi> that are before him: And if it <hi>Require</hi> not, yet it will <hi>Produce,</hi> not only <hi>Spirituality,</hi> but also <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> more than a little, thus to set all the <hi>Creatures</hi> of God on speaking unto us. <hi>Truly the Light is sweet;</hi> but usually a <hi>Ray</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> is much the <hi>Sweeter,</hi> for descending from Heaven unto us, in some <hi>Earthly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>Similitude.</hi> And if also we may be Foolishly Impatient at the <hi>Reproofs</hi> of our Neighbours, and by that Impatience perhaps may discourage them from doing us the <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their <hi>wise Reproofs,</hi> we may now obtain those to <hi>Reprove</hi> us, that cannot <hi>Offend</hi> us. What an admirable, what a profitable Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, Syrs, have we now before us! A <hi>Chymistry,</hi> by which we may turn the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Objects whatsoever, into what is far <hi>better than Gold, than much fine Gold!</hi> And <hi>for</hi> this <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry,</hi> we have indeed one singular Advantage; That <hi>no Employment, no Company, no Place,</hi> need hinder us from it. We may any where, every where, Apply our selves unto it; and especially in the little <hi>Fragments of Time,</hi> that intervene between our more <hi>Stated Businesses.</hi> There will also be this very notable of it. That when-ever we have been at the pains to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001067_0013_0FAEF23C08434BA0"/>
make any Occasional Reflections on any thing, there are not only <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> for the present raised in us, but the <hi>Sight</hi> of those Things upon any occasion afterwards, will be ready to raise the same <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> again, and make our <hi>mind,</hi> for the <hi>continual Feast</hi> of it, as that of the <hi>Righteous</hi> is: For, <hi>Anima Justi Caelum est.</hi> Let no man be so vainly Impertinent, as to deride the <hi>Art,</hi> (&amp; <hi>Heart,</hi>) of making these Occasional Reflections. We have not only the Writings of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Robert Boyl,</hi> of Sr. <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> of Dr. <hi>Spurstow,</hi> and other persons of the <hi>finest Heart strings,</hi> recommending this <hi>Art</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; but we have above all the most unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Example of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, to recommend it. Our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord Jesus Christ; when He saw a <hi>Vine,</hi> or a <hi>Field,</hi> or the <hi>Bread</hi> on the <hi>Table,</hi> or a stately <hi>House,</hi> or but an <hi>Hen and Chickens,</hi> His Holy Soul presently Sally'd forth to some Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Reflections thereupon, which had much of <hi>Admonition</hi> in them. To <hi>abound in these works of the Lord,</hi> will be no small <hi>Conformity</hi> to our most <hi>Exemplary Saviour:</hi> and it will therewithal most gloriously transfer this World, from the <hi>First,</hi> unto that <hi>Second Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Method</hi> of proceeding in our Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Reflections, needs not be tied up unto many strict <hi>Rules</hi> about it. I remember, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de Sancto Victore</hi> tells us, That there is a <hi>Three fold Voice</hi> of all the <hi>Creatures</hi> unto us,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001067_0014_0FAEF23CF501B3C0"/>
               <hi>Accipe, Redde, Fuge.</hi> All <hi>Creatures</hi> may put us, in mind, first of something that we do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of God, in them; next, of something that we should Return to God for them; and thirdly, of something that we should Avoid, both of <hi>Transgression</hi> in them, and so of <hi>Punishment</hi> from them. And it were a very sutiable <hi>Method of Thinking,</hi> to touch upon each of those <hi>Three Heads</hi> in our Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Reflections Or at lest, we may do well to oblige our selves unto the forming of a certain <hi>Triangle</hi> in them, with first, Going <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Behold, Reader, a Book of Occasional Reflections, all made upon one of those <hi>Creatures,</hi> that we have daily before us: And if <hi>one</hi> of them, could afford so many <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> unto one of so <hi>dull,</hi> and so <hi>vain</hi> a mind, as that which the Author of this Book, has to complain of (and yet <hi>he himself</hi> now finds, it might have easily afforded him as <hi>many more!</hi>) What an Immense Treasure of <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> might we find in all the rest? The Reason, why the Author singled out the fire, for his <hi>Chymistry</hi> to <hi>Work upon,</hi> (the

very thing that other <hi>Chymistry</hi> does prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <hi>Work withal,)</hi> was, partly, because one day perswading some of his Intimate Friends, to try their skill at Occasional Reflections, he accidentally let fall this Encouragement; <hi>He would give them a Demonstration, that as dry a Subject, as for instance, that of the Fire then before us, would yield a Christian a whole Book full of Meditations;</hi> And he was obliged then to give the <hi>Demonstrations:</hi> [making some good progress in it, as long agoe as the year, 1683.] And partly, because he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, That we <hi>all</hi> spend very much of our <hi>Time</hi> at the <hi>Fire: Every body</hi> is concerned with it, and Relieved by it: and he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, That by the way of Occasional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections thereupon, he might convey those <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> unto his Friends, which would so more beneficial to their <hi>Inward,</hi> than the <hi>Fire</hi> is to their <hi>Outward man.</hi> Go then, my Little <hi>Book.</hi> If thou do any Hurt unto the Interests of Religion, or bring any <hi>Strange Fire</hi> to the Altars of God, I am willing thou shouldst have the Fate of those vile <hi>Books,</hi> which being thrown into the <hi>Fire,</hi> made a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Spectator say, <hi>Nunquam vidi Clariorem Ignem,</hi> I never saw a brighter <hi>Fire!</hi> But certainly, 'Tis <hi>Good,</hi> and not <hi>Hurt,</hi> for Christians to be <hi>warmed</hi> (even by the <hi>Fire,)</hi> into a <hi>Fervency of Spirit, serving the Lord.</hi> And God can make this Little Book, of the <hi>Fire,</hi> to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

(as once a <hi>Pillar of Fire</hi> was) to Lead some of His People unto their <hi>Everlasting Rest.</hi> This Little Book may help, like them whose Office it was, to preserve the <hi>Sacred Fire,</hi> even to keep the <hi>Fire of zeal</hi> for <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> in some or other from going out. Tho' <hi>Reading by Fire light</hi> is not good for the <hi>Eyes,</hi> yet it will do their neither the <hi>Eyes,</hi> nor the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the Readers any Damage, I hope, to Read of the <hi>Fire</hi> and see many <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> by the <hi>Fire light.</hi> A Philosohus per Ignem, is counted a man of some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: And he will attain something too, that shall be, Christianus per Ignem, Try, Syrs, whether this Little Book will do any thing to make you such.

            <p>The <hi>Time</hi> of our Lords being Arraign'd, and Condemn'd, for us, had this Remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; <hi>It was Cold.</hi> May that Circumstance add some <hi>warmth</hi> unto our Meditations on the Sufferings of our Lord. When we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Agonies which our Lord in a <hi>Cold Night</hi> Endured for us, were such as notwithstanding His then Lying on the <hi>Cold Ground,</hi> threw Him into a bloody <hi>Sweat,</hi> it may well make us cry out, <hi>Lord, what means the Heat of this Anger?</hi> And beholding the <hi>Love</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ unto us, in these His direful <hi>Agonies,</hi> we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>The Coals of this Love, were Coals of Fire, having a most vehement Flame.</hi> What a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Thing is it, that a Disciple, who had newly seen these <hi>Agonies</hi> of his Lords <hi>Love</hi> unto Him, should when <hi>Warming himself by a Fire of Coals,</hi> in that very Night, find his own <hi>Love</hi> unto his Lord so <hi>Cold,</hi> as to <hi>Deny</hi> Him!</p>
            <p>That this Time should be so <hi>Cold,</hi> may be perhaps by some a little wondred at, because the <hi>Spring</hi> was now advancing; the month of <hi>March</hi> was now begun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Harvest</hi> in that

warm Climate was at hand.

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001067_0021_0FAEF2445E4CA720"/>
No doubt, it made the Enemies of our Lord, the more to insult over Him, and flout, <hi>See how bravely this Doctor hath instructed his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples!</hi> This doubtless hardened those Enemies in what they were about: And our Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hearing the speeches of <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore look'd back with inexpressible <hi>Grief</hi> upon him. In the mean Time, sit still with admiration at the <hi>Flaming Love</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was now <hi>Suffering</hi> for them that were at this Time <hi>Sinning.</hi> Tho' our Lord were sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that <hi>Peter</hi> were now <hi>Denying</hi> of Him, yet He would not give over the work of <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for <hi>Peter,</hi> to save <hi>Peter</hi> from the Sin of his <hi>Denyal,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> might not be <hi>Deny'd</hi> by the merciful God of Heaven, that the plagues which <hi>Peter</hi> was wickedly wishing to himself might not come upon him, according to his wicked wishes. Behold, Syrs, Behold, a <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>Flames</hi> whereof are more ardent, than those at which you would now <hi>warm</hi> your selves. But I am very prone to suspect, that there was a further special Design of all the Evangelists, in reporting <hi>Peters</hi> Denyal of the Lord; and I believe <hi>Peter</hi> himself did, for that among other causes, desire every one of them, and <hi>Mark</hi> above the rest, that they would particularly tell the Story of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in their Gospels. Tis This; <hi>Peters Denying</hi> of our Lord, gives an irrefragable and ungainsayable <hi>Demonstration,</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001067_0022_0FAEF2452B4F6AE8"/>
of what he asserted afterwards in <hi>witnessing</hi> for our Lord. By <hi>Peters Denying</hi> our Lord' before He <hi>Dyed,</hi> there is produced an irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof of the <hi>Truth</hi> in his Testimony that our Lord <hi>Rose</hi> from the <hi>Dead.</hi> Had our Lord continued in the State of <hi>Death,</hi> you may be sure, <hi>Peter</hi> would have persisted in his <hi>Denial</hi> of Him. If our Lord had been found an <hi>Impostor,</hi> by His remaining under the Bands of <hi>Death, Peter</hi> having thus <hi>Deny'd</hi> Him, would have gone on to <hi>Deny</hi> Him, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Him all his dayes. But now, instead of This; you have this very <hi>Peter</hi> afterwards writing two <hi>Epistles,</hi> and Preaching more than two thousand <hi>Sermons,</hi> and Exposing himself to more than ten thousand <hi>Torments,</hi> that he might assure the world, of his Lords <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Dead.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> went about every where commending and proclaiming, and adoring his Dearest JESUS, as the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> of God, it was a mighty Confirmation to the Truth of his Testimony, to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>This is the man, who once Deny'd and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swore that JESUS, whom he now so magnifies!</hi> Thus our Incontestable Religion, like the <hi>Fire</hi> before you, will fetch <hi>Fuel</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> from every thing. Oh! Be amazed at the deep Counsils of God; <hi>Peters Denial of Christ,</hi> is one thing that helps to render the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> for ever <hi>undeniable!</hi>

               <p>The Narrative of this unhappy Business,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001067_0023_0FAEF245C6A2AB60"/>
the <hi>Denyal</hi> of our Lord, by <hi>Peter,</hi> is given us by the Four Evangelists, with some variety. They all reckon up <hi>Three</hi> several Times of <hi>Peters Denying</hi> the Lord; and the first of the <hi>Three</hi> which was on the challenge of a <hi>Damosel,</hi> is very variously described. The Reconcilation is easy: Several Speeches were uttered by the <hi>Damosel</hi> unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and about him; and <hi>Peter</hi> made several Answers, whereof one of the Gospels does Relate one, and Another, another. The <hi>Damosel</hi> first says to the Standers by, (as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it,) <hi>This man also was with Him;</hi> And then turning to <hi>Peter,</hi> she says (as <hi>John</hi> hath it,) <hi>Art not thou one of this mans Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?</hi> Whereupon she peremptorily affirms, that she had seen <hi>Peter</hi> with Him, saying, (as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> have it,) <hi>Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</hi> This drew out the several Answers of <hi>Peter,</hi> which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists have severally Recorded; All which together make up the <hi>First</hi> Action of <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Denying</hi> his Lord; and <hi>That</hi> where with our Discourse is now more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned. All this occurr'd, at <hi>Peters</hi> first coming to the <hi>Fire side.</hi>

with Disposition, to Repeat his Affection to Him, [yea, and this by the <hi>Fire side</hi> also! See Joh.21.9] as often as his <hi>Denial</hi> of Him had been Repeated.

The Psalmist could say, Psal.147.18. <hi>Who can stand before Gods Cold!</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Constancy</hi> of our Souls, in the Service of God, is often impaired and impeded by <hi>His Cold;</hi> tho' methinks, its being <hi>His Cold,</hi> should rather <hi>pinch</hi> us to the doing of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in some respects, than <hi>chill;</hi> us from it.</p>
               <p>We will briefly, and as the <hi>Cold</hi> now upon us, will allow us, Enquire,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>How do men sometimes Deny the Lord on the Occasion of the Cold?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Know it, Syrs, That when <hi>Duty</hi> to the Lord, is omitted, by reason of the <hi>Cold,</hi> then the Lord is <hi>Denyed</hi> for the <hi>Cold.</hi> The Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Christian Duties, is called, <hi>A Denial of the only Lord God, even of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> We read of some, who, <hi>In works Deny Him.</hi> When the <hi>Cold</hi> puts us by the Doing of such <hi>Good Works,</hi> as might be done by us notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001067_0037_0FAEF567B811BE98"/>
the <hi>Cold,</hi> we practically, <hi>Deny</hi> the Lord, <hi>because it is Cold.</hi> We <hi>Deny</hi> that our Lord Jesus Christ is our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we <hi>Deny</hi> that He is our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> we <hi>Deny,</hi> that He is our <hi>Example,</hi> when we <hi>Deny</hi> to keep the <hi>Precepts</hi> which He has <hi>commanded us to keep with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi> Impiety is called, 1 Tim.5.8. <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the Faith.</hi> If we are Impious, we are <hi>Denyers</hi> of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Cold</hi> is often made an unjust, and an undue <hi>pretence</hi> for mens omitting of their <hi>Duty.</hi> Many a man is that <hi>Sluggard,</hi> who, (Prov.20.4) <hi>will not plough</hi> (nor do many another Duty) <hi>by reason of the Cold.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>by reason of the cold,</hi> we omit the Duties of <hi>Piety.</hi> Our <hi>Supplications</hi> are <hi>Frozen,</hi> when the <hi>Frost</hi> has taken every thing else: Our <hi>Meditations</hi> are <hi>sapless,</hi> when the <hi>Sap</hi> is gone from all the Fields about us; we needlesly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selves from the <hi>House of God,</hi> when we can be warmer in our <hi>own Houses;</hi> and object the Snow, or the Wet, as a <hi>Lion, in the way:</hi> We lay aside <hi>Working about our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> when our Hands are <hi>Sealed up</hi> from doing our <hi>other work:</hi> We lay aside the <hi>Wars of the Lord,</hi> or our combate with our interior Adversaries, when Retired into our <hi>Winter Quarters.

               <p>Again, Sometimes <hi>by reason of the cold,</hi> we omit the Duties of <hi>Charity,</hi> Our <hi>Charity</hi> is often as <hi>cold,</hi> as the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>because of the

Time.</hi> When we are <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> at our <hi>Winter Tables,</hi> we are not grieved for those that want <hi>Meat</hi> or <hi>Drink:</hi> Nor are we <hi>grieved for the poor,</hi> who have <hi>no Covering,</hi> while we are <hi>well Covered,</hi> and are Shivering over a <hi>Brands End</hi> or two, (the <hi>Widows Fire,</hi>) while we are more than sufficiently <hi>Warmed,</hi> Our own circumstances, that should rather <hi>Excite</hi> us, to do all the Good we can, <hi>unto</hi> those that are not so well circumstanced, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal</hi> us rather into an Insensibility of other peoples; and the <hi>Love of many waxes cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more; Don't we often <hi>mispend</hi> our Hours, <hi>by reason of the cold?</hi> Is not advantage taken, when our <hi>Clocks</hi> won't <hi>go,</hi> for such a mispence of <hi>Time,</hi> as if we dream the <hi>Time</hi> also Stood <hi>still!</hi> What <hi>Gaming,</hi> what <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> what <hi>Profanity,</hi> and (which is to say <hi>All</hi> the <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>All</hi> the <hi>worst!</hi>) What <hi>Evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> is the <hi>Winter</hi> often made an occasion for? Truly, Our Lord Jesus Christ, is in some degree <hi>Denied,</hi> by a such miscarriages.</p>
               <p>We will then Enquire,</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>How men may come rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, than to deny the Lord, on the occasion of the Cold?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Croud</hi> will do best in the <hi>Cold,</hi> I will <hi>croud</hi> close together a few Instructions.</p>
               <p>First, Consider, O Christians, That the more <hi>Self denial</hi> you undergo, for the <hi>Serving</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, under the Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001067_0039_0FAEF56B3880BCA8"/>
of the <hi>Cold,</hi> the greater will be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence</hi> which the Lord Jesus Christ will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon you, at the <hi>Spring</hi> of Heavenly and Eternal Glory, The more that our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do cost us, the greater is the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>sweetness</hi> of them, even in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the greater the <hi>Reward</hi> that is to come, in the World to come. The <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that were <hi>Frozen to Death,</hi> went unto the pleasant Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Paradise. Even those <hi>Bodies,</hi> that have suffered the Hardships of <hi>Cold,</hi> in the Service of the Lord, shall one day be made <hi>Chariots of Fire,</hi> for the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Faithful. Syrs, I say unto you, 1 Cor.15.58. <hi>Your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider also, That there is a worse <hi>cold,</hi> than that of the <hi>Winter,</hi> against which we are to be fortified and cautioned. There is the <hi>Cold</hi> of our <hi>Formality,</hi> against which our wish must be, <hi>Oh! That I may be servant in Spirit, serving the Lord!</hi> And, there is the <hi>Cold</hi> of our <hi>Unregeneracy,</hi> against which, our wish must be, <hi>Oh! That this dark time of my Inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for serving the Lord, were over with me!</hi> But, Let us nextly, Beware of perverting and abusing the <hi>Dispensation</hi> which God gives us, because of the <hi>Cold.</hi> Because our Lord hath said, Mar.9.13. <hi>I will have mercy and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi> Let us not upon the Excuse of show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>mercy</hi> to our selves, defraud the Lord of that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which we may be able to bring

thereof, they have a particular <hi>Brightness,</hi> and Beauty upon them.</p>
               <p>When I see the <hi>Reflection</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> on the Objects about the <hi>Fire,</hi> methinks, I am furnished with <hi>Light</hi> enough, to make a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> of my own upon it. This <hi>Light</hi> leads me unto that <hi>Glory,</hi> that shall be Enjoy'd by the Saints in the Heavenly World; and unto the very <hi>Fountain</hi> of all their <hi>Glory.</hi> If unto the <hi>Fire,</hi> I should Resemble the Glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST, who shall one day appear in <hi>Flaming Fire,</hi> the Resemblance, might with many Good Thoughts be prosecuted. It is enough, that our Lord, the <hi>Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> is compared unto the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is an <hi>Ocean of Fire;</hi> and that Caelestial and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Fire ball,</hi> corresponding with the little Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes on my Hearth, in the property of <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nositie,</hi> the comparison that is now to be made, will be sufficiently vindicated. Nor will it be unserviceable unto this purpose, to remark, that in some Languages (particularly the <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi>) the same word that is used for <hi>Fire,</hi> is used also for <hi>Light.</hi> The Splendor of my <hi>Fire,</hi> tho' so sparkling and so dazzling, that the most lively Limner can't paint it out unto the Life, is but a <hi>black Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> which the Disciples in the <hi>Holy Mountain,</hi> saw resting on the Transfigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lord of Glory.</hi> One of them that saw it, has reported unto us. That it was a <hi>Majesty</hi>

attended with an <hi>Excellent Glory;</hi> Another of them has reported, That it was the <hi>Glory, as of the only Begotten of the Father.</hi> Now, that which I would assert is, That unto <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> and <hi>Irradiations,</hi> from the <hi>Glory</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, all the Saved shall be everlastingly beholden, for all the <hi>Glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,</hi> which they shall ever Enjoy in their <hi>Spirits,</hi> or in their <hi>Bodies.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is that <hi>Moon,</hi> that borrows all her <hi>Light</hi> from the <hi>Messiah.</hi> The Lord JESUS CHRIST, by <hi>Shining</hi> on the <hi>Children</hi> of God, and of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> conveys to them the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His promise, That they shall <hi>Shine as the Brightness of the Firmament,</hi> that is to say, <hi>as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> The <hi>Beams</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST shall fall upon His people Admitted unto the <hi>Sight</hi> of Him; and His <hi>Amiableness</hi> beheld by His people, will be both the <hi>Cause</hi> and the <hi>Copy</hi> of whatever <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable</hi> Thing shall ever be beheld in <hi>Them. The Glory of God in the Face of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.

               <p>GOing this Evening, to write a short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon my <hi>Fire,</hi> it was necessary my <hi>Candle</hi> should first be <hi>Lighted,</hi> and it being at the <hi>Fire</hi> it self that it was <hi>Lighted,</hi> this very circumstance affords me something to Reflect upon.</p>
               <p>If I compare <hi>Contention</hi> unto the <hi>Fire,</hi> I shall have Scripture and Reason enough, to justify the comparison. And now, though I hope, I shall not be a <hi>man of Contention</hi> my self, yet I would fain fetch <hi>Light</hi> from the <hi>Contention</hi> wherein I see other men engaged.

one another. Some <hi>Light</hi> in these <hi>Evil</hi> points may do me some <hi>Good.</hi> But then there are Numberless other points, wherein I may come to be <hi>Enlightned,</hi> from the <hi>Contentions</hi> that fall out, among the Writers of <hi>Controversies.</hi> 'Tis a very raging sort of a <hi>Fire</hi> that appears in the <hi>Controversal Writings</hi> that fill the World.

The Jewes called Good men, <hi>Green Wood,</hi> and Ill men, <hi>Dry Wood:</hi> [compare, Ezek. 20. 47.] By the same Token, they have an Old Adage among them, <hi>Two Dry Sticks will soon burn up one Green Stick:</hi> Meaning, That Good men which are few, will soon find many Ill men too hard for them.

A thing wholly <hi>Insensible,</hi> does in the <hi>Fire</hi> I see, put on a Semblance of mighty <hi>Sensibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is one without a principle of <hi>Life:</hi> He is one altogether destitute of that <hi>Life,</hi> wherein God is Known, and Serv'd, and Glorified. He has no <hi>Living Sense</hi> of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Eternal Objects. But when an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi> is cast into the <hi>Fire</hi> of some <hi>Affliction,</hi> he seems as if he had some <hi>Life</hi> in him: his <hi>Prayers,</hi> and his <hi>Vows,</hi> and his <hi>Devout Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and various <hi>Devotions,</hi> look very <hi>Sensibly,</hi> when some Grief or Fear is <hi>Afflicting</hi> of him.

on the <hi>Showes,</hi> that men make in their <hi>Affliction.</hi> I will mention but one Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to confirm it. I have often been concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Criminals under the Sentence of <hi>Death,</hi> having their Souls in a <hi>Fire</hi> of Agony. In this <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Fright,</hi> Oh, the sorrow for <hi>Sin,</hi> and hatred of it, Oh, the hope in Christ, and love to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions never to Sin on any Terms any more, which these Wretches have now <hi>Show'd</hi> unto me. I could scarce imagine it possible for any but Regenerate Souls to speak so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly well; many of these have been <hi>Repriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>Pardoned</hi> by the Government; but of them all I never knew two, but what proved afterwards meer <hi>Devils Incarnate.</hi> All I will add is This; If men be not Religious in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,</hi> as well as in <hi>Adversity,</hi> there is no true <hi>Life</hi> of Religion in them.

round about.</hi> Many Sticks and Logs of <hi>Wood,</hi> cast on an <hi>Hearth of Fire,</hi> seem to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Suppression and Extinction of the <hi>Fire.</hi> But the <hi>Fire</hi> is not so to be suppressed; no, the <hi>Wood</hi> it self shall be consumed; and let never so many parcels of it be brought one after another, they shall all be in like manner consumed.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of the Church, are cast by Satan, upon it, with an Intention to suppress it, cover it, bury it, and smother it for ever. But all the Enemies, whether <hi>Seducers,</hi> or <hi>Oppressors,</hi> that are by Satan cast upon it, shall be but like Sticks and Logs of <hi>Wood,</hi> thrown upon an <hi>Hearth of Fire;</hi> instead of putting out the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, they shall be destroy'd every one of them. The Experience of all Ages, has notably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, and Illustrated this Observation; That the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, has been like an <hi>Hearth of Fire,</hi> unto all its Adversaries; They that have Adversaried the Church, have but cast themselves like <hi>Wood upon an Hearth of Fire:</hi> At the long run, they have put out nothing; but been them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Devoured.</p>
               <p>If my Friends now <hi>Sitting by the Fire side,</hi> will pursue this observation, by falling into a Discourse upon the <hi>History,</hi> that will verify it, they will fall upon a Noble Subject, and Employ themselves a thousand times more

a <hi>Fiery Furnace,</hi> made seven times more <hi>Fiery</hi> than ordinary: But, behold! The astonished Emperour, observing the effect of his own cruel Edict, cried out, <hi>Lo, I see Four men loose, walking in the midst of the Fire, and they have no Hurt; and the Form of the Fourth, is like the Son of God.</hi> If any ask, where was <hi>Daniel</hi> himself at this time, that he should bear no part in the <hi>Miracle?</hi> I find this Question ask'd in the <hi>Jewish Talmuds,</hi> and one Answer there given, is, That he was then sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon a public Negotiation. But now, while I behold the Fierceness of the <hi>Fire</hi> on my <hi>Hearth,</hi> [or in the Stove] Heated beyond what is use to be, and how Unhabitable, and Intolerable a place, the midst of that <hi>Fire is,</hi> I will a little Divert my self with a <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> on the <hi>Miracle</hi> thus wrought in that <hi>Fiery Furnace,</hi> where the <hi>Three Martyrs,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks, Heb. 11. 34. <hi>Quenched the violence of Fire.</hi> And here in the first place, I cannot but Enquire, Whom did the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour understand by, <hi>The Son of God,</hi> when he so called the Illustrious person, that he saw in the midst of the <hi>Fire?</hi> Now, for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Enquiry, I am informed, That the Learned <hi>Gentiles</hi> of old, illuminated with such a Tradition from the <hi>Jews,</hi> had some Apprehensions, not only of <hi>One</hi> Supream <hi>Deity,</hi> but also of a <hi>Trinity</hi> in this <hi>Deity.</hi> The <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> particularly had some rude Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001067_0093_0FAEF59FCCF13F68"/>
of this Mystery, and their King was doubtless well versed in their Mysterious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that Lived among them, owns it: and the <hi>Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Chaldoeans,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> mentioned by <hi>Hierocles, Damasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Porphyrie,</hi> and other profess'd Pagans assert. That the World was made by <hi>Three,</hi> and that a <hi>Trinity,</hi> whose <hi>Head</hi> was an <hi>Unity Shines thro' all things.</hi> The Names by which they distinguished the <hi>Three,</hi> in this <hi>Trinity,</hi> were, <hi>Oromasdes,</hi> (whom they expresly call'd, <hi>The Father,</hi> which implies, <hi>A Son,</hi>) and <hi>Mithras,</hi> (which they sometimes called, <hi>Mether,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>) &amp; <hi>Arimanes,</hi> (which they also called <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anius,</hi>) on each of which they look'd, as on <hi>God Almighty,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Creator</hi> of the World. Antiquity assures us, That from the <hi>Mithras,</hi> (whom they styled, <hi>The Second Mind</hi>) the <hi>Persians</hi> did use to call any <hi>Mediator</hi> by that very Name. I will not recite here, what notable hints we find in <hi>Plutarch</hi> particularly, concerning these things. I hasten to add, They often understood the <hi>Sun</hi> by <hi>Mithras;</hi> but then they had yet an higher Notion of him, as, <hi>The Maker of all things,</hi> and therefore of the <hi>Sun</hi> it self. They distinguished between, <hi>The Intellectual Sun,</hi> and, <hi>The Visible Sun;</hi> as 'tis evident from the Orations of <hi>Julian,</hi> who calls the <hi>Second</hi> in their <hi>Trinity,</hi> by the Name of, <hi>The Sun.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Mal 4. 2.] They fancied the <hi>Sun</hi> to be the Representation of that <hi>Second,</hi> as the <hi>Fire</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:001067_0094_0FAEF5A09640E640"/>
to be the Representation of the <hi>Sun.</hi> 'Tis probable, That <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his Image did represent the <hi>Sun,</hi> the usual <hi>Idol</hi> of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> &amp; that the Representation might be the more compleat, the <hi>Fire</hi> of an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Furnace</hi> (devoted unto the Service of that <hi>Idol</hi>) was added hereunto. Those that would not worship the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Idolaters of those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, did use to cast into the <hi>Fire:</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> coming out of <hi>Ur,</hi> was his being delivered out of this <hi>Fiery Trial.</hi> Such a <hi>Fire</hi> was now near unto the <hi>Image</hi> Erected by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Idolaters, would have them to be worship'd <hi>Both together:</hi> for which cause the Three Confessors here answered, <hi>We will not Serve thy Gods,</hi> in the plural Number. Now <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> seeing in the <hi>Furnace,</hi> a Fourth, who was of a glorious Appearance, a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Majesty, a Countenance more than Humane, he might imagine, That this was most likely to be the <hi>Intellectual Sun,</hi> the <hi>Second Principle</hi> of their <hi>Trinity;</hi> whom his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> tells us, held for to be like <hi>Light</hi> without, &amp; like <hi>Truth</hi> within; and the <hi>Mediator</hi> between <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Matter.</hi> Hence, 'twas very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for him to cry out, <hi>The Form of the Fourth, is like the Son of God.</hi> But lest it be thought, that the glare of that <hi>Fire</hi> has <hi>daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled</hi> me, I will now pass on to observe, what
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001067_0095_0FAEF5A18D942688"/>
it is that preserves, and supports, and upholds the people of God, when they are cast into the most <hi>Heated Fire</hi> of <hi>Affliction:</hi> It is the <hi>Special Presence</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ, the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Spirit,</hi> wonderfully visits the Hearts of His Children, when they are in the <hi>Hottest Fire</hi> of <hi>Affliction,</hi> and especially when their <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is that of <hi>Persecution</hi> for their Fidelity to their Lord. It is one of His promises, Isai. 43. 2. <hi>I will be with thee; when thou walkest thro' the Fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the Flame kindle upon thee.</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ being thus <hi>present</hi> with His Faithful Ones, by His Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> applying His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to them, &amp; injecting of Divine Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into their minds, they don't feel the force of the <hi>Fire,</hi> they are as if nothing ail'd them, &amp; they Enjoy more of true <hi>Liberty,</hi> than if they were out of the Furnace. <hi>The Divine Consolations of the Martyrs,</hi> are the wonder and the proverb of Christianity: The <hi>Martyr Books</hi> are filled with amazing Instances. We find some of them, Triumphing in the midst of horrid <hi>Flames;</hi> and I have had the pleasure to be acquainted with a <hi>French Protestant,</hi> who from the midst of a thousand inexpressible miseries, at the bottom of a doleful and a dismal Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, in <hi>France,</hi> wrote this among very many charming passages to his Wife, then in this Countrey, <q>My Soul is swallowed up in a

               <head>On the Torment of the fire.</head>
               <p>I Do not Approach to the <hi>Fire,</hi> so near as to meddle with it, without being made sensible, That the <hi>Torment</hi> of being Burnt in the <hi>Fire,</hi> is very Terrible; perhaps no <hi>Torment</hi> so very Terrible! Being sensible hereof, I cannot but give Thanks to God, for preserving <hi>me</hi> and <hi>mine,</hi> from the painful Affliction of being scorch'd in the <hi>Fire;</hi> which is an Affliction, that from one Disaster or another, men do often fall into. But then, I do also with Astonishment call to mind, the Courage of those <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who have courageously and cheerfully undergone the Torment of <hi>Burning,</hi> for their Faithfulness to the Truths and Wayes of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was of old said, <hi>Isa. 24. 15. Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ye the Lord in the Fires, even the Name of the Lord God of Israel in the Isles of the Sea.</hi> Truly, in the <hi>British Isles of the Sea,</hi> more than on any part of the Earth beside, there have been called forth <hi>Martyrs,</hi> in the strictest sense, to <hi>Glorifie the Lord in the Fires.</hi> The popish and monstrous Figment of <hi>Transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> and the Abominable Doctrines depending on it, was formerly endeavoured there to be thrust down the Throats of Good men with <hi>Burning Five brands.</hi> That Sham

It was a wonderful Operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, on the minds of those brave Christians, That rather than they would pollute their Souls, by Denying the Evangelical <hi>Truths,</hi> wherewith Heaven had illuminated them, or by practising the Antichristian <hi>Wayes</hi> of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, they would Expose their <hi>Flesh</hi> to all the horrible Torment of <hi>Burning</hi> to Death. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, these <hi>Heroic</hi> Souls had a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Fear</hi> of the Divine Anger, to avoid which they were not <hi>Afraid</hi> of the cruel <hi>Flames;</hi> and certainly, they had a very powerful <hi>Faith</hi> of their own Resurrection from the <hi>Ashes,</hi> &amp; of a State of Heavenly <hi>Blessedness</hi> both before and after the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or they would not so cheerfully have gone to the <hi>Flames</hi> that made <hi>Ashes</hi> of them. The Martyr <hi>Bilney,</hi> the Night before his <hi>Burning,</hi> thrust his Finger into the <hi>Fire,</hi> to try whether it could be born or no. Now I am Sitting before my <hi>Fire,</hi> I am Trying, whether I should be able to bear <hi>Burning</hi> for the Cause of God. <hi>Lord, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I cannot! except thy Spirit strengthen me: But, O Omnipotent Spirit, thro' thee strengthening of me, I can do all Things,</hi> And I do also

think, 'Tis Better to <hi>Burn</hi> for the Sake of the Lord Jesus Christ, than to incur the Fate of that Apostate, who gave that as the Reason for his Apostasy, <hi>I cannot Burn, I cannot Burn!</hi> and behold he was quickly <hi>Burnt</hi> unto Death in his own House casually <hi>Fired</hi> over his Head. Nor may I forget the words of the Martyr <hi>Hooper</hi> the Night before be dyed: <hi>When I think of the Fire. I begin to be afraid, for I fear how the Fire will burn; but when I think of the Fire of Hell; the Fear of Eternal Fire, makes me willing to Endure a Temporary Fire!</hi> While I adore the Almighty <hi>Spirit,</hi> Which <hi>possessing</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> carried them forth unto this Elevated pitch of Christianity, I cannot but make some Reflection upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Wonder, which is also to be ascribed unto a <hi>Possession</hi> of the same <hi>Spirit of God, and of Glory</hi> When the Martyr <hi>Hawks</hi> gave to his Distressed Friends, a sign that he found the <hi>Flames</hi> to be Tolerable enough, it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn'd their Distress, into a Rapture of Admiration and Satisfaction.

               <p>WHile I Sit by a <hi>Fire,</hi> where I see one piece of <hi>Wood</hi> after another <hi>Consumed,</hi> I call to mind a memorable point of History, which the Renowned <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>First-born</hi> of all Historians, whom even the <hi>Pagan Writers</hi> of After-Ages, do celebrate for <hi>A man of a great Soul,</hi> has left upon Eternal Record; and whereof <hi>Moses</hi> was an <hi>Eye-witness,</hi> himself.

Our <hi>Moses</hi> was now on a Mountain, which had <hi>Bushes</hi> naturally growing on it; and one of those <hi>Bushes</hi> Exhibited unto him, in those amazing circumstances, did represent the State of the Church, which was then a <hi>Bush in the Fire</hi> of sore Distresses, but was to out live all the <hi>Flames</hi> of this Distressing <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the Ancients considered an Higher Mystery in this <hi>Burning Bush;</hi> They consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as a Figure of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> wherein the <hi>Bush</hi> of His Humanity, is possessed, and yet not consumed, by His <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is, <hi>A Consuming Fire.</hi> Thus <hi>'tis Gregories</hi> gloss up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Per Succensum Rubum ostensum est, quod ex illo populo exiret, qui Igne Deitatis carnis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroe Naturam, quasi Rubi Spinam, acciperet; et inconsumptam Humanitatis substantiam, in ip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>But we will at present, rather take this <hi>Burning Bush,</hi> to be the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and we will now say with <hi>Moses, I will now turn aside, and see this Great Sight.</hi> The Thing which is to be seen, is This; <hi>That although the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, be like a Bush all on Fire, yet this Glorious Bush will never be consumed, but be gloriously Preserved, Rescued, and Enlarged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is on a diverse account fitly compared unto a <hi>Bush.</hi> Particularly, There is much <hi>Lowness,</hi> much Meanness, much Contempt, Commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:001067_0104_0FAEF5A989263960"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord. It is called, <hi>A Low Tree.</hi> Tho' the <hi>Church</hi> have no less a Lustre than that of the <hi>Moon</hi> in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it; yet in outward Appearance, and in vulgar, Opinion, the <hi>Church</hi> is a poor <hi>Bush;</hi> yea, the All wise Dispensations of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, towards the Church on Earth, have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually been such, that there has been room for that Complaint, <hi>We are brought very Low.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is therefore in the Visions of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah styled, A Myrtle grove; a Myrtle</hi> is but a low and a mean sort of a <hi>Shrub.</hi> As the <hi>Church</hi> has but low and mean thoughts of it self, and the Members thereof do not aspire to be in Worldly Grandure, like the proud <hi>Oaks of Bashan,</hi> so Worldly people have but low and mean thoughts of the Church, and look upon it, like the proud King, upon, <hi>The Thistle in Lebanon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, 'Tis a <hi>Dangerous</hi> thing, for any to fall foul on the <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord. The <hi>Bush</hi> wherein there was given a picture of the <hi>Church,</hi> was one, as the Hebrew word intimates, that had <hi>prickles</hi> on it: And we are told by Travellers, the <hi>Bushes</hi> thereabouts, are so <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that if a <hi>Bird</hi> Light on one of them, he can hardly scape without a Deplumation. This we may be sure of; They that go to wrong the <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will find it a <hi>prickly,</hi> tearing and wounding thing. Indeed, it is not the Disposition of them
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001067_0105_0FAEF5AA51F74DE0"/>
that are the genuine Children of the Church, to do Hurt for Harm; and much less to be, <hi>as Thorns, which the man that shall touch, must be fenced with Iron, and the Staff of a Spear.</hi> But it is the happiness and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Church,</hi> that through the jealous Care of God concerning it, its Adversaries do not find it safe to meddle with it; its <hi>Motto</hi> is, <hi>Nemo me impune Lacessit.</hi> A certain little <hi>Benjamite,</hi> was once <hi>Ravening like a Wolf</hi> on the Church of our Lord; but he was told from Heaven, <hi>That he was kicking against the pricks.</hi> Many a man sets himself to molest the <hi>Church</hi> of God; he thinks, He'll <hi>handle them without Mittens!</hi> But those fool hardy creatures procure miserable Scratches to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by what they do. All that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto gone to damnify this <hi>Bush,</hi> tho' as big men, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or a <hi>Senacherib,</hi> the <hi>Bush</hi> hath scratch'd them to Death; yea, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God has taken this <hi>Bush</hi> and scourg'd its Adversaries to Death, with its <hi>Tribulations.</hi> Vain men! Lay Hands on this <hi>Bush,</hi> if you Dare: Consider what you do; 'Twill <hi>tear you to pieces,</hi> and there shall <hi>be none to deliver you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we past on to observe, That the <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is a <hi>Bush on Fire: Lord, preserve me from ever adding Oyl unto the Flame!</hi> For, first, there is the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Affliction,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord must Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter withal all <hi>Affliction</hi> is compared unto

                  <hi>Fire;</hi> but especially, an <hi>Affliction</hi> by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God rendred <hi>Epidemical: which sets people on Fire round about and burneth them:</hi> And most of all, <hi>Persecution;</hi> wherein men are <hi>Scorched,</hi> and <hi>Fall by Flame.</hi> Now, the Name of the <hi>Church</hi> all along hath been, <hi>O Thou Afflicted:</hi> And there never was a Time, wherein they that would <hi>Live Godlily,</hi> did not in some respect or other, <hi>Suffer</hi> P<hi>ersecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> must not, <hi>think strange of a Fiery Trial.</hi> If I am never so little a Twig of the <hi>Burning Bush,</hi> I must have the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fire of Affliction</hi> on my Enjoyments; I must at last Fly into Heaven out of such a <hi>Fire,</hi> if ever I would <hi>Enter into Life.</hi> There is also the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Contention,</hi> wherein the <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord is too often Embroiled. When a <hi>Strife</hi> arises any where, there is a <hi>Fire</hi> in that <hi>Strife.</hi> There is a certain <hi>Heat</hi> of Spirit, and an <hi>Heart-burn,</hi> enkindled among those that Quarrel with one another; and in their <hi>Lips, there is as Burning Fire.</hi> Alas, for the <hi>Flames,</hi> that have all along Raged in the <hi>Church</hi> of God! The scandalous <hi>Contention,</hi> that hath set the Church on <hi>Fire</hi> in every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod! We cannot all see with the same eyes; and God for Holy Ends, has left His people to buffet one another in the dark. I am sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to say it, but it is too notorious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, (and the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves have taken so much Notice of it, as to pretend, that this
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:001067_0107_0FAEF5AE15789500"/>
is one thing that prejudices them against Christianity) the <hi>Church</hi> has generally been under the Reproach of that wretchedness, <hi>Thro' the Wrath of the Lord of Hosts, the Land is darkened, and the people shall be as the Fuel of the Fire.</hi> Old <hi>Adams</hi> World must have <hi>Thorns</hi> in it: and that we may remember, we are not arrived unto the Second <hi>Adams</hi> World, the <hi>Church</hi> must have its <hi>Thorns,</hi> in the Treats, which we rashly give to one another. Yea, the <hi>Bush</hi> of the Lord has been, in its <hi>Dayes of Temptation,</hi> too like a <hi>Bramble bush,</hi> from whence a <hi>Fire has gone forth to devour the Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> In the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> of the New-Testament, how early did the Apostles complain, <hi>I hear there are Divisions among you!</hi> It was not long before they fell to <hi>Haeretica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>Excommunicating</hi> one another; and the <hi>Schisms</hi> arose, that Burn, like the unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable <hi>Fire of Hell,</hi> to this very day. Even in the <hi>Church</hi> of the Reformation, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Divisions</hi> have arisen, which have been managed with so much <hi>Fire,</hi> that as the Jesuite writes, concerning the Books of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> against the <hi>Calvinists, You would think you saw, not men, but so many Devils engaging one another!</hi> Lord, make me a man of a <hi>cool Spirit,</hi> and, <hi>Libera me ab implacabilibus Theologorum Odijs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, Let me <hi>behold</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <hi>Bush not consumed,</hi> but gloriously preserved in the midst of the <hi>Fire,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:001067_0108_0FAEF5AF18EF7BE0"/>
and give to the Churches Lord, the Glory of its preservation. It is <hi>de facto,</hi> sensible unto us, That our Lord has at this day a <hi>Church</hi> on Earth, yea, this <hi>Church</hi> has been in some degree always <hi>visible.</hi> I would, <hi>behold this great sight,</hi> with raptures and wonders, and thousands of Praises to that Lord, of whom <hi>having obtained Help the Church continues to this day.</hi> But why is not the <hi>Bush consumed?</hi> When the <hi>Bush</hi> was once all on a Light <hi>Fire,</hi> it gave this Account of it, <hi>It is of the Lords mercies, that we are not consumed.</hi> The <hi>presence</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, with His <hi>Church,</hi> is the <hi>Churches grand preservative.</hi> When the <hi>Burning Bush</hi> was <hi>not consumed,</hi> we read, there was, <hi>The Angel of the Lord,</hi> in that <hi>Flame of Fire.</hi> It seems to have been, that <hi>Angel,</hi> who is, <hi>The Lord;</hi> even our Lord <hi>Messiah</hi> Himself; an <hi>Angel,</hi> whose Name is, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> There is no Fear, the <hi>Church</hi> will be <hi>Consumed.</hi> so long as it has the <hi>presence</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the Safeguard of it. We read, of, <hi>The Good will of Him that dwelt in the Bush.</hi> I would sing of that <hi>Good Will,</hi> as the <hi>First Cause,</hi> why the <hi>Bush</hi> is <hi>not consumed.</hi> This <hi>Bush</hi> we have an order to Sing unto it, as unto that <hi>Vine, I the Lord keep it! I will keep it night and day.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is no other than that Number of men. Whom God the Father has given unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to be the Spectators, and Partakers of His <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:001067_0109_0FAEF5B058931788"/>
The Spirit of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is therefore, always at Work, to maintain this Church of His; and can it be lost? No; All the <hi>High Trees</hi> in the World, have been and shall be <hi>consumed,</hi> but,<hi>O Bush of the Lord, Thou shalt Endure, and thy years shall have no End.</hi> Why, Because thy Lord Himself <hi>Endures:</hi> The Name of the <hi>Bush is Jehovah Shammah.</hi> And, <hi>Si nos rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ruit et Christ us.</hi>

The <hi>Burning Bush</hi> is not <hi>consumed,</hi> because the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are a <hi>Wall of Fire</hi> about it: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> saw once, what one <hi>Angel</hi> was able to do: <hi>One Angel</hi> gave Daniel to see him do great Things for the Bush.

               <p>If Works of <hi>Necessity</hi> and of <hi>Compassion,</hi> may be done on the Sabbath, which is a Day set apart for the <hi>Services of Religion,</hi> and not allowing <hi>Servile Offices</hi> to be done upon it; the <hi>Kindling</hi> of my <hi>Fire</hi> this Day, which is our <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> altho' it were done for the Relict of my <hi>Flesh,</hi> is not to be Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001067_0111_0FAEF5B111BF7118"/>
among the <hi>Works of the</hi> F<hi>lesh:</hi> If there were a <hi>Necessity</hi> of my Attending the <hi>Services of Religion</hi> this Day, there was a <hi>Necessity</hi> of my defending my self by a <hi>Fire</hi> against the <hi>Cold,</hi> that would else have crampt those Holy <hi>Services:</hi> And while I am En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged herein, such is the <hi>Compassion</hi> of the Lord, who will have <hi>Mercy rather than Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> that He permits my Interior to treat my Exterior, with the <hi>Compassion</hi> of a <hi>Fire</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, without which my <hi>Sacrifice</hi> had been that of a F<hi>ool.</hi> But if it were proper to <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> a F<hi>ire,</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> I am sure, it will not be less proper to Employ and Apply my F<hi>ire</hi> unto the Sacred purposes, which are most of all proper to the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and let the F<hi>ire kindle</hi> in my Soul, those <hi>Thoughts,</hi> by which the <hi>Sabbath</hi> will be Sanctifyed.</p>
               <p>Now the first Entertainment, offered unto my Thoughts on this occasion, is, that prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which the Lord gave, in Exod. 35. 3. <hi>ye shall kindle no</hi> F<hi>ire, throughout your Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Sabbath Day.</hi> I might have known, tho' <hi>Munster</hi> had not informed me, that the <hi>Jews</hi> take this precept in the Letter, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hire <hi>Christians</hi> to kindle their F<hi>ire</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> But I remember, That the <hi>Priests</hi> were to Burn the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which could not be done without the kindling of a F<hi>ire;</hi> for tho' the F<hi>ire</hi> which came down from Heaven was constantly upon the <hi>Altar,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:001067_0112_0FAEF5B1CBACA5C0"/>
where it continued until it was Renewed in the <hi>Temple,</hi> which they call'd, <hi>The House of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;</hi> yet by a daily supply of <hi>New</hi>F<hi>uel,</hi> was that F<hi>ire</hi> maintained. The <hi>Priests</hi> were to <hi>Lay Wood every morning</hi> on it, and so soon as the <hi>Old</hi> F<hi>ire</hi> had scattered the particles which it prey'd upon, a <hi>New</hi> F<hi>ire</hi> must needs be kindled. The Remembrance hereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me to the Judgment of some Learned men; <q>That the Text under consideration must not be taken in that Latitude, which at the first view it seems to have. And if it must have some limitation, it cannot better be Restrained than to what is Expressed in the Context. The Thing treated of, is, <hi>The Work of the Tabernacle.</hi> Though many Cautions had been given, concerning the Forbearance of <hi>Servile Work</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon any private Account, yet some would be ready to think, that work tending to the preparing of Materials for the composing of that Sacred Thing, the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> might be lawful. For the prevention of such Thoughts, before the Description of what was Requisite, in Entred upon, this precept is laid down, That in order to any such Work, whether the melting of Silver, Gold, or any other Metal, which might be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary about the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> not to much as a F<hi>ire</hi> should be kindled.</q>

way or t'other, as the different Inclination of mens <hi>Understanding</hi> may carry them; 'Tis evident from it, That a <hi>Sabbath</hi> is to be <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> We are assured, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 3. That from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, God <hi>Sanctified the Seventh Day,</hi> or commanded that it should be Separated, and Dedicated, unto Sacred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, How?

               <p>Well then; If it were <hi>no Fault</hi> in me, to kindle my <hi>Fire</hi> on the <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> certainly 'twill be <hi>no Fault</hi> in me, if my zeal to keep the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> be now enkindled into a <hi>vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Flame.</hi> If the Question were put unto a Christian in the Primitive Times, <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum Servasts?</hi> Do you keep the <hi>Lords Day?</hi> His Answer would be, <hi>Christianus sum, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere non possum,</hi> I am a <hi>Christian,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dare do no other.

While I have my <hi>Fire</hi> now before me, to preserve me from chilling in the Devotions of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> I will venture to say, The <hi>Lords Day,</hi> is as a <hi>Fire</hi> unto all our other Devotions. It is a sad Remark, to be made upon too many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which in this point want
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001067_0117_0FAEF5B807EBC948"/>
still very much to be <hi>Reformed.</hi> They indulge themselves in loose <hi>Principles,</hi> and in loose <hi>Practices,</hi> about the <hi>Lords Day;</hi> and it is to be observed, That the Holy <hi>Religion</hi> of our Lord, which is this Day, most of all to be <hi>Inculcated</hi> as well as <hi>Exemplified,</hi> has by this <hi>loosness</hi> of theirs been exceedingly damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; There is too little of the <hi>Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> to be seen in those Churches, tho' the <hi>Doctrine of Godliness</hi> be still held and preach'd among them. They have called, The strict Celebration of the <hi>Lords; Day, Figmentum Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum,</hi> an <hi>English Fiction.</hi> But it is no <hi>Fiction,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> where the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is kept better than in the other Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> have had more of the <hi>Power of Godliness,</hi> than all the other Nations. And those other Nations, as they have broken <hi>Gods Rest,</hi> so God has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Theirs;</hi> astonishing plagues have been <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resting,</hi> and <hi>distressing</hi> of them. A Worthy Divine, as many years ago as the Dayes of my Grandfather, seeing in Print, an humble Confession of the Sins, that had brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Germany</hi> the Troubles then harassing of it, said, <hi>I see the Troubles of</hi> Germany <hi>are not over yet, I see no Confession of their Sabbath breaking!</hi> And the Event has confirmed it. If we would Thrive on <hi>Temporal</hi> Accounts, we shall find the due Celebration of the <hi>Lords Day</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much contribute unto it. It is said, <hi>If thou call the Sabbath a Delight, and the Holy of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001067_0118_0FAEF5B8F7967418"/>
the Lord, I will cause thee to Ride upon the Migh places of the Earth.</hi> It has been the Remark of some Judicious Observers, That their <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> usually is as their <hi>Sabbath</hi> is, and from their keeping of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> they can form a probable conjecture, how it will fare with them all the Ensuing <hi>Week.</hi> But much more, if we would Thrive on <hi>Spiritual</hi> Accounts, Let us be <hi>in the Spirit on the Lords Day,</hi> and our <hi>Spirits</hi> will reap an incredible advantage from it. We shall be <hi>made Joyful in the House of Prayer,</hi> by vast accessions of Light, and Life, and Joy, unto our Souls, if we duely improve the <hi>Market</hi> for such Good Things, which is on the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> held among us. What shall I say more? May I believe that word of God, Isa.56. 2. <hi>Blessed is the man who keeps my Sabbath, from polluting of it.</hi> The Sin of <hi>Sabbath breaking</hi> should be terrible to me, since I hear that Thunder once utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven, by the God of Heaven, <hi>Ye bring fierce wrath, by profaning the Sabbath.</hi> I am now sitting by the <hi>Fire</hi> kindled on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but I am led now to think on a <hi>Fire</hi> to be kindled against them, who break the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> I find it threatned, Jer. 17. 22. <hi>If you will not hearken unto me, to Sanctifie the Sabbath day, Then will I kindle a Fire, and it shall devour, and it shall not be quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May I then have my Heart <hi>Inflamed</hi> with an <hi>Holy Zeal,</hi> to keep the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> with an
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001067_0119_0FAEF5BA07047A70"/>
Exemplary <hi>Holiness.</hi> Let me on this <hi>High Day</hi> not allow my self in <hi>Low</hi> Employments; but let me Employ my self in <hi>Heavenly</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises and <hi>Meditations;</hi> and as far as I can, let me be <hi>in the Spirit on the Lords-Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But one of the <hi>Meditations</hi> wherewith es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially I would Entertain my self on, <hi>The Lords Day,</hi> shall be, <hi>That Sabbatism,</hi> whereof our <hi>Weekly Sabbath</hi> is a Figure, and a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol: Even that <hi>Sabbatism,</hi> whereof one of the glorious Characters will be, <hi>That no Fire shall be kindled on it:</hi> all <hi>War</hi> shall then cease; and there will be an uninterrupted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable <hi>peace,</hi> among the people of God. Until the arrival of that Blessed <hi>Sabbatism,</hi> there will always be much <hi>Fire</hi> in the world; yea, and in the <hi>Church;</hi> Even that worst <hi>Fire</hi> of Contention. But in that <hi>Sabbatism,</hi> they <hi>Learn War no more;</hi> The Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> will then marvellously possess, and instruct, and unite, His people: Yea, the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> Himself, will visibly appear, at the Beginning of that <hi>Sabbatism,</hi> and the <hi>Sign of the Son of Man appearing,</hi> all Nations will <hi>with one accord,</hi> yield Subjection to the <hi>Father</hi> of that <hi>World to come.</hi> It is an Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a most agreeable <hi>Sabbath Work,</hi> to be swallow'd up with Contemplations of that great <hi>Sabbatism:</hi> the Approach of it, the Nature of it. And inasmuch as it seems to Commence at the Ruine of, <hi>The Antichrist,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:001067_0120_0FAEF5BAE07AC608"/>
whose period of <hi>Twelve Hundred and sixty years,</hi> is doubtless very near Expired, Behold, how much <hi>Fire</hi> may this Thought add, not only unto my <hi>Contemplations,</hi> but also unto my <hi>Expectations</hi> of it?</p>

                  <hi>Sin,</hi> and all the <hi>Works of the Flesh,</hi> as of a <hi>Coal</hi> to be clapt upon my <hi>Flesh.</hi> The Purest Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites, once contaminated with <hi>Sins</hi> against the Holy Laws of God, may have that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> made upon them, Lam. 4 8. <hi>Their Visage is now blacker than a Coal.</hi> Wherefore, Let me take heed, lest I Blacken my self by the <hi>Coals,</hi> and not <hi>Abhorring that which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> It is the Wise mans Disswasive, relating to the particular Sins of <hi>Unchastity,</hi> Prov. 6. 27, 28. <hi>Can a man take Fire in his Bosom, and his Cloaths not be burnt? Can one go upon hot Coals, and his Feet not be burnt? So,</hi>—Now let me by this Consideration, be Disswaded and Affrighted from all other <hi>Sins. They are so many Coals; why should I meddle with them!</hi> I remember Old <hi>Mela,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Situ Orbis,</hi> tells of a silly people, who had not known <hi>Fire,</hi> and when they first saw it, they were so taken with it, as to <hi>Embrace</hi> it, until it horribly burnt 'em. O my Soul, Thou knowest, that <hi>Sin</hi> is a <hi>Coal;</hi> it will infalliby do thee a <hi>Damage;</hi> be not then like that sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people; keep at a due distance from such a Dangerous Evil. What a Frozen Creature am I? A principle, as cold, as the Venemous Juice, with which the <hi>Salamander</hi> does Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the ardent <hi>Coals</hi> on which it is cast, [whence the <hi>Vulgar Error,</hi> of its Living in the <hi>Fire]</hi> surely hath possession of me, or else I should esteem every Sin, too dangerous a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001067_0122_0FAEF5BC535DAFF8"/>
Thing for me to be free withal. It surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Spectators, to see Jugglers, put ardent <hi>Coals</hi> into their <hi>Mouths:</hi> But is it not more surprizing, that mens <hi>mouths</hi> are filled with Offences against the Holy God! There are Contrivances, which the Writers of such Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosies do suggest; How men may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Harm take up ardent <hi>Coals</hi> into their <hi>Hands:</hi> But I never could see it contrived, how men may <hi>Work Wickedness</hi> with their <hi>Hands</hi> &amp; not bring upon themselves a mischief,</p>
               <p>While I am in this Meditation, I call to mind, the parable, by which the Sins of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonesty,</hi> have been sometimes painted out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. To carry <hi>Burning Coals into his Nest,</hi> was in the issue, no Advantage to the <hi>Thievish Bird of Prey.</hi> Should I convey an Handful of these <hi>Burning Coals,</hi> into the Boxes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Papers, and the best of my other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, what mad work should I make! Truly, those men, that add unto their Estates, by Fraudulence, by Oppression, by any <hi>Dishone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi> do but convey <hi>Burning Coals</hi> among all their Treasures; and what, may we foresee, will be the Issue? <hi>He gets Riches, and not by Right, He shall leave them in the midst of his Days, and at his End shall be a Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, there is a sort of <hi>Coals,</hi> that we may become free withal. 'Tis required, Prov. 25. 21, 22, [And repeated, Rom. 12. 20.] <hi>If thine Enemy be Hungry, give him Bread
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001067_0123_0FAEF5BD37A32230"/>
to eat; and if he be Thirsty, give him Water to Drink; for thou shalt heap Coals of Fire on his Head, and the Lord shall Reward thee.</hi> The Lord help his poor Servant, ever to avoid all <hi>Revenge</hi> upon <hi>Personal Enemies;</hi> but rather to Wish them, and Do them, all the <hi>Good</hi> that is possible for their <hi>Evil</hi> It were a very lamentable Thing, for a Christian who hath suffered any <hi>Injuries,</hi> and <hi>Reproaches,</hi> to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his Forgiving of his <hi>Personal Enemies,</hi> by making those very <hi>Injuries,</hi> to be the occasions of his <hi>Praying</hi> by Name for <hi>them,</hi> for whom it may be, he never so pray'd before. And Christianity will be further Exemplified, if we don't <hi>Shun,</hi> but rather <hi>Watch,</hi> all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to show <hi>Kindnesses</hi> unto them, that have been most <hi>Unkind</hi> unto us. But how will this, <hi>Heap Coals of Fire on the Heads of</hi> of my Adversaries? If I should Answer, That then the <hi>Righteous God,</hi> will take my Adversaries into His Hand, and <hi>Revenge</hi> the wrongs done to me, with Judgments that shall fall as <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals</hi> upon them that have wronged me, the Answer would be true; but I must have a care of having this Intention, in my silence, my patience, my forbearing to <hi>Retaliate.</hi> Wherefore, I will rather put a sweeter sense upon it. My <hi>Gentleness</hi> towards my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, will perhaps <hi>melt</hi> their <hi>Hearts,</hi> as much as if <hi>Coals of Fire</hi> were thrown upon them; and the <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Maliee,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Dead Coal,</hi> would first most naturally put one in mind, of a <hi>Dead man.</hi> The <hi>Extinction</hi> of a <hi>Coal,</hi> does (at least as with a Coal) draw a Picture of <hi>Mortality.</hi> And she that had but one Son, being afraid of his <hi>Death,</hi> Expressed her Fear, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 7. of <hi>Quenching the Coal that was left.</hi> Now, when I see how much longer some <hi>Coals</hi> do last, than others, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites me to think, how <hi>Long Lived</hi> some, in

comparison of others, are. Since the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable <hi>Abbreviation</hi> of Humane Life, unto the Term, at which it hath stood for near Four Thousand years, we see, That while some <hi>Coals</hi> are put out by thousands of Accidents, <hi>before their Time,</hi> there are men who not only Live to the Term of <hi>Threescore years and Ten,</hi> but also keep some Light and Heat, unto a much Greater Age; yea, and this although they never took such a <hi>Temperate &amp; Accurate</hi> way of Living, as did the famous <hi>Cornaro,</hi> to <hi>prolong their Lives.</hi> Though the Countreyes where they Live most meanly and hardly, are the Countreys where they generally live the longest; and hence the Gentleman, who this present year [1700.] Published, An Account of the Islands of <hi>Orkney,</hi> mentions it as no rare thing for People <hi>there</hi> to live unto a very great Age; and that among other Instances which are no Rarities, a Gentleman is yet living at <hi>Strousa</hi> there, whose Father begat him, when he was One hundred years old, and lived until he saw this mans Children: Yet all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys have afforded some Exemples of <hi>Long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:001067_0126_0FAEF5C2E6CAAA00"/>
Author and Giver of my <hi>Life.</hi> So far as the <hi>Fear of God</hi> will <hi>prolong my Life,</hi> and so far as <hi>Abstinence,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> will (as beyond all <hi>Elixirs</hi> they will!) contribute unto it, I am desirous to make use thereof. But, I am far from Desirous, to be so long from the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>(where to be is by far the best of all, 7128)</hi> as I see some of my pious Neighbours are; And I am very Desirous that my <hi>Life</hi> may not last any longer than my <hi>Work.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as also my <hi>Broken Health</hi> Exceedingly forbids me the least Expectation of being a <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and, <hi>Non Annis sed Factis vivunt mortales, tis my</hi> earnest Prayer, <hi>Lord, let me live long in a little Time!</hi> and if I am to Dy quickly, I wish I may be worthy of that Epitaph, <hi>Diu vixit, licet non diu fuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But seeing a <hi>Dead Coal,</hi> I enquire, what made it so? And this <hi>Enkindles</hi> another Thought. If the <hi>Dead Coal</hi> were lying among the <hi>Living</hi> ones, it would be no longer so <hi>Dead. Lively Christians</hi> in like manner (say I) keep one another <hi>Alive,</hi> by being <hi>Together.</hi> The <hi>Company</hi> and the <hi>Conference</hi> of <hi>Lively Christians,</hi> has a mighty Tendency to keep Christianity <hi>Alive</hi> among them. A <hi>Dead,</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, Formal Frame of Spirit, is the usual Effect of keeping at a Distance from the Society of <hi>Lively Christians.</hi> It has been particularly found, that <hi>Religious Meetings</hi> wisely managed, have had a more than ordinary tendency to
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:001067_0127_0FAEF5C30B9F4010"/>
preserve the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> among a People.

And let them very peculiarly direct and Excite their <hi>Young People,</hi> to the maintaining of such <hi>Meetings.</hi> It will be found that the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness</hi> will be marvellously maintained by such Things, And it will be found, That where persons withdraw from the Fellowship of <hi>Lively Christians,</hi> and <hi>Forsake the Assembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together,</hi> it won't be long before the <hi>Coals goe out.</hi> May I value and enjoy the <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship</hi> of <hi>Lively Christians;</hi> and may I, by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Modest, and Fruitful <hi>Speeches</hi> in their Fellowship, both have and give those things, upon which it shall be said, <hi>While we spoke, did not our Hearts burn within us!</hi>

peculiar Instructions unto us. And there are especially two Things wherein I am here instructed. First, I am to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, That the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, penetrate into the most secret Recesses ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. The <hi>Eyes</hi> of that <hi>Omniscient Lord,</hi> penetrate like <hi>Lightning,</hi> which is a <hi>Flame of Fire,</hi> into the most Remote and Hidden Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the World. He needs no other <hi>Light,</hi> but that of His own <hi>Eyes</hi> which are a <hi>Flame of Fire,</hi> to discover the darkest matters. Oh, let me Study to Approve my Heart, with all Sincerity, unto that Lord, who because <hi>He hath Eyes like a Flame of Fire,</hi> will <hi>make all the Churches to know, that He Searches the Reins and the Hearts of the</hi> Children of men. I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to Remember, That there will be no Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Wicked men or Things, before the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ. The <hi>Eyes</hi> of that <hi>Omnipotent Lord,</hi> will dart forth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, like a <hi>Flame of</hi> F<hi>ire,</hi> upon those that shall oppose His Interests. Great Wrath will, as both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> take notice of it, produce a F<hi>lame of Fire</hi> in the <hi>Eyes.</hi> Let me take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Teach me,</hi> O L<hi>ord, always to behave my self as before the Eyes of a Lord, that hath Eyes like a Flame of Fire</hi>

But I may, without any Difficulty in the <hi>Transition,</hi> pass over from hence to a Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of those Blessed Spirits, the ANGELS, of whom it is said, Heb. 17. <hi>They are a</hi> F<hi>lame of Fire:</hi> And this the rather, because it is also said, of <hi>Them,</hi> Zech. 4. 10. <hi>They are the Eyes of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> of God, even those Wonderful and Excellent Spirits, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>Heavenly Host,</hi> are very fitly called, <hi>Seraphim,</hi> or, Burners, for their F<hi>laming Zeal,</hi> as well as upon other accounts. And he that would approve himself an <hi>Angelical</hi> man, (which the <hi>Pastors</hi> of Churches, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Angels,</hi> are concerned above others to do) must be a man of a F<hi>laming Zeal</hi> for God, and for His Truths, and for His Wayes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sin that is Offensive to Him. 'Tis very certain, That there are <hi>Good Angels,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Rational Substances, which are Spirits, that were made by God, in the Beginning of Time, for His own more special Service and Honour. This is doubted by none, but men under an horrible possession of the <hi>Evil</hi> Ones. That there are <hi>Evil Angels,</hi> we have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selves more than Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; and this is an Irrefragable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, That there are <hi>Good</hi> Ones too. Tho' <hi>Moses</hi> do not expresly mention the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> in his History of the Creation. yet the Repetition of that History in the Hundred and Fourth Psalm seems to make an Express
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:001067_0134_0FAEF49D05E24960"/>
mention of them. Indeed, the Nature, the Office, the Degrees of <hi>Angels,</hi> do come on to our observation, by slow Degrees in the Book of God. The Story of the Bible is carried on Two Thousand years, even as far down as the Dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> e're we find any <hi>Angels</hi> visibly Exhibiting themselves unto the World. The Coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Angels,</hi> is in the Sacred Story, made somewhat plain, before the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves are much Exhibited in these Oracles. And possibly, towards the End of the World, the Truths concerning <hi>Angels,</hi> will be marvellously recovered, out of the <hi>Darkness</hi> as yet upon them, and more Discovered unto the People of God, than ever since the World began. However the <hi>Angels</hi> are now mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two Hundred and sixty times in the <hi>Bible</hi> of God; and it becomes all that Enjoy the <hi>Bible,</hi> not only to Believe, but also to Study, with a due Modesty, the Ministry of <hi>Angels</hi> for the Chosen of God, under the Conduct of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth,</hi> 'tis abundantly intimated, That the <hi>Good Angels</hi> do compose an <hi>Heavenly Army,</hi> and there is a most <hi>Heavenly Order</hi> in that <hi>Army.</hi> Possibly the <hi>Order</hi> wherein the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, was disposed, might be a little imitation of it; and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God might be called, <hi>The Lord of Hosts,</hi> with relation unto both.

The Scripture is plain, for their having <hi>Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi> and the Church of God in the First Ages, were fully of this Opinion.

Its Purity,</hi> which admits nothing Heterogeneous, to lodge in it, would <hi>Stir up a pure mind,</hi> unto the <hi>Remembrance,</hi> of something that is much to be Desired. So <hi>Pure</hi> indeed is the <hi>Flame,</hi> that our English word <hi>Pure,</hi> seems derived from the Greek word of the same sound, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Pure Heart,</hi> like a <hi>Pure Flame,</hi> will admit nothing to be lodged in it, but what shall be of an Heavenly Tendency, and pleasing to the God of Heaven. And when I Learn from the Oracles of God, of what consequence it is to have, <hi>A pure Heart;</hi> particularly, <hi>That it shall be Blessed with the Sight of God;</hi> I will no

               </p>
               <p>I have within me a <hi>Conscience,</hi> whereof, if I make, the <hi>Flame</hi> to be a Picture, I draw it by the <hi>Light</hi> of a Proverb, that fell from the Pen of <hi>Solomon, The Spirit of a man is the Candle of the Lord.</hi> But then I read of some, <hi>Whose Conscience is Defiled.</hi> Every <hi>Sin</hi> is a discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of that <hi>Flame,</hi> with some Vile Pollution cast into it: And if <hi>Sin</hi> be not pardoned, and Removed, with the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ cast into the <hi>Flame,</hi> the <hi>Polluted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> will but Burn the more fiercely for it, throughout Eternal Ages. Oh, That I might preserve all <hi>Purity</hi> of Soul; and <hi>Cleansing my self from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit,</hi> O let me keep alive a <hi>Pure Flame of Love</hi> to God, in my Heart, <hi>Purified by</hi> F<hi>aith,</hi> continually. There is a promise, which I am to plead with God, that I may obtain this Favour from Him, <hi>I will Purify the Sons of Levi.</hi>

               <p>ONe of the most visible Things about the F<hi>ire,</hi> is the F<hi>lame;</hi> and one of the most sensible Things about the F<hi>lame,</hi> is the <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Ascent</hi> of it. But our Hissing F<hi>lame,</hi> does not <hi>move upward,</hi> without calling upon us, as the Primitive Christians, when they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:001067_0144_0FAEF4A8ECB5E858"/>
their Acts of publick Worship, did use to be called upon, <hi>Sursum Corda!</hi> or, Let your <hi>Hearts move upward!</hi> If naturally the F<hi>lat side</hi> of my <hi>Heart</hi> Ly towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Sharp side</hi> of it Ly towards <hi>Earth,</hi> I wish my <hi>Heart</hi> may be <hi>turned,</hi> even turned into the contrary posture of the F<hi>lame,</hi> which I am now thinking on. An <hi>Heavenly Tendency</hi> is the property of every Godly man; <hi>His Conversation is in Heaven</hi> May I now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, in my own Desire and purpose to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after that property.</p>
               <p>The <hi>motion</hi> of the Heart, is in its <hi>Thoughts,</hi> its Loves, its <hi>Hopes</hi> an its <hi>Joyes.</hi> May mine always be <hi>upward,</hi> and <hi>Heavenward Lord; Enflame this miserable Heart of mine, with thy Love, and it will be so!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a Christian that would keep a constant F<hi>lame</hi> of Devotion in his Heart, always <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending</hi> towards God and Christ and Heaven, cannot more effectually do so, than by filling every day of his Life, with that sort of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which we call Ejacul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. By the Daily and Hourly Use of <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers,</hi> a Christian may have his Heart, like a F<hi>lame,</hi> continually mounting <hi>upward,</hi> unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and <hi>Our Father which is in the Heavens.</hi>

               <p>Now, It is impossible for me to mention all the Numerous, and indeed Numberless, <hi>Occasions,</hi> for <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers;</hi> but if a Christian will <hi>Watchfully</hi> improve such <hi>Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Favours</hi> of God, for our <hi>Inward man,</hi> may on many <hi>Occasions</hi> be supplicated with our Ejaculations. As now; we may take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions for such Ejaculations and <hi>Supplications,</hi> from the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God. Before we set upon any signal <hi>Exercise</hi> of Religion, there is <hi>Occasion</hi> for some such <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> as That; O <hi>Lord, Assist me to draw water out of this Well of Salvation; or, Let the words of my mouth. and the thoughts of heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord.</hi> And all the while, we are in the <hi>Exercise,</hi> there is <hi>Occasion</hi> for multiplied <hi>Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> While we are joining with another in <hi>Social Praying,</hi> we may fix our wandring hearts, by annexing such a pertinent <hi>Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto all that he utters, as, <hi>Lord, I own it!</hi> or, <hi>Lord, I ask it!</hi> When the Congregation that sat under our Lords Ministry, heard <hi>Him,</hi> (who was <hi>It</hi>) speaking about the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> they presently made an <hi>Ejaculation</hi> upon it; <hi>Lord, give us this Bread for ever.</hi> Thus in the Hearing of a Good <hi>Sermon,</hi> a Studious <hi>Head,</hi> and a Gracious <hi>Heart,</hi> may tack a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Ejaculation</hi> upon every thing that shall be offered.

               <head>On Passing through the Fire.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SItting by the Fire,</hi> I call to mind frequent passages in the Divine Oracles about, <hi>Passing through the Fire:</hi> and I call to mind especially that prohibition, Lev. 18. 21. <hi>Thou shalt not let any of thy Seed pass thro' the Fire, to</hi> Moloch. It would now by the <hi>Fire side,</hi> be Edifying and Entertaining, to Enquire after the meaning of this matter.</p>
               <p>And in the first place, we may Enquire, <hi>Who was Moloch?</hi> Now, I will not with <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and <hi>Grot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="unknown:001067_0153_0FAEF4B2E4722F58"/>
                  <hi>Moloch.</hi> I will not say with <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> That <hi>Moloch</hi> was the same with <hi>Mercury;</hi> though <hi>Malach</hi> do signify, what they made <hi>Mercury,</hi> a <hi>Messenger.</hi> Nor will I say with <hi>Cyril,</hi> that <hi>Venus</hi> was by the Ancients worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped under the Name of <hi>Moloch;</hi> nor with <hi>Sanctius,</hi> that <hi>Moloch</hi> was an Idol peculiar to the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> nor with some others, That some certain <hi>King,</hi> by way of Eminency cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so, (which <hi>Moloch</hi> signifies) tho' the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Name of the Gentleman be now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, were intended. I will rather <hi>concur</hi> with the Learned <hi>Spencer</hi> (however in the main Design for which he has Employ'd his Learning, I <hi>differ</hi> from him;) That <hi>Moloch</hi> was a Name common to all the Gods, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>The</hi> Sun) worshipped in the Images of the ancient Pagans. And therefore <hi>Baal,</hi> which was also a Name common for all False Gods, is promiscuously used for <hi>Moloch.</hi> [Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, Jer. 19. 5. with Jer. 32 35.] Indeed, there is extant at this day, an ancient Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, brings both Names into <hi>One. Moloch</hi> signifies a <hi>King,</hi> and it imports <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty:</hi> whereof, 'tis no wonder, if the <hi>Devil</hi> is ambitious. But it is also likely, that <hi>Malach,</hi> the root of his Name, signifies, to <hi>Worship,</hi> to <hi>Adore,</hi> to reckon as a <hi>God;</hi> for tho' the <hi>Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> take no notice of such a sense, yet the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopic Language countenances it. Thus the

               </p>
               <p>But we will in the next place, Enquire, What was <hi>passing thro' the Fire to this Molech?</hi> Now, 'tis very certain, That some of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, especially when certain Distresses were upon them, did use an <hi>Immolation</hi> of their Children unto <hi>Moloch.</hi> [Ponder, Ezek. 16 20, 21. with Jer. 7 31. and Jer. 32. 35. There I shall see the signification of <hi>Passing thro' the Fire.</hi>] As we read of the <hi>Sepharvites,</hi> [2 King. 17. 31.] That they <hi>Burnt their Children</hi> unto <hi>Adramelech,</hi> [or, <hi>Deus potens:</hi>] and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> [or <hi>Deus respondens.</hi>] Thus, other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, and particularly <hi>Josephus,</hi> relate such horrid practices to have been usual among the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> whom therefore the <hi>Book of Wisdom,</hi> calls, <hi>Unmerciful Murderers of their Children.</hi> The <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of the Diabolical Oracle requiring this Rite, may have been one thing that betray'd the woful people into it. As when <hi>Apollo</hi> demanded of the <hi>Pelasgians, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which might signify, either, <hi>A man,</hi> or, <hi>A Torch:</hi> So very ambiguous was the phrase of, <hi>passing thro' the Fire.</hi> And therefore, the <hi>Hard Word,</hi> which the Elder Ages had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the <hi>Harder Sense</hi> of <hi>Combustion,</hi> the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:001067_0155_0FAEF4B446E3BF88"/>
Later Ages, found out a <hi>Softer Sense</hi> of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for it; and they began to think, that <hi>Moloch</hi> would be content, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks, <hi>Traducto Corpore</hi> F<hi>lamma.</hi> For this <hi>Februation</hi> of the Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> two pyles were kindled, and persons were carried thro' them, in token of their consecration to <hi>Moloch.</hi> And thus tho' tis said of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 King. 16. 3. <hi>He caused his Son to pass thro' the Fire;</hi> yet it seems, we find the Son surviving this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction;</hi> it being that very <hi>

               <p>BEholding the <hi>Sparks</hi> to ascend in such Number, and with such Briskness, from the <hi>Fire,</hi> what can I so readily think upon, as those words of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> Job 5. 7. <hi>Man is born unto Trouble, as the Sparks fly upward!</hi> The first Thought, which at the first View, now natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rises like a <hi>Spark</hi> from the <hi>Fire,</hi> in the mind of a Devout Reader, would be This; That it is not more Natural for the <hi>Sons of the Burning Coal</hi> (as the <hi>Sparks</hi> are called here) to <hi>fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:001067_0157_0FAEF4B5D0331458"/>
than it is for the <hi>Sons of Sinful man</hi> to run into <hi>Trouble.</hi> It becomes me therefore to live to the continual Expectation of <hi>Troubles;</hi> yea, as many <hi>Sparks</hi> do arise together from the <hi>Fire,</hi> and these do no sooner disappear, but as many more <hi>Sparks</hi> do succeed, so I must Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Succession of <hi>Troubles:</hi> And it will not be unprofitable for me, to consider <hi>Sin,</hi> as the <hi>Fire</hi> at the Bottom, from which all these <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> are produced. We need not quote any Pagan <hi>Authority</hi> to prove, <hi>Natum in curas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum genus.</hi> General <hi>Experience</hi> gives us proof Enough. Christians are <hi>Forewarned</hi> by the Lord, who was Himself a <hi>Man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs,</hi> That <hi>in the World we shall have Trouble.</hi> The Disciples of the Lord, who Dyed upon a <hi>Cross,</hi> must all be <hi>Cross bearers,</hi> no less than that famous Prince who was called, <hi>Crouch back,</hi> from his wearing an image of the <hi>Cross</hi> on his <hi>Back.</hi> Being thus <hi>Forewarned,</hi> let me be <hi>Forearmed,</hi> and not be Surprized, when <hi>Troubles</hi> of all kinds come upon me; but be prepared with <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> to encounter them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, there may be some further Glosses made upon this matter. And among the rest, methinks, that of <hi>Coccejus</hi> is a little Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. <hi>Sicut Scintilloe natura eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <head>On Labouring in the Fire.</head>
               <p>SOmetimes I see a <hi>Writing,</hi> or some other curious, and perhaps tedious, Effect of <hi>Labour,</hi> thrown into the <hi>Fire;</hi> and then what becomes of all the <hi>Labour?</hi> This however shall come of it! It shall engage me in a short Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, on those words of the Prophet, Hab. 2 13 <hi>Behold, is it not of the Lord of Hosts, that the people shall Labour in the very Fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit of Prophecy here foretells the Downfal of <hi>Babylon:</hi> but it looks thorough &amp;
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:001067_0163_0FAEF4BD49DB9EE0"/>
beyond the Downfal of the Literal <hi>Babylon,</hi> down as far as that of the <hi>Mystical;</hi> the <hi>Town built with Blood,</hi> the <hi>City established by Iniquity,</hi> the Sorceress that <hi>makes the Neighbours Drunk,</hi> and <hi>Entices</hi> them into the <hi>Fornication</hi> of her <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries.</hi> The Oracle now before us, reports one special and signal character of the <hi>Time,</hi> when this Blessed Revolution is at the Door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the general Importance of the Oracle, is, That an extraordinary, and an Astonishing <hi>Disappointment,</hi> shall attend the expectations of people in all their Affairs. The wrath of God, like a <hi>Fire,</hi> shall so devour the Effects of all their <hi>Labour,</hi> that when men have never so much <hi>wearied</hi> themselves, to bring about their purposes, they shall find nothing but <hi>Vanity</hi> frustrating all that they have purposed. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall be strangely unprosperous in their most Hopeful, and most Likely Affairs, and have all their Hopes from very promising Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects evaporated into nothing.</p>
               <p>Indeed, all the <hi>Labour</hi> wherein we do not Serve our Lord Jesus Christ, is <hi>Labour in the Fire:</hi> 'Tis but <hi>lost Labour</hi> all of it. But now even in my <hi>Labour</hi> for the Lord Jesus Christ, there are two Unhappinesses of <hi>Labour in the Fire,</hi> which I would very warmly deprecate.</p>
               <p>First, I wish, that I may not <hi>Labour in the Fire,</hi> in regard of <hi>Unsuccessfulness</hi> attending my <hi>Labour,</hi> and so sad a Fate of the Souls under my Ministry, that they shall <hi>perish</hi> in the End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

and Easeless <hi>Fire,</hi> of the Divine Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from whence the <hi>Smoke of the Torment as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends for ever and ever.</hi> Oh! Let not this be the upshot of all my <hi>Labour</hi> to Teach, and Charge, &amp; Warn the Souls under my Charge; that they shall be thrown into that <hi>Fire,</hi> where they shall cry out, with him, Luk. 16. 24. <hi>I am Tormented in this Flame!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I wish that I may not <hi>Labour in the Fire,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Unusefulness</hi> of the Things done by my <hi>Labour,</hi> and their being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WE know, That <hi>Air</hi> is necessary to <hi>Flame.</hi> And our knowledge of it, is notably confirmed, by the Experiment of the <hi>Air <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the <hi>Flame,</hi> will be as if the <hi>Fire</hi> had hardly touched it. Yea, the Divine Oracles, [for such is the <hi>Fulness</hi> of them!] do seem to take notice of this Experiment, in Ezek. 15: 4 Where, first, <hi>Both Ends of the Vine stalk are devour'd and then the midst of it is burnt.</hi> But without those Experiments, we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of it every day, when our <hi>Fire</hi> will not burn, because the <hi>Wood lies too close</hi> The <hi>Fire</hi> will be smothered and obstructed, if the <hi>Air</hi> have not Access unto it.</p>
               <p>This thought invites me, in the first place,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:001067_0166_0FAEF4BF88543F78"/>
to consider the Necessity of <hi>Air</hi> to <hi>Life</hi> in our selves: For, tho' I am not such a <hi>Psychopyrist</hi> as to call the <hi>Soul,</hi> a <hi>Fire,</hi> yet, I see not why <hi>Life</hi> may not be called so; and without <hi>Air,</hi> we see (howbeit there have been some rare Instances of persons that have <hi>Lived Breathless</hi> for many days together; it may be, <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>oniack</hi> has revived the <hi>Flame;</hi>) that it will be soon extinguished. I would therefore give Thanks to the Good God, who by His <hi>Air</hi> does <hi>uphold my Soul in Life;</hi> and I would look upon it, as a very signal point of <hi>Health</hi> for me to be cautious, what <hi>Air</hi> I choose to be much conversant in; and not look to survive any long while, because none of my caution can secure me from the unseen <hi>Miasmata</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> which will damp all before them.</p>
               <p>Dismissing of this Thought, I presently fall into another; Namely, That S<hi>mothered Griefs,</hi> are worse things than S<hi>mothered Fires,</hi> and not so likely to go out. If a man have any <hi>Griefs,</hi> or <hi>Fears,</hi> or <hi>Cares</hi> upon his mind, let them have <hi>Air,</hi> and they will the sooner evaporate. All will be the more <hi>Lightsome</hi> with us, if we don't let them L<hi>y too close</hi> upon our mind. He that has any Remarkable Guilt, lying with distress upon his Conscience, let him single out some <hi>Faithful Pastor,</hi> to whom what he confesses will be as it were but confessed unto the Lord. The <hi>Reveling</hi> of the matter, and his ensuing <hi>Prayers,</hi> and Counsils, and Cordials, will be of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:001067_0167_0FAEF4C0A62384F0"/>
a blessed consequence unto <hi>an Heart that will be Hot, thro' a Fire burning in it, until it hath spoken with the Tongue.</hi> And let him that has any other Anguish, afford <hi>Vent</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> unto it, by some Agreeable Expressions of it: The <hi>Air</hi> will be a kindness to the <hi>Fire</hi> in the Soul; and all things will be the Better, and the Brighter for an Anguish not <hi>Lying too close</hi> upon it.</p>

               <p>THE Wood on my <hi>Fire,</hi> was in a mighty <hi>Blaze,</hi> that seemed as if it would have been a lasting one, at its first Blowing up: Nevertheless, the <hi>Bellows</hi> giving over to <hi>Blow,</hi> the <hi>Fire</hi> gave over to <hi>Burn</hi> immediately. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts, I now saw an Emblem of that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasy,</hi> which often attends <hi>Good Beginnings</hi> in Religion, where the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ (that Heavenly F<hi>ire</hi>) never took yet an <hi>Effectual Hold</hi> upon the Soul. Many <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners,</hi> in Religion, and <hi>Professors</hi> of it, seem very forward for the Services of Christianity, and make a mighty <hi>Blaze</hi> of Profession; but it is not a Lasting one: <hi>It goeth away.</hi> May the God of all Grace, make all our Young People, exceedingly apprehensive of, <hi>The</hi> A<hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states Doom,</hi> and afraid of <hi>Turning aside unto crooked wayes,</hi> thro' the Influences of <hi>Evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> or any other Temptation, after they have made <hi>Good Beginnings</hi> in Religion, lest they have that awful word fulfill'd upon them, <hi>If any man draw back, my</hi> S<hi>oul shall have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in him.</hi>

And this put me in mind of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing Favour, which I had <hi>my self</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Heaven, and which <hi>many more</hi> of the Elect have likewise Received. It is very commonly so, That the <hi>Elect</hi> of God, which enjoy a Religious Education, have by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God excited in them, very <hi>Fervent</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to piety, while they are in their <hi>Childhood:</hi> But when they advance into more of <hi>Youth,</hi> Temptation so prevails upon them, that for a while, all seems to be <hi>Gone out,</hi> and their former Inclinations are hardly to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: Nevertheless the Spirit of God will not let their <hi>Youth</hi> proceed very far, before He, who had been <hi>Grieved</hi> and <hi>Quenched</hi> by their Vanities, [L<hi>ord, can I write this, and not mingle my Tears with my Ink!</hi>] does again <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Once indeed, Sitting by a F<hi>ire,</hi> where a <hi>Pot</hi> boiled over, I observed, That the <hi>Boiling</hi> over of the <hi>Pot</hi> put out the <hi>Fire,</hi> and left the <hi>Pot</hi> without likelihood of <hi>Boiling</hi> over any more: But therewithal I could not miss Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, That there is a very wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, often doing a thing of this Importance.

               <head>On throwing my Pen into the Fire. Dec. 31. 1700.</head>
               <p>THus at length, in the <hi>Thirty Eighth</hi> year of my Age, I have Resumed and Finished the Reflections which I had begun, (and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many of them,) and then thrown by, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ago.

               <p>There are <hi>Men,</hi> (as well as <hi>Pens,</hi>) who have written man, Good Things &amp; thereby done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Service for the Churches of the Lord; but have been cast into the <hi>Fire</hi> after all: God has cast them into the <hi>Fire that never shall be Quenched.</hi> Many Learned, yea, many Devout, Writers have been <hi>Cast aways:</hi> because they have contented themselves with a meer <hi>Pen-and-Paper Piety:</hi> and going down to the <hi>Unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>Everlasting Fire</hi> have had cause to say, <hi>Surgunt ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>GOing out of my Study, to take some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my <hi>Little Folks</hi> in a Room accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with that great convenience for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Little Folks,</hi> A Stove, I saw occasion to take another Pen in hand, for some Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A <hi>Stove</hi> has no little Advantages of <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> &amp; <hi>Neatness</hi> &amp; <hi>Safety,</hi> and Uniform warmth, in any part of the Room, at any time of the year, for to <hi>Recommend</hi> it; nor is there any thing, that I know of, in the Objection of its

being <hi>Unwholesome</hi> (if it be not <hi>overheated,</hi>) for to <hi>Discommend</hi> it. But as my <hi>Stove</hi> has done me many another Service, it shall now Serve me with a Reflection, and Instruction of Christianity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fire</hi> in my <hi>Stove</hi> does abundance of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to all about it, yea, (as it is placed,) in two Rooms at once. My House is not now a <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenun,</hi> or <hi>place of Cold,</hi> (as the Jews called the Country that lay near the <hi>Snows</hi> of <hi>Lebanon:</hi>) but I have an <hi>April,</hi> or <hi>September</hi> there, in the midst of <hi>January:</hi> and yet the <hi>Fire</hi> which does all that Service, keeps out of <hi>Sight;</hi> no body <hi>Sees</hi> it; People <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>Effect,</hi> while they <hi>see</hi> not the <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks, It advises me, to <hi>Do Good,</hi> and yet <hi>Ly Hid,</hi> as much as ever I can. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain points of <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein the <hi>Religion</hi> will be very much lost, if the circumstances of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy</hi> &amp; <hi>Concealment,</hi> be not observed. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour says, <hi>Let thine Alms be in Secret;</hi> &amp; again, <hi>Pray to thy Father in Secret;</hi> and once more, <hi>When thou Fastest appear not unto men to Fast</hi> An Affectation to have our doing such Duties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, will be a <hi>Dead Flie,</hi> to spoil the Savour of the Duties, And very particularly, To give no <hi>Alms,</hi> but what shall be <hi>Seen,</hi> Savours of too much <hi>Hypocrisy.</hi> Tis true, That Good (<hi>quod fit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

is indeed <hi>thrown away.</hi> The Hypocritical Jews, themselves, who laboured under an Invincible <hi>Itch,</hi> to have all their <hi>Alms</hi> as publick as they could, yet had their <hi>Conscience</hi> calling them, to more of <hi>Concealment.</hi> Hence, <hi>The Treasury of the Silent,</hi> where some good men, silently &amp; privately conveyed their Charity for maintaining the Children of the Poor, was a Treasury of the most famous Account in the Temple. And hence it was a Proverb among them, <hi>He that doth Alms in Secret, is greater than our master</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>himself.</hi> Briefly, An Humble Christian, will watch opportunities, to <hi>Do Good;</hi> but he cares not, whether there ever be in this world the least <hi>Notice</hi> taken of it. He will <hi>Pray</hi> for many and many a man by <hi>Name</hi> and yet the obliged man himself shall never know of it. He will convey <hi>Reliefs</hi> to the Needy, and yet the Needy themselves perhaps will never know from whence they came. He will a thousand other ways it may be, seek to be a Blessing unto his Neighbours, but never seek for them to <hi>Bless</hi> him, or know his Influences.</p>
            <p>And now, to have done, Sirs, Let my <hi>Stove</hi> afford an Apology for my <hi>Nameless Writing.</hi> I am in hopes, That this little Book, may like a <hi>Stove,</hi> dispense a little <hi>Warmth</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> unto them, that shall allow it near enough. <hi>Luther</hi> complain'd of the <hi>Religion</hi> in his Time, <hi>Deest Ignis, Deest Ignis!</hi> It wants more <hi>Heat!</hi> May not we make the same complaint of ours?

may be, this Essay, may Revive something of our Languishing <hi>Heat!</hi> We read Job 28. 5. Of, <hi>A Land,</hi> out of which <hi>cometh Bread; &amp; under it is turned up as it were Fire.</hi> (Perhaps, <hi>Paradise,</hi> with the <hi>Volcano's</hi> which vomited out <hi>Fire</hi> near it, may be referr'd unto!) I have been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a <hi>Book,</hi> out of which there may <hi>come Food,</hi> for the minds of the Faithful; and under it, <hi>all turns upon Fire.</hi> But I do for many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, now (as well as often heretofore,) choose to write <hi>Anonymously.</hi> And hereby, t'will come to pass, that tho' the Author will be unavoidably known unto many in the next Vicinity, (which also he could be glad, he were not!) yet he will be preserved from the knowledge of the <hi>most</hi> in places that are further off. The Author most sincerely wishes that with as much <hi>Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> (according to his mean capacity,) as may be, he may enjoy the Satisfaction of one, <hi>Bene qui latuit;</hi> and be as Remote from View, as the <hi>Fire</hi> in the <hi>Stove.</hi> If any <hi>Good</hi> be done, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, Sirs; Let <hi>Man</hi> be <hi>Nothing;</hi> Let GOD, and CHRIST, and GRACE, have all the <hi>Glory.</hi>
