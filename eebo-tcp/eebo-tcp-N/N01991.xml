            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sermons were Preached I entertained the Congregation with another short Discourse, not Worthy the Name of a</hi> Sermon, <hi>so that (as I before said) I take these to be</hi> my Last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> First Sermon <hi>that ever I Preached in</hi> Boston, <hi>was in the Year</hi> 1661, <hi>immediately upon my Coming from</hi> England. <hi>I was then in the Twenty-Second Year of my Age: And had been several Years a Preacher of the Gospel in other Parts of the World, and I have (through Grace) continued to Preach the</hi> Gospel of CHRIST <hi>here in</hi> Boston <hi>until the end of the Eighty-Third Year of my Age, which is above Sixty Years. But (which I rejoyce at) I have known many who have done more Good in a few Years then I (an Unprofitable Servant) may pretend unto in many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I did (when I spoke my last unto the Dear People to whom I have these many Years been Preaching) Declare

to them, that the greatest Affliction I had in this World, was that I could do no more Service for them, whom I Love more dearly than my Life. Now I can do no more God in this World, I desire to Dye and Go to a better: But I must Humbly and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently Wait GOD's Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would Gladly do some Good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I am Dead. I hope the Books I have Written will do Good unto some of the People of GOD, when I can neither Speak nor Write. This is my Hope concerning these poor plain Sermons. The LORD Grant that it may be so, and that CHRIST may be Glorified by them.</hi>

If a Man hath True Grace it will Last forever. They that have the Grace of Faith it shall abide with them as long as they Live in this World.

and will be in a greater Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven than ever it was here in this World. Thence <hi>Grace</hi> is compared to <hi>Living Waters,</hi> to a Living Spring that never runs dry. Hence Christ said to the Woman of <hi>Sameria, The Water that I shall give, shall be Living Waters, springing up into Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</hi> Grace is compared unto a River, John 7. 38. <hi>He that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me, out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Waters.</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers continue from One Age to another.

When God sees his Servants would receive Damage by having much of this World, in Love and Faithfulness He denies it to them; but He gives them that which is much better. 1 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>Godliness has the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness has a Promise of Blessings that respect this present Life, so far as Infinite Wisdom shall see good for them.

            <p n="4">4. Demon. <hi>A further Evidence of the Truth, is, in that Grace in the Soul is a wonderful Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

God keepeth himself, and the wicked One toucheth him not.</hi> The Devil shan't come at him, shan't ruine him. Grace in the Soul pre'erves from the power of Satan and from Sin: We see notable instances of this in the Scriptures, as now, there was that instance of <hi>Joseph</hi> that was tempted by his leud Mistress; he had the Fear of God in his Heart, that kept him from being overcome by that Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Says he, <hi>How shall I do this Wickedness and Sin against God.</hi> He cannot do it. Thus it was with <hi>David</hi> divers times, said he, Psal. 18. 23. <hi>I kept my self from mine iniquity.</hi> It was from the Grace in <hi>David's</hi> Heart that he was kept from that Iniquity, which he was in special danger by; there was that Iniquity of Killing <hi>Saul,</hi> he had opportunity to have done it, and was urged by other Men to do it, so he might have delivered

himself from the Hand of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but he did it not, he kept himself from that Iniquity, he knew that God would be Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured if he did that thing. So when in his Passion purposed to have Destroyed the House of <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his Family; when <hi>Abigail</hi> came to him and gave him good Advice, said he, Blessed be thou and Blessed be thy Advice, thou hast kept me from shedding of Blood: In my Passion I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be revenged on such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Wretch, but now I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If Men live in Places where there is much danger of their Sinning, if they have Grace in their Souls they will be Preserved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. It is said of <hi>Obadiah, He feared the Lord greatly,</hi> 1 Kin. 18. 3. Therefore he did not do as <hi>Ahab's</hi> Courtiers did, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Prophets were cut off. This Man that Feared the Lord, did take Care of the Prophets of the Lord. Thus <hi>Daniel,</hi> when in the Court of a King that was a great Idolater, he did not fall in with that Idolatry, he was bold as a Lion, he would rather be throw among the Lions than be Guilt of such Idolatry. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> brought up in the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> he was not as other Courtiers, <hi>so did not I,</hi> says he, <hi>because of the Fear of God.</hi> Be sure there are two Sins that if a Man hath Grace in his Soul he shall be kept pure from he shall never become Guilty of. One is the Sin against the Holy Ghost. Psa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

shall never become Guilty of, is the Sin of <hi>Final Impenitence.</hi> It is true a good Man may fall into very grievous Sins in an Hour of Temptation: As we see in <hi>Peter,</hi> a very good Man, yet in an Hour Temptation he fell grievously, but he did not persist in his fall but did immediately repent, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly. David</hi> Sinned grievously in that matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> the Hittite, but he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of it and published his Repentance before the whole World, Psalm Fifty-first is the Psalm of <hi>Davids</hi> Repentance on the account of that grievous Sin.
