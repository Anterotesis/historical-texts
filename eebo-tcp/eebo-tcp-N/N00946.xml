            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Christ are thereby meant. As for the Persons invited to this Great Supper, both Jews and Gentiles are intended, &amp; not only the great ones but the meaner fort among them. Therefore it is said, <hi>Go-into the Streets of the City, and call them in,</hi> and it is said, <hi>Go into the High-ways and compel them to come in:</hi> By which the calling of the Gentiles might be signified. The Jews had the first offer of the Gospel made to them. Christ was Preached unto them before unto any other in the world; but few of them would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, few of them did believe, but with unreasonable Excuses did put off their coming to him.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>That when men are in the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come to Christ for Salvation, they are apt to delay &amp; put it off with Unreasonable Excuses.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001134_0013_0FB087F1B7874178"/>Two things are before us to be shewed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What those Excuses are, and the Unreasonableness of them, whereby men put off their coming to Christ?</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Question 1. <hi>What are those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses which men commonly make, &amp; the Unreasonableness of them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer 1. <hi>Men are are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> to pretend that their coming to Christ will be prejudicial to their worldly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interests.</hi> Thus here, three are mentioned as Excusing themselves: Two of them their excuse was, it would be prejudicial to their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit, the other because it would be prejudicial to his carnal sensual delights. Men are apt to think, that if they come to Christ they shall
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001134_0014_0FB087FE9CE648F0"/>
suffer as to their Outward estate. It may be they shall be Poor then. And indeed tho' the Lord Jesus Christ does not require that all his Disciples should actually part with whatever in the world they enjoy, nevertheless he requires that they be willing to do it when he shall put them upon it. Luk. 14. 32 <hi>He that will not forsake all that he has cannot be my Disciple.</hi> A man must be willing to forsake all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that he has in the world, when ever Christ calls him to it, or he can't be his Disciple. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, this Excuse is very Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable: For if a man should lose all that he has in the world and gain Christ instead of it, he would be no loser, but an infinite gainer. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. The Apostle there speaks of <hi>the Unsearchable Riches of Christ.</hi> If a man looses the world and gains Christ, he has unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches instead of that which he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001134_0015_0FB087FFE8853310"/>
had in the world. And <hi>Mat</hi> 13. 45. we read of one that did sell all that he had that he might obtain <hi>the Pearl of great price.</hi> Christ is the Pearl of great price. Tho' a a man should part with all that he has in the world, if he gain that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>earl he is no loser, but a great gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. No man loseth any thing for Christ, but Christ will make it up to him in this world; if not in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, then in spirituals which is far better. Mark. 10. 30. <hi>Who ever shall lose House or Land</hi> (said Christ) <hi>for my sake, and the Gospels, he shall receive an Hundred fold in this present life.</hi> He shall have more Grace given to him if he loses the world, and a little of that is more valuable than a great deal of the world. And he shall have more of inward heavenly Joy in his own soul. As the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Hebrews when their goods were taken away from them on Christs account, took that affliction
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001134_0016_0FB08801B96FB858"/>
               <hi>Joyfully.</hi> And much more will the Lord recompense them in the world to come. Therefore the Lord says, he shall have an hundred fold in this world, and <hi>Eternal Life in the world to come.</hi> Now that Eternal Life is of great worth and value, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more than any thing of this world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21. Sayes Christ to one there, <hi>Follow thou me, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and follow me and thou shalt have treasure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> How great is that Treasure? how vast are those Riches? Eph. 1. 18. <hi>That you may understand the Riches of the Glory of the Inheritance.</hi> Riches of glory, a rich and glorious Inheritance. This men should have, if they came to Christ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very unreasonable in them to object the profit of the world as their Excuse for their not coming to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Again, Others are apt to Excuse themselves by thinking they shall be
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001134_0017_0FB0880333D4C0C8"/>
deprived of their earthly Delights. That they shall never see pleasant Day more; that if they become se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Christians, then they must bid a farewel to all Pleasure in the world. But this is an Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objection. For those pleasures which Christ calls his Disciples to renounce for ever, they are sinful ones, and last but for a season. Heb. 11. 25. <hi>The pleasures of Sin are but for a season.</hi> Yea and but for a very short season too. Eccl. 7. 6. <hi>They are like the crackling of Thorns.</hi> If Thorns be set on fire they make a crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but they are presently out. And such are the pleasures of Sin: And then they end in dismal sorrow. Prov. 14. 13. <hi>The end of that mirth is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>eaviness.</hi> The pleasures of sin, the end of them will be heaviness. And the more delight any take therein the greater will their sorrow and misery be in another World. Rev. 18. 7. <hi>How much she hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001134_0018_0FB0880825F10EF8"/>
her self &amp; lived deliciously, so much torment &amp; sorrow give her.</hi> The more persons have indulged themselves in the wayes of sin, the greater torment shall be given to them in the world to come. Whereas if they hearken to Christ and come to him, they shall have better pleasures. Prov. 3. 17. <hi>All the wayes of wisdom are pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</hi> They are pleasant, and in them are far greater pleasures than ever any did enjoy in the wayes of sin, Psal. 36. 8. <hi>Thou wilt make them to drink of the rivers of thy pleasures.</hi> Rivers of pleasures are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by those that come to Christ. And they are pleasures that shall last for ever and ever, Psal. 16. 11. <hi>At thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</hi> Now then for men to refuse coming to Christ because they think they must never enjoy their pleasures any more, whereas those pleasures are but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001134_0019_0FB0880AC8C5C5F8"/>
and if they did come to Christ, they should enjoy better &amp; greater and eternal Pleasures, for them on that account to Excuse themselves is most unreasonable.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There are some who are so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable as to Object, that they don't know whether Christ dyed for them or no, and then if they did come to him they should not partale of the Salvation purchased by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to show you the Unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of this Excuse.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There, is merit enough in the Blood of Christ to save all the men in the world.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 2. <hi>He is a propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole World.</hi> If all the men in the world should believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, there needs no more to be done that God should become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to them, than that which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001134_0020_0FB0880D95E62F98"/>
Jesus Christ has already done. His Blood is infinitely Meritorious; and it most needs be so, because of his being not Man only but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> also. 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>The Blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</hi> Inas-much as the Blood of Jesus Christ is the Blood of the Eternal Son of God, it cleanseth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> all sin. There is an infinite value and efficacy in it. There is a super-abundant merit in the Blood of Christ. As the repenting Prodigal said, Luk. 15. 17. <hi>There is Bread enough in my Fathers House and to spare.</hi> Even so, there is Merit enough in the Death of Christ and to spare. As for all those thousands of Millions that perish to Eternity, I will say to you, there is not one of them all that does perish for want of a sufficiency of Merit in the Blood of Christ to save them, but because they do not come to him &amp; believe on him. Therefore,</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001134_0021_0FB0881128A9D210"/>2. <hi>In the Gospel Christ and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him is offered unto all men.</hi> The offer of the Gospel is as Free and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Come whosoever will.</hi> What can be more Free or Universal than that invitation of the Gospel, Come whosoever will? And if they come they shall have Life? Heb. 5. 9. <hi>He is the author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Let never so many obey him, he will be the author of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to them. And there is not a man in the world, but a Minister of Christ may say to that Man, Do you believe on the Name of Jesus Christ and you shall never perish, but shall have Eternal Life, Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001134_0022_0FB08812A602B680"/>
whosoever does believe on him should not perish, but should have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</hi> In this there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between fallen Man and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels. It may not be said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fallen Angels, if you believe you shall be saved by Christ, if you will trust to him for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you shall be saved by him. When Evil Spirits in possessed persons have entred into discourses with men, as oftentimes it hath been so, no man may say to one of <hi>them,</hi> If you will trust to Christ for Salvation, you may be saved. But now this may be said to Men, to every one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. So large, so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal is the offer of the Gospel that the Children of men are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of. If a Prince should lay down a Price for the Redemption of a company of Slaves, declaring that whosoever will consent to be his Subjects, the price is laid down for them, how unreasonable
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001134_0023_0FB0881B9B1DB238"/>
would it be for any one of them to say, I don't know it was intended for me in particular: when the Prince their Redeemer said it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for all that would consent to be his faithful Subjects. So does the Lord Jesus Christ the Prince of Life say in the Gospel, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aid down a Price to redeem the Slaves of Hell, and whosoever will sincerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be my Subject, my faithful Servant, it is for him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The way and the only way for a man to know whether Christ dyed for him in particular, is to believe on his Name.</hi> If any man, tho' a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate should say Christ has not dyed for me, that man would sin in so saying; for then he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude himself into that which is a Divine secret.

things belong to us.</hi> Whether Christ has dyed for such a man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is a secret thing, known unto the Lord only, until by the fruits of it it doth appear. But that such a man ought to Believe on the Name of Jesus Christ: that he ought to come to Christ, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him is revealed. Then let him do what is revealed, and he may be sure Christ has dyed for him. Yea as sure of it, as if he were now in Heaven <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Sayes the Apostle, <hi>The life that I now live, is by the Faith on the Son of God, who gave himself for me.</hi> If a man has Faith in the Son of God, then he may know that Christ gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for him in particular.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis mans own fault that he cannot come.</hi> They have made themselves unable to believe. How then will that Impotency Excuse them? It is true, that the Children of men are become impotent, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures. Rom. 5. 6. <hi>They are without strength.</hi> But they have made themselves to be without strength. They have sinned away that power which once they had.

to Satan, our Strength is departed from us, and we are become weak. <hi>Adam</hi> had power enough to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God required of him: There was nothing that God enjoyned on him, but he had power sufficient to do it. Eccles. 7. 29. <hi>God made man upright but they sought out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi> So God gave to man in his <hi>first-state</hi> sufficiency of Power to obey whatsoever he should enjoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> on him. But they have sinned away that power, and made themselves unable to do what once they could have done. If a Servant should make himself sick, and neglect doing his work that his Master hath set him about, and then pretend that he was sick, would that be a sufficient Excuse? When it might be said, You did wilfully make your self sick &amp; weak. That would be no rational Excuse for him.</p>

enough, that if they did not come to Christ for Eternal Life, they should be sent down to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell world without end. Yet for all this they would not come to him that they might have Life. That Unbelief which is <hi>the</hi> Damning sin of men that live under the Gospel, it is a wilful Unbelief. Joh. 3. 19. <hi>This is the Condemnation that Light is come into the world and men have loved Darkness rather than Light.</hi> That is the Damning sin under the Gospel, <hi>men love darkness.</hi> And when light is come to them, they shut their eyes and don't care for the light. It is plain that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not come to Christ; that they have no mind to believe, in that they will not do what they can do.

God requires sinners that they should think seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously of that <hi>Eternity</hi> to which they are going: That Eternity is before them in another world where they must quickly be. Eccl. 11. 8. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the dayes of darkness for they are many.</hi> Remember <hi>Eternity,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and where you must be when you go out of this world. This God requires of men. And that they should <hi>Meditate on the Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> that they should think of his being a suitable Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for them: that they should Meditate on the Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, and how he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely.

enamoured with him; it may be they would be perswaded to part with all for his sake, if they would but Meditate on Jesus Christ and on his Glory. But now Sinners will not do this, altho' they can do it if they will. For that <hi>Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative faculty,</hi> that power of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God has given to men makes them capable to think of Christ, of Eternity, and of another World, as well as of the vain things of this world. That power which God has given them enables them to do it if they would. But they will not. They suffer other kind of thoughts to lodge in their souls, Jer. 4. 14. <hi>Wash thine heart from wickedness O Jerusalem that thou may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p>God requires that men should Pray to him for Faith. For Faith is the gift of God, Eph. 2. 8. <hi>We are saved by Grace through Faith, &amp; that not of our selves it is the Gift of God.</hi> That Faith that men have if a true Faith, 'tis the gift of God to them. Faith is of the <hi>Operation of God.</hi> Then God requires &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from men that they should pray to him for this gift; that they should go alone and Cry as for their lives and souls to God to give them Faith. They say they can't come to Christ except God draw them, then you ought to <hi>Pray</hi> to God that he would draw you.

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:001134_0038_0FB0884CA5510638"/>
So ought sinners to pray to God that he would draw them to Christ. He will be enquired of by the House of <hi>Israel</hi> to do this thing for them. 'Twas said to the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, If thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We have instances of those that prayed for Faith, Mark. 9. 24. <hi>Lord help my Unbelief.</hi> So the Lord would have sinners come before him and complain of their Unbelief, &amp; to Cry to God to help them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Unbelief. The Apostles prayed for more Faith, Luk. 17. 5. <hi>Lord encrease our Faith</hi> say they. So sinners should go to God and should Pray to him, <hi>Lord give us Faith,</hi> and help us to lay hold on Christ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in Crying to God for Faith. Tell me if you can, where there is one Unbeliever in the world that does day and night Cry to God to help him to believe, that does Cry to God to give him saving Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded there is not one such Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer in the World.

Whenas we must come to Christ like poor Beggars that have nothing in the world to recommend us to him, but only Sin and Guilt and Misery, that so Christ may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from it. Nor will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to accept of such if indeed they come unto him. As we read concerning <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 22. 2. <hi>That if any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

as are so poor as that they have neither Money nor Monies worth, the Lord sayes to them <hi>Come, come, come.</hi> And thus in this Parable, we see that Christ invites the most worthless ones to come to the great Supper, Luk. 14. 21. <hi>Go into the Lanes and Streets of the City, and bring in the Poor, the Maimed, and the Halt, and the Blind<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

They are not sensible of that exceeding Guiltiness that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

on them. Especially if they have been kept from gross scandalous Sins, they are apt to think all is well with them, and that they have no such need of a Saviour as indeed they have. Thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> before his Conversion, Rom. 7. 9 <hi>I was alive without the Law, but the Commandment came, Sin revived and I dyed.</hi> He thought himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, that he was in the way unto Eternal Life.

But when the <hi>Commandment,</hi> when the <hi>Law</hi> was set home on his Conscience in the power and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Nature of it, then he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a thousand times more guilty and sinful than once he apprehended. Then <hi>I Dyed,</hi> (sayes he) he saw himself a Dead and and a Damned Creature, and was e'ne ready to dye away with the terrible sight of his sins. And Sinners are ignorant

of their Misery, Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 17. <hi>Thou knowest not that thou art Miserable.</hi> A man that is very sick if he does not know it, he will not go to the Physician. So it is with sinners, Mat. 9. 12. <hi>The whole have no need of a Physician.</hi> The Pharisees thought themselves to be whole, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough without a Christ, and therefore they came not to him, Joh. 9. 41. <hi>You say we see, therefore your Sin remains</hi> They were under Spiritual blindness and other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, which they needed a Christ to save them from, but they knew it not; therefore their sin did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sinners are ignorant of Christ, therefore they come not to him, Joh. 1, 10, 11. <hi>He was in the world and the world knew him not; He came to his own and they received him not.</hi> They knew him not, and therefore received him not. If a

man should have a Jewel offered to him of never so great value, if he is ignorant of its worth, he will not much regard the offer. So here, Christ is the most precious Jewel that ever was offered to any man, He is better than <hi>Rubies:</hi> But sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners don't know the worth of a Christ, if they did they would not reject him, but count it the greatest happiness might they have an interest in him. Psal. 9. 10 <hi>They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee.</hi> They that know the worth of a Christ will believe on him. It was therefore said to the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> Joh. 4. 10 <hi>If thou hadst known the gift of God, thou wouldest have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But as long as sinners do not know Christ, it is not to be wondred at if they do not come to him for Salvation. The man that was born blind but had his eyes opened, when 'twas said to him, Joh. 9. 35. <hi>Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,

               <hi>Who is He that I may believe on him?</hi> If men do not know who and what manner of one Christ is, they will not believe on him. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ignorant of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, and therefore do not desire to be made partakers of it. Rom. 10. 3 <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Although they have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which set forth the Glory of Christ, for all that they remain ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it. Act. 13. 27 <hi>They knew him not, nor the voice of the Prophet<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that were read to them every Sabbath Day.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> in their Meeting-houses had the Scripture read and expounded to them every Sabbath Day.

him, 1 Cor. 2. 8 <hi>If they had known Him they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reason why sinners do not come to Christ when invited, <hi>It is because they love him not.</hi> No man will choose to be a Scholar to a Master that he hates. Sinners are so far from loving the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as that they do indeed hate him. Joh. 3. 20 <hi>He that hates the light does not come to the light.</hi> Christ is that light which sinners hate, therefore they do not nor will come unto him. It is a sad word to be spoken, but alas a true one, <hi>That men by Nature are haters of God,</hi> and therefore will not believe on him who is the Son of God. This reason Christ gives why the <hi>Jews</hi> did not believe on him, Joh. 5. 42. <hi>You will not come unto me that ye may have life: You have not the love of God in you.</hi> They hated God &amp;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001134_0052_0FB088E56529D310"/>
therefore would not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ. He that hates God the Father, hates the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ who is the Son of God also, and must needs do so because he is so like unto his Father. Joh<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 15. 24. <hi>They have hated me and my Father,</hi> sayes Christ. He that hates the one will hate the other. He that hates Christ will hate God even the Father, and he that hates God the Father will hate Jesus Christ too. Wherefore Christ speaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those <hi>Jews</hi> the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> were invited to come to him, but did not, nor would they come, sayes <hi>Their Soul loathed me, Zech.</hi> 11. 8. Because Christ is holy therefore the unholy hearts of men do not love him. As the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirit once said in a po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

He is too holy for them. They would willingly have a Christ that should save them from Hell and yet allow them to live in their sins: such a Christ would please them. But Christ is <hi>He who is Holy,</hi> and will not allow men to continue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against God. Hence they hate him, Joh 7. 7. <hi>The world hates me</hi> (sayes Christ) <hi>because I testify of it that the works of it are evil:</hi>

They would rather with some works of their own purchase Salvation. A Learned Papist (but a Prou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is true, he would not have men to Pray, to observe the Sabbath, to reform their Evil wayes, yet he had rather they should do all this, than go to Christ.

At last the <hi>Daemon</hi> advised him to kill himself, and told him he should rise again within three dayes. The miserable wretch did kill himself, and so was ruined Body and Soul. But it was observed that this <hi>Demon</hi> said not one word of Christ to him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> never exhorted him to believe in the Name of Jesus Christ. The Devil knows that the Salvation of men depends on this thing above all others; that if they believe in <hi>Christ</hi> they shall have Eternal Life. But he knows also that tho' they Hear, Pray, and keep the Sabbath, if they do not believe on <hi>Christ</hi> they never will be saved. Therefore above all things, Satan sets himself to hinder men from believing on, and coming to Christ for Life and Salvation.</p>

Because they are not able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give very great wrongs, they are apt to think that God can't do so neither: but this the Lord reproves, Isa. 55. 8, 9. <hi>My wayes are not as your wayes, but as the Heavens are higher than the Earth so are my wayes higher than your wayes.</hi> I'll forgive great injuries to my Name, sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus to speak concerning God, thus to deny his Omnipotent Power, is to speak against him, it is to blaspheme his Name, Psal. 78. 19. <hi>They spake against God saying, can God prepare a Table?</hi> So when any say, Can God forgive so great a Sinner? Can God pardon so great Sins as mine are? This is to speak against Him. Again, Despair is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against the Grace and Mercy of God. In which Attributes his Divine Glory does most eminently shine forth.

Psal<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 78. 41. <hi>They limited the Holy One of Israel.</hi> To limit his Power or his Mercy is a great Evil. Yet so do they that Despair. They set bounds to the infinite Mercy of God. They say there is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mercy in God: Only Mercy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pardon lesser sins, but not the greatest. Men thereby say there is more of Evil in a finite Creature, than there is of Goodness in the Infinite God: than which blasphemy nothing more untrue can be spoken. Rom. 5. 20. <hi>Where Sin abounds Grace much more abound.</hi> But Despair sayes, Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the Grace of God. Yea and in this sin, there is a blasphemous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the Truth of God as well as on his Power and Mercy, as if there were no. Truth in those gracious Promises which God hath made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repenting believing Sinners. God in his Word has said that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sinners in the world, if they will truly repent and turn to him shall be forgiven, Isa. 1. 18. <hi>Wash you make you clean, cease to do evil, learn to do well, though your sins be as Scarlet they shall become white as Snow, then red like Crimson, they shall be a Wool.</hi> God sayes that the horride<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

God in his Word sayes, they that have been guilty of many sins as well as great ones, if they do truly repent and turn to God in Jesus Christ, shall have their many sins
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001134_0086_0FB08958F84CD398"/>
forgiven to them. Isa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the Wicked forsake his war, and the Unrighteous man his thoughts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord, he will have mercy, to our God and he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> He will multiply to pardon. They that have been guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sins shall find there are more Pardons with God to bestow on them, than they have committed sins. And they that have committed the same sins many Times over, yet God, sayes in his Word, if they will repent and believe on Jesus Christ they shall be forgiven. A Drunkard that has been Drunk an hundred times and more. An Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean person that has been guilty many a time, if he repents God will forgive him.

It is then a great Evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In Despair there is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on Jesus Christ the Son of God and Saviour of the World.</hi> It sayes Jesus Christ is but a little Saviour, whereas He is a Saviour, and a Great one, Isa. 63. 1. <hi>He is mighty to save.</hi> Despair sayes of Christ that He is a Physician that can cure only lesser diseases and not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Whereas he is able to cure the most Diseased Soul in the world. As no Bodily Disease could stand before his power, Mat. 4. 23. <hi>He healed all manner of Sicknesses, and all manner of Diseases.</hi> That was to signify that he Healeth all manner of Soul Diseases: And that he has
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001134_0088_0FB0896244DA3000"/>
obtain'd Forgiveness for all manner of Sins that men are guilty of. We find in the Gospel, some diseased Twelve, others Eighteen, others Thirty Eight Years, yet Christ did heal them; thereby declaring, that Souls which have been a long time under the Guilt of sin may through him hope for Forgiveness. And that the most Chronical, the most laveterate Soul-diseases may be and shall be healed by him. But Despair sayes otherwise. Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He is able to save to the uttermost.</hi> No, sayes Despair but he is not. Tho' a Sinner has destroyed himself to the uttermost; though he has damn'd his own Soul a Million times over, yet <hi>Christ</hi> is able to save him. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair then is a reflection on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Death and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> as though that Blood could make atonement for lesser offences, but not for great ones: Whereas the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ the

Son of God, cleanseth from all sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. Let the sins be never so many, never so great, that Blood cleanseth from them all. There is more of Merit in the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, than there has been of Demerit in the greatest Sin that ever was committed in the world. <hi>Adams</hi> sin was in some respects the greatest that ever was, for that has brought ruine on thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of millions of Immortal Souls, yet the Merit of the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> has exceeded the Demerit of that great Offence Rom. 5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 17. <hi>If by one Death came, how much more shall they that receive abundance of Grace, &amp; the gift of Righteousness reign in Life, by Jesus Christ.</hi> Much more sayes the Apostle. The Disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> destroyed Souls, much more does the Obedience of Christ save the Souls that believe on him. God has been pleased more, and honoured more by the Death of Christ, than

he has been displeased and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by all the sins of all the Men in the world. But Despair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies this. And it reflects on the Veracity of <hi>Christ,</hi> as tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

than can be forgiven. Thus in <hi>Cain,</hi> the Wicked one perswaded him to murder his Brother, and when he had done so, he told him that now his Sin was so great, as that it was Unpardonable. Who is it that says to sinners, their sins are greater than can be forgiven? God does not say so. And Ungodly sinners tho' they are wont to tempt one another to Presumptuous sins, yet they don't use to tempt one another to Despair. It remains then that it is Satan which tempts persons to Desperation. So he tells sinners it is too soon to Repent, and when they have delay'd their Repentance for a long time, then if they begin to have a serious thought of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, he sayes now it is too late. First that it was too soon, &amp; then that 'tis too late. This he does that so he may discourage from Returning to God, and from Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Pardoning mercy.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Lest the Day of Grace is past with them.</hi> But why should any say so, or think so? Sayes the Lord, Isa. 40, 27. <hi>Why sayest thou O Jacob? Why speakest thou O Israel, my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is passed over from my God?</hi> Why should any one say the Day of Grace is past? God will look on me no more! Whereas there is not any one here this day, that can say that his Revealed Day of Grace is gone and passed away. As for the Secret Inward Day of Grace that continues so long as the Holy Spirit strives with the Soul. Such fears as these not amounting to Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair oftentimes are attended with the strivings of the Holy Spirit of God. Hence the Apostle speaks of <hi>the Spirit of Bondage to Fear, Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:001134_0093_0FB089709D82B7D0"/>
8. 15. Poor sinful Creatures are in great Bondage, because they are full of Fear. God sanctifies such Fears to his Elect, in order to their Conversion. As for the Revealed Day of Grace, that continues so long as men enjoy the Outward means of Grace, and have the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Preached to them, which is the Gospel of the Grace of God. Isa. 65. 2. <hi>I have stretched out my hand all the day long.</hi> There is no man that lives under the Gospel, but God offers to him the Pardon of his Sins, and the Salvation of his Soul, if he will indeed believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. And unto such the Revealed Day of Grace continues so long as the Day of Life Indeed after Life is ended, the Day of Grace is at an end. No more Sermons, no more tenders of Mercy, no more calls to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance after that. Therefore Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration must needs be in such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001134_0094_0FB08971B4A0BB88"/>
Souls as dye in their sins, Isa. 38. 18. <hi>They that go down to the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth.</hi> But while Life lasts there is hope, Eccl. 9. 4 <hi>To him that is joyned to the living there is hope.</hi> Hope that he may obtain the forgiveness of Sin, and the Eternal salvation of his Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Despairing Sinners are afraid that God from all Eternity has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated them to Damnation.</hi> But who is this that darkens Counsel by words without Knowledge? Who told thee that thou art a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate? God never told thee so. It must needs be Satan then, and will you believe him?

But there is no cause for that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination</hi> is a Divine secret, known to no Man or Angel, to none but God alone. Therefore for men to conclude that they are Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is an high offence to God, Rom. 11. 34 <hi>Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor?</hi> Who was by him when he wrote the Book of Life, to see whose Names were enrolled there, and whose left out?

            <p>One Character of such a person is, that he has an implacable Hatred of the Holy Lord Jesus Christ. Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

appearing in them. It has been thought by Divines, that <hi>Saul</hi> was guilty of the great Transgression. Now he had a most bitter hatred of those that did in a peculiar manner belong to God. 1 Sam. 22. 17. <hi>Slay the Priests of the Lord.</hi> They are the Lords Priests therefore Slay them.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is not one here in this Assembly that has been guilty of that Sin.</hi> For if you had, you would not be here attending on the Word of God.

Hope is a Grace exceeding necessary for a Christian, as an Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met is for a Souldier. Eph. 6. 17. <hi>Put on the Helmet of Salvation.</hi> What is that? Hope in God and the Lord Jesus Christ, that is the Helmet of Salvation; 'tis the Head-piece. If a man be wounded in the head, it is dangerous. If a Christian lets his Hope go, his Head lyes open to the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001134_0116_0FB089CDF052F4D8"/>
Wicked one, to the fiery Darts of the Wicked one. And those fiery Darts are evil Thoughts concerning God. The Devil puts it into a Christians heart that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have mercy on him, that God has Reprobated him. Now his Head piece is gone if he gives way to these Temptations. Hope is as necessary as an Anchor to a Vessel. Heb. 6. 18, 19. <hi>Who are fled for Refuge to the Hope set before us, which Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, sure and stedfast.</hi> What comes of a Vessel if it has no Anchor when a Storm riseth? It is broken to pieces. So the poor Souls that let their Hope go, bring themselves to confusion.</p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>
               <p>Meditate much on those things that are a sure ground of Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. A great relief against all Despairing thoughts is, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the infiniteness of the Mercy of God. He is rich in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001134_0117_0FB089CF74D64690"/>
How great is his Goodness? No man can say how great his Goodness is. No man can say how far his Mercy may extend. And medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the infinite Merit of the Death of Christ. A man may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture his Soul on that bottom. The greatest sinner may safely say, <hi>If there is not Merit enough in the Blood of Christ to save me, let my Soul perish for ever.</hi> Well then, think much &amp; often on the infinite Merit of that precious Blood. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member also, that God takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them that Hope in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 11. They that Pray to God, and Hope in his Mercy, and Confess their Sins and Hope in his Mercy, and Turn, from Sin to God and Hope in his Mercy, God takes pleasure in them. For then the more Glory will come to his Name the greater their Sins have been. Sayes <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 25. 11. <hi>For thy Name sake Pardon mine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for it is great.</hi> The greater the Iniquity of any poor Creature has been, the greater Glory will come to God by the Pardon of it. Therefore God takes pleasure in it, when very great Sinners return to him and hope in his mercy. Remember also, that others that have sinned as much as you, have found pardoning mercy with God. There is not any one here this day, but as great a sinner as he, has been Pardoned. What a bloody Sinner was <hi>Manassch?</hi> And yet when he humbled himself greatly, the Lord had mercy on him. What think you of the <hi>Jews</hi> that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed their hands in the Blood of Christ?

If thou shouldest weep Seas of Tears, that would not make amends for the wrong done to God by thy Sins. If thou shouldest give ten thousand Rivers of Oyl, Yea, the Fruit of thy Body for the Sin of thy Soul, all won't do. Only Christ can do that.

Oh! Then look to Him above all things. It was well spoken by an Eminent Minister on his Death-bed, <hi>When I look on the best Works that

As for the many things that people are cumbring themselves about, and carking for, they are not needful. About what are men encumbring themselves? 'Tis how they may get
