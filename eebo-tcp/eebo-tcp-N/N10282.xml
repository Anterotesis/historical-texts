            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NOTHING gives more convincing proof of deficiency in judgment or malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of heart in an Author, than general, undiſtinguiſhing ſatire, levelled at an order of men, at a ſex, or at human nature. Moſt writers, who have taken the Fair Sex as their ſubject, have treated them without proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and either deified them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, or condemned them without mercy; and ſcarcely have the Ladies been more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ridiculous flattery, than injured by undeſerved cenſure. The Roman Poet, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal,</hi> who gave the lead to theſe Lampooners, hath railed at the Sex in a very long ſatire, the moſt witty and injudicious of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. The Eſſay on the Characters of Women by <hi>Pope,</hi> notwithſtanding the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious praiſes of his whimſical Editor, is one of his leaſt meritorious performances, and was juſtly received with coldneſs by the public. <hi>Swift,</hi> tho' he hath ſhown far greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of human nature, hath debaſed all his
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013052_0004_0F8FF5F9D5ED3090"/>
ſatires on the Ladies, by the moſt general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions and dirty raillery. <hi>Young,</hi> inferior perhaps to the two laſt in genius, hath diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much more judgment and true wit on theſe ſubjects. His ſatires I would recommend to the peruſal of my fair readers, as the reproofs and corrections of a friend. The man, who only inſults over vice and folly, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cauſes, or pointing out the remedy, employs his pen to very little purpoſe: like a phyſician, who ſhould prove you had a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſe, and yet through malice or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhould refuſe a preſcription.</p>
            <p>My deſign in this Poem is to ſhew, that all the foibles we diſcover in the Fair Sex ariſe principally from the neglect of their educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the miſtaken notions they imbibe in their early youth. This naturally introduced a deſcription of theſe foibles, which I have endeavoured to laugh at with good humour, and to expoſe without malevolence. Had I only conſulted my own taſte, I would have preferred ſenſe and ſpirit with a ſtyle more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated and poetical, to a perpetual drollery, and the affectation of wit: but I have found by experience in the ſecond part of this work, that it is not ſo agreeable to the bulk of my readers; and I wiſhed in the laſt production I ſhall probably offer the public to have the good fortune of general approbation. I have endeavoured to avoid unſeaſonable ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and hope, in that point, I am pretty clear of cenſure; eſpecially as ſome of my good friends in theſe parts have lately made
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:013052_0005_0F8FF5FA9C2B8470"/>
a diſcovery that ſeverity is not my talent, and there is nothing to be feared from the ſtrokes of my ſatire; a diſcovery, that on this head hath given me no ſmall conſolation. In the following poem, my deſign is ſo apparent, that I am not much afraid of general miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; and I hope there are no grave folks, who will think it trifling or unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. I expect however, from the treatment I have already received in regard to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts of this work, as well as ſome later and more fugitive productions, that my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns will by many be ignorantly or wilfully miſunderſtood. I ſhall reſt ſatisfied with the conſciouſneſs that a deſire to promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of learning and morality was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal motive, that influenced me in theſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; judging as I did, that unleſs I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething in this way, that might conduce to the ſervice of mankind, I had ſpent much time in the ſtudies of the Muſes in vain.</p>
            <p>Polite literature hath within a few years made very conſiderable advances in <hi>America.</hi> Mankind in general ſeem ſenſible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and advantages of learning. Female Education hath been moſt neglected; and I wiſh this ſmall performance may have ſome tendency to encourage and promote it. The ſprightlineſs of Female genius, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that Sex in their proper walks of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are by no means inferior to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Men. And although the courſe of their education ought to be different, and writing is not ſo peculiarly the buſineſs of the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:013052_0006_0F8FF5FB51729D20"/>
ſex, yet I cannot but hope hereafter to ſee the accompliſhment of my prediction in their favor.</p>
            <l>Her Daughters too this happy land ſhall grace</l>
            <l>With pow'rs of genius, as with charms of face:</l>
            <l>Bleſt with the ſoftneſs of the female mind,</l>
            <l>With fancy blooming, and with taſte refin'd,</l>
            <l>Some <hi>Rowe</hi> ſhall riſe and wreſt with daring pen,</l>
            <l>The pride of genius from aſſuming men;</l>

            <l>And what can mean that gown ſo odd?</l>
            <l>You ought to dreſs her in the mode,</l>
            <l>To teach her how to make a figure;</l>
            <l>Or ſhe'll be awkward when ſhe's bigger,</l>
