            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>The gentleman forced his diſcourſe very much to the lady, and then aſked me what the ruff was that was in the window. I reached it to him, and told him it was eighteen pence; he bought the ruff, and went away.</p>

               <p>I can't exactly tell the time. I believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a week after that, as near as I can gueſs, I ſaw him again, he came about noon; he came in a great hurry, all over mud on one ſide, and ſaid a coach had flung him down.</p>

I made anſwer, I never was at a play, and never intended it. That was all that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly paſſed then.</p>

               <p>I ſaw him no more to my knowledge. On Monday, the 14th of December, at night, one Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey came; ſhe afterwards told me her name.</p>

               <p>Yes; <stage>(<hi>pointing to the priſoner Harvey</hi>)</stage> ſhe beſpoke a pair of laced ruffles, and aſked, if I could get them done by the next day noon; after ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke them, ſhe aſked me, if my name was not Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock; ſhe ſaid that I had been ſtrongly recommended to her, and ſhe loved to encourage young beginners; and told me if ſhe liked the ruffles, ſhe would recommend me to a lady of her acquaintance which wanted a great many things.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>Not to my knowledge. The next day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noon, ſhe came according to her time, and fetched the ruffles, and ſaid ſhe wanted ſeveral more things, and aſked me, if I could come to her houſe next day at four o'clock; I anſwered, I would come if ſhe pleaſed.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>December the 16th, the day of the week was Wedneſday. I went to Curtain Row, juſt by Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway mount. The maid opened the door, ſhe went up ſtairs and let her miſtreſs know that I was there, and then I was ordered up ſtairs; ſhe behaved in a very genteel manner, and aſked me to ſit down, and then deſired to look at the things which I had brought; ſhe ordered tea directly; I told her I could not ſtay to drink tea, and begged to be excuſed. Juſt as I was ſpeaking of that, in came a little man like a Jew, and made a great many compliments to this lady, as if he had not ſeen her before that day. I have ſince found the name of this man to be Jſaac Jſaacs; then they began to talk about his going to the play, ſhe ſaid ſhe was going into the city to ſee a lady.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No; he ſaid he muſt have a coach to go to the play, and chat if ſhe would, ſhe might go part of the way in his coach, that he would ſet her down. Then the turned to me, and ſaid, this is the lady I told you of; ſhe then ſaid, ſhe would be glad if I would go along with her; that ſhe wanted a great many things, and would be a good cuſtomer to me. I made many excuſes, that my dreſs was not ſuitable, and then deſired to be excuſed from going that night; ſhe ſaid, the lady was a very agreeable lady, and would think nothing of my dreſs, it was all very well, and begged I would go; then the Jew went with a pretence to fetch a coach; he came back again directly, and hurried away very faſt; we were hurried into the coach, and the maid ſeemingly, was to bring the candle, but kept back with it. I went into the coach in the dark, and was not able to diſcern what fort of a coach it was. When I got into the coach, the Jew drew up the glaſſes; I obſerved that they were very good glaſſes for a hackney coach. He ſaid it was a very good coach indeed. I by and by ſaid, it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good coachman, as well as a good coach, he drove ſo faſt, and I did not hear him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010919_0009_0F852914A4B5A8C8"/>were coming to the door, Mrs. Harvey ſaid, Miſs, this is a very fine houſe this lady keeps; I ſaid, I was very ſorry I was come in ſuch a dreſs, for I was quite aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then they knocked at the door, they drove in ſo faſt, that I did not know that it was in a court-yard, but thought it was a door in the ſtreet.</p>

               <p>They did, and with a great deal of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, I drank one diſh. After tea he went out of the room, and brought in a heap of nicknacks; ſuch as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſmelling-bottles, tetotums and a ring: He ſaid he had bought them all for me. I told him. I had no uſe for them, and did not chuſe to accept them. He wanted me to play at tetotum: He ſaid, he ſuppoſed I could play, and begged I would, I told him, when I was a child poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I might, but now I thought it rather beneath me. He ſaid, if I would not accept the things we ſhould play for them; which we did, but I did not accept of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. I ſaid ſeveral times, between, to Mrs. Harvey, I ſhould be glad if ſhe would let me go home. She ſaid we ſhould go home preſently. I told her it grew late, and begged that I might go, for my friends did not know where I was, and would be uneaſy. She ſaid I ſhould go preſently. The gentleman ſaid he wanted me to ſee the houſe. I told him I did not care to ſtay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; and as the ladies were not there, and I did not ſee they would come, I could ſee the houſe another time. He ſaid, may be I would not come another time, I ſaid, may be I would. He ſaid, will you promiſe me to come another time. I ſaid I did not chuſe to promiſe it. I would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, becauſe I never intended it, if I could get out; not that that I had, at that time, any thoughts of being kept there; but expecting the perſon that courted me, I wanted to be at home. He then ſaid, Miſs, but you ſhall ſee the houſe to-night, therefore took me in to ſee another room or two. When we came into a room where there was a harpſicord, he aſked Mrs. Griffinburg whether ſhe was ſure all the family were out, becauſe if he was ſure all the family were out, he would play the muſic to Miſs.—This confirmed me that he was a ſervant in the houſe; and becauſe I thought I heard the Doctor before ſay, here comes the ſteward; and the gentleman having ſo mean an appearance, I had no notion he was maſter of the houſe.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as he had ſaid that, Mrs. Griffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, turned to Mrs. Harvey, and ſaid, how glad ſhe was they had got ſo nice an opportunity to have the houſe all to themſelves. After he had played the muſic, and they had ſtaid a little while, I was had out into the room I was firſt in. I intreated of Mrs. Harvey again
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010919_0011_0F8529161D9D11E8"/>that ſhe would let me go home, for it was late. They ſaid it was not late; it was not above eight or nine o'clock, and the lady would come preſently. I told them, as to the lady, I did not ſee ſhe would come, and I muſt go home. Lord Baltimore ſaid, Miſs, you ſhall ſtay to ſupper firſt. I ſaid, Sir, I don't chooſe any ſupper, and begged I might go home. He then ordered ſupper. Mrs. Griffinburg went out of the room, and ordered ſupper. As ſoon as ſhe was gone, he took me up behind the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow curtain, and ſaid, Miſs, you ſhall come and ſee where you are: You don't know where you are, do you. I ſaid, no; Sir, where is it; but he did not tell me then; he began to ſhow indecencies, ſuch as opening his breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and putting his tongue into my mouth. I flew into a very great paſſion, ſtruggled, and got from behind the curtain. Mrs. Harvey and Doctor Griffinburg came up ſeemingly to help him: With that I fought with them all, and ſaid, I would go home directly, and made up to the door: With that, he ſaid I ſhould ſtay to ſupper firſt. I ſaid I would not ſlay, I would go home directly. He then made me ſit down by him at ſupper, but I would no eat nor drink. He then offered me a glaſs of ſyllabub, which I knocked out of his hand, and got up again, and ſaid I would go home, and made up to the door. He ſaid it was late, and ſaid there could be no coach got for me. I told him not to tell me about a coach, I wanted no coach, and would ſlay upon no account whatever. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired he would not attempt to perſuade me. With that he ſtood over me (I believe it might be then about eleven but can't exactly ſay the time; I think it was about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven when they had firſt done ſupper) he ſtlood over me till between twelve and one.

I ſaid if he could fend a letter, what was the reaſon he could not let me go home? I would go home, and he ſhould not keep me upon any account whatever. With that he ſaid I could not, nor ſhould not go home. I cried very violently, and ſaid it did not ſignify, they ſhould not keep me there. He flew into a paſſion, and ſaid I need not trouble myſelf about him, for he ſhould not meddle with me. I told him no, no more he ſhould. He went away. Then Harvey and Griffinburg, and Dr. Griffinburg, ſtood over me for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout another hour, to perſuade me to be reconciled, and go up flairs to bed.

I told them I would not go to bed in that houſe.— They both went to bed ſome time after in the ſame room, and I walked about the room all night, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I ſaid it did not ſignify their pretending to keep me, for I would not ſtay. He pretended again to write to my father. I told him it did not ſignify, for nothing he could do ſhould keep me there. With that he aſſured me that he meant nothing but honour, for he loved me to diſtraction: That he could not part with me, and I muſt ſtay. I told him I would not ſtay upon any account; he ſaid he would write to my father, and when my father came, he would make ſuch propoſals to my father as I thould like; and if I did not like them and like to ſtay, I ſhould go home with my father: with that he wrote. I do not know what anſwer I made to him, and I was ſo much diſturbed, I can't recollect what he wrote.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing particularly but they pulling me away, and ſaid I ſhould not ſtand there. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on Thurſday, Mrs. Griffinburg, or ſomebody, had ordered the windows in the room where I had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the night, to be nailed up.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know who ordered them, of my own knowledge. With that Lord Baltimore came in, and pretended to be in a great paſſion, with Mrs. Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finburg, and ſaid, what did ſhe mean by ordering the windows to be nailed up, to make his ſervants think he was going to murder ſomebody, or do ſomething bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the windows muſt be nailed up. He turned to me, and ſaid, madam, I aſſure you if you offer to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a window, or make any diſturbance any other way, I will f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that may-be he might murder me. This was before ſupper. I went on in the ſame manner, pleading and crying; I don't know that I ſtopt crying all that day. They ſupped together, but there was no ſervants: I neither eat nor drank. After ſupper, when time was come to go up ſtairs, I ſaid, I would not go up till he had promiſed that he would not meddle with me, nor come near me. He promiſed he would not, and went
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010919_0016_0F852919DF3F6F78"/>away. Some time after that, I was led again up the ſame back ſtairs, into the ſame back room.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Harvey, or Mrs. Griffinburgh, I don't know which; I believe both of them. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated me very much to go to bed; I told them I would go to no bed in that houſe; I would neither eat nor drink, if they kept me there ever ſo long; they went to bed, and left me. I walked about the room in the ſame manner all night, in the greateſt diſtreſs poſſible, and in the morning waked them with my crying. They then aſked me how I could make ſuch a piece of work; they never heard a perſon make ſuch a crying, or ſaw ſuch diſtreſs in their lives. With that I told them, I thought I had great reaſon for it, when I was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all that was near and dear to me in the world. I did aſſure them, that I would not ſtay there, and they ſhould not keep me upon any account; for that I would never yield to his baſe purpoſes. With that, Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſaid, ſhe did not ſuppoſe he wanted to do any thing againſt my will. I told her, if he did not, what was the reaſon that he kept me there from day to day, and would not let me go home? I told her I would not ſtay, or yield to his baſe purpoſes, if he would give me his houſe full of ſilver and gold—This was up in the room, if I remember right. She ſaid, ſhe did not ſuppoſe he would do any thing againſt my will, or keep me againſt my will. I told her, he never would keep me with my will, for it never would be my will to ſtay there; and that if he would marry me, and ſettle all his eſtate upon me, I never would have him, for I hated him, and ever ſhould; and therefore begged he would not keep me in that priſon of hell, for it was a priſon of hell indeed!</p>

               <p>Some time after this, I went down ſtairs again into the ſame room where I was before. He came to me; I was in the very ſame diſtreſs as I was before; it was before breakfaſt; and I told him, though he had no compaſſion on me—I aſked him if he had ever been a father; if he had, he might have ſome compaſſion for my father: if he was a father himſelf, ſurely he muſt conſider my father, what he muſt feel for the loſs of a child that he loved, and could not tell where ſhe was; whether ſhe was dead or alive. I told him, not only ſo,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010919_0017_0F85291A95C41908"/>but that we were engaged in buſineſs, and they could not carry on the buſineſs without me. With that, he ſaid, he had been more careful in that reſpect than I had, for he had ſent my father ſomething, that his buſineſs might not ſtop. I told him, that would be of no uſe, for they could make no uſe of it till I came. He ſaid with that, I ſhould write to my father myſelf. I told him, if I did, it would be to no purpoſe, for I ſuppoſed I muſt write juſt what he pleaſed; and if he did not like it, he would not ſend it, let me write whatever I would. He ſaid, yes he would, and I ſhould write. I ſaid, I ſuppoſed he would ſtand over me all the time. He ſaid, no, he would go away; but he left the two women ſtanding over me; therefore he might as well have ſtay'd himſelf.</p>

               <p>Standing cloſe to me, to ſee how I acted, and take care of me; this was upon Friday, about the middle of the day.

               <p>I ſaid that he had uſed me with as much honour as I could expect, and begged they would come immediately. After I had wrote theſe two or three lines, the two women ſaid, he had ſent my father two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds the day before, and that I ought to put it in, and know if they had it: that they ſhould return thanks for it. I told them I would not do any ſuch thing, for I can'd nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Both jointly, and I refuſed it ſeveral times. After that they went and aſked Lord Baltimore, whether it ſhould be to or not; he came in and ſaid he did not care much about it, but I might, if I would, put it in; ſo I wrote that they told me they had ſent two hundred pounds, and I deſired to know if he had it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I think your expreſſion was, that you put into your letter more than truth; how came you to do that?</p>

               <p>For the reaſon I ſaid before; that I knew he would not ſend it, if I did not ſay ſomething in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him. In an hour or two after that, there came up one of the ſervants, I forget which, and ſaid that a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010919_0018_0F85291CD744DD08"/>gentleman had brought a letter, which Lord Baltimore brought in, and ſaid it came from Richard Smith; and that my father had been there, and would not ſtay till I and he could be ſent for. With that I ſaid, I would not believe any thing of it. I did believe it was his own forging, for it was wrote in another language. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to read it to me, but I told h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it was nothing at all, for he could read it as he lik'd. With that he ſaid he would ſend for the man, and make me a liar. I ſaid he could not, but he would make the man ſay as he pleaſed, and could talk to him in another language. The man was brought. I told him if he would let me aſk the man queſtions, then I would believe, if he gave me ſatisfactory anſwers. He ſaid I could confound the whole world; I told him I did not know but I might, if they did not ſpeak truth. The man came in and ſat down, and he ſpoke to him ſomething firſt in another language; it was not Engliſh I know; and then ſaid, did not you bring this letter? he anſwered, Yes. I told him I did not believe he did; the more, becauſe he had been talking to him in another language. I aſked him what ſort of a man it was came to him. He ſaid a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling man. I aſked him what he called a middling man; he ſaid a taliſh man. I aſked whether he was old or young, and what ſort of a face he had, but he could give me no ſatisfactory anſwer to any thing I ſaid. I then ſaid to Lord Baltimore, who is a liar now, you or me? I ſaid they were a parcel of popiſh, rubbiſhing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I would not believe any thing they ſaid to me, (for I thought Lord Baltimore had been a French man and a Papiſt.)</p>

               <p>He paſſed for Richard Smith. My Lord Baltimore played upon the muſick, Richard Smith and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010919_0019_0F85291D96A1B768"/>Mrs. Harvey danced, and I walked about the room in the greateſt diſtreſs. After that they took me to look at the pictures; and there was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ip in diſtreſs. I told them that was my picture. They ſaid no, and took me to another picture of a ſhip in a ſtorm, and told me that was my picture. Then they led me back into the room again. They all ſat down before the ſire, and I ſat down with them. He ſaid to this Richard Smith, as ſoon as he had ſat down, he ſhould draw Miſs's picture. I ſaid he ſhould do no ſuch thing; I ſhould not think of having my picture drawn. He drew my picture in the poſture I ſat crying, in this manner <stage>(<hi>deſcribing it, with her head leaning upon her hand;</hi>)</stage> they did not put the tears into the picture.</p>

               <p>Nothing more particular. About twelve at night it was pretended that the little Jew man that firſt took me away, was ſent with that letter that I wrote. Broughton came in, who was called the ſtewart, (that is one that anſwered to that name) and brought word that my father had ſtopt the Jew. Lord Baltimore was in a violent paſſion, and ſwore he would go and pull my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the noſe. I deſired he would give me leave to ſpeak a word or two: that I was very ſure my father had done no ſuch thing, for he had not ſpirit enough for it. While I was ſpeaking, in came the other man, the Jew that I had ſeen at firſt, Iſaacs; he brought a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he ſaid he had brought from my friends; and told me they were all well ſatisfied and pleaſed, and ſo put the letter into my hands. It was wrote by my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my ſiſter writing ſo ſeldom, I did not know her hand at firſt; but turning the other ſide of the letter, I found the ſeal to be the young man's that courted me, Mr. Davis, which couſirmed me it was come from them, which was the firſt word I knew that came from them.</p>

               <p>It was, as near as I can remember, this: Only pleaſe to appoint a place when and where we may meet you. It was directed to me if I remember right. This was about twelve at night: time was come that I muſt go up ſtairs, which I would not do till he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me he would not meddle with me, nor come near me. I went up ſtairs to the ſame room where I went before, and Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg came up to the ſame room, and preſſed me very much to go to bed. I ſtill cried, and ſaid I would not; but finding
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010919_0020_0F85291E570478A8"/>my ſtrength was gone, I ſaid, may be I will lie down ſometime in the night in my cloaths.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I lay down in about half an hour after Mrs. Griffinburg was gone; and ſhe coming up about half an hour after frightened me, for I thought it was Lord Baltimore coming up, which ſet me in ſuch a tremble, that I was obliged to get up; then I walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſo laid down again, and ſo I went on all the night in great diſtreſs: then I talked to Mrs. Harvey, and aſked her if ſhe had ever been in love: I think ſhe ſaid yes, I am not poſitive: with that I told her, then I was engaged; that a young man kept me company, and we were about ſettling; that he had a great regard for me, and that I could not ſay but I had the ſame for him, and therefore begged her to think how hard it muſt be in my caſe.</p>

               <p>Yes; and that I could not bear any of their ways; and that if Lord Baltimore would ſettle all his eſtate on me I would not comply, and a great deal of ſuch diſcourſe, which I can't now recollect; but begged that ſhe would lay it before my Lord, and intreat him to let me go; for I thought, if ſhe would lay the caſe before him, and tell him how it was, he would let me go. I ſaid, I dare ſay, if ſhe had a mind, ſhe could let me go herſelf. She ſaid, no; tho' ſhe had known the houſe ſo long, ſhe did not know the way out of the houſe. With my crying, and being in ſuch an agony and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, ſhe got up ſooner than common, and we went down ſtairs; but when we came to the bottom of the ſtairs every door was locked, and we could get no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we were therefore forced to go up ſtairs, and were upwards of an hour before we could get into the room, where there was a ſire below ſtairs, where we were before.</p>

               <p>I think about eight or nine o'clock. I pleaded the ſame arguments with him as I had done with Harvey, and told him about this ſame young man. With that he flew into a violent paſſion, and called me all the hitches and whores he could think of, and throwed the news-paper at me; and told me, if I offered to tell him any thing more about another man, he would fling me out of the window, or tie my petticoats about my head, and ſend me home in a wheelbarrow. The little Jew was preſent, Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg, and he ſaid to the Jew, carry the ſlut to a mean houſe, like her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. With that I was terrified very much, and thought he meant a bawdy-houſe. He flew out of the room in a great paſtion, and left the little Jew, Harvey and Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finburg. They perſuaded me to be reconciled. They ſaid, had he not promiſed he would ſend for my father, and make ſuch propoſals as he would like; and if I did not like them, I ſhould go home again, and had I not better leave it to him. With that the little Jew came and told me, that all my friends, and Mr. Davis in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, were well pleaſed. I told him I was ſure it was a very great ſtory, therefore begged he would not ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother word about it; but with their perſuaſions, and fearing he would ſend me to a bawdy-houſe, I deſired Lord Baltimore might be called in. He came in. I told him, if my father came, and terms were offered him, I would conſider them, and begged that God would direct me. This was on Saturday about noon: after this I was very ill, and could hold up my head no longer.</p>

               <p>No; only a diſh of tea that morning. With that he came to me, and told me, by that means I put it out of my power to help myſelf in that which I was ſo afraid of; and then he went and mixed a draught and brought it me, and ſaid, I muſt take it. I refuſed it, ſearing there might be ſomething hurtful in it. He ſaid there was nothing hurtful in it, and I muſt take it. I did. This was about two or three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Nothing particular. I lay in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with my head upon the elbow chair, till nine o'clock. Nothing particular paſſed that evening. At the uſual time he ſaid we muſt go to bed again: I got a little more ſpirits, but I ſaid I would not go till he had promiſed not to come near nor meddle with me: he ſaid he would lead me up ſtairs, which he did: when he had got there, he deſired me much to go to bed, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. Griffinburg, before I went up, to make me ſome whey: I believe between two and three o'clock, as well as I can recollect, ſhe brought me ſome red wine, and I drank a little of it, and eat a bit of a toaſt: this was in the morning: I had not laid down then: this was between two and three o'clock on Sunday morning: I had laid down in my cloaths.</p>

I deſired they would bring me a bible, and I would prove to him that there was all. With that the bible was brought, and I proved to him from the word as much as was in my power, that there was a God, a devil, heaven and hell: and after that I concluded my diſcourſe, which was from two or three in the afternoon till nine at night, with very little intermiſſion.</p>

               <p>I believe that day I might eat a bit; I am not ſure. I told him my reaſon of having ſo long a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and being ſo plain with him, was to convince him of the difference there was between him and me; and that he might be aſſured it was impoſſible I ſhould comply, and that I would not ſtay upon any account whatever, and therefore begged he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

After ſupper they all went out of the room; that is, Dr. Griffinburg, Mrs. Harvey, and Mrs. Griffin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, went out, and left him and me alone. Then he began to ſhow indecencies: he firſt pulled me into his lap. This was about nine o'clock on Sunday night, and wanted to put his hand in my boſom, which I would not let him, and got out of his arms. Then I was ſet down in the other chair, he began to open his breeches again, and ſtrove to pull my hand to him. I ſtruggled and got away, and got up; then he preſſed me to one corner of the room, and there preſſed me up againſt the wainſcot, as if he would preſs me to death. I ſtruggled and got from him; then he got me down in an elbow chair; he opened his breeches, and ſtrove to pull my petticoats up.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010919_0024_0F85292263C856E0"/>I ſtruggled, and cried out all I could, and begged and pleaded with him that he would take my life, for I would never yield the other to any one, but upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms, which was marriage. He then got up and walked about the room awhile, and then ſet me down, and ſerved me in the ſame manner, but did not compleat his baſe purpoſe at that time. This, I believe was near two hours. I ſtruggled and cried all I could. Then he called in Mrs. Harvey, and ſaid we muſt go up to bed; and he ſaid he would lead me up ſtairs, which terrified me greatly. I did not know what I ſhould do with myſelf, leaſt he ſhould fling me upon the bed when he got me up ſtairs. Mrs. Harvey made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: ſhe ſaid ſhe had forgot ſomething, and muſt go down again. I was afraid they had juggled it between them, and begged and pleaded he would not meddle with me. He began as before to open his breeches, and ſtrove to pull up my petticoats. Soon after Mrs. Harvey came into the room again, and he told me, if I did not undreſs myſelf that night, and go into bed, he would force me to go into bed with him. He went away; and I went to bed with Mrs. Harvey. This was on Sunday night. All this night I had no reſt: I did not go to ſleep any part of the night, as I know of. I ſtarted up and cryed, O, he is coming! he is coming! with that I again pleaded with Mrs. Harvey, to perſuade him to let me go home. I met with no ſucceſs, as ſhe was juſt as relentleſs as ever. This was on Monday morning. When I came down ſtairs I was in the ſame manner. I went on crying as uſual, praying that I might go home, or ſee my friends.</p>

               <p>I ceaſed very little indeed, by and by he came to me and ſaid, if I would go and have my face waſhed, and another cap on, and clean things, and leave crying, I ſhould ſee my father; but if I would not I ſhould never ſee him; for what could my father think to ſee me in that dirty condition, and my eyes ſo bad with crying. I had had no change of linen. I went up ſtairs with that view. He ſaid, if I would go up he would ſend for my father, and I ſhould ſee him. He then ſaid, now you ſhall ſee your father to day. I had put on ſome linen, with my own gown and petticoats.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>Mrs. Griffinburg brought it. Then he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010919_0025_0F852922DBBEE7C0"/>ſaid I ſhould ſee my father, I ſhould go and take an air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the coach, and that would divert me a little. I told him that would be no pleaſure to me. If he would carry me to ſee my father, that would be a pleaſure to me. With that he ſaid I ſhould go and take an airing, and ſee my father when I came back. Soon after this they brought word the coach was ready, and that I maſt go. He led me down ſtairs, into the coach. It was in the yard at the door.</p>

               <p>I don't know. He handed me into the coach himſelf. He then got in: Mrs. Harvey and he ſat on one ſide, and Dr. Griffinburgh and his wife ſat on the other ſide. He bade Mrs. Harvey ſit forward, againſt the door. I ſat between my Lord and Mrs. Harvey.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know exactly. They drove out of the gate with ſuch violence, that they tore off part of the gate by that means.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>It did not cauſe the leaſt ſtoppage. They went through the ſtreets over Weſtminſter-bridge. They had like to have been overturned, they went with ſuch violence. They had like to have been overturned within three or four doors of the houſe. As near as I can recollect, this was about two o'clock. When we came to Weſtminſter-bridge, or before, I can't juſtly ſay, I ſaid, I hoped he was not going to carry me far, that he was not going abroad. He ſaid no, he was only taking an airing to divert me, and that he ſhould come back again to dinner. When we came ſome way farther, and I ſaw the four and five mile ſtones, I ſaid I hoped he was not going to carry me abroad. He ſaid, yes, to be ſure, he was going to carry me to Spain, to ſee the Spaniards. We put on. I aſked him again, and he ſaid the ſame. When we got to Epſom, he ſaid, now we are come to Spain, and theſe are the Spaniards. There were two or three men in the ſtreets.</p>

               <p>I ſaw the poſt to direct to Epſom. When they came to Epſom they began to talk about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try houſe. Then I began to think we were going there. When we came to the houſe they aſked me how I liked it. I told them that was a worſe priſon than the other,

               <p>They went to dinner ſoon after we were in. It was about four o'clock.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>In the country there were two men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants waited at table. I did eat a very little bit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing, that I can recollect, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. After dinner Mrs. Griffinburg, Dr. Griffinburg, and Mrs. Harvey, went out of the room. He then took me behind the window-curtain, and began to ſhew the ſame indecencies as before. I pleaded much with him, and ſtruggled all I could, and begged and prayed that he would take my life away. I told him I would give that up freely, but never would the other. With that, he ſaid it muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſo that night, whether I would or no. Then they came in again. They took me out of that room into ſome other rooms, to ſee the houſe. I told them I thought it was the worſt ſight I ever ſaw. They then told me it muſt be ſo that night: Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg, told me ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>No. I was in great diſtreſs, and cried very much. After this they came in again, and I drank tea with them. Nothing particular paſſed at tea. After tea they went up ſtairs again. Lord Baltimore ſaid, they muſt do ſomething to divert themſelves; that they would play at blindman's buff, and I ſhould play with them. I ſaid I could not play at blindman's buff, I would do no ſuch thing. He ſaid I ſhould not always ſit in that manner. I was crying, and he ſwang me round the room, and ſaid I ſhould play with them. One of the women was blinded, and one of them pretended ſhe had catched me; with that I ſaid poſitively I would not be blinded. I ſat down and cryed again. As ſoon as he ſaw that, he came and ſet down by me, and ſtrove
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010919_0027_0F852929230C4A40"/>to make me look at him. Nothing would make me forget my trouble. I ſtill kept crying, and pleading with God, that he would take me out of time into eternity.</p>

               <p>I don't know whether they heard me or no. After this they went to ſupper, but before they went to ſupper the two women and he himſelf all joined together and ſaid, I might as well do it quietly, for it muſt be ſo that night. This was ſome time before ſupper.</p>

               <p>No. I eat a little bit, but drank no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for fear they had put ſomething it it. After ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he ordered them to go to bed; with that they led me out of the room. I was crying. They led me into the bedchamber. The two women began to undreſs me.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I was in ſuch a tremble and fright, that I had no ſtrength left; therefore I was not able to reſiſt them, but cryed, and begged, and pleaded, that God would take away my life, and preſerve me from that wicked creature. Dr. Griffinburg ſaid (he was by then, I did not know it till he ſpoke) he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, O, my dear Miſs Sally, don't cry ſo, don't take on ſo, it will be all well by and by. Mrs. Harvey ſaid ſhe never ſaw any one make ſuch a piece of work in her life: if I was going to be killed I could not do more. I told her I had much rather be killed. I cryed and took on in a very ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, and pleaded much with God to take me out of time into eternity. Then they led me out of that room into the next, and ſet me down in the elbow chair.</p>

               <p>My cap was pulled off, but the reſt were only unpinned, and ſuch like; with that they ſet me down and pulled all the reſt of my things off, and put me into the bed. When the curtains were open I ſaw that Lord Baltimore was in bed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>No, they had forced me a-top of the

               <p>He turned upon me with all the force he could, and forced himſelf between me, and ſaid he would get into me; with that he lay upon me all the weight he could, and ſtrove to puſh himſelf into me with all his might; and I cried and ſtruggled all I could, but he held my mouth together with his fingers, that I might not cry; and ſtrove to lie over me, ſo much as to ſmother me. When he had been ſometime in me, I felt ſomething come from him; and then he turned off from me as he came on, and left me to live or die as I could. He ſaid nothing to me all night. I laid in ſuch a fright and ſuch a tremble, for fear he ſhould come to me again, I ſweat that the drops ran off from me. In the morning he turned upon me in the ſame manner, and uſed me in the ſame manner. I cried out as I had done before, and made all the ſtuggle I could. He ſaid he never heard ſuch a noiſe in his life; I ſhould raiſe the whole houſe. After this he aſked me if I wanted the pot? I ſaid, yes. I got out of bed, I don't know how, and there came a great quantity of blood from me. I ſtrove to get on my things, and to get away, I was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid for fear he ſhould pull me in again, that I got a few of my things on in a looſe manner; and he ſaid I could not get out, but muſt ſtay till he let me out.</p>

               <p>Into the next room, where Mrs. Harvey was, I was not dreſt. I ſat down and cried. Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey got up.

I told her no, I ſhould ever hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every thing of the kind; if that was to be my life, it would be a burthen indeed; but I hoped I ſhould not live long. Finding ſhe anſwered me in a rough manner, I thought with myſelf, that I had loſt every thing that was dear to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010919_0029_0F85292BC8D84C28"/>me, but my life, how ſhould I do to ſave that?

By ſtanding at the windows, I thought that ſome time or other I might ſee my friends.

               <p>One of them was, the other came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010919_0030_0F85292BE8E1ED58"/>I took no notice, nor he neither, no farther than this; my Lord ſaid I was not wen, and I muſt take a powder, (this was before breakfaſt, before I had eat any). While we were at breakfaſt, he ſaid to Mrs. Harvey, Miſs wants ſomething, does ſhe not? She ſaid, yes, Sir, ſhe wants ſome clean linen. He ſaid, you ſhall go to Epſom and buy Miſs ſome muſlin for aprons, and things, and ſhe ſhall work, and that will divert her mind from ſitting and thinking. While Mrs. Harvey was gone, he ſaid I ſhould go and take an airing in a boat. This was Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning. I told him I had never been upon water, and ſo was afraid. I had never been upon the water, but only croſſed our little river at Cambridge.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I did.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Cox.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Where?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I went out of the houſe. He ſaid I muſt run, for ſear I ſhould get cold. I did. When I came to the canal, I was all in a tremble, and did not know how to go in, for I was afraid. When I came in, the bottom of the boat was very full of water. I thought that was a very unfit place. I thought it would have killed me, but I thought I was as willing to die as live, therefore I would go. When I was upon the water, he ſaid it would ſit me for going abroad: this increaſed my fears that I had had before. Then, if I remember right, Mrs. Griffinburg ſaid we will take a walk in the park. I then ſaid, if we did, I ſhould be glad to go to ſuch a place, becauſe I fancied there was a foot-path and a gate that way to go out of the park, becauſe the way they brought me had no foot-path near it; therefore I thought, if I could any ways eſcape, I could not go that way, ſo wanted to ſee if this other gate would lead me out; but whether ſhe came at my thoughts or not, I cannot tell, but we did not go a ſixth part of the way, I believe.— Then we came in again, and Mrs. Harvey, ſome time after this, came home, and brought a hat, and ſome white ribbons to put on the hat, and ſome pink ribbon, which ſhe ſaid ſhe had bought for a night ribbon. With that Lord Baltimore ſaid he liked the pink ribbon beſt upon the hat. With that I ſaid, if he liked that beſt I would put it on, for the ſame reaſon as before, that I ſaid I would do any thing in my power that was imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; ſo I put on the pink ribbon. When we went up ſtairs again, ſhe ſaid ſhe would have the white ribbons
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010919_0031_0F85292C9B7079A0"/>tied up for favours for a wedding. I ſaid I ſhould not think of ſuch a thing as a wedding, indeed. She inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it. She made up one for herſelf, and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and fixed it to my breaſt, but whether ſhe pinned it I do not know. Then we came down again, and ſhe ſaid to Mrs. Griffinburg, how fine we were, and that ſhe ſhould have one too; therefore when I came back they made me tie up one for her. At night he brought me the Spectator to read, which, when I found ſomething ſerious in it, he came and took it away, and gave ſome of Dr. Swift's works, which was very fooliſh and abſurd, that I would not read it: I ſaid it was nonſenſe and ſtuff. That was all I remember that night. He did not deſire me to go to bed to him that night. I went to bed to Mrs. Harvey.</p>

               <p>I believe you made no application to Mrs. Harvey after this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>No; as they would not let me go before, I knew they would not let me go after. There was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother circumſtance which I believe I forgot, that was this: He (Lord Baltimore) ſaid one day, (I believe on Friday) that if he was to be ſo ſooliſh as to let me go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my fooliſh defire, did I think my friends would take me in? I told him yes, I knew my friends knew me very well, and would take me in; but if they would not, that ſhould be no excuſe to him, for I would beg my bread from door to door rather than ſtay there. He ſaid I ſhould go and expoſe him finely indeed. I told him if he would let me go then I would not. He aſked me if I would promiſe him? I ſaid I would. He aſked me, if I would take an oath? I ſaid I would, upon the Bible, and I would keep it. For this reaſon I did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune Mrs Harvey, becauſe I knew ſhe would not let me go; for as I knew he was afraid I ſhould expoſe him before, I knew he might be afraid I ſhould expoſe him now. Afterwards, I only importuned every day that I might go to London again to ſee my friends. I impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned Dr. Griffinburg, and all of them, as they were preſent.</p>

               <p>We took an airing again in the cloſe boat on the water in the evening of that day. Juſt at tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time there came in two gentlemen and a lady that had been ſent for from London, as I underſtood. After they had drank tea, he called for a ſheet, which ſurpriſed me a good deal, and I was afraid they were going to play
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010919_0032_0F85292D70C94DB8"/>at ſome miſchief, but I found ſome time after that they were going to act the magie lanthorn. While they were acting the magic lanthorn, they hung up ſeveral ſheets acroſs the room, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> went and danced behind it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>But while they were acting this, the lady that came down from London ſaid, that is Lord Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more that is acting the old man. There was a perſon acting the part of an old man. With that I was glad to hear the name, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did not. Next morning, which was Thurſday, I intreated Dr. Griffinburg that he would aſk my Lord to let us go to London again. He ſaid he would. He went, and came ſome time after to me, and told me we were to go home that day; but I was not ſatisfied till I ſaw the coach that we were to go to London in. That day, the women went out into the park, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run, and defired me to run along with them, which I did a little way; but I ſtrove to drop them, which they did not let me, but came up with me.</p>

               <p>Nothing particular, only I was fearful I ſhould be obliged to go to bed to him, and was very much terrified. We went up the back way into the ſame room we was at firſt; then Mrs. Harvey ſaid I muſt go to bed to Lord Baltimore. I ſaid I would not do any ſuch thing. She ſaid I muſt go, to be ſure; had not I been before? I ſaid I would do no ſuch thing. I then made another excuſe apphcable to my ſex, and deſired that ſhe would go and beg me off, but ſhe would not go, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went myſelf rather than go to bed. I went to him
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010919_0033_0F85292E23F1A518"/>and told him, and he gave me leave to go to bed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. I lay that night along with Mrs. Harvey.</p>

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I was very dull as uſual. I dont know whether I cried or no, but was very dull. By and by, towards noon, I believe, he ſaid he would introduce me to the other part of the family; and then he told me, if I would be quiet a few days longer, and make myſelf ſatisfied and eaſy, and not tell any of the family what had paffed between him and me, I ſhould ſee my father, and if I liked to live with my father beſt, we ſhould have a houſe and live together. He had put ſome money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hand, and told me, after I had ſeen my father I ſhould go where I pleaſed, do as I liked lay out the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as I choſe, and if I liked to go to meeting I ſhould go. He ordered my hat and cloak to be brought down, and then he went in and fetched a woman which they call Madam Saunier, or ſome ſuch name, and told her that there was a lady come to be a companion to the young ladies. He told her I was a very religious lady, and ſomething of that kind. She ſaid ſhe would take care of me.</p>

He was in bed. She want into the room, but did not ſtay. He aſked me to come to bed: I told him no, I would not. He aſſured me if I would come to bed he would not meddle with me, he would only lie by my ſide. I told him I would not, over and over; at laſt he inſiſted upon it that I ſhould come; and knowing chey would ute force if I did not do it, I went into bed. As ſoon as I had got into bed he jumped out of bed and ſetched the candle; and when he had done ſo, he ſtrove to tear up my ſhift to ſee my nakedneſs; I ſtruggled with all my might, and would not let him get a full fight: I cried out, and ſtruggled all I could. With that, he expoſed himſelf in the ſame manner, and wanted me to look at him; but I would not. After that he went and ſet the candle down again, and then he came and ſtrove to do the ſame things again.</p>

               <p>It was ſtrictly true. I went into that room where I was at firſt, and they brought me up ſome gauz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and petticoats, and ſaid I muſt chuſe ſome; but he had fixed upon the colour of the petticoat himſelf; and as for the gauzes, I told her I did not care, ſhe might take which ſhe pleaſed.

               <p>No. Mrs. Griffinburg deſired I would take the work and work with the ladies. I took an apron and ruffles to make; and there was a lady to drink tea that day; after tea, Lord Baltimore ſaid, he thought the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould go te cards. The eldelt Miſs entreated me very much to play, but I refuſed, and ſaid I could not: I did not chuſe it. As ſoon as they had got to play, I retired to the next room; Mrs. Griffinburg came unto me, and told me ſhe wanted me to ſee the apartment ſhe had been preparing for me, for that I could not have that room I was in in the morning; thereſore ſhe carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me up into a ſtone garret: it ſeemed to be all ſtone; it was very cold, and ſtruck like a well, and was among all the fervants, that I was very much frightened and uneafy about it.</p>

I was very much frightened and uneaſy, and thought it very odd I could not have a better room in ſuch a houſe as that. I was afraid that now he had done with me himſelf, that he did intend I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to any body that he might ſend. Upon that I told Mrs. Griffinburg that I durſt not lie there; ſhe, upon that, ſaid, to oblige me, ſhe would bring up a little bed, and He there a night or two.

On Sunday I kept up in the garret, and they came often and diſturbed me, that I could have no reſt any where. I came down ſtairs to breakfaſt, and then went up again, and came down again to dinner; and after dinner I ſtood up at the window, and as I was sſtanding up at the window, (this was the corner win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and looked toward Hampſtead) as I was ſtanding, I thought I ſaw Mr. Davis. the perſon to whom I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>

               <p>Two more ladies that came to dinner that day, Madam Saunier, and the governeſs and the two children, and myſelf; they ſix were ſtanding up at the fire ſide while I went to the window; there I ſaw Mr. Davis; and when I firſt ſaw him I was ſo ſtruck I could not tell how to ſtand; and fearing that he ſhould not ſee me, when he looked up I thought he did not know me; but he went behind a wall towards the Foundling Hoſpital, and there peeped two or three times, till I was ſure he knew me. He took a book out of his pocket, and made a motion with his hand for me to write; with that I waved my hand for him to come further, but he did not underſtand me; therefore, when I went to the next window, at firſt ſight I loſt him, but ſeeing him again, I waved my hand for him to come further, and then I ran into the next room, which was the room Lord Baltimore generally ſat in; but I ran in hap hazard, without thinking whether he was there or no, and called out to him in great agony, I cannot come to you! I cannot come to you! This was the other corner room, the weſt ſide of the houſe; I croſſed the room the bow-window is in, to go to that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010919_0037_0F85293115D14FD8"/>room. He ſaid are you well? But I prevented him, by aſking, is my father well! He ſaid Yes, he is well, and we are all well; he ſaid then, how do you do? Then he ſaid, where is Mrs. Harvey? I ſaid I knew nothing of her. He then ſaid, is all well? With that I was ready to drop: I ſaid, good bye, and ſhut down the window.</p>

               <p>I feared ſome of the women would come; and before I could get out of the room Lord Baltimore came in. I was ſo flurried and was all in a tremble, that I did not ſpeak to him as he came in, nor he to me. After this I intreated the maid to get me a pen, ink, and paper, and bring it up into my room, meaning the garret, and not tell any body of it, becauſe I wanted it to amuſe me. I lay in the garret that night, and next morning ſhe brought me a pen and ink. I began to write imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to my father, but was ſo prevented that I could not go on with my letter: this is a part of it <stage>(<hi>produced</hi>)</stage> I did not throw it out of the window: This was on Monday morning. While I was writing this letter, Mrs. Griffinburg came, and ſaid the milliner had brought me ſome caps; I ſaid I did not care to come down: I told Mrs. Griffinburg ſhe might take what ſhe pleaſed; ſhe ſaid, I muſt go down: With that, I went to the milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſhe had brought ſome caps and cloaks: With that, I took one that I thought looked the decenteſt, and that was all; Mrs. Griffinburgh intreated me very much to ſpeak for more things: and ſaid I muſt have ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prons. I aſked the woman if ſhe had any flowered muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; ſhe ſaid, ſhe would bring it when ſhe came again; that was the ſubſtance of what paſſed then. I went and I had my breakfaſt with the family; Then I went up into my garret again, and Mrs. Griffinburg came after me. I aſked where my Lord was? ſhe aſked if I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him? I told her, yes. I wanted to know if ever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended I ſhould ſee my friends again; for I could not bear to live ſo. She deſired I would take my work and go down ſtairs; which accordingly I did: And ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I came in, Lord Baltimore came in, and clapt me upon the ſhoulder, as I ſat with my back to the door; and told me he was coming to tell me ſomething that would pleaſe me very much, that I ſhould ſee my father that day without fail: With this, to be ſure I was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and went up ſtairs with intent to put my things on. Mrs. Griffinburgh followed me, and ſaid my father, was ſent for to come to her houſe, and that I muſt make
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010919_0038_0F852931DD31B970"/>haſte, and go directly; for he would be there before I could get there; ſhe helped to put on my things; and I came down ſtairs into the room next the Foundling Hoſpital; there was a lady that had been there the day before. Lord Baltimore began to tell her what a religious lady I was; and that he was ſorry for many things he had ſaid to me. What his reaſon was for this I don't know, except he thought I ſhould expoſe him too much. Some time after this, he led me into another room; and when he got me there, he ſaid I now was going to ſee my father; that he was ſent for, and I was going to Mrs. Griffinburg's to meet him. He told me I muſt ſay I was willing to ſtay; and if I would tell my father I was ſatisfied and eaſy, he would do any thing for me that I deſired: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>My meaning was this, Sir, that I might put him into ſome way of geting me away, if I could not get away with him; then he ſaid, I ſhould take the little Miſs, and I ſhould ſay to my father, I was a companion of that lady; to that I only ſaid, very well: Then we were ſent on to Mrs. Griffinburg's houſe, with an intent to meet my father, in Dean ſtreet, Soho; I went to this houſe; when I was there, I ſaid to Mrs. Griffinburg, I thought you ſaid my father would be here, before I ſhould get here; but I ſee you have deceived me, as you have done all along. She ſaid he would come preſently. In about two hours after this, or rather more, Lord Baltimore and Dr. Griffinburg came. As ſoon as he came in, I ſaid, I thought you told me I was to ſee my father; but I ſee you have deceived me, as you have all along; and I ſee I ſhall not ſee my ſather to-night; he ſaid, yes, you ſhall: But what do you think has happened? Your father has taken up Mrs. Harvey, and put her into the round-houſe: This gave me ſome pleaſure, but I dared not ſhew it; I did not know what to anſwer; at laſt, I ſaid, I did not ſuppoſe that would do any good, for ſhe would not tell where I was: Soon after this, in came another man, and ſaid, Lord Baltimore's houſe was beſet with Juſtice Fielding's men: He fell into a paſſion, and ſaid my father muſt be a fine man indeed, to ſet to work ſuch rogues as Juſtice Fielding, and his men, were, that they were the greateſt
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010919_0039_0F85293296031DD8"/>rognes that could be. I was frightened, and thought my life and my friends were in danger, becauſe he was in ſuch a rage; and I was afraid, having much about the ſame opinion of him, that he had of Juſtice Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that may-be he might ſend ſome of his men and ſet the homſe on fire, or do ſome miſchief. After this there was a great demur about Mrs. Harvey's being at the round-houſe, and how they ſhould get at her, and get her bailed: Sometime after this, I found that Mrs. Griffinburg had been to ſet if ſhe could come at her; Mrs. Griffinburg ſaid ſo, that ſhe could not; with that they were in a great taking, in what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Lord Baltimore, and Dr. and Mrs. Griffinburg; then I ſtudied what I ſhould ſay and do: At laſt, I ſaid, that if they had got Mrs. Harvey (I ſpoke to Lord Baltimore) they might depend upon it, they would never deliever her up, till I was ſet at liberty: I told them, if they had a mind Mrs. Harvey ſhould be ſet free, it muſt be me that could do it; and if they would let me ſee my father, and I could ſettle things to my mind, I could releaſe her if I pleaſed. In two or three hours they got a man to go, upon account of ſpeaking Engliſh: they ſaid, if Dr. Griffinburg went, they ſuppoſed that the old man (meaning my father) would think he ſhould be run away with: Then they got ſome tradeſman to go along with them to carry the letter, which I had then wrote, if I remember right, at Dr. Griffinburg's, to my father.</p>

               <p>The intent of it was for my father to come to me: We went then to Whitechapel; I went in a coach with Lord Baltimore, Dr. Griffinburg, this man, the Doctor's niece, and the little girl: This was on Monday.</p>

               <p>I ſaw one run on the ſide of the coach as I went; it was Pierini, they call him the valet de cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre: We ment to a tavern; I cannot ſay what it was; I believe I ſhould know it again, if I ſaw it: There was only a little boy that led the way up to a back room: When we came there, this man, the tradefinan, was ſent with the letter to my father: He came back and brought word, that my father had been out ever ſince nine in the morning, in ſearch of me, and brought the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010919_0040_0F852933580AF3F8"/>letter back. I was very loth to go back again; I did not know what to do. I wrote to the landlord of our houſe, to tell my father to be as eaſy as he could; for I would ſend for him next morning at ten, as Lord Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore told me I ſhould: At that time at the tavern he told me I ſhould ſend for him in the morning: It was the land-lord of my father's houſe, whoſe name is Berry. The tradelman brought word back again, my father was not come home as yet; ſo Lord Baltimore would go back again, and ſaid, he ſuppoſed they were making a fine piece of work at the other end of the town. We went back; and when we came to Covent-Garden, the coach ſtopped, and the tradeſman got out, and went to Juſtice Fielding's, according to their orders.</p>

               <p>He did, along with Juſtice Fielding's clerk, who brought a card, with his compliments, and that I ſhould ſee my friends there: I did not know what to ſay to the man; I made no anſwer, but gave the card into Lord Baltimore's hand; he read it, and ſaid I ſhould not go. With that, I told the man to tell my friends, that I was there (I mean at Dr. Griffinburg's houſe) and that I deſired my friends to come to me there directly; the man did not come any more; but there was meſſenger after meſſenger, came to tell him of men being about the houſe, and a great mob in the yard; and withal, that there was ſome women had been crying there. With that, I was afraid it ſhould come out, that I had ſeen Mr. Davis at the window. I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of my Lord, to let me ſpeak to the man firſt. I found there was another meſſenger come about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; I went out of the room, and there was Broughton, which we call the Steward: I aſked him what the woman ſaid? He ſaid I was ſeen out of the window; I told him I was, and I wanted to ſpeak to him about that. I told him I thought that my life depended on its being known; and therefore begged, if he had any value for a perſon's life, he would not mention to my Lord, that I was ſeen at the window. He ſaid he would promiſe no ſuch think, his bread depended upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I thought may-be he would murder me that night, or ſend me away. After this there was a great deal of conſuſion, and they talked in another language; I was fearful they were contriving to go ſome other way, or ſend me abroad. My Lord was ſo frightened, he was afraid to go home for fear they ſhould take me out of the coach: I told him they could not take me out unleſs I would, and that I would not go with Juſtice Fielding's men. After ſome time, we ſet out to go to Lord Baltimore's again. When we came within two or three doors, the coach ſtopped, by whoſe order I do not know; Right againſt the coach there were ſeveral men ſtanding; I got up to ſee if I could ſee any of my friends; but Lord Baltimore pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me down, aſked me what I got up for, and ordered the coach to drive on immediately: which they did as faſt as they could; and the men ſtrove to'get into the yard along with the coach; Juſtice Fielding's men, I believe they were; they ſtrove to get into the gates, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the coach, I cried out, let the men come in: He pulled me in, and ſaid I ſhould not ſtay. With that, we went up ſtairs; when we got there, the little Jew came up, and ſaid, my Lord, Piereni wants you: With that, I got up, and walked about the room in great diſtreſs, fearing it was coming out that I had been ſeen out of the window. I thought I would ſtrive to hide it; I plucked up all the courage I could, and aſked him as ſoon as he came in, what Piereni wanted. He ſaid I had ſpoke to ſomebody out of the window; I told him I had; he aſked what I had ſaid: I told him; but did not tell my diſtreſs becauſe I was afraid: When I had told him, he ſaid he could not blame me, he ſhould have done the ſame himſelf. He ſuppoſed I was glad to ſpeak to the firſt I had ſeen. With this, I was rejoiced, I had been in ſuch a terror before, leſt he thould kill me for it. After this, he and the doctor talked a good while in ſome other language; what, I don't know. By and by, Lord Baltimore ſaid I muſt go to bed to him; that I muſt lie with him that night, or he ſhould be wretched: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On Tueſday morning he got up firſt, and went away, and ſent Mrs. Griffinburg to take me up. She came, and ſaid Lord Baltimore wanted me directly: With that, I got up and went to him. When
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010919_0042_0F852934E4524B48"/>I came to him, he ſaid, Well, now we will write to your father, and ſend for him as propoſed. I had heard over night, that one Mr. Watts was to come in the morning at ten o'clock: So I ſaid I thought it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtay till ten o'clock, before I ſent to my father. I thought it would be Mr. Davis would come by the name of Watts. At ten o'clock I wrote a letter to my father, the purport of which, if I remember right, was this, that I begged my friends would come with all the decency and reſpect becoming a nobleman's houſe: He took the letter, and ſhewed it Mr. Brown, the attorney, and ſeemed very much pleaſed with it, and ſent it away. After this, he wanted to know what I ſhould ſay to my father, and whether I would ſay as I had told him, that I was willing to ſtay. I ſaid I would, but I would ſee my father alone by myſelf. With that, he ſaid, he would do any thing to make me eaſy. With that, I ſaid very well, but could not tell what to anſwer him. He ſaid I ſhould have a houſe to live in, and live with my friends, if I liked it better than living with him. Juſt upon that, Piereni came in, and ſaid, my Lord, here is Mr. Watts come; but before that, I ſhould have told you, my Lord ſaid, that whoever came, I muſt ſay I was willing to ſtay. The man came up, and ſaid, there was Mr. Watts. Lord Baltimore went out to him.</p>

               <p>I don't know; there was Mrs. Griffin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg and Dr. Griffinburg, backwards and forwards; but whether they were in the room or no, I can't ſay. My Lord brought Mr. Watts up ſtairs; he was in the firſt room, and I was in the fartheſt room; he was brought up ſtairs; The doors happened to ſtand a jar, that I could juſt ſee them, but I could not hear them. It I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber right, there was Piereni in the middle room. My Lord talked with Mr. Watts for about ten minutes; and then my Lord came firſt, and Mr. Watts almoſt behind him; and my Lord ſaid, Miſs, here is a friend of your's; I ſaid, I don't know the gentleman: He then ſaid, Miſs, you don't know me, nor do I know you; but I am come from your friends, to know if you are here by your own conſent? I anſwered, yes; but I want to ſee my father.</p>

               <p>I think it was; I was in ſuch a flurry at that time, I can't be poſitive. He ſaid, very well, Miſs, if you are here with your own conſent, no body has a right

               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>I went into the next room; I did not know what to think of Mr. Watts, and I had no thoughts at that time of a lawyer; therefore I went into the middle of the room, to ſee if I could ſee any friends about; when I ſaw none, I opened the window; this was on the firſt floor: I ſaw ſeveral friends at that time, but one pretty near that I knew, Mr. Cay: He aſked me, if I was there by my own conſent? I ſaid yes; but I ſaid I wanted to ſee my father. He ſaid, my father would never come within thoſe walls; I then turned away in a great trembling, and ſaid, then I never ſhall ſee him; that was my way of thinking at that time; I thought, that as they would not let him come in, I ſhould never get out. After that, Lord Paltimore came in again, and ſaid, I muſt go to Lord Mansfield's, and ſaid, I muſt ſay I was there with my own conſent, and not to tell Lord Mansfield particulars.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. Woodcock.</speaker>
               <p>Lord Baltimore ſaid, if I did not ſtand by him now, he ſhould be undone: He then ſaid, will you be faithful to me now, and keep your word; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I am undone? I ſaid I would? but I would tell my Lord Mansfield, that I wanted to ſee my father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. He ſaid, if I would be eaſy, and tell him I was eaſy and ſatisfied, I ſhould have a houſe, and live with my friends, and have the young man. With that, I told him I would ſay, I was willing to be there, as I promiſed him before, but would ſee my friends alone. He aſked, if I would tell my friends the particulars? I told him, yes; I would tell my friends all the truth. After this, he ſaid very little. Another meſſage came for him. He came up, and ſaid, we were to go to Lord Mansfield's immediately. I ſaid, very well, I was very willing. Mr. Brown, the lawyer, my Lord, and myſelf, went together in Mr. Brown's chariot.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as I came into Lord Mansfield's doors, my Lord Baltimore had hold of my hand up the ſteps; I clapt my hand upon Mr. Potts, one of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that ſtood in the hall, whom I knew; and he took no notice of me; which ſtruct me very much; becauſe Lord Baltimore had told me, that my friends would not look upon me; and ſeeing ſuch a repulſe from Mr. Potts it ſtruck me very much; I ſaw ſeveral other of my friends there; but I did not ſpeak to any body, nor any body to me; I went into another room, and Lord Mansfield met me at the door? Lord Mansfield aſked me to come in; and Lord Baltimore was to ſtay in the next room; then Lord Mansfield and I were alone, only another gentlemen preſent.

I ſaid, my Lord, as things are as they are, I am willing, but not without ſeeing my friends alone: He aſked me, what friends? I ſaid my father and my ſiſters. He deſired them to be called.

               <p>The Doctor, I think, did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in any other manner than by endeavouring to comfort you?</p>

               <p>You have given an account of the womens having put you to bed, of having tucked up the cloaths, and going out of the room; and that in the morning I got up to open the door to you; you

               <p>You had ſo far compoſed yourſelf, that you had intended to do every thing that was only trivial; to give into my ways, and for that reaſon you pinned the ribbons on; did not you puſſ them up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion, that I ſaid they were puffed up too high?</p>

               <p>Now as to theſe ribbons, you ſay they were new made up ribbons, but that they were made up by requeſt of Mrs. Harvey, and the other woman?— Did not you think that breaking in upon your rule?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No, I was not then; Mrs. Harvey came on Monday the 14th of December, and deſired to know whether we had any flowered gauze; I took down the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010919_0068_0F85294CE569B2A0"/>book and ſhewed her: ſhe beſpoke a pair of double ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, and ordered them to be done the next day by one or two o'clock. She accordingly came, and paid for them; and ordered my ſiſter to bring ſome lace with her (to put on a child's cap) to Curtain-row where ſhe ſaid ſhe lived. The next day my ſiſter went, about half an hour after four o'clock; that was on Wedneſday. My ſiſter did not come home all night; we were very much frightened; we ſat up till one o'clock; then a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came that ſhe was at a friend's houſe; that ſhe was ſafe and well. A porter brought it; it was not my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's hand-writing. This was Wedneſday the 16th of December.</p>

               <p>That is it. There was no name, nor the place ſhe was at. I aſked the man who brought it, where he had it. He ſaid he came out of Whitechapel, and then he went away. This letter ſaid ſhe would come home at twelve o'clock next day. I ſat till that time, and was very uneaſy. I then went to all her friends ſhe uſed to go to, to enquire after her. The firſt night we had any account of her, was a week after ſhe had been gone away.</p>

               <p>We went to ſee after Mrs. Harvey, but could not find the place; nobody knew ſuch a woman. Mr. Davis came and told me he believed he had found ſomething of it out. I went accordingly to Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey's; the maid came to the door; I aſked for Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, if ſhe was at home. She ſaid, no. I aſked her how long ſhe had been gone out. She ſaid ever ſince that night week. I aſked if any body went with her. She ſaid a young lady.</p>

               <p>I made no manner of uſe of it; I put it that night into the hands of Mr. Cay, a baker, in Whitecroſs-ſtreet, to keep it till we ſhould hear from her: he has that note to ſhew now. On the Friday there came a Jew-like man, that ſent for me and my daughter to a tavern on the other ſide Tower-hill (I have forgot the ſign) to deſire me to meet about my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's affairs. He ſaid to me, this day I ſaw your daughter. Said I, we are in great concern to know where ſhe is. Where did you ſee her? Said he, I ſaw her this day at Bethnal-green; but I never ſaw her before in my life. He promiſed that on the morrow following, which was Saturday, I ſhould ſee my daughter between ten and three in the afternoon. He ſwore to it many times. If my Lord had ſent me twenty bank notes it would not have ſatisfied me; we wanted to ſee my daughter. That gave us a little relief; we were in hopes till the time was expired. We heard no more about her for five or ſix days. We were ſeeking after Mrs. Harvey, and could not ſind her for ſome time. We heard ſhe came home on Chriſtmas-day at night: we took all the methods we could to take her up; and we did take her up. I had one that waited in Mr. Goff's houſe in the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010919_0073_0F852869A7C86320"/>ſame row, to ſee if ſhe could ſee any thing paſs in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey's houſe.

               <p>Threeſcore-and four. I was glad to ſee her; but was ſorry to ſee her in that condition. She ſeemed like one that was almoſt bereaved of her ſenſes at that time. She ſeemed to be ſo concerned about ſeeing Lord Baltimore again; for ſhe did not know that it was in the power of Lord Mansfield to ſet her at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

               <p>When we went to my Lord Mansfield's, the ſervant told us, he was not within then, but was at L. C. J. Wilmot's. The ſervant ſaid he would go and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Lordſhip that we were there. Then he went, and in a ſhort time Lord Mansfield came in. When he came into the hall, he aſked if the Habeas Corpus was ſerved; Mr. Watts anſwered, it was. His Lordſhip then ſaid, gentlemen, if this young lady ſhould chooſe to go with Lord Baltimore, or words to that purpoſe, ſo it muſt be; for no perſon has any right to compel her to go any where againſt her own conſent. Therefore, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſid, none of us muſt touch her. To which ſomebody preſent ſaid, there was no reſcue intended. Lord Mansfield having ſaid, if any of us touched her he muſt commit us; he then ſaid, if ſhe ſhould chooſe to go with her father and friends, if Lord Baltimore, or any of his people, touch her, I will commit them. Lord Mansfield very condeſcendingly added, I give you this friendly hint that you may know how to behave. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Lord Mansfield retired into an adjoining room, having ordered Mr. Watts to ſend to Lord Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and let him know that he (Lord Mansfield) was ready. In a very ſhort time I ſaw a carriage with two gentlemen and Miſs Woodcock. The firſt gentleman walked in, and as he appeared to me, with much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind: from whence I concluded it was not Lord Baltimore. The other gentleman, whom I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010919_0075_0F85286B38DF5768"/>found to be Lord Baltimore, handed Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock out of the carriage; when he led her up the ſteps into the hall, ſhe put her hand on Mr. Potts's arm, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in his face, ſhook her head, and the tears ſtood in her eyes. Mr. Potts lifted up his right hand, as I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, intending to lay his hand upon her's: when I pulled back his hand, and ſaid, are you mad? recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Lord Mansfield had ſaid. Several gentlemen ſaid, do not touch her. Mr. Potts ſaid, I did not touch her; ſhe has laid hold of me. At this time, a ſervant opened a door of the room adjoining: upon which Lord Baltimore and Miſs Woodcock went into that room, and the door was ſhut. When they had been there about three quarters of an hour, more or leſs, I heard a bell ring, and the door was opened. And I knew Lord Mansfield's voice when he ſaid, is Mr. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock the father, and Miſs Woodcock the ſiſter, there? To which it was anſwered from without, no, my Lord, they are not here, but juſt by. Upon which his Lordſhip ordered they ſhould be ſent for. They were ſent for; and in a few minutes came Mr. Woodcock and his two daughters, when they were introduced, and the door ſhut after them. After they had been introduced about a quarter of an hour, or nearly that, a little more or leſs, the door was thrown open, and the gentlemen preſent that pleaſed, were deſired to walk in. When we walked in to the room, Mr. Woodcock the father, and his three danghters, were there, and no other perſon that I obſerved. I went up to her, and ſaid, well girl, how do you ſtand affected now? to go with your father and friends, or with Lord Baltimore? She anſwered, to go with my father and friends. I then retreated a few ſteps.</p>

               <p>I cannot tell; in a ſhort time the door was opened, the further door, Lord Mansfield appeared and ſaid to this purpoſe; Madam, is it your deſire, or are you willing (I cannot ſwear poſitively to all his words, or the exact poſition of ſuch of them as I do remember) are you willing to return with Lord Baltimore to his houſe in Southampton-Row, or to go with your father and friends? to which ſhe anſwered, with my father and friends by all means. Lord Mansfield aſked her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had been taken or carried without her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and detained againſt her will? ſhe anſwered, that
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010919_0076_0F85286BD82A10D0"/>as ſhe had been carried to a place which ſhe did not then know, but found afterwards to be Lord Baltimore's, ſhe had been kept all this time againſt her will. Lord Manf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field repeated the queſtions, with ſome variation of the terms, and told her, that her going with her father and friends was not to be underſtood to be in cuſtody by them, but to be at liberty as uſual. After this his Lordſhip ſaid to us that were preſent to this effect; Gentlemen, I would have you take notice of theſe anſwers, becauſe poſſibly this matter may be variouſly talked of in public, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ought to be done to both parties; for when this lady came before me on her private examination, ſhe expreſſed, at firſt, her inclination to return with Lord Baltimore, however ſhe expreſſed a deſire to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee her father and ſiſter, or ſiſters, upon which I called for her father and ſiſters, and now ſhe has anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you have heard. His Lordſhip then ſaid ſomewhat, which I have not been able ever ſince to recollect, for I had attended to what he had ſaid, when his Lordſhip had deſired we would take notice of her anſwers, but his Lordſhip concluded with this, and I ſuppoſe gentlemen, none of you make any doubt of it. His Lordſhip then ſaid, madam you are at full liberty to go where you pleaſe. His Lordſhip then aſked Mr. Watts if the habeas corpus was regularly ſerved? to which he anſwered, it was. Then his Lordſhip ſaid, it was not ſerved by any of Sir John Fielding's men was it? it was anſwered none of us were in any connection with them. Then ſaid Mr. Watts I ſerved it myſelf, and would not do ſuch another job for five hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>On Wedneſday evening, the 16th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I went to Mr. Woodcock's, agreeable to an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before; I was then informed Miſs Woodcock went out about four o'clock, to wait on a cuſtomer, one Mrs. Harvey. I waited till about nine that evening; ſhe did not return; I went then away.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010919_0081_0F8528730D1628A0"/>I found Mr. Woodcock and the other ſiſter in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confuſion that could be.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>I went, as I was informed Mrs. Harvey lived in the Curtain, to enquire for her: Several perſons had been to look after her before. On Tueſday, about three o'clock, I went to the Horſe and Groom to enquire for her; they informed me they did not know ſuch a perſon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, by information of Mr. Goff.</p>

               <p>We had no information that ſhe was there, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Mrs. Harvey was traced there.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Having that information, what did you do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>They had obtained a writ for taking up Mrs. Harvey. I went, with ſome more friends, about eleven or twelve on Sunday morning; we could ſee nothing of Mrs. Harvey: we went to an adjoining houſe, drank ſomething, and then they returned; that was on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day about noon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serj. Leigh.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>No, not then. I went into the ſtrand and came back again, and then I ſaw Miſs Woodcock; I came down Southampton Row that afternoon, about four or five o'clock, and turned round to go to the Foundling hoſpital; at the fartheſt window in that front, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow next the hoſpital, I firſt ſaw Miſs Woodcock.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serj. Leigh.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>How was ſhe employed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>She was ſtanding at the window, and looking out at the window in a very penſive manner. When I firſt ſaw her, I was within a few yards of the wall that goes to the Foundling Hoſpital. My ſurprize was ſo great, that I could hardly believe it; I came nearer, and ſaw ſhe had taken notice of me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Serj. Leigh.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>Not then. I came back from the corner of the wall, and pulled a book out of my pocket, and made ſigns for her to write: She ſhook her head, and pointed with her finger. I went back to the gate that belongs to the Duke of Bedford's; I ſtaid there for about a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; while I was there, ſhe got from that window to the Venetian window in the centre of the front, ſhe wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her hand, and then I went round to the other corner.</p>

               <p>The firſt word ſhe ſaid was, I can't come to you, I can't come to you. I ſaid, How do you do? ſhe rather waved that anſwer, and ſaid, How does my father do? I anſwered her, he is well, and we are all well; I think
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:010919_0083_0F85287422547B90"/>the next was, Are you well? ſhe ſaid, I am well. I aſked where Mrs. Harvey was, for I had a warrant in my pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et for taking her; ſhe ſhook her head, and ſaid, I don't know, I don't know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
               <p>She ſeemed in diſtreſs and miſery to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree.</p>

               <p>I ſaid, is all well? She ſeemed then more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed than ever, and put down the ſaſh.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brown ſaid in my hearing, that it was a mere joke for my friends to attempt any thing of that kind, for that ſhe would certainly go back again with Lord Baltimore; which confuſed me, in the manner I ſtood connected with her.</p>

               <p>I was employed by him to go to the father, in order to wait for the coming of this perſon to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's; between ten and three of the afternoon of that Saturday a perſon was to come; I went and waited at the father's a conſiderable time, and no body came. Mr. Cay and I went to the King's-head tavern, which was a place where this perſon had been before, and we made every enquiry we could after that perſon; there had been no ſuch perſpon there that day. Upon this I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the making this matter known to Lord Mansfield; it appeared to me in a very ſtriking light as to the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abſence of the girl; and I went to Lord Mansfield's at Canewood; Lord Mansfield was not there, but was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to dinner; I waited till about one or two o'clock; he did not come; I went to his houſe in Bloomſbury ſquare; I was told there was a great deal of company with him; I was recommended by the ſervants to wait on him next morning; I went next morning, and ſaw Lord Mansfield; that was the Monday before Chriſtmas day; I acquainted my Lord with the appearance in which the facts ſtruck me, and my Lord ſaid (to the beſt of my remembrance; I do not ſpeak the words, I ſpeak of the ſubſtance of the matter), it is a very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affair, but time will give light to it.</p>

               <p>I had orders to come next morning, and a promiſe of ſeeing my Lord: this was between 10 and 11 o'clock. I was introduced to my Lord, and my Lord in a very genteel manner accoſted me, he had been told who I was, and that I was an attorney on behalf of Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock. I told him, my Lord, I wait on your Lordſhip, in order to acquaint you, that the friends of Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock have found that ſhe is here; but are doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe is here with or againſt her will, and it highly becomes your Lordſhip to diſcloſe this matter; for as I find ſhe is of age, if ſhe is here with her will, it is not in the power of her friends, or the law itſelf, to releaſe her; if ſhe is here againſt her will, you cannot detain her. Upon this, my Lord acquainted me ſhe was there with her conſent, perfectly happy. My Lord retired from me a minute or two, and he came to me again, and deſired me to follow him; I did, and he opened a door that introduced me into a room where was Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, and Mrs. Griffinburg, I believe; it was a perſon much like her. My Lord, in a polite manner, pointed
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010919_0086_0F8528765FD0A740"/>his hand, and ſaid, that, Sir, is the lady in queſtion. Upon that I made her a bow, and what I am going to ſay now is the ſubſtance of the matter: I do not pretend, nor will I ſwear to the words that paſſed; I will tell them then as they were. On my making a bow, it is my preſent apprehenſion that ſhe immediately was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very near the door, ready to receive ſome perſon; I did not know that; I aſked her a queſtion: I aſked her, whether ſhe was there with her own conſent. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered immediately, I am here with my free will and conſent. Upon that my Lord looked upon me with a complacency, and ſeeming expectation that I ſhould be ſatisfied: upon that I ſaid to my Lord, (he looked to me expecting an anſwer, whether I was or was not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) I am not ſurpriſed that your Lordſhip has got temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations enough to gain the approbation of this young woman. Miſs Woodcock ſaid, where is my father? I ſaid, very near, Miſs:—And my ſiſters?—I ſaid, yes, they are. Said ſhe, can I ſee them? I ſaid, I do not know. Says my Lord, I ſhall take that as a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if you will fetch the father and the ſiſters, that they may hear her declarations, and receive the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſaction as you have done, Upon this I told them, I was willing to go: upon this I went out of the houſe. I did not ſerve the Habeas, but went out, and got a promiſe from my Lord I ſhould come in again. I ſaw ſeveral friends within a few yards of Lord Baltimore's, and I told them what ſhe ſaid. They immediately ſaid, they did not care what declarations ſhe made under my Lord's roof and influence, and would not go there, unleſs with two friends, and ſo ſee her alone. I went to my Lord, and told him this matter: he was rather angry at it, and ſaid it was an inſult upon him; he did not ſee any occaſion he had to ſatisfy any body but the father and ſiſters, and as to having two friends he would not agree to it, and gave this as a reaſon: Have I not as much reaſon to ſuſpect that her father and her friends would influence her to tell another tale, as they have to ſuſpect me? I anſwered, I thought if his Lordſhip was ſatisfied that the declarations ſhe had made to me were genuine and clear, that he might even ſend her home, and they could not keep her from him. He told me a ſtory of ſome of Sir John Fielding's men having made a riot, or ſomething of that ſort; I told him, that all that was againſt him was what I had in my pocket; nor do I know to this moment, how, or by what means,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:010919_0087_0F852877175DCFC0"/>Sir John's men came to go there that night, becauſe there was no accuſation whatever. I did not know that they were there: I believe there were nobody there but ten or twelve perſons with me to ſerve the Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus. He would not believe but I was privy to it. He took hold of me by the arm, and conducted me down ſtairs, and I thought was going to turn me out of doors, but this was my imagination, inſtead of that, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me into a room, through another room, and there was a man in the room ſtanding: and then ſat me down in an elbow-chair on the off-ſide of the fire, to the door: he ſet himſelf down on the off-ſide of the fire and he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the man to ſit down by me, or by us. My Lord kept ſtill angry about Sir John's men, and I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to argue every thing I could for the ſake of his Lordſhip, to diſcharge the girl undoubtedly. My Lord refuſed to ſubmit to let the girl's father and ſiſter, and two friends come. I then found it abſolately neceſſary that I muſt ſerve the Habeas; I then gave it to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: I ſaid, my Lord I will, if it will oblige your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I will wait upon my Lord Mansfield, and deſire him to appoint a time. I went to Lord Mansfield; he appointed the time immediately. I wrote a card to Lord Baltimore, and he attended at Lord Mansfield's. My Lord, Miſs Woodcock, and Mr. Brown, came in his chariot; before they returned, my Lord Mansfield came out of his ſtudy to me, and enquired if her father and ſiſters were there: I ſaid not there, but very near; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which my Lord ordered me to ſend for them: I did, and they came, and when they came were introduced to Lord Mansfield; but when Lord Mansfield thought proper, he ordered all the friends and me to come in; I went in, and, to the beſt of my remembrance, Lord Mansfield ſaid, Gentlemen, I called you in, that you may hear my examination of this girl; and then he aſked her, are you willing to go back with Lord Baltimore? Or are you willing and deſireous to go with your father and friends? Says ſhe, with my father and friends, my Lord. He repeated that ſeveral times, and ſhe made the ſame ſort of anſwer. My Lord then turned to us, and he ſaid, Gentlemen, I think it my duty to acquaint you, that notwithſtanding the anſwers you have heard to the queſtions I have put to this girl, upon her firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, ſhe did declare ſhe was willing to go back to my Lord Baltimore's. As this matter may be talked of variouſly, I think it my duty to declare this; ſhe declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010919_0088_0F8528782C2CDE50"/>herſelf willing to go back to her father and friends, and then was diſcharged.</p>

               <p>Miſs Woodcock came to my houſe, I do not recollect the time; a woman whoſe name was Harvey, was in cuſtody at that time before me, upon a warrant granted, on an information made by her ſiſter, Elizabeth Woodcock, relating to Sarah Woodcock's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; and that was the reaſon of her coming to my houſe, as far as I could judge.</p>

            <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>I have put myſelf upon my country, in hopes that prejudice and clamour will avail nothing in this place, where it is the privilege of the meaneſt of the king's ſubjects to be preſumed innocent, until his guilt has been made appear by legal evidence. I wiſh I could ſay that I had been treated abroad with the ſame candour. I have been loaded with obloquy, the moſt malignant libels have been circulated, and every other method which malice could deviſe, have been taken, to create general prejudice againſt me. I thank God, that, under ſuch circumſtances, I have had firmneſs and reſolution enough to meet my accuſers face to face, and provoke
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:010919_0092_0F85287C95550B58"/>an enquiry into my conduct. <hi>Hic murus ahaeneus eſte— nil conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire ſibi.</hi> The charge againſt me, and againſt theſe poor people, who are involved with me, becauſe they might otherwiſe have been juſt witneſſes of my innocence, is in its nature very eaſy to be made, and hard to be diſproved. The accuſer has the advantage of ſupporting it by a direct and poſitive oath; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence can only be collected from circumſtances.</p>
            <p>My defence is compoſed then of a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; all tending to ſhew the falſity of this charge, the abſurdity of it, the improbability that it could be true. It will be laid before the jury under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my counſel; and I have the confidence of an innocent man, that it will be manifeſt to your Lordſhip, the jury, and the whole world, that the ſtory told by this woman is a perverſion of truth in every particular. What could induce her to make ſuch a charge I can only ſuſpect: very ſoon after ſhe came to my houſe, upon a repreſentation to me that her father was diſtreſſed, I ſent him a conſiderable ſum of money; whether the eaſe with which that money was obtained from me might ſuggeſt the idea as a means of obtaining a larger ſum of money, or whether it was thought neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me, in order eſtabliſh the character of the girl to the world, I know not; but I do aver, upon the word of a man of honour, that there is no truth in any thing which has been ſaid or ſworn, of my having offered violence to this girl. I ever held ſuch brutality in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. I am totally againſt all force; and for me to have forced this woman, conſidering my weak ſtate of health and my ſtrength, is not only a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al but a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical impoſſibility. She is, as to bodily health, ſtronger than I am. Strange opinions, upon ſubjects foreign to this charge, have been falſly imputed to me, to inflame this accuſation. Libertine as I am repreſented, I hold no ſuch opinions. Much has been ſaid againſt me, that I ſeduced this girl from her parents: ſeduction is not the point of this charge; but I do aſſure your lordſhip and the jury, this part of the caſe has been aggravated exceedingly beyond the truth. If I have been in any degree to blame. I am ſure I have ſufficiently atoned for every indiſcretion, which a weak attachment to this unworthy woman may have led me into, by having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the diſgrace of being expoſed as a criminal at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010919_0093_0F85287D7B7E1A40"/>to have attained the ſame honour, had that ſort of an active life been my object.</p>
            <p>I will take up no more of your Lordſhip's time than to add, that if I had been conſcious of the guilt now imputed to me, I could have kept myſelf and my fortune out of the reach of the laws of this country. I am a citizen of the world; I could have lived any where: but I love my country, and ſubmit to its laws; reſolving, that my innocence ſhould be juſtified by the laws. I now, by my own voluntary act, by ſurrendering myſelf to the Count of King's Bench, ſtake upon the verdict of twelve men, my life, my fortune, and what is dearer to me, my honour.</p>

I have lent her cloaths at different times: ſhe did go into my room and chuſe theſe cloaths, caps, handkerchiefs, and any thing ſhe deſired. She was at all times ready to pleaſe my Lord. After ſupper was done ſhe went into the room, and ſhe beſpoke of me ſome water to waſh her feet, and I fetched the water; ſhe aſked if the water was brought up; and it was firſt brought into the wrong room; and as ſhe came out of the room ſhe undreſſed herſelf, and I ſaw nobody touch her: ſhe aſked me if I had a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap for her?

I went to the window, as ſhe mentioned, and did uſe ſome familiarities with her, and ſhe with me. I put the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain round me, that the ſervants running through the room might not ſee us. She conſented to it. I went down ſtairs among the workmen; I came back again: ſhe ſaid, I believe I am a little out of order; upon which I ſaid, that was not material; which is all I ſaid to Miſs Woodcock, till ſhe came to bed to me, ſo help me God.

                  </gap> about part of a letter, ſomething wrote at the bottom of the letter to her father, if it was her hand writing? ſhe ſaid it was: he aſked her about a perſon who had ſeen her from Lord Baltimore's window? ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſeen a perſon whom ſhe knew about the houſe, and ſhe ſaid that ſhe beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to him to came to another window; accordingly, upon her meeting him at the window, he aſked her if ſhe was well? ſhe ſaid yes; and ſhe ſaid that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe beckoned him to come to the window was, that her father might be ſatisfied, and might know ſhe was well; and that he ſaid, then you are well, and have been well, or words to that effect, and at laſt aſked, is all well? on which ſhe ſaid ſhe turned away from the window. Lord Mansfield aſked her in this kind of way I think, from the affidavit, you are of age, of five or ſix and twenty? ſhe ſaid ſhe was; becauſe, ſays he, if you was not of age I ſhould not take your anſwer ſo eaſily, but I ſhould take you away; ſhe anſwered, as I am of age I know you cannot do it, my Lord; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it ſeveral times. She had mentioned ſomething about her father, before Lord Mansfield aſked her if ſhe would ſee her father; ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould be glad to ſee her father and tell him ſhe was well: he was ordered to be ſent for to ſome neighbouring houſe, and ſhe ſat down about ten minutes, while her father was ſent for, and ſaid nothing. A meſſage was brought in that the father was come into the hall, and his Lordſhip directed me to

               <p>I was in the room while ſome converſation paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them. She came and took hold of her young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſiſter and her father; and ſhe aſked them what made them ſo uneaſy. She ſaid ſhe was very well off, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy; and deſired they would not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uneaſy—I immediately withdrew out of the room, and went to the hall where all the proſecutors friends were, and, I believe, Mr. Watts, and Mr. Brown; and I ſaid I believed the young lady would go back to Lord Baltimore again. I took it from hearing her ſay ſo when I went firſt. The ſecond time was about five minutes ſpace; ſhe ſaid, what ſignifies my going back: all my friends will think me a whore. They ſaid no; all her acquaintance had a good opinion of her. Upon that ſhe turned round to me, and defired me to let Lord Mansfield know ſhe had agreed with her friends. Then my Lord ordered all the perſons into that room that were concerned in the affair. There was a young man they called a ſweatheart of the young woman's; he went in

               <p>She bid them not be uneaſy, ſhe was very well and very happy; Lord Baltimore had behaved very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly to her, in that ſhe was very happy. They paus'd and whiſpered a great deal; they burſt into tears; ſhe was not in tears at all.</p>

               <p>I was appointed to go to Lord Baltimore; it was a Monday night the ſervant came to my houſe. I ſaw Miſs Woodcock there. About two in the morning ſome body came from Lord Baltimore's to my houſe to deſire I would be at Lord Baltimore's houſe; I went there about nine; I was ſhewn up into a room in the one pair of ſtairs floor; a ſervant went in, and he came out to me, and told me, that the night before there had been ſome people at his houſe from Juſtice Fielding, who had attempted or wanted to force in at his gates; I aſked what could be the occaſion of it; he ſaid there was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken into cuſtody for having ſeduced a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or to that effect; I ſaid, Have you got the young woman here; he ſaid ſhe was in the next room. My Lord told me they ſaid they had come with a habeas cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, and that upon that authority they had forced into his gates; I aſked him if he had been ſerved with the habeas corpus, or his ſervants? he ſaid no, and that one of the perſons was Mr. Watts. Miſs Woodcock was in a room; I was introduced to drink coffee; ſhe was ſitting at the upper end of the room, writing. I ſaid to my Lord, that he ſhould get Harvey bailed, as ſhe is taken up on your account. This young lady came running up to me with a piece of a letter in her hand, and ſaid, Sir, I have a letter I am going to ſend to my father; I told her to finiſh it, and ſend it away; ſhe ſaid ſhe would. I went out with my Lord into the adjoining room, and adviſed my Lord to bail the woman; I aſked who he had to bail her; he had not, he ſaid, any body but Mr. Broughton,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:010919_0100_0F85288380259130"/>his houſe-ſteward, and Dr. Griffinburg; he ſaid he would be obliged to me to go to Juſtice Fielding's; I did, and Juſtice Fielding ſaid ſhe was taken up for an offence, for decoying to my Lord's houſe a woman. I went from there back to my Lord, and told him, that bail would not be accepted then, but I muſt go again at two o clock. My Lord ſaid, he had juſt then been ſerved with a writ of habeas corpus; he ſaid, he ſhould obey this writ. Miſs Woodcock came up, and aſked if ſhe muſt go to my Lord Mansfield, and ſaid, I hope I cannot be taken from my Lord Baltimore; I ſhould be glad to ſee my father, but no body elſe. Upon this I aſked her her age; ſhe ſaid ſhe was twenty-ſix; I ſaid, I don't think that any judge or any other power can have any juriſdiction over you; ſays ſhe, I am glad of that, for I was afraid I ſhould be forced away; and ſhe ſaid ſhe would go then to Lord Mansfield's immediately; ſhe took me by the hand and jumped into the chariot, and all the way ſhe ſaid, Sir, are you ſure I can't be taken away from my Lord? I ſaid yes, as ſhe was of age.</p>

We had a good deal of talk before ſhe was inclined to go, for fear of being forced from my Lord.</p>

            <p>I am clerk to Mr. Hammerſly. I was at Lord Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's on the 29th of December laſt, about eleven o'clock or near that time. I was in the parlour at my Lord's houſe: and while I was there, Mr. Watts and my Lord Baltimore came into the parlour where I was. My Lord addreſſed himſelt to me, and ſaid, this gentleman is come to me concerning a lady that I have in the houſe. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſome converſation aroſe between my Lord Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore and him; and Mr. Watts ſaid, the lady's father, and ſiſter, and ſeveral friends, wanted much to ſee her. My Lord aſked where they were. He ſaid, hard by. My Lord ſaid they are welcome to come and ſee her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I have ſome friend or friends preſent: and ſaid he had been extremely ill uſed the night before; that his houſe had been beſet by a parcel of people; that they had not treated him like a gentleman, but had uſed him extremely ill, and forced open the gates. Mr. Watts ſaid, what can you do with ſuch a body of people? He ſaid Methodiſts or Diſſenters, I don't know which. He ſerved the Habeas Corpus upon him from Lord Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. My Lord ſaid, I will obey the writ immediately, and go with you; and fix the time. Upon this Mr. Watts went out of the room. I went with Lord Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more up ſtairs into a room, where I ſaw the young lady: I never ſaw her before nor ſince. My Lord ſpoke to her, and ſhe ſeemed very chearful with my Lord and laughed.</p>

After tea, there was a little converſation about ſeveral indifferent things; and Lord Baltimore deſired me to draw a ſketch of that lady's picture; and he gave me a black pencil. I
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010919_0104_0F85288866D8B7A8"/>deſired the lady to put herſelf in a poſture to draw her picture. So ſhe did. After I had begun her picture about half an hour. I thought the lady was tired, and I deſired her to reſt. I afterwards deſired her to put herſelf in the ſame poſition, which ſhe did. After I had finiſhed it, I put it in Lord Baltimore's hand; ſhe ſmiled at it; and the converſation went on till ſupper was ready: and then Lord Baltimore deſired me to ſtay to ſupper with him. There was my Lord, this lady, Dr. Griffinburg, and another lady, that ſupped with us, I took particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of this lady, ſhe being a ſtranger to me: ſhe eat a bit of fowl, and ſeveral other things, and drank to every body's health; and I did the ſame as every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy does.

            <sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE priſoner at the bar, Lord Baltimore, ſtands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for feloniouſly raviſhing and carnally know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sarah Woodcock, ſpinſter, againſt her will, on the 22d of December laſt at Epſom; againſt the ſtatute which makes this offence felony: and the other two priſoners are indicted as acceſſaries before the fact, by feloniouſly and maliciouſly procuring, aiding and abetting Lord Baltimore, to commit the ſaid rape, at the ſaid time and place. To this they have pleaded Not Guilty; and you are to try if they are guilty. Before I ſtate to you the evidence, I will mention to you two or three things: In the firſt place, my Lord complains of libels, and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accounts of this tranſaction, which have been circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. It is a moſt unjuſtifiable practice, and tends to the perverſion of public juſtice; and therefore if you have ſeen any thing printed on the ſide of the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ix or the priſoners, I muſt deſire you to diveſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any prejudice that ſuch publications may have occaſioned, and give your verdict only on the evidence now laid before you. Another thing I deſire, is, that whichever way the verdict is given, none of the friends of any of the parties will make uſe of any expreſſion of approbation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> applauſe, which are extremely improper and indecent in a court of juſtice, and I ſhall certainly commit any perſon whom I ſhall know to be guilty of it. The laſt thing I ſhall mention to you, is, to deſire that no reſentment you may feel at the manner in which ſhe was carried to Lord Baltimore's houſe, may have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on your verdict; for however unwarrantable the manner was, in which ſhe came into his power, if at the time he lay with her it was by her conſent, he is not guilty of the offence of which he is indicted; though it was proper to be given in evidence in this trial, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for her being with him, and his having an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of committing the crime; and to ſhew, from the indirect manner of getting her to his houſe, the greater probability that her account is true. Having ſaid this, I will now ſtate to you the whole evidence as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Mr. Baron Smythe then ſtated the whole of the evidence to the jury, as before given, which took up three hours, and on account of the length of it is not repeated here; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In point of law, the fact is fully proved on my Lord and the other two priſoners, if you believe the evidence of Sarah Woodcock. It is a crime which in its nature can only be proved by the woman on whom it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for ſhe only can tell whether ſhe conſented or no; it is, as my Lord obſerves, very eaſy to be made, and hard to be diſproved; and the deſence can only be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from circumſtances; from theſe you muſt judge whether her evidence is or is not to be believed. Lord Hale, in his hiſtory of the pleas of the crown
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 632, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note>, lays down two rules: I. If complaint is not made ſoon after the injury is ſuppoſed to be received; 2. If it is not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a recent proſecution; a ſtrong preſumption ariſes that the complaint is malicious. She has owned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury was received December 21ſt, and the complaint was not made till December 29th; but ſhe has accounted for it in the manner you have heard. The ſtrong part of the caſe, on behalf of the priſoners, is, her not complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when ſhe was at Lord Mansfield's, the ſupreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the kingdom in criminal matters: you have heard how ſhe has explained and accounted for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in that particular, which you will judge of. Upon the whole, if you believe that ſhe made the diſcovery as ſoon as ſhe knew ſhe had an opportunity of doing it, and that her account is true, you will find all the priſoners guilty; if you believe that the did not make the diſcovery as ſoon as ſhe had an opportunity, and from thence, or other circumſtances, are not ſatisfied her account is true, you will find them all not guilty; for if he is not guilty, they cannot be ſo; for they cannot be acceſſary to a crime which was never committed.</p>
