            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN I received your commands to publiſh the following plain diſcourſe, I could not flatter myſelf that your Excellency had any other motive than that of giving a ſanction to my honeſt endeavours, to excite in thoſe that heard me a ſpirit of Gratitude to God, for his diſtinguiſhing favours to this nation and land; and to promote that loyalty and obedience to government on which the ſtability of our preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth ſo much depend.</p>
            <p>NEITHER my ſtation nor abilities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to enter into the policy's of
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:009361_0003_1032113E15CA79D8"/>
ſtate, or to determine whether the late peace ſecured all the advantages which the nation had juſt reaſon to expect from its acknowledged ſuperiority. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe, and I would have others alſo ſuppoſe, that all things conſidered, the public affairs have been conducted (human errors excepted) with as much wiſdom, and to as good effect as the condition of things would well admit.—Whether this be ſo or not, it is at leaſt evident that the nation has acquired a large addition to its territory, and perhaps no inconſiderable improvement of its commercial intereſt.</p>
            <p>THESE things certainly deſerve the acknowledgment of every good ſubject, and ſhould fill our hearts with gratitude to the Supreme Diſpoſer of all, to whoſe gracious favour it is owing, and not to any merit of ours, that we have ſo many bleſſings to thank him for.</p>

I SUPPOSE it will be allowed me, that things might have been worſe; and God grant that they may not prove ſo yet. If a ſpirit of murmuring and diſcontent ſhould get the better of our gratitude, I ſee not but that internal diſcord may accompliſh that which external violence was not able to effect; rob <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

If any thing in the following diſcourſe has a tendency to prevent ſo unfortunate a conſequence, I ſhall not repent me of the preſent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. God is able to give efficacy to the moſt inconſiderable means, where there is an honeſt intention to promote his glory: Conſcious of ſuch an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and humbly begging the divine bleſſing upon it, It is ſubmitted to your Excellency's pleaſure by</p>

            <head>The great Bleſſing of ſtable Times, with the Means of procuring it.</head>

               <bibl>ISAIAH XXXIII. 6</bibl>
               <q>Wiſdom and Knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of thy Times.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE words are part of a triumphant ode, occaſioned by a prophetick view of the deſtruction of the Aſſyrian army and power. By ſuperior ſtrength and numerous forces, this invader of nations, this natural enemy of the Jews, thought to have ſwallowed up that people, to have ſlain, or carried them captive into his own land.—But God had otherwiſe determined—and revealed his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to his prophet, who repreſents the ſeveral ſcenes of that tranſaction, in all the force and ſublimity of language, and with all the beauties of a poetical deſcription.<note n="†" place="bottom">A learned perſon obſerves that if a tranſlation could be made of this Chapter, that ſhould come up to the original, it would appear to be as noble a piece of poetry as is to be found among the moſt admired writings of the ancients. LOWTH'S Com.</note>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:009361_0009_10321149C0A59E70"/>
AT the firſt verſe he prophetically relates the deſtruction and ſpoil of the enemy, whom he characteriſes as guilty of great injuſtice, violently and treacherouſly entring upon the territory of their neighbours, without any provocation. <hi>Wo to thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled, and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT the ſecond verſe the prophet repreſents, what might naturally be expected from any people in diſtreſs, but eſpecially from a religious and covenant people, their humble addreſs and ſupplication to God for protection and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. <hi>O Lord be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; our ſalvation alſo in the time of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT the third and fourth verſes he deſcribes the terror, confuſion and deſtruction of this haughty and treacherous enemy, and the ſignal interpoſition of divine providence in that event. <hi>At the noiſe of the tumult the people fled; at the liſting up of thy ſelf the nations were ſcattered. And your ſpoil ſhall be gathered, like the gathering of the caterpillar; as the running to and fro of locuſts ſhall he run upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009361_0010_1032114C03F04D00"/>
AT the fifth verſe, the Almighty is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in great Majeſty, as it were ſurveying with complacency the juſtice of his own award, and the protection and ſecurity he had given to his people. <hi>The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high; he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM hence he proceeds in the text to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what ſort of conduct in his people, would be ſure to eſtabliſh the bleſſing of peace and ſecurity which God had thus procured them. <hi>Wiſdom and knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of thy times; and ſtrength of ſalvation: the fear of the Lord is his treaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS prediction or deſcription of the prophet was afterwards within about three years, lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fulfilled in the unjuſt and treacherous attempt of the Aſſyrian, and in his confuſion and defeat, by the hand of divine providence.</p>
            <p>AND may we not almoſt ſay that the ſame or a like ſcene has been repeated in our times? Had we not been deceitfully and unjuſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon by a powerful and treacherous neighbour? Did he not attempt an invaſion?
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009361_0011_1032114D87F05558"/>
Did he not ſeek and labour the deſtruction of this nation, and eſpecially of this land? And to this end, did he not form alliances, and ſtir up the nations round about, even the barbarous ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to plunder and deſtroy? And did we not addreſs, repeatedly addreſs the Almighty to ſave us from theſe violent attempts and unjuſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments? We certainly did ſo—and I hope we did it ſeriouſly and in good earneſt, from a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

At leaſt it is certain that God has viſibly appeared in our favour, in the many inſtances of ſucceſs and triumph we have experienced; he has defeated the counſels, impaired the ſtrength, and humbled our haughty enemy beyond the example of any former time.—And then as to the conſequences of this divine aſſiſtance; we have not only obtained a glorious and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace, but have the faireſt proſpect of its ſtability or continuance both in our times, and to ſucceeding generations. I ſpeak here my own ſenſe of the matter, and I truſt alſo the opinion of moſt that hear me: Nay it is the public ſenſe likewiſe, unleſs we mean to affront Almighty God, to mock him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thanks, for what we really are not thankful; for to what purpoſe is it that we are now aſſembled together? Is it not to bleſs and praiſe God, not only for his holy protection

over us, and his gracious aſſiſtance of us, during a long, expenſive and bloody war, but chiefly for diſpoſing contending monarchs and nations to hearken to the voice of peace; and that too upon ſuch terms in regard to us, as ſome time ſince we could ſcarce have hoped for, without the moſt ungrounded partiality in our own favour.</p>
            <p>IT is true, there may be ſome who appear diſſatisfied with the terms upon which it is founded; but ſo perhaps they would if any other terms had been obtained. Diſſatisfaction with any public adminiſtration doth not always ariſe from what is truly exceptionable in it, but often from quite different motives, more or leſs laudable in proportion to the ability, knowledge and integrity of thoſe that are in the oppoſition—Some are deficient in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, others are unacquainted with the true ſprings of government; ſome are influenced by ambition or vanity, others by intereſt or envy: But without inquiring into the motives of diſſatisfaction which individuals have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is both determined by public authority, and appears to be the general voice of the nation, that we have a glorious peace, ſuch as reflects luſtre upon the Britiſh counſels, and loudly calls for a univerſal and devout acknowledgment to the ſupreme diſpoſer of all events. But becauſe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009361_0013_10321151994D5350"/>
even this great bleſſing would yield but little ſatisfaction, without a reaſonable proſpect of its continuance. It may be proper to inquire,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now the ſtability of times ſeems to ſuppoſe a previous ſtate of quietneſs and peace, and that ſuch a peace as is generally acceptable; wherein the dignity of the crown, and the honour of the nation is ſecured, the full extent of its dominion maintained, and perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, ſo far at leaſt as may be a reaſonable ſecurity againſt future encroachments—The ſources of its wealth, its trade and commerce, preſerved and extended, and in general every juſt right or claim aſcertained with ſo much preciſion, as if poſſible to leave no room either to caſual or wilful miſconſtruction. And this by the bleſſing of Almighty God is ſuppos'd to be our preſent caſe, and is what we are this day aſſembled to bleſs God for.—But if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this we could ſuppoſe a peace to be raſhly or haſtily concluded, without judgment
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009361_0014_103211538BC09F08"/>
or deliberation, without a proper attention and reſolution preciſely to fix and determine every claim which former allowed rights, and the ſuperiority of arms give juſt reaſon to demand; eſpecially if any thing grievous and unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the body of the nation, or to great numbers of the people in it, ſhould be left unadjuſted, in ſuch a caſe as this, I ſay, it is impoſſible that the times ſhould be ſtable or quiet; the nation will be under perpetual apprehenſions of ſome new attack, or foreign invaſion, while they are ſenſible that their treaties have been but looſly conſtructed, or weakly guarded.</p>
            <p>STABILITY of times then you ſee implies a previous ſtate of peace, founded upon terms that are honourable, and generally ſatisfactory. A peace that promiſes all reaſonable ſecurity againſt foreign violence, and that leaves no juſt occaſion to faction or diſſention at home. In regard to the former perhaps no treaties can be ſo far relied on, as to diſpenſe with a conſtant ſtate of preparation, or to neglect ſecuring the moſt ſuitable and natural alliances. And in reſpect to the latter, an impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, and a diſintereſted diſtribution of rewards, will go a great way in preventing any inbred diſturbance; at leaſt they will ſo far ſuppreſs the ſeeds of faction and diſorder, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009361_0015_1032115511154698"/>
they will not come to maturity, or acquire ſtrength enough to endanger the peace and quiet of the ſtate. Theſe two things therefore ſeem to be ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the peace and tranquility of any nation, that there does not appear, in a human view, any room to hope for ſtability without their concurrence. For whenever the people have an ill opinion of their treaties, they loſe all confidence in that kind of ſecurity, and deliver themſelves up to perpetual apprehenſions of violence from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and this alſo naturally produces factions and diſturbance at home; ſo that there can be no ſuch thing as ſtability of times, where a peace is not deem'd honourable, and where it is not generally acceptable.</p>
            <p>IT is our preſent happineſs in regard to the firſt of theſe (I mean foreign violence) to have all the ſecurity that human means can give by the late honourable peace, which ſince we had the opportunity of making upon our own terms, muſt be ſuppoſed to contain every thing that we could reaſonably demand. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a matter that lies entirely with our ſuperiors, and every good ſubject will be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of cenſuring their proceedings, although he ſhould not perfectly comprehend all the advantages that are ſaid to ariſe from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009361_0016_10321156EB3EC148"/>
BUT then, as to the other thing neceſſary to a permanent peace, the guarding againſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and faction at home, this will very much, if not wholly depend upon ourſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we are but careful not to give way to a turbulent diſpoſition, to faction and diſcontent, we may ſo far conſide in the wiſdom of our ſuperiors as to be under very little apprehenſion of foreign dangers.</p>
            <p>No man of the leaſt reflection can be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what great advantages that nation enjoys, which is not only in a ſtate of perfect peace with its neighbours, but poſſeſſes uninterrupted quiet and tranquility at home, which is neither threatned with foreign inſult, nor moleſted by inbred commotions, which generally ſpeaking, are far more dangerous than the other, at leaſt, when they riſe to any conſiderable heighth. It has indeed been ſaid, that 
  <q>ſmall diſturbances do the ſame ſervice in the ſtate that the winds do in the air, by motion to keep it from ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and putrefaction:<note n="†" place="bottom">Bp. of Gloceſ.</note>
               </q>
but when once the winds are raiſed, no one can tell when they will be laid, or how ſtrong they will grow; and that which was wantonly raiſed to ſerve a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent turn, may in time come to overturn a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009361_0017_103211597767DE50"/>
WE muſt not indeed ſuppoſe, that every ſmall inquietude, that every little party or faction that happens to take place, will be able to accompliſh ſuch extraordinary and pernicious events, yet certainly it will not be diſputed, but that they are liable to produce many fatal and deſtructive conſequences, which tho' not always immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparent, will yet in time become ſufficiently manifeſt, in a general corruption of manners, in breaking looſe from all proper reſtraint, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a partial diſtribution not only of favours but rewards, directed ſolely or chiefly by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of prejudice, party or undue affection, thereby ſtirring up a bitterneſs of reſentment, and all the ill effects of envy, anger and malice. By this means the very principles of juſtice and charity will be extinguiſhed, and each man in ſupport of his own party will be liable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf in ſlander and detraction, and every vice that is diſhonourable to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now when this ſort of corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes general, it greatly diminiſhes if it does not totally eradicate, every ſentiment of honour, every principle of obedience, and all concern for the public good and ſafety, which hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, without heſitation or remorſe are made a ſacrifice to party deſigns, to ambition or vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to intereſt, envy or reſentment. When ſuch a temper as this prevails it muſt greatly perplex the wiſeſt adminiſtration, the public counſels
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009361_0018_1032115B127A3D68"/>
and reſolutions not being properly ſupported muſt be various and fluctuating, utterly deſtructive to the public credit and reputation, unworthy the confidence of any neighbouring power, and conſequently neither feared nor ſought to.</p>

               </gap> of ſuch unquiet and diſorderly times, as well as thoſe who are the chief promoters of them. Could you boaſt the richeſt ſoil, the happieſt climate, the greateſt flow of wealth that your hearts could wiſh; tho' the laws of your country promiſe the utmoſt care of your wealth and liberty and life and honour, yet if you are apprehenſive that theſe may be given up, and made a ſacrifice to diſſention and diſcord, what ſatisfaction can ariſe from ſuch a ſtate? What conſolation is there in reflecting that you are this day happy, in every enjoyment of life, while you are haunted with the fears of loſing all tomorrow? Such apprehenſions for ſome years paſt were not utterly without grounds, while we were engaged with numerous and powerful enemies; and now ſince we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from theſe fears by the invaluable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of peace, God grant that we may not by internal diſcord and infatuation <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

SOME may poſſibly imagine that theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections do but little concern us, in theſe remote parts of the Britiſh dominions: But ſuch people do not ſeem to conſider, that our happineſs and proſperity are ſo intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that of the nation in general, that they muſt ſtand or fall together. We have the happineſs to be a part, and begin really to be conſidered as an intereſting part of this great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore muſt look upon ourſelves as deeply concerned in every thing that befalls her, whether it be proſperous or adverſe. You cannot but remember that the late war was at firſt undertaken in defence of theſe remote colonies, and to repel the encroachments that were made upon us by a reſtleſs enemy; theſe ends being now obtained, gratitude as well as duty and intereſt, invite us to rejoice in the common happineſs, to contribute as far as in us lies in our ſeveral ſtations, to promote the internal peace order and ſtability of that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, from whence our ſafety and felicity, under God, are derived. For ſhould a ſpirit of unquietneſs and diſturbance at home, defeat the great ends and bleſſing of peace, and render the times unſtable, it will be in vain for us to look for ſtability in this land, how diſtant ſoever it be from the root or ſource of ſuch evils.</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be thought that ſuch a reflection as this, is foreign to the buſineſs of a day dedicated to joy and gratitude; I ſhall only
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009361_0020_1032115F24CB5790"/>
ſay, that it was deſigned as a contraſt to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the bleſſings of peace and ſtability, in a fuller and ſtronger light, and by that means to excite you to uſe all your power and influence, each one in his reſpective ſtation, to preſerve the bleſſing which God has graciouſly put into your hands, and not to deſpiſe or undervalue it, becauſe poſſibly it may not contain every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that ſome ſanguine people might expect.</p>
            <p>THE mention of this is a natural introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other thing I promiſed to ſpeak to, and that was,</p>
            <p>II. To ſhew how this great bleſſing may be obtained.</p>
            <p>Now the text aſſures us that this is brought about by wiſdom and knowledge. <hi>Wiſdom and knowledge ſhall be the ſtability of thy times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WISDOM is of two kinds, political and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, each of them is derived from God, who is <hi>the giver of every good and perfect gift.</hi> It is the latter of theſe which I apprehend to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the text, and which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Here then it is plain that to cultivate the duties of religion is the moſt effectual if not the only means of procuring ſtability of times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of obtaining a firm and laſting eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the peace lately ſettled. A ſerious care to encourage and propagate religion is certainly the beſt way to ſecure the peace and happineſs of any nation. This is a truth which receives confirmation from the hiſtory of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>BUT without entering into ſuch an extenſive enquiry, we may venture to affirm, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God is pleaſed to beſtow even political wiſdom upon thoſe who have the conduct of the public affairs of any nation, it is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as the effect of his favour, and a reaſonable preſumption of that nation's ſtability. For peace and ſecurity are the natural effects of ſuch wiſdom, and may generally be depended upon to flow from it. I ſay generally, becauſe when men grow conceited and preſumptive upon it, and forgetful of the hand from whence their wiſdom is derived; aſcribe all their ſucceſs and happineſs to their own counſels; In ſuch caſes God is often known to oppoſe himſelf to this pride and ſelf ſufficiency, by <hi>confounding the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe, and bringing to nought the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the prudent,</hi> to the intent <hi>that no

               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>There is a fooliſh and a wretched pride, wherewith men being tranſported, can ill endure to aſcribe unto God the honour of thoſe actions, in which it hath pleaſed him to uſe their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, courage or foreſight. Therefore it is commonly ſeen, that they, who entring into battle, are careful to pray for aid from heaven, with due acknowledgment of his power, who is the giver of victory; when the field is won, do vaunt of their own exploits; one telling how he got ſuch a ground of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; another how he gave check to ſuch a battalion; a third how he ſeized on the enemies cannon; every one ſtriving to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify himſelf, whilſt all forget God, as one that had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the action. To aſcribe to fortune the effects of another man's virtue, is I confeſs, an argument of malice. Yet this is true, that as he which findeth better ſucceſs, than he did, or in reaſon might expect, is deeply bound to acknowledge God the author of his happineſs; ſo he whoſe meer wiſdom and labour hath brought things to a proſperous iſſue, is doubly bound to ſhew himſelf thankful, both for the victory, and for thoſe virtues by which the victory was gotten.

of God, and in another aſcribes them to the hand of the diligent. In ſhort, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that this ſort of wiſdom, tho' we call it a natural endowment, is a gift and bleſſing that cometh from God. But when I ſpeak of it as a divine gift, and naturally productive of peace and ſtability, I would not be underſtood to mean that deceit and cunning and diſguiſe, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſurps the name of wiſdom; for this is productive of nothing but fraud and corruption, and will be ſo far from producing quiet and ſtability, that it tends to exaſperate thoſe who are deceived by it, to raiſe tumults and factions, and to throw every thing into confuſion.</p>
            <p>SUCH temporary expedients, when they are founded in deceit, are very precarious, and being once detected, will expoſe the unhappy contrivers of them, not only to be deſerted by their friends, but to become the ſcorn and contempt of thoſe who have been injured by them, and perhaps alſo made to feel their reſentment.</p>
            <p>BUT where truth and honour, where inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and virtue are made the baſis of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and every meaſure is certainly, if not apparently directed with a view to public good, there we may diſcover the true plan of that wiſdom which promiſes ſtability. And after all the vain efforts of falſhood and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, no principle ſhort of this will do honour

to thoſe who have the management of public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or bring laſting peace and ſecurity to a country. 
  <q>In ſhort political wiſdom ſhould never be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from that which is religious, and great men would do well never to let this maxim of eternal truth be abſent from their minds, that God Almighty governs the world,<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Wilcocks.</note>

and in conſequence of it endeavour above all things ſo to conduct themſelves, as to engage his favour and approbation in all their deſigns, and to look upon the encouragement of religion and piety as the only way to a laſting peace, or in the phraſe of the text, to render the times ſtable.</p>
            <p>NOR is it ſufficient that thoſe who have the management of public affairs, are endued with this religious wiſdom, it muſt likewiſe extend to all orders and degrees of men among us, if we would ſecure to ourſelves the bleſſing promiſed in the text. It would be very eaſy to ſhow how neceſſary an influence this religious wiſdom has, in ſecuring the peace and eſtabliſhing the happineſs of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by mentioning the virtues it recommends; ſuch are the conſcientious adminiſtration of juſtice in the rulers, and a quiet and peaceable ſubmiſſion and obedience in the people. For every man is inſtructed by it to keep within the bounds of his own ſtation—to ſubdue every luſt and paſſion, from whence public diſorders ariſe—to put on a temper of meekneſs and love towards each other,—to be not only honeſt and juſt and upright, but to be kind and tender and charitable.—It leaves no room for pride or envy, for diſcontent or faction, for peeviſhneſs or murmuring, or any of thoſe evil

diſpoſitions which interrupt the peace of ſociety, and therefore wherever the voice of this wiſdom is generally heard and obey'd, it is impoſſible but that the community muſt enjoy an uninterrupted tranquility.</p>
            <p>WE find then at laſt that the continuance of our happineſs, the ſtability here ſpoken of, is put into our own power, and made to depend upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If we will but truly and ſincerely cultivate the knowledge and the fear of God; if we will in good earneſt obey the laws of that holy religion which we profeſs to believe; if we will ſeek after that <hi>wiſdom which cometh from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be entreated, full of good fruits, without partiality and without hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy:</hi>

            <p>I TAKE it for granted you ſee that peace, nay that the preſent peace, notwithſtanding its ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed imperfections, is a great and real bleſſing, and deſerves the utmoſt returns of praiſe and gratitude to God, that we are capable of paying. I am ſure we ſhould have thought ſo, if this event could have been foreſeen. Had there been a prophet among us, who had foretold the various ſucceſs we have experienced in the courſe of the late war, together with the preſent happy iſſue of it, we ſhould hardly have dared to credit ſuch a flattering prophecy; but if we had done ſo, we ſhould certainly have been ready to overflow with joy and thankſgiving at the

Nor can I ſuppoſe that you have been utterly inſenſible of his chaſtiſements, witneſs the repeated humiliations, the many earneſt prayers and intreaties you have ſent up to heaven, that God would put a ſtop to the ravages and miſeries of war, and reſtore peace and tranquility to the nations. God has at length heard your prayers, and granted your requeſts, he has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the ſword, and commanded the nations to peace. How ſoon was that powerful voice obey'd? Like the irreſiſtible word at the creation, which but commanded and it was done: Or like that authoritative rebuke of our Saviour to the winds and the ſea—peace be ſtill—and there was a calm; the winds were huſh'd, and the ſea obey'd. In like manner, in the midſt of all the fury and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed preparation for war, God ſpake the word and it was done, he commanded and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending intereſts were huſh'd to peace. Peace is the work of God, as war is his permiſſive ſcourge: Blind mortals indeed purſue their own reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but it is God who governs all, and conducts all to accompliſh the wiſe ends of his providence.</p>

GOD has, I ſay, anſwered your prayers, and given you the peace you ſo earneſtly deſired and prayed for, and you are taught by the prophet how to ſecure and make it laſting, and that is by a wiſe and religious improvement of it, to the honour and praiſe of God. Remember what was ſaid to the Iſraelites after their conqueſt of the land of Canaan. <hi>Take good heed to yourſelves, that ye love the Lord your God; elſe know for a certainty, that the Lord your God will reſerve the remnant of theſe nations, the inhabitants of the land to be ſcourges in your ſides, and thorns in your eyes.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiii. 11. 13.</note> I ſhall make no other application of this paſſage than to remind you, that if you ſhall neglect that religious wiſdom which is the only certain means of your ſecurity, how natural it is to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould in like manner cauſe the barbarous ſavages of this land, to become <hi>ſcourges in your ſides,</hi> and <hi>thorns in your eyes</hi> to afflict you. Such apprehenſions as theſe, ſince they are not merely imaginary, ſhould create in you ſeriouſneſs in the midſt of rejoicing, as not knowing what viſitation God has further in ſtore for you.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time ſince we have the higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to praiſe and thankfulneſs, let us acknowlege the bleſſings of God with a perfect heart; let us own him for our protector helper and mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, whoſe powerful hand and ſtretched out arm, hath wrought ſalvation for us, and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conducted us through a long and dangerous conteſt, and at laſt hath given us to ſee and enjoy

IF therefore you are deſirous of rendring this great bleſſing ſtable and laſting, be perſuaded each of you according to your ſeveral ſtations and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to endeavour to make it ſo: Firſt of all by cultivating the firmeſt allegiance to our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, and a becoming concern for, and dutiful ſubmiſſion to, our excellent eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in church and ſtate, which the divine goodneſs has ſtill continued to us, not withſtanding the perpetual reſtleſs attempts of our enemies to deprive us of it, and notwithſtanding our own great unworthineſs of this diſtinguiſhing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And let us be particularly cautious not to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diviſions, or give countenance to murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcontent, to a turbulent and unruly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor entertain groundleſs apprehenſions as to the adminiſtration of affairs whether national or provincial.</p>
            <p>BUT above all things let us take care to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate that religious wiſdom and knowledge which was mentioned before, and which is expreſsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the text. This will enſure to us the countenance of heaven, and the favour of the moſt high, and will preſerve us from every evil attempt or accident whether foreign or domeſtic. And to this end it will be neceſſary to acknowledge the manifold offences that are amongſt us, and to put on ſerious reſolutions of amendment, to be wail the infidelity that is in the land, and which ſpreads like a peſtilence, as well as the coldneſs and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of thoſe who are yet untainted with the infection, the great neglect of God, his word and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009361_0030_1032117203722FD8"/>
worſhip and ordinances, together with that general diſſolution and diſſipation of virtue, honour and integrity which all the divine diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, whether merciful or afflictive, have not been able to amend.</p>
            <p>WOULD you be perſuaded in good earneſt to take up ſuch ſerious reſolutions as theſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the divine aſſiſtance endeavour to put them in practice, you might then be aſſured of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of God's favour, and in conſequence of that might ſtand entitled to the bleſſing promiſed in the text. But if you remain ſtill careleſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, forgetful of God and negligent of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, your preſent happineſs will ſwiftly paſs away, and the ſunſhine of favour which you now enjoy, will ſoon be covered with clouds of darkneſs and ſorrow. You may indeed be unmindful of God, but he will not be unmindful of you, his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations will ſtill purſue you, either to procure your amendment, if mercy or chaſtiſement will effect it, or to accompliſh your final exciſion, if theſe are obſtinately and perſeveringly reſiſted. We are now by the bleſſing of God, at the ſummit perhaps of national happineſs; let us take heed that we grow not giddy with the height: The danger is viſible, and the fall may be irrecoverable. If on the one hand we grow intoxicated with preſent felicity, and thereby let go the fear of God, or on the other hand ſhould we murmur that our happineſs is incomplete, inſtead of thanking God for that meaſure of it we enjoy, in either caſe the event is to be dreaded. Our love will be found to wax cold, both to God and our country, and then a

            <p>To prevent theſe or the like pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, let us receive the bleſſings God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us with pious and grateful hearts. Let us praiſe the name of God with a ſong, and magnify it with thankſgiving. Let us teſtify the ſenſe we have of his preſence with us in all our paſt diſtreſs, and his gracious influence in the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event which we now celebrate, by devoting ourſelves to his ſervice, and by our humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the throne of grace, that as he hath been pleaſed to hearken to our prayers, and give us this deſirable bleſſing of peace, ſo he would vouchſafe to render the ſame ſtable and laſting, that it may continue from generation to generation.</p>
