            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>NATIONAL CREDIT AND CHARACTER. 1790.</head>
            <p>THIS country will more and more experience the good effects of the ſteadineſs, wiſdom, and energy of her general government. The ability of America is now conſolidated in an approved and adequate ſyſtem, which will give conſequence abroad and aſſure harmony and protection at home; whereas a number of little ſovereignties were rather threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetual diſcord, with inſecurity, and every effect oppoſed to the good ſought by men in forming governments, for the protection of their perſons, and of the wages of their labour and care, againſt bad people at home and enemies abroad.</p>
            <p>UNDER this efficacious, mild, and free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over an extenſive and fine country, we have now before us a report of the price of her freedom, and of the means for ſatisfying her creditors; which is nervous, clear, and promiſing, as it alſo is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to the abilities and integrity of the Secretary of her Treaſury. It offers nought to inthral its honeſt purpoſe of performing what this people na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally promiſed they would perform, and for which they have a conſideration; though indeed in national engagements a conſideration, or value re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is not neceſſary to give validity to them. What, between man and man, would be <hi>nudum

A national promiſe requires the moſt ready and complete performance, in all caſes, and will not admit of circumlocution or modification, however ſmooth the preſence. Governments ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be capable of committing a breach of faith in trimming their engagements, whatever be the plauſible advantages propoſed, will be in low credit; and, when truſted, muſt pay a premium, in a high intereſt, for eſtimated riſques.</p>
            <p>A FULL unequivocal <hi>performance</hi> of engagements, in every iota, ſtamping a character of inflexible integrity in the ſovereign authority of a nation, will communicate to ſuch nation the higheſt credit and reſpect with the attendants national health and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: whereas, nations deficient therein, will want, will be weak, will be deranged will be neceſſitous; and muſt pay at dear and ruinous rates.

To the account of <hi>ignorance,</hi> is chargeable the general depravity of Europe, for moſt if not all of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of the chriſtian era, which have preceded the preſent; and it was the <hi>ignorance</hi> of <hi>ſovereigns</hi> and of <hi>legiſlators.</hi> It led them to believe that their ſafety, their grandeur, and their happineſs depended on their brutalizing the people, who were under their ſubjection. They did brutalize, they ſwaggered in diabolical wantonneſs, and they dogmatiſed: but apprehenſion of aſſaſſination or of deprivation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually grating their minds. The people were wretched—the ſovereign more wretched—all were <hi>ignorant;</hi> and it was an arcanum of thoſe who could read, to prevent others from learning to read: the body of the people were to be kept in ignorance, ſurpaſſing the ignorance of their feudal ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns—but clerks read, and clerks read for their own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.—It was the art of printing which became the great inſtrument in diffuſing <hi>knowledge,</hi> as it aroſe in the minds of a few people of wiſdom and goodneſs, and was by them communicated to the world through that noble inſtrument. The preſs has nearly annihilated tyranny, in diffuſing <hi>knowledge</hi> to the world, and warning wiſdom of her danger from the wicked. It is to be lamented, however, that this noble friend of mankind ſhould ever have been perverted to become the inſtrument of incendiaries—or of malicious ſlanderers. Whilſt it is free to communicate intelligence of a public nature, common ſenſe—humanity—the ſweets of ſocial happineſs—and a conſciouſneſs of its own dignity and office, will forbid its degenerating into a vehicle of chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat abuſe and ſcandal of individuals in private life, or of malignancy towards the government of the country. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of communication concerning public affairs, will be expected from it,—it will be ſought for by the people, whilſt it ſpeaks to the <hi>underſtanding:</hi> but attempts to impoſe ribaldry on them, would diſguſt their good ſenſe, as being foreign to any good purpoſe, and affrontive to their underſtandings.</note> —where will it end! Even in the courſe of enacting laws on other common occaſions, a weakneſs appearing in them cheapens a legiſlature, in the judgment of the world, and leſſens energy in the government; for it leſſens <hi>opinion</hi> of the abilities of her public men; which mars confidence in the government tinged with ignorance or affected with caprice: this aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly is a ſink to public credit.</p>
