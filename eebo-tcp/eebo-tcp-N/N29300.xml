            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of the year 1799, I received from my friend Dr. LETTSOM of London, a copy of Dr. EDWARD JENNER's "<hi>inquiry into the cauſes and effects of the</hi> VARIOLAE VACCINAE, or COW-POX"; a diſeaſe totally unknown in this quarter of the world. On peruſing this work, I was ſtruck with the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages that might accrue to this country,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039022_0003_10138A79DFDDE1F8"/>and indeed to the human race at large, from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a mild diſtemper that would ever after ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the conſtitution from that terrible ſcourge, the ſmall-pox. My attention was not the leſs awakened by a previous impreſſion that the ſmall-pox came originally from the brute creation; for all that I could recollect of the hiſtory of the famous Mahomet, and his <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</hi> and of modern Arabia, conſpired to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the idea that the ſmall-pox came to the human race through the bruce creation.</p>
               <p>DR. GEORGE PEARSON's book, which I received ſoon after that of Dr. JENNER's, confirmed in a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory manner the moſt important part of JENNER's doctrine.</p>
               <p>As the ordinary mode of communicating even me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical diſcoveries in this country is by news-papers, I drew up the following account of the <hi>cow-pox,</hi> which was printed in the <hi>Columbian Centinel,</hi> March 12th, 1799.</p>
               <p>SOMETHING CURIOUS IN THE MEDICAL LINE.</p>
               <p>EVERY body has heard of thoſe diſtempers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pocks or puſtles, called the <hi>ſmall pox,</hi> the <hi>chicken-pox</hi> and the <hi>ſwine-pox,</hi> but few have ever heard of the <hi>cow-pox,</hi> or if you like the term better, the <hi>cow ſmall-pox</hi>; or to expreſs it in technical lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the <hi>variolae vaccinae.</hi> There is, however, ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039022_0004_10138AAA6FFE6850"/>a diſeaſe, which has been noticed here and there in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of England, more particularly in Glouceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhire, for ſixty or ſeventy years paſt, but has never been an object of medical inquiry until very lately.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>variolae vaccinae</hi> or <hi>cow-pox,</hi> is very readily communicated to thoſe who milk cows infected with it. This malady appears firſt on the teats of the cows in the form of irregular puſtles or pocks.<note n="*" place="bottom">See JENNER, p. 3. &amp; 4.</note> They are commonly of a paliſh blue, ſomewhat approaching to livid, and ſurrounded by an eryſipelatous inflammation, reſembling the St. Anthony's fire. Theſe puſtles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs timely remedied, degenerate into thoſe ragged ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers known by the ſurgeons under the name of <hi>phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denic.</hi> The cows ſoon become ſick, and the ſecretion of milk is leſſened, but I never heard of one dying with it. Thoſe who milk cows thus effected, ſeldom or ever fail catching the diſtemper, <hi>if there be cracks, wounds, or abraſions in the hands.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>they are inoculated.</hi> When infected, there appear on different parts of the hands and wriſts, inflamed ſpots, having the appearance of bliſters, produced by burns. Theſe run quickly on to ſuppuration. Theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſuppurations have a circular form with their edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es more elevated than the centre, very much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a certain ſtage of the ſmall-pox. Theſe depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed puſtles or pocks, are of a colour approaching to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039022_0005_10138A7B6DAEF628"/>blue. Abſorption now takes place, and a ſoreneſs and ſometimes tumors appear in the arm pits. Then the arterial ſyſtem becomes affected; the pulſe is quickened, and ſhivering with a general laſſitude and pains in the back and limbs ſupervene, and theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are not unfrequently accompanied with vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There is too, a pain in the head and dizzineſs. Theſe ſymptoms varying in their degrees and violence, generally continue from one day to three or four, leaving ulcerated ſores about the hands, reſembling thoſe on the cows teats, from whence they ſprung. The lips, noſtrils and eye-lids are ſometimes affected with ſores, but theſe evidently ariſe from their being rubbed or ſcratched with the patient's infected fingers. This is the common courſe of the diſeaſe with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies. <hi>No perſon was ever known to die of this diſtemper.</hi> But what makes this newly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſeaſe ſo very curious, and ſo extremely important is, that every perſon thus affected, is EVER AFTER SECURED FROM THE ORDINARY SMALL-POX, <hi>let him be ever ſo much expoſed to the effluvium of it, or let ever ſo much ripe matter be inſerted into the ſkin by inoculation.</hi> In other words—a perſon who has undergone the <hi>local</hi> diſeaſe and <hi>ſpecific fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> occaſioned by the cow-pox infection, is <hi>thereby rendered ever after unſuſceptible of the ſmall pox.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. PEARSON's publication.</note> It is worthy of remark that the infection of the cow-pox
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039022_0006_10138AAC12097A38"/>can be conveyed to the human ſpecies by the ordinary mode of inoculation. And it is obſerved, that there is no difference in the effects of the matter taken from the cow, and of the matter generated ſucceſſively in the ſecond, third, fourth or fifth human creature.</p>
               <p>SUCH are the outlines of a mild diſeaſe, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which may lead to conſequences of the utmoſt importance to the whole human race, no leſs indeed than that <hi>of ſuperceding, if not extinguiſhing, that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcourge, the ſmall-pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DR. EDWARD JENNER, is the phyſician in England, who has collected and arranged a ſeries of facts and experiments reſpecting the diſeaſe called there the <hi>cow-pox.</hi> His ſhort work is commented on by Dr. GEORGE PEARSON, phyſician to St. George's hoſpital, London.</p>
               <p>THIS imperfect ſketch is thrown into the news-paper at this time, with a view of exciting the attention of our dairy farmers to ſuch a diſtemper among their cows. It may alſo be gratifying to ſome of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of medicine, who, it is preſumed, are not yet gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally informed of an <hi>epizootic</hi> diſeaſe, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communicated from the brute to the human kind, and which when communicated, is <hi>a certain ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſmall-pox.</hi> The public anxiety has been rouſed of late, to ſearch after the cauſe of a deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039022_0007_10138A808E78F0D8"/>
                  <hi>fever.</hi> Their attention has been directed merely to <hi>effluvia, vapours</hi> or <hi>gaſſes,</hi> while they may here ſee a diſeaſe, the <hi>neareſt a kin</hi> to the ſmall-pox of any yet known, which is never communicated by effluvia, or medium of the air. It is highly probable that ſome of the moſt diſtreſſing diſeaſes which afflict man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, have an <hi>animal</hi> origin; and time may prove, that ſmall-pox, whooping-cough, and one kind of quincy, have like the hydrophobia, a ſimilar ſource.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambridge, March,</hi> 12, 1799.</p>
               <p>THIS publication ſhared the fate of moſt others on new diſcoveries. A few received it as a very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diſcovery, highly intereſting to humanity; ſome doubted it; others obſerved that wiſe and prudent conduct, which allows them to condemn or applaud, as the event might prove; while a greater number ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ridiculed it as one of thoſe medical whims which ariſe to-day and to-morrow are no more.</p>
               <p>AT a meeting of the AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES, held a few weeks after, in one of the rooms of this Univerſity, I communicated what I knew of this novel diſtemper, by exhibiting Dr. JEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER's beautiful publication, and recapitulating as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt prominent parts of Dr. PEARSON's book as I could recollect, for I had lent and loſt the work itſelf. The reception of this communication was
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039022_0008_10138AAE58C64130"/>much to my ſatisfaction, eſpecially with the ILLUSTRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS PRESIDENT, who to a profound erudition in laws and politics, joins a no ſmall knowledge in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of medicine<note n="*" place="bottom">Leſt this ſhould ever be read beyond the bounds of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, it will not be ſuperfluous to add here, that THE PRESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES IS JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHEN this verbal communication was made, I promiſed to prepare a memoir on the ſubject by the next quarterly meeting. But before that period ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, Dr. WOODVILL's publication came to my hands, which I found ſo entirely to the purpoſe, that I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held my memoir, and preſented the Academy with the book itſelf, as containing a chain of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and facts, arranged in the form of a table, vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond what I could procure elſe where. This publication is entitled, "REPORTS <hi>of a ſeries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculations for the</hi> VARIOLAE VACCINAE, or COW-POX, <hi>with remarks and obſervations on this diſeaſe, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſubſtitute for the ſmall-pox,</hi> by WILLIAM WOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILLE, M. D. <hi>Phyſician to the ſmall-pox and Inoculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hoſpitals in the city of</hi> London."</p>
               <p>THIS work I found contained juſt what I wiſhed, a ſeries of experiments, conducted by a learned phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039022_0009_10138A82182BAAF8"/>long converſant with the caſual and inoculated ſmall-pox, in the largeſt city in the world. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication bore an additional weight from the opinion given me by Dr. HAYGARTH of the book and of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; there being no man now on the ſtage more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly acquainted with the laws of contagion than Dr. HAYGARTH. From this publication of Dr. WOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILL's, was formed, in a great meaſure, my ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which I made, like the firſt, through the medium of a news-paper. It is this which follows:</p>
               <p>COW-POX.</p>
               <p>THE curioſity of the public has been excited by a newly diſcovered diſeaſe, denominated from its origin, the cow-pox, an account of which I ſent you laſt March. By the hiſtory then given, it appeared that this cow-pox pretty exactly reſembles the very mildeſt ſmall-pox from inoculation; that none had ever died of it, whether man or beaſt; and that thoſe who had undergone the cow-pox, were EVER AFTER SECURED FROM THE SMALL-POX, <hi>be they ever ſo much expoſed to the effluvium of it, or ever ſo much ripe matter inſerted into the ſkin by inoculation</hi>; or in other words, that thoſe perſons who had undergone the local diſeaſe and ſpecific fever occaſioned by the cow-pox infection, <hi>are thereby rendered ever after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible of the ſmall-pox.</hi> Many parents are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039022_0010_10138AB1F192DF48"/>anxious to know if theſe aſſertions are juſtified by ſubſequent experiments, and ſubſtantiated by a well connected chain of facts. I now ſend you what infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I have gathered from my correſpondents in England, and from various publications, eſpecially from one by Dr. WOODVILLE, on this all important ſubject.</p>
               <p>Dr. WOODVILLE is phyſician to the ſmall-pox and inoculating hoſpitals in the city of London. It ſeems, that finding by Dr. JENNER's original publication, that no fatal effects had ever been known to follow from the cow-pox, and that it left the conſtitution in a ſtate of perfect ſecurity from the infection of the ſmall-pox, Dr. WOODVILLE became very anxious to try the effects of inoculating the matter of this new and ſingular diſeaſe; and as trials could be made not only with ſafety, but alſo with a proſpect to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he conceived it to be a duty that he owed the public in his official ſituation at the <hi>inoculating hoſpital,</hi> to embrace the firſt opportunity of carrying the plan into execution.</p>
               <p>HE found the diſeaſe at a cow-houſe in Gray's Inn Lane, where there were about 200 cows kept. One of the milkers, named SARAH RICE, had ſo perfect a ſpecimen of the diſtemper on her hands, that Dr.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039022_0011_10138A84A62B7C00"/>WOODVILLE entertained no doubt of its being the genuine cow-pox. It very much reſembled the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation given in the firſt plate of Dr. JENNER's publication. Dr. WOODVILLE, therefore, in Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt, went to that cow-houſe, in company with Lord SOMERVILLE, Sir JOSEPH BANKS, Sir WILLIAM WATSON, Drs. SIMMONS, PEARSON, WELLAN, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and took ſome of the purulent matter from the teats of the cow, and from SARAH RICE, with which he immediately inoculated ſeven children, by ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſkin with the point of a lancet till the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became tinged with blood. In the courſe of three months, Dr. WOODVILLE inoculated two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, whoſe caſes he has given in his pamphlet. By the month of May, he had inoculated obout ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and has exhibited the reſult as it regarded the number of puſtles, days of illneſs, &amp;c. in the form of a table. Nearly all thoſe perſons <hi>were afterwards inoculated with matter of ſmall-pox, or elſe expoſed to the infection of it in the ſmall-pox hoſpital, without the leaſt ſigns of the diſeaſe.</hi> The Dr. then points out where theſe two diſeaſes agree, and in what they differ. The cow-pox, he obſerves, in every caſe with which we are as yet acquainted, has been introduced into the human conſtitution through the medium of <hi>external local inflammation,</hi> and is therefore to be conſidered as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039022_0012_10138AB38CDA92B8"/>an <hi>inoculated diſeaſe</hi>; for there are no clear inſtances of its being received by effluvia, as is the ſmall-pox; nevertheleſs its virus ſeems to affect a ſimilar mode of action, and to be governed by the ſame laws. Thus, if a perſon be inoculated alternately with the ſmall-pox matter, and that of the cow-pox every day, till fever is excited, all the inoculations make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and as ſoon as the whole ſyſtem becomes diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they appear to be all equally advanced in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation. It is to be remembered, that the local tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor excited from the inoculation of the cow-pox, is commonly of a different appearance from that which is the conſequence of the inoculation with variolous matter. The fluid formed in the cow-pox tumor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely becomes puriform, and the ſcabs which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed are of a harder texture, and exhibit a ſmoother ſurface than the ſmall-pox.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr.WOODVILL's publication.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IT is evident from Dr. WOODVILLE's publication, that the matter of the cow-pox has generally produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>much fewer puſtles and leſs indiſpoſition,</hi> than that from the inoculated ſmall-pox; for it appears from his ſummary or table, that about two fifths of all the perſons inoculated for the cow-pox, <hi>had no puſtles at all,</hi> and that in not more than a fourth part of them <hi>was there experienced a perceptible diſorder.</hi> But it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039022_0013_10138A871FF847C8"/>muſt at the ſame time be acknowledged, ſays Dr. WOODVILLE, that in ſeveral inſtances, the cow-pox has proved a very ſevere diſeaſe. Some had 200, ſome 300, and ſome 500, and two had 1000 puſtles. One infant at the breaſt died on the eleventh day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cow-pox matter had been inſerted into its arm. In this ſolitary fatal caſe, the local tumor was very ſlight, and the eruptive ſymptoms took place on the ſeventh day, when the child was ſeized with convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fits, which carried it off. The puſtles were from 80 to 100. Can we, however, be certain it died in conſequence of inoculation? Finally, the inſtances which have been brought forward to prove, that thoſe who have undergone the cow-pox, reſiſted the infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the ſmall-pox, are <hi>unquestionable</hi> and <hi>decisive,</hi> and ſufficiently numerous to eſtabliſh that important fact. This circumſtance, then, ſays Dr. WOODVILLE, appears to be as much a general law of the ſyſtem, as that a perſon having had the ſmall-pox is thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unſuſceptible of receiving the diſeaſe a ſecond time. For all the patients, ſays he, whom I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated with variolous matter, after they had paſſed through the cow-pox, none were affected with the ſmall-pox; and it may be remarked, that nearly a fourth part were ſo ſlightly affected with the cow-pox, that it neither produced any perceptible indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor puſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:039022_0014_10138AB7ABB1A370"/>I HAVE thought it not improper to throw thus much before the public at this time. We live in the ſcrutinizing aera of experiment, and we cannot doubt but our brethren in England, will purſue this important ſubject with an indefatigability, character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of the nation, and produce a ſtill longer chain of facts, which ſeems abſolutely neceſſary before we can all unite in the reſolution to diſcard the inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſmall-pox, and adopt that of the cow.</p>
               <p>B. WATERHOUSE.</p>
               <p>Cambridge, Nov. 15, 1799.</p>
               <p>I NOW found that the brief hiſtory which I had given of the origin and progreſs of this diſeaſe made a favorable impreſſion on the minds of the people; for the dread of that terrible ſcourge the ſmall-pox is ſtill great in America, eſpecially in New-England, as is ſufficiently obvious by the numerous laws and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for preventing its contagion, and which are all deſcribed in my letter to Dr. HAYGARTH, printed in London in the year 1782, and glanced at in ſeveral ſubſequent letters to be found in that gentlemans' "<hi>ſketch of a plan to exterminate the caſual ſmall-pox from Great-Britain, printed at Warrington in</hi> 1792, <hi>and dedicated, by permiſſion, to the</hi> KING."</p>
               <p>PERCEIVING that this diſeaſe began to excite a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of enquiry among our literary men, I deemed it of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039022_0015_10138A898F853C70"/>importance to collect and examine every thing that had or might be publiſhed on the ſubject, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, from my correſpondents in England, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation reſpecting a diſtemper ſo intereſting to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p>As the great queſtion which the profeſſional public were anxious to have reſolved was, <hi>whether a perſon who had been fairly infected with the genuine</hi> cow <hi>or</hi> KINE-POX, <hi>were thereby ſecured againſt the ſmall-pox,</hi> I bent all my enquiries to aſcertain this point.</p>
               <p>IT would be ſuperfluous to mention every queſtion I put, and tedious to relate the different anſwers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Suffice it for the preſent to ſay, that I made my enquiries of phyſicians living in different parts of Great-Britain, and of thoſe too who were the leaſt ſanguine, although moſt intereſted in the event; of men, who objected much, and believed ſlowly, yet have in the end become its moſt potent advocates. And I do now deliberately declare, that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a croud of evidence in confirmation of the doctrine, "that the cow, or kine-pox renders the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frame unſuſceptible of the ſmall-pox", too great to be reſiſted by any mind not perverted by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. In truth, the ſubject has been traced in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by thoſe who doubted, until conviction became too ſtrong for argument, and theoretical objections
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039022_0016_10138ABA4A971710"/>gave way to ſtubborn facts. The conſequence has been, that THIRTY THOUSAND perſons, from two weeks old and upwards, have paſſed ſafely through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Dr. JENNER has been particularly noticed by the KING, who gave him permiſſion to dedicate the new edition of his book to him.</p>
               <p>BUT diſtance of ſpace operates on ſome minds like diſtance of time. People are not ſo ready to believe what happened a great while ago, or a great way off. I therefore found it neceſſary to bring the matter home to us, and to repeat in America the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments performed on the other ſide of the Atlantic. I wiſhed alſo to examine another <hi>important fact,</hi> of which ſome eminent phyſicians in London expreſſed ſome doubts, and which I myſelf was anxious to ſee more firmly eſtabliſhed, namely, <hi>whether this new diſeaſe, this</hi> COW-POX, <hi>or</hi> KINE-POX, (denominate it which you will) <hi>be really not</hi> CONTAGIOUS, <hi>or catching from one perſon to another.</hi> And I do now aſſert, that from all the experiments hitherto made public, it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that <hi>this ſubſtitute for the ſmall-pox cannot be communicated by any other means than by the actual</hi> CONTACT OF MATTER; or in other words, <hi>is not catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one perſon to another by effluvia, like the ſmall-pox or measles.</hi> Even the cows do not convey the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper by effluvia, or when there is a fence or hedge
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039022_0017_10138A8C0A0308B8"/>interpoſed between them; and not, ſays Dr. JENNER, unleſs they be handled or milked by thoſe who bring the infectious matter with them.<note n="*" place="bottom">See JENNER's "further obſervations on the VARIOLAE VACCINAE."</note>

               <p>UNDER a ſerious impreſſion of effecting a public benefit, and conceiving it, moreover, a duty in my offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſituation in this Univerſity, I ſent to England for ſome of the <hi>vaccine</hi> or <hi>cow-pox-matter</hi> for trial. After ſeveral fruitleſs attempts, I obtained ſome by a ſhort paſſage from Briſtol, and with it I inoculated all the younger part of my family.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of my children that I inoculated, was a boy of five years old, named DANIEL OLIVER WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERHOUSE. I made a ſlight inciſion in the uſual place for inoculation in the arm, inſerted a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the infected thread, and covered it with a ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-plaſter. It exhibited no other appearances than what would have ariſen from any other extraneous ſubſtance, until the 6th day, when an encreaſed red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs called forth my attention. On the 8th, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of pain under the inoculated arm, and on the 9th, the inoculated part exhibited evident ſigns of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulency.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039022_0018_10138ABCD415F7C0"/>By the 10th, any one, much experienced in the inoculated ſmall-pox, would have pronounced the arm infected. The pain and ſwelling under his arm went on gradually encreaſing, and by the 11th day from inoculation, his febrile ſymptoms were pretty ſtrongly marked. The ſore in the arm proceeded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as Drs. JENNER and WOODVILLE deſcribe, and appeared to the eye very like the ſecond plate in Dr. JENNER's elegant publication. In ſhort, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſymptoms of this diſeaſe, in the <hi>old</hi> world, and in the <hi>new,</hi> were more completely alike than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. From the difference of ſituation, greater dryneſs of our atmoſphere, and extraordinary heat of the weather, (from 88. to 96. of Farht.) I did expect a greater variation.</p>
               <p>THE inoculated part in this boy, was ſurrounded by an effloreſcence which extended from his ſhoulder to his elbow, which made it neceſſary to apply ſome remedies to leſſen it; but the "<hi>ſymptoms,</hi>" as they are called, ſcarcely drew him from his play more than an hour or two; and he went through the diſeaſe in ſo light a manner, as hardly ever to expreſs any marks of peeviſhneſs. A piece of true ſkin was fairly taken out of the arm by the <hi>virus,</hi> the part appearing as if eaten out by a cauſtic, <hi>a never failing ſign of thorough ſection of the ſyſtem in the inoculated ſmall-pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:039022_0019_10138A8F49A68CF0"/>SATISFIED with the appearances and ſymptoms in this boy, I inoculated another of three years of age, with matter taken from his brother's arm, for he had no puſtles on his body. He likewiſe went through the diſeaſe in a perfect and very ſatisfactory manner. This child purſued his amuſements with as little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption as his brother. Then I inoculated a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant boy of about 12 years of age, with ſome of the infected thread from England. His arm was pretty ſore, and his "<hi>ſymptoms</hi>" pretty ſevere. He treated himſelf rather harſhly by exerciſing unneceſſarily in the garden, when the weather was extremely hot (Farht. Thermr. 96, in the ſhade!) and then waſhing his head and upper parts of his body under the pump, and ſetting, in ſhort, all rules at defiance, in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Nevertheleſs, this boy went through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order without any other accident than a ſore throat and a ſtiffneſs of the muſcles of the neck, all which ſoon vaniſhed by the help of a few remedies.</p>
               <p>BEING obliged to go from home a few days, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted my colleague Dr. WARREN, to viſit theſe children. Dr. DANFORTH, as well as ſome other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, came from Boſton out of curioſity, and ſo did ſeveral practitioners from the country. I mention this, becauſe it gave riſe to a groundleſs report, that one of the children had ſo bad an arm that I
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039022_0020_10138ABFC2966A20"/>thought it prudent to take the advice of ſome of my brethren upon it.</p>
               <p>FROM a full maturated puſtle in my little boy of three years old, I inoculated his infant ſiſter, already weaned, of one year. At the ſame time, and from the ſame puſtle, I inoculated its nurſery maid. They both went through the diſeaſe with equal regularity. As this woman was the firſt adult perſon on whom I had performed the operation, I was more conſtant in my enquiries, and more careful to note ſymptoms as they aroſe. They were very ſimilar to thoſe of the lighter kind from inoculation for the ſmall-pox, viz. a ſlight dizzineſs and nauſea, watery eyes, chillineſs, ſoreneſs of the fleſh, uſually called by the common people in this country, "<hi>bones'-ache</hi>", a general laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, tranſient pains in the region of the ſtomach, loins and head, with a diſinclination to animal food and exerciſe; yet none of theſe ſymptoms were ſo oppreſſive as to diminiſh for a moment her attention to her little charge, whoſe ſymptoms, we conjectured, kept pace with thoſe of its nurſe.</p>
               <p>THIS ſtriking ſimilarity of ſymptoms has induced ſome practitioners in this country, as well as ſome phyſicians in Great-Britain, to conclude, that the <hi>kine-pox</hi> was only a variety of the ſmall-pox. We
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039022_0021_10138A90D4613190"/>confeſs they appear to be near a kin; yet ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances lead us to conclude them ſpecifically different; for example, we can communicate the vaccine poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to any cow by inoculation, but we cannot give her by any method the ſmall-pox. This is not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, peculiar to the cow—It is true of every other brute on which the trial has been made; without which proviſion in nature, the whole human race might again ſuffer under this terrific ſcourge!</p>
               <p>I ATTEMPTED to inoculate two more of our female domeſtics, but failed, owing probably to uſing a new method recommended by an eminent ſurgeon in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which was, to paſs a needle with an infected thread through the ſkin, ſo as to leave the thread in. This, it is probable, underwent an alteration ſimilar to what happens in the operation of <hi>wire-drawing,</hi> where moſt of the oil and ſome of the metal are left behind. Then I performed the operation on four gentlemen, one of them a phyſician, whoſe ſymptoms were ſo nearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like what I have already related, that I find nothing new to add, excepting that one of them choſe to live pretty freely by way of experiment, and whoſe febrile ſymptoms, eſpecially the head-ache, were full as much as he could bear and walk about. This convinced me that the <hi>Kine-pox</hi> was a diſeaſe not to be trifled with.</p>

                     <p>YOU have doubtleſs heard of the newly diſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſorder, known in England by the name of the <hi>cow-pox,</hi> which ſo nearly reſembles the ſmall-pox, that it is now agreed in Great-Britain, that the former will paſs for the latter.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE collected every thing that has been printed, and all the information I could procure from my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents, reſpecting this diſtemper, and have been ſo thoroughly convinced of its importance to humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I have procured ſome of the vaccine matter, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039022_0023_10138A934A656850"/>therewith inoculated ſeven of my family. The inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation has proceeded in ſix of them exactly as deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by WOODVILLE and JENNER; but my deſire is to confirm the doctrine by having ſome of them inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by you.</p>
                     <p>I CAN obtain variolous matter, and inoculate them privately, but I wiſh to do it in the moſt open and public way poſſible. As I have imported a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, I conceive that the public have a right to know exactly every ſtep I take in it. I write this, therefore, to enquire whether you will, on philanthrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic principles, try the experiment of inoculating ſome of my children who have already undergone the cow-pox. If you accede to my propoſal, I ſhall conſider it as an experiment in which we have co-operated for the good of our fellow-citizens, and relate it as ſuch in the pamplet I mean to publiſh on the ſubject.</p>

               <p>To this letter the Dr. returned a polite anſwer, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me of his readineſs to give any aſſiſtance in his power, to aſcertain <hi>whether the cow-pox would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſmall-pox</hi>; obſerving, that he had at that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039022_0024_10138AC53929F8E0"/>time freſh matter that he could depend on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring me to ſend the children to the hoſpital for that purpoſe. Of the three which I offered, the Dr. choſe to try the experiment on the boy of 12 years of age, mentioned in page 20, whom he inoculated in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by two punctures, and with matter taken that moment from a patient who had it pretty full upon him. He at the ſame time, inſerted an infected thread, and then put him into the hoſpital, where was one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with it the natural way. On the 4th day, the Dr. pronounced the <hi>arm</hi> to be infected. It became every hour ſorer, but in a day or two it dried off, and grew well, without producing the ſlighteſt trace of a diſeaſe; ſo that the boy was diſmiſſed from the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital and returned home the 12th day after the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.

                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:039022_0025_10138A9608ADFC20"/>Of the ſources of ſpurious cow-pox, he enumerates,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt—That ariſing from puſtules on the nipples, or udder of the cow, which puſtles contain no ſpecific virus.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly—From matter, (although originally poſſeſſing the ſpecific virus,) which has ſuffered a decompoſition, either from putrefaction, or from any other cauſe leſs obvious to the ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly—From matter taken from an ulcer in <hi>an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſtage,</hi> which ulcer aroſe from a true cow-pox.</p>
               <p>HE then gives a ſtriking inſtance, where a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was under the neceſſity of taking ſome ſmall-pox-matter from a puſtule, which experience ſince proved, was <hi>advanced too far</hi> to anſwer the purpoſe intended, and ſays that the ſame may happen in the cow-pox.</p>
               <p>HE next ſhews, that when the inoculated part has degenerated into an ulcer, the matter, although it may poſſeſs the power of inflaming the patient's arm, is nevertheleſs, void of that ſpecific virus requiſite to produce the genuine diſeaſe; and of courſe, incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſecuring the human ſyſtem againſt the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>HE doubts whether <hi>pure pus,</hi> though contained in a ſmall-pox puſtule, is ever capable of producing the ſmall-pox perfectly.
<q>I have often been foiled, ſays
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039022_0026_10138AC7C34B6628"/>Dr. JENNER, in my endeavours to communicate the cow-pox by inoculation. An inflammation will ſometimes ſucceeds the ſcratch or puncture, and in a few days diſappears without producing any further effect. Sometimes it will even produce an ichorous fluid, and yet the <hi>ſyſtem</hi> will not be affected. The ſame thing, we know, happens in the ſmall-pox.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THREE of four inſtances of the kind are recorded to have happened in England. The children were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated for the ſmall-pox, and took the diſorder. The oppoſers to the introduction of the kine-pox have <hi>uncandidly</hi> adduced theſe inſtances, and they have been repeated in this country, without any explanation, by ſome who were capable of explaining them.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER circumſtance, tending to diſcredit the idea of diſcarding the ſmall-pox and ſubſtituting the kine-pox, is <hi>mixing the two diſeaſes together, and perhaps giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one for the other,</hi> as we preſume was done in ſome of the hoſpitals in London. A phyſician of the firſt rank, wrote thus to the author, in Feb. 1799.
<q>Dr. W. tells me, that he finds the cow-pox a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſeaſe than was at firſt imagined; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſafety of inoculation, (for ſmall-pox), and the danger of introducing a new diſeaſe into the human frame, probably the practice will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:039022_0027_10138A99598226C0"/>IT was juſt about the ſame time, that Dr. SIMS wrote the letter referred to in page 33, ſo that the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering proſpect of baniſhing the ſmall-pox forever from Great-Britain, ſeemed to be obſcured for ſeveral weeks. But Dr. JENNER, and Mr. R—, a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed ſurgeon and native of the county where the cow-pox firſt appeared, undertook to examine how it happened that a diſtemper ſo mild in Gloceſterſhire, ſhould be converted into a pretty ſevere diſeaſe in London. This matter was unravelled, and the end of it appeared to be this: The firſt ſubjects inoculated for the kine-pox, were chiefly people maintained as <hi>poor.</hi> They were inoculated at the ſmall-pox hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, and ſeveral of them for both kinds, ſmall-pox and kine-pox at the ſame time, or at an interval of a day or two, by way of experiment; and it is more than probable, ſays one of my correſpondents, that a lancet infected with variolous matter, was uſed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating for the kine-pox. Be that as it may, it is certain that the patients of a celebrated inoculator, had the diſeaſe with greater ſeverity than any other practitioner. In general, the patients had more fever, ſorer arms, and more puſtules in London, than in the country.<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be neceſſary to inform ſome of our readers, that the people of England call every part of their Iſland "THE COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY" out of London; that city being called, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, "THE TOWN."</note> Thoſe of the authors friends who have
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039022_0028_10138AC9A1B8B4A8"/>urged him to eſtabliſh an hoſpital for the kine-pox, will now ſee more clearly, the reaſons for not following their advice. An hoſpital might poſſibly heighten a very mild diſtemper into a formidable diſeaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">"Dr. JENNER told me, ſays Dr. LETTSOM, that his patients in the country have rarely more than one puſtule. So ſays Mr. R. who comes from the ſame neighbourhood. He is fully of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that the diſeaſe has been mixed at the ſmall-pox hoſpital, or why ſhould it differ ſo eſſentially from the original diſeaſe in the country?"</note>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER this ſucceſsful inveſtigation, inoculation for the kine-pox went on with redoubled activity; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that from the date of Dr. SIMS' letter, to May following, (juſt about a year) 29,400 perſons of all ages, paſſed through the diſeaſe WITHOUT A SINGLE DEATH!</p>
               <p>HE who reflects on the difference of the two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, the kine and the ſmall-pox, the one contagious, the other not; the one not unfrequently attended with diſagreeable conſequences, and ſometimes fatal, while the other is as little hazardous as the ſwine or chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-pox—He, I ſay, who compares the two diſeaſes and their conſequences, will not heſitate a moment in his preference.</p>
               <p>"IN conſtitutions prediſpoſed to ſcrophula, ſays Dr. JENNER, how frequently we ſee the inoculated
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039022_0029_10138A9B98F98E00"/>ſmall-pox rouſe into activity this diſtreſsful mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There are many, who, from ſome peculiarity in the habit, reſiſt the common effects of the ſmall-pox matter <hi>inſerted in the ſkin,</hi> and who are, in conſequence, <hi>haunted</hi> through life with the diſtreſſing idea of being inſecure from ſubſequent infection. A ready mode, ſays he, of diſſipating anxiety, originating from ſuch a cauſe, muſt now appear obvious; for the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may at any time be made to feel the febrile attack of the cow-pox."<note n="*" place="bottom">See JENNER's inquiry, p. 70.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is another circumſtance of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome families, I mean thoſe in which the ſmall-pox <hi>always proves fatal, even under inoculation.</hi> But this can be beſt enforced and illuſtrated by the letter of Mr.WALKER, an eminent engraver in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, addreſſed to the editors of the MEDICAL AND PHYSICAL JOURNAL, accompanied with a coloured en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving, repreſenting the diſorder in the arm through all its different ſtages.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. 1. p. 118.</note>
               </p>
               <p>"HAVING a ſon between ten and eleven months old, and the ſmall-pox being in my oppoſite, as well as my next neighbour's family, I conceived it ſo unlikely for my infant to eſcape the contagion, and having heard of the benign tendency and mildneſs of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039022_0030_10138ACBB4106E20"/>the cow-pox, I made it the ſubject of particular enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and from all I could learn, there had never been known an inſtance of its proving fatal. On the other hand, <hi>I had experienced the ſmall-pox in my own family, both natural and inoculated, to terminate mortally.</hi> On theſe conſiderations, and admitting it ſhould not have the deſired effect of a preventative againſt the ſmall-pox, it would ſtill leave my child in the ſame ſituation as others; but if it really were a preſervative, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be in numerous inſtances, the advantage would be incalculable; and, if encouraged, might in the end even annihilate that dreadful ſcourage of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>"To encourage others, I tranſmit my obſervations, made in the progreſs of the diſorders, accompanied with a drawing, exhibiting the various appearances of the puſtules.</p>
               <p>"ON Monday, 19th February 1799, the infection was given by Dr. WOODVILLE, in the preſence of Dr. WILLAN, by two inciſions, &amp;c. &amp;c." Then follows an account of the appearances (with nine repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions colored to the life, by the anxious parent) through the whole diſeaſe, which we omit, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit nothing new or extraordinary; and ſhall add on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the two laſt paragraphs, which are theſe:</p>
               <p>"ON the 18th March, the whole ſcab was ſeperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039022_0031_10138A9D20486780"/>all round the edges, and the child was inoculated with variolous matter for the common ſmall-pox, which on this day (March 21ſt,) is evidently dying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a ſimple ſcratch.</p>
               <p>"DURING the whole time, the child never exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any particular ſymptoms of indiſpoſition, and had ſo little fever, that it was hardly, if at all, perceptible; he, however ſeemed by the motion of his arm, to be ſenſible of a ſoreneſs under it; but neither that, nor the eruption affected him ſo much as to render him croſs or peeviſh, although he cut three teeth during the progreſs of the diſorder."</p>
               <p>London, Roſamond-ſtreet, Clerken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, 21ſt March, 1799.</p>
               <p>THE editors of this work, (which is one of the beſt medical reviews in Europe), make this remark on the above narrative:
<q>The preceding communication on ſo intereſting a ſubject, we conſider as peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable, as Mr. WALKER not only ſhews a mind ſufficiently enlightened to give a fair trial to a new method of conquering one of the moſt dreadful ſcourges to mankind, but from his profeſſional abilities, alſo enables us to exhibit the progreſſive appearances of the cow-pox.</q>
See Med. and Phys. Journal, vol. 1ſt. p. 120.</p>
               <p>HAVING adduced thus much in favor of this newly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039022_0032_10138ACFAC9325E8"/>deſcribed diſtemper, it is agreeable to the candor we profeſs, to inform the reader, that one phyſician of eminence, and but one in London, has written a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rather againſt the practice; I mean Dr. JOHN SIMS. It is grounded on an extract of a letter from "an intelligent gentleman, not of the profeſſion," ſaying that "there is a gentleman of eminence in the law who has had the cow-pox twice, which he caught by milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his father's cows when a lad. This gentleman was afterwards inoculated for the ſmall-pox, and had it in ſo great abundance that his life was diſpaired of. "He deſcribes the cow-pox as the moſt loathſome of diſeaſes, and adds, that his right arm was in a ſtate of eruption, both the firſt and ſecond time, from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to the other; the pain was exceſſive, and his fingers ſo ſtiff, he could ſcarcely move them."— Nay, he ſpeaks of the "abhorrence the diſeaſe created in the family." Had this gentleman been of the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical profeſſion, he would have known, at once, that this was not the cow-pox, but an ulceration, ſimilar to what Dr. JENNER mentions in p. 8. &amp; 9. of his 2d part. If this was the cow-pox, it was very different from any ever ſeen ſince. It appears pretty clearly, that this gentleman, eminent in the law, was under a miſtake. Dr. SIM's communication is dated Feb. 13th, 1799, and may be ſeen in the 1ſt vol. of the MEDICAL AND PHYSICAL JOURNAL In a ſecond letter in the ſame
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039022_0033_10138A9EF31AEE78"/>volume, which is explanatory and apologetical, he ſays, he had no intention of declaring himſelf an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the inoculation of this diſeaſe; that his only wiſh was, to induce the practitioners to parſe a little, to obtain more decided experience of its utility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould be generally recommended. This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is dated April 20th, 1799, ſince which, <hi>decided ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of its utility has been obtained,</hi> and Dr. SIMS is now among the firm advocates for the operation. The reader, however, is entreated to peruſe theſe two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe they have been quoted by ſome who did not advert to their being written at ſo early a period of the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Dr. MOSELY has raiſed ſome objections to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; but it would be unkind to repeat them at this time. We have glanced at ſome of his notions in the note at the bottom of our firſt page. One idea of his, however, we cannot paſs over, becauſe that too has been repeated among us. Coming cloathed in the garb of prudence, we muſt not treat it but reſpecfully. We allow, ſay they, that the kine-pox ſecures the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from the ſmall-pox for a ſhort time, becauſe that has been proved; but how do we know it will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it for a length of time. Dr. MOSELY, ſays Mr. Mr. RING,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Med. and Phys. Journal, vol. 2d, p. 25.</note> expreſſes a <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> that the cow-pox
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:039022_0034_10138AD42C3A47E8"/>can only render the habit unſuſceptible of the ſmall-pox "<hi>for a time.</hi>" "This, obſerves Mr. R. is refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by volumes of evidence, and a cloud of witneſſes." Perſons who repeat this ſuſpicion of Dr. MOSELY, ſhould be informed of the number now living in the weſtern counties of England, who have had the diſeaſe from milking cows in the early part of life, and who have reſiſted every attempt to communicate the ſmall-pox to them after the lapſe of 15, 20, 30, and even 50 years and upwards. See the caſe of SARAH PORT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOCK, who was inoculated ineffectually for the ſmall-pox <hi>twenty-ſeven</hi> years after receiving the infection of the kine-pox from milking cows; of MARY BARGE, <hi>thirty-one</hi> years; of ELIZABETH WYNNE, <hi>thirty-eight</hi> years, and above all, of JOHN PHILLIPS, FIFTY-THREE years after. See alſo, ſeveral caſes in the 1ſt and 2d volumes of the Med. &amp; Phys. Journal.</p>
               <p>THIS was one of the moſt formidable objections made againſt inoculation for the ſmall-pox, when firſt practiſed by Dr. BOYLSTON in Boſton, in 1721. Yet the long experience of <hi>eighty years</hi> has now effectually removed every ſuſpicion of the kind.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the inoculation for the cow-pox was not received in England, without a degree of caution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an enlightened age and people, yet it may be aſſerted with truth, that nothing has occurred in the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:039022_0035_10138AA273DB7B70"/>annals of medicine, which has been taken up more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, received more candidly, or conducted more prudently. And it cannot be ſuppoſed, that we Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans ſhall give it a leſs candid reception, or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine it leſs ingenuouſly.</p>
               <p>THE people of New-England, particularly of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſet a noble example to their elder brethren of Old-England, in adopting the Turkiſh practice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation for the ſmall-pox, in 1721. Now, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, in their turn, lead the way in a practice ſtill more ſalutiferous. For, although the inoculation which commenced here in 1721, ſtripped that horrid diſeaſe, the ſmall-pox, of more than half its terrors, yet it is the <hi>kine-pox</hi> that will effect its extermination. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it be found that the latter is every way an eaſier, ſafer and more pleaſant diſtemper, and a perfect ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt the former, do not humanity, regard to our country, the dictates of reaſon, and the precepts of religion, urge us all to unite our efforts to exterminate "a diſeaſe, which has, during the laſt thouſand years, deſtroyed full a tenth, and probably a larger propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the human race." To effect ſo deſirable a purpoſe, I have laboured to collect all the evidence on this important ſubject, and to lay it before the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can public, in ſo plain and ſimple a manner, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no other preparation for its admiſſion than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and an unprejudiced mind.</p>

            <div type="replies">
               <head>MY PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENTS, PARTICULARLY AT THIS SEASON, IN THE UNIVERSITY, RENDERED IT CONVENIENT TO INSERT IN THE NEWS-PAPER THE FOLLOWING GENERAL ANSWER TO A NUMBER OF QUERIES PUT TO ME BY LETTER, AND OTHERWISE, RESPECTING THE NATURE AND INOCULATION OF THE KINE-POX.</head>
               <p n="1">1ſt. RESPECTING its contagion. It appears, by all the obſervations and experiments hitherto made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, that the diſeaſe is not contagious or catching from one perſon to another. Even the cows do not take it of each other, if an open rail-fence be interpoſed between them. Dr. W's. children labouring under the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſlept through the whole courſe of it with thoſe not then inoculated for it. "It does not ſeem poſſible, (says Dr. JENNER,) for the contagious matter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the diſeaſe from effluvia, or by any other means than contact; <hi>ſo that a ſingle individual in a family might at any time receive it without the riſk of infecting the reſt, or of ſpreading a diſtemper that fills a country with error.</hi>"</p>
               <p n="2">2d. RESPECTING diet previous to receiving the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Dr. W. had rather inoculate perſons in the <hi>pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039022_0037_10138AA671DD6568"/>of health,</hi> without the leaſt alteration of diet, or mode of living.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. IT is difficult to anſwer the queries reſpecting the mildneſs or ſeverity of the diſorder. Dr. WATER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOUSE anſwers generally, that in a vaſt majority of caſes, it is incomparably milder than the inoculated ſmall-pox, and it appears from experiments in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that it has become milder as it progreſſed. Thus according to Dr. WOODVILL's laſt report, out of 310 caſes, only 39 had puſtules that ſuppurated; viz. out of the <hi>firſt</hi> hundred 19 had puſtules; out of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> 13; and out of the laſt 110 only 7 had puſtules. There have been a few caſes, however, where it has proved an heavy diſeaſe, the patient being burthened with between 1000 and 1500 puſtules. It is preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that had ſuch perſons been inoculated for the ſmall-pox, they would have died.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. As to the beſt ſeaſon for receiving the diſeaſe. In this region, the ſeaſon preferred for inoculation of the kine-pox, as well as the ſmall-pox, is from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt to November; cooliſh nights and ripe fruit are pleaſant aſſiſtants to the inoculator. Very cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is unfavorable to the kine-pox. It aggravated the ſoreneſs of the arm to that degree in England, that the inoculators were obliged to poſtpone their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions until warmer weather. Cold, combined with dampneſs, is worſt of all. About a dozen perſons paſſed through the diſtemper at Cambridge, when the weather was hotter than ever was known there ſince the uſe of thermometers.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. To thoſe of the faculty who have applied to him by letter <hi>to ſupply them with matter for inoculation</hi>— he would juſt obſerve, that as he has taken much
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:039022_0038_10138AD957640D68"/>pains in this buſineſs, run no ſmall riſk of reputation, as well as of perſonal feelings, there are <hi>few,</hi> he truſts, that will wonder he is anxious to have the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own eye until the practice is more firmly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by the public opinion. Some unſucceſsful caſes at the beginning, deprived Scotland of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of inoculation for the ſmall-pox for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Two young gentlemen were rendered ſomewhat uncomfortable for three or four days in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of eating and drinking as uſual. One, the leaſt attentive to directions, after walking to, and from Boſton in A VERY HOT DAY, had his febrile ſymptoms very much aggravated. Has head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache was excruciating, and a ſlight delirium came on in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a ſtricture acroſs the region of the ſtomach, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to what we ſometimes find in the caſual ſmall-pox. Such imprudent conduct might have deſtroyed him if inoculated for the ſmall-pox. A boy, after eating green-corn, was crammed with fruit, under the abſurd idea that RIPE FRUIT CAN HURT NO ONE, ſo that with the ſymptoms of KINE-POX was joined a CHOLERA MORBUS. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother boy, the MUMES appeared about the 4th day, and arreſted the infection. I could add ſome other inſtances to prove that this new diſeaſe, mild and ſafe as it is, requires more of the phyſician than merely putting the matter into the arm; but as this treatiſe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed not ſo much to the PHYSICIAN, as to the COMMON SENSE of all, I purpoſely avoid profeſſional directions or criticiſms.</p>
