            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Lord hath made;</hi> inaſmuch as He has given us the happy Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, by putting our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and continuing us in the Poſſeſſion of thoſe invaluable Privileges, the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe whereof is the proper Buſineſs of the Day:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004498_0005_100D5A14ADA5D250"/>
And if we, and our People, do not <hi>rejoyce</hi> and ſhew ourſelves <hi>glad in it,</hi> with a religious as well as civil Joy, our Stupidity and Ingratitude will be an Evidence, how unworthy we are of the Favours of Heaven wherewith we are diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
            <p>WE again ſee <hi>the Princes,</hi> the Legiſlators <hi>of the People, even the People of the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>gathered together;</hi> not only in the <hi>State-Houſe</hi> to diſpatch the publick Buſineſs, but in the <hi>Lord's-Houſe</hi> to pay Him their publick Homage, and to learn their Duty to Him <hi>by inquiring in his Temple:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 47, 9.</note> And ſince <hi>the Shields of the Earth do belong unto God,</hi> it is fit He ſhould in this Way be <hi>exalted</hi> by them.</p>
            <p>OUR preſent Rulers deſire this publick Day may continue to wear the Garb of Religion, not only <hi>out of Cuſtom,</hi> and in Conformity to the Practice of their Anceſtors; but, we truſt, <hi>from a Senſe of Duty,</hi> and becauſe they inherit a good Meaſure of the ſame Spirit of Piety and Devotion, which was the diſtinguiſhing Glory of the Fathers of our Country.</p>
            <p>I know your <hi>Excellency,</hi> and the honourable <hi>Counſellers,</hi> who have order'd me into the ſacred Desk on this great Occaſion, don't expect from me, either an Addreſs of Compliment, or a Lecture in Politicks; both of which are as diſtant from my Genius, as they would be diſagreable to my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. That which you have called me to is, as a Goſpel Miniſter, to direct you from the Word of God, and remember you of your Duty as Chriſtian Magiſtrates; which I ſhall accordingly endeavour, by divine Help, with all Fidelity, and a proper
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004498_0006_100D5A1632CC7888"/>
Deference: And I don't know how I can better do this, than from the ſolemn Paſſage I have juſt read.</p>
            <p>IF then you are come together to <hi>hear what God the Lord has to ſay unto you,</hi> the Meſſage bro't you in his Name, by the unworthieſt of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, is this, <hi>Serve the</hi> LORD <hi>with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling. Kiſs the</hi> SON <hi>left He be angry, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Pſalm</hi> of which our Text is the Cloſe, is a prophetick Diſcourſe of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> It foretells the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> which would be given to that Kingdom, when it ſhould be ſet up in the World. Tho' the Laws of this Kingdom, and the Adminiſtration of it, are every way ſuited to make the Subjects thereof eaſy and happy; and the Nature of it is ſuch, that if it did univerſally obtain, it would make the Kingdoms of this World reſemble the Kingdom of Heaven; for it <hi>conſiſts in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 7</note> and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet ſuch are the Prejudices of Men, that they not only refuſe to become the Subjects of this Kingdom themſelves, but do their utmoſt to prevent its Eſtabliſhment and Spread in the World. And this Oppoſition is <hi>general,</hi> made by all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; not only the common Rout, from whom lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better is to be expected, but the Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are engag'd in it; as if they tho't the Reign of Chriſt would eclipſe their Glory, and diminiſh their Authority. Theſe back their Strength and Power with Policy and Counſel. <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and the Rulers take Counſel
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004498_0007_100D5A18F33613B0"/>
together, againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed, ſaying, Let us break their Bands aſunder, and caſt away their Cords from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT for the Comfort of all thoſe who have heartily eſpous'd the Intereſts of Chriſt, and are the faithful Subjects of his Kingdom, the Vanity and <hi>Unſucceſsfulneſs</hi> of this Oppoſition follow. Their Attempts will certainly be defeated, and their Counſels baffled, however confident they may be of carrying their Point. The moſt High controls their Rage, and derides their Folly. <hi>Why do the Heathen rage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. &amp; 4. v.</note> 
               <hi>and the People imagine a vain Thing? He that ſitteth in the Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in Deriſion.</hi> For the Thing they attempt is not only unlikely, but impoſſible. The Kingdom of Chriſt is better eſtabliſh'd than any of the Monarchies of the World. It is founded upon an irrevocable Decree of God the Father, from which he cannot recede in Point of Honour. This eternal Purpoſe and Reſolve, which lay hid in the divine Counſels from the Days of Eternity, is publiſh'd with Solemnity:<note place="margin">6, 7, 8. v.</note> 
               <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy Hill of Zion. I will declare the Decree; the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the utmoſt Parts of the Earth for thy Poſſeſſion.</hi> Nay; The Oppoſition will iſſue not only in a vexatious and ſhameful Diſappointment, but in the dreadful, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and irrecoverable Ruin of all that are in the curſed Confederacy. The Honours of this divine King will be ſufficiently vindicated; and they who would not ſubmit to his gracious Sceptre, ſhall be broken with his iron Rod.<note place="margin">v. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt break them
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004498_0008_100D5A1A9B5D8DE0"/>
with a Rod of Iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in Pieces like a Potters Veſſel;</hi> ſo <hi>ſuddenly, eaſily,</hi> and <hi>irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our Text is the <hi>Application</hi> of all this, by way of Counſel and Admonition, to Perſons of the higheſt Rank and Order in the World, as more eſpecially concerned in it. And here we may obſerve, 1, The Perſons to whom the Counſel is addreſs'd. 2, The Counſel that is given them. And 3, The Arguments and Motives with which it is enforc'd. Theſe three Diviſions of the Text may be the general Heads of our Diſcourſe: And, if I miſtake not, they will furniſh us with Matter proper for this Occaſion; and naturally ſuggeſt to us ſuch weighty Things, as will concern every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whatever Degree or Station, in this large Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>I. THE firſt Thing then that falls under our Obſervation is, <hi>The Perſons to whom the Counſel in our Text is addreſs'd:</hi> And theſe are the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges of the Earth.</hi> That is, Sovereign Princes and their Under-Officers; all Magiſtrates, both the ſupream and the ſubordinate; thoſe that have the legiſlative, and thoſe that have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive Power, in the Government of any People.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Office of the Magiſtracy</hi> is here ſuppos'd at leaſt; the <hi>Inſtitution of Government</hi> conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed to if not aſſerted: For ſome Perſons are here addreſs'd as veſted with Authority and Rule.</p>
            <p>NOTHING in the World is plainer than this, That it is the Mind and Will of God that there
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004498_0009_100D5A1C222CFA48"/>
ſhould be Magiſtracy in the World; that Men ſhould be govern'd by Laws and Polity, and kept in Order by this Means.</p>
            <p>SURELY no one can doubt whether the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of civil Government is laid in divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who but reads, without a Comment, ſuch Texts as theſe. Prov. 8. 15. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice: By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 2. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man for the Lord's ſake. Whether it be to the King as ſupream, or to Governors as ſent by him; for the Puniſhment of Evil Doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the Will of God</hi>—</p>
            <p>AND this is the Dictate of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well as the Voice of Scripture. The very Light of Nature gives a ſufficient Indication of the Mind of God in this Matter: For all Nations, how barbarous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have united in ſome Kind of Government or other, for their common Peace and Safety; nor can any Number of Men continue any Time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſomething of Law and Rule; which ſhews that Government is from God as the Author of Nature.</p>

BUT how neceſſary is Government, even in the ſeverer Reſtraints of it, for Man in his preſent fallen and corrupt State? To how much greater a Height wou'd Wickedneſs riſe, if there were none to be a <hi>Terror to evil Doers?</hi> If all Men were left to their unreſtrain'd Liberty, what an uncomfortable and dangerous Place would this World be?

            <p>THEREFORE God's good Will to Men, and Concern for their Happineſs, appears next to the Goſpel and the Miniſtry of it, in the <hi>Inſtitution of Magiſtracy;</hi> his appointing that Men, in their preſent State, ſhou'd be govern'd by Men.

THE People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> found this by Experience, in the Day when God promulg'd his Law to them, in a way ſuited to his own Majeſty and Greatneſs. They could not bear it. They were ſtruck into ſuch Amazement and Terror, as to make it their humble Requeſt that he would pleaſe to go into a Method of Government more ſuted to Spirits in Fleſh;<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19.</note> and that they might <hi>no more hear the Voice of the Lord, leaſt they ſhou'd die:</hi> And God granted their Requeſt, and in Condeſention to their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infirmity, when the Government over <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> he uſed the Miniſtry of Men in the Management of it. Truly, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Wiſdom and compaſſionate Goodneſs of God are ſeen, in governing as well as teaching us by <hi>Men</hi> like our ſelves.</p>
            <p>THIS does not indeed leſſen the <hi>Obligations to Obedience;</hi> for <hi>he that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man but God:</hi> But it is a very good Reaſon why we ſhou'd make favourable Allowances for the Defects and Failings of Rulers.

And their Miſtakes and Miſmanagement, whether in private or publick Life, ſhou'd not be too ſeverely cenſur'd.

I don't mean that out of Reverence to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we ſhou'd reſign common Underſtanding, and the publick Intereſt, to Men in Power: Nor wou'd I be tho't to deny the Right which every private Man, as he is a Member of the Body, and his Intereſt is involv'd in that of the Publick, has to judge of the Conduct of publick Affairs. No; <hi>I am too deep in the Principles of Liberty,</hi> to mean any thing like this. But this I ſay, the Cenſure of Rulers ſhould be in matters of which we are able in ſome good Meaſure to form a Judgment, upon Things apparent, and where Facts may be compar'd together; and always manag'd with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and temper'd with Charity.—Nor ſhou'd we preſently vote thoſe to be ill Men, Enemies of their Country, regardleſs of its Intereſts, or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Ruin, who don't judge with the Populace, or go into the Meaſures which others think beſt. For Perſons equal in Integrity and Love to their Country, may judge very differently about the publick Intereſts.</p>
            <p>WHAT we have ſpoken of the divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government, you all underſtand to be meant of <hi>Government it ſelf,</hi> and not of any particular Form or Model of it: For one is no more appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God than another; but every People are left to judge for themſelves, to frame ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as may beſt anſwer the Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, and to alter and change <hi>that too</hi> at Diſcretion, and by common Conſent.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Kingly Government</hi> is mentioned in our Text; but is not to be underſtood excluſive of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forms. And all Perſons are for Conſcience ſake to yield Obedience to the Laws and Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates

under which they live, and from which they receive the Benefit of Protection; whether in Kingdoms or Common Wealths; and whether the Government does or does not deſcend by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Right.</p>
            <p>The ſame Model of Government would not ſuit every People; their Genius, Scituation, and other Circumſtances are ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And by the various Forms of civil Government, which there are among the Nations of the Earth, the Wiſdom of God in the Government of the World in general, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the more illuſtrious and admirable.</p>
            <p>OF the various Forms of civil Government which are in the World, ſome are undoubtedly <hi>much better</hi> than others, and it is a greater Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to live under one than another of them.

AND if we conſider our ſelves as NEW-ENGLISH MEN, our Obligation to Thankfulneſs riſes ſtill <hi>higher:</hi> For we enjoy not only the Immunities and Liberties of natural Subjects born in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but have ſome additional ones granted and affirmed to us by a <hi>Royal Charter,</hi> which is as a Hedge about our deareſt and moſt valuable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts: So that none can with more Juſtneſs, and greater Propriety than our ſelves, uſe thoſe thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words of the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 6.</note>

            </p>
            <p>WE have been ſaying, GOD has in Kindneſs to Men appointed that they ſhou'd be govern'd by Men; yet, He has been <hi>too good and kind to leave them to be govern'd by Men according to their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britrary Will and Pleaſure.</hi> The End of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the publick Peace and Safety; when therefore this is neglected, and the Ordinance of Government only made an Engine of Tyranny and Oppreſſion; when the Conſtitution is ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Liberties and Properties of the People invaded, their Religion and Laws made a Sacrifice to the Superſtition, Ambition, or Covetouſneſs of the Prince that is over them; when this is <hi>really the Caſe,</hi> as it has been in <hi>our own Nation,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Remedy is left in their own Hands, and every Man is under higher and earlier Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Community in general, than he is to the ſupream Magiſtrate.</p>

HE that has freed his People from their <hi>ſpiritual Task-maſters,</hi> has not left them under the Power of <hi>earthly Tyrants.</hi> The Rules of Obedience laid down in the Goſpel oblige none to ſubmit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Impoſitions.

            </p>
            <p>AND tho' GOD has not preſcrib'd any one Form of Government in Scripture, yet he has therein given <hi>general Rules</hi> to be obſerv'd by all that are in Government.

II. THE ſolemn <hi>Counſel</hi> here given to earthly Rulers of all Degrees: <hi>Serve the</hi> LORD; <hi>Kiſs the</hi> SON.</p>
            <p>THE ſame <hi>Perſon</hi> is here meant by the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> namely, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mediator.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Duty requir'd</hi> is expreſs'd two Ways. They muſt <hi>ſerve</hi> him, as thoſe that are in Subjection to him, in all the Inſtances of Devotion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They are to <hi>kiſs</hi> him; with a Kiſs of <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Worſhip:</hi> They that worſhip'd Idols kiſs'd them;<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 18</note> for we read of the People, their <hi>kiſſing of</hi> Baal, and <hi>kiſſing the Calves.</hi>—With a Kiſs of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Loyalty:</hi>

            <p>I take the Words to be comprehenſive of the Duty of Rulers in their <hi>double Capacity;</hi> the private and the publick; as Chriſtians and as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>

HERE many Particulars offer themſelves to our Tho'ts, which are in themſelves worthy of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement: But I muſt content my ſelf with a few comprehenſive Hints, in opening to you the Character of a Servant of Chriſt in his <hi>ſingle</hi> or <hi>private Capacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Servant of Chriſt is one who has parted with his <hi>old Maſters;</hi> fallen off from his Allegiance to,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 13.</note> and renounc'd the Service of thoſe <hi>other Lords</hi> which <hi>have had Dominion over him;</hi> Satan and the World.</p>
            <p>HE has actually <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to the Government of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 106.</note> 
               <hi>taken his Yoke upon him,</hi> and ſworn Allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>AND now,</p>
            <p>HE <hi>obeys all his Laws,</hi> and makes <hi>his Will</hi> the Rule of all his Actions; how contrary ſoever to his own Will or Humour, Eaſe or Intereſt. He ſits at the Feet of his divine Maſter, and makes that Inquiry,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 6.</note> with a ſincere Reſolution to obey, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Or,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE therefore <hi>attends upon all his Inſtitutions,</hi> thoſe Ordinances which Chriſt has appointed to ſhew his Authority over, and Care for his Church. He religiouſly obſerves the <hi>Sabbaths of the Lord,</hi> conſtantly frequents the <hi>ſolemn Aſſemby,</hi> reverently hears his <hi>Word preach'd</hi> by his Miniſters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly attends upon the Adminiſtration of the <hi>holy Sacraments.</hi>

            <p>MOREOVER,</p>

AND ſo they are to conſider themſelves as Chriſt's <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Stewards,</hi> plac'd in their Stations to ſerve him and his Intereſts.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE,</p>
            <p>THEY muſt not <hi>ſeek</hi> Themſelves, and <hi>their own Things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 21.</note> to the Neglect of <hi>the Things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If they are covetous and Self ſeeking, and aim at Nothing but gratifying their own Ambition, raiſing Themſelves and Families, enlarging their Honours and Eſtates, this is not to ſerve Chriſt, but to ſerve themſelves <hi>of him;</hi> and to proſtitute their high Office to low Ends.</p>

            <p>THEY muſt make no Laws that are <hi>repugnant to, or inconſiſtent with</hi> the ſettled Laws of Chriſt's Kingdom. For altho' GOD has given this Power to all Kingdoms and Nations to make Laws for the better Support and Government of themſelves, yet he has not given them Leave to repeal any of his own Laws, nor to enact any Thing contrary to <hi>them.</hi> It is uſual for a Prince, when he grants a <hi>Charter</hi> to a City or Company within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

In ſuch a Caſe,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 29.</note> the general Law is, that <hi>we muſt obey GOD rather than Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE BIBLE therefore, which is the great <hi>Statute Book of Heaven,</hi> muſt be conſulted by the Rulers of a People, and they muſt frame their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration by the general Laws there laid down. The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were commanded by GOD to write for themſelves <hi>a Copy of the Law,</hi> and to <hi>read therein all the Days of their Lives,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17, 18, 19.</note> that they might <hi>learn to fear the Lord their God, and to keep all the Words of his Law.</hi> And <hi>Jehojada</hi> gave to <hi>Joaſh</hi> the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> with the <hi>Crown,</hi>

Yet we muſt not run into the other Extream, and ſay that the Magiſtrate has <hi>nothing to do</hi> in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>AS they rule <hi>by</hi> Chriſt, ſo they are oblig'd to rule <hi>for</hi> Him; and therefore to protect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Practice of his holy Religion; to guard and defend GOD'S ſacred Name, Day and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the Inſults of thoſe who wou'd openly profane and trample upon them; and to reſtrain and puniſh thoſe Vices and Immoralities, which are as contrary to the Laws of Chriſt as they are to the Welfare of Societies: For the very End of their Office is, the <hi>Puniſhment of evil Doers,</hi>

            <p>THERE is a War carried on in this World, between the <hi>rightful King</hi> and the <hi>uſurping God of it;</hi> between Chriſt and Satan; and whoever ſtands neuter, <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are Chriſt's Officers, muſt not: If they do, they are <hi>Traitors</hi> to his Crown and Government, and muſt expect from him the higheſt Reſentment, and the ſevereſt Puniſhment. Which leads us the third and laſt thing obſerv'd in the Words.</p>
            <p>III. THE <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> with which the divine Counſel here given to the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges of the Earth is enforc'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the</p>
            <p>1ſt REASON or Argument may be taken from the <hi>Wiſdom of ſuch a Conduct. Be</hi> wiſe <hi>now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O ye Kings: be</hi> inſtructed <hi>ye Judges of the Earth. Serve the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WISDOM</hi> is a very requiſite Qualification in Rulers. Without this they will make but a poor Figure, and both their Perſons and Authority fall into Contempt. Now, to ſerve the Lord, <hi>Behold! this is Wiſdom.</hi> When Rulers do <hi>this,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all the Rules of Policy into one.</p>
            <p>FOR,</p>
            <p>THIS is the way <hi>to have the Preſence of Chriſt with them in their Adminiſtration,</hi> to direct their Counſels, and ſucceed their Endeavours for the publick Good; without which their own Policy and Power will be in vain; the wiſeſt Schemes will be baffled, and the moſt promiſing Enterprizes
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004498_0027_100D5A44863F3288"/>
defeated. Whatever the <hi>wiſe Men after the Fleſh</hi> may think, the Rules of Religion ſteadily purſu'd by thoſe entruſted with the publick Affairs of a People, will be found to conduce more to the true Ends of Government, than all the Maxims of carnal Policy. 1 Sam. 23. 3, 4. <hi>He that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt, ruling in the Fear of God: And he ſhall be as the Light of the Morning, when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Graſs ſpringing out of the Earth by clear ſhining after Rain.</hi> i. e. The religious Ruler will be a great common and extenſive Bleſſing, like the Light and Rain of Heaven.</p>
            <p>THIS is alſo the beſt way to <hi>ſecure and exalt their own Character.</hi> For, if a ſerious and ſtrict Regard to Religion runs thro' their Conduct, both in private and publick Life; if they appear to act in the Fear of God, and with a governing View to the Honour of Chriſt, this will certainly make them look more great and venerable in the Eyes of the People, than any ſhining Titles or glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Badges of Honour which they wear: This will procure them not only outward but <hi>inward</hi> Reverence. When Piety is found in Conjunction with Greatneſs, the Perſon ſhines with a diviner Luſtre, and the Authority wherewith he is veſted ſtrikes into a greater Awe, and more powerfully conſtrains Submiſſion and Obedience. So <hi>Joſhua was magnified in the fight of all</hi> Iſrael.<note place="margin">Joſh. 4. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THUS they will be likely to <hi>ſit eaſy in their Poſts of Honour;</hi> not only from the Conſciouſneſs of their own Integrity, which will always give them inward Peace, and raiſe their Minds above the Cenſures and Clamours of ignorant and diſaffected
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004498_0028_100D5A460B6A16B0"/>
Perſons; but alſo from the Acceptance which their faithful Endeavours will find among the Generality of their People. For as bad as the World is, <hi>when the Righteous are in Authority,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 29. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the People rejoice.</hi> Common People, and even vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, are under ſuch a Conviction of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Virtue and Religion, that they can't but take Satisfaction when they ſee it <hi>exalted to great Dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER,</p>
            <p>THIS is the moſt likely way for them to be <hi>eſtabliſh'd and continued in their Authority,</hi> and to have their publick Opportunities and Advantages lengthned out by that GOD <hi>in whoſe hand their Times are.</hi> For it ſtands in the Book of GOD as an Argument why the King ſhould above all Things mind Religion, <hi>To the end that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his Days in his Kingdom.</hi> Deut. 17. 20. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably (as one obſerves) we find in the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> that generally the beſt Reigns were the longeſt, except when GOD ſhortned them for the Puniſhment of the People, as <hi>Joſiahs.</hi> Or, this will miniſter pleaſing Reflections to them, and give them a Satisfaction <hi>divinely calm,</hi> if they ſee Others fill the Stations they have held; or in the near Approach of <hi>Death,</hi> and Proſpect of their <hi>final Account</hi> to GOD the Judge of all. <hi>Be</hi> wiſe <hi>now therefore, O ye Kings; be</hi> inſtructed <hi>ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we conſider the <hi>Dignity of this glorious Perſon</hi> whom the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges of the Earth</hi> are commanded to <hi>ſerve,</hi> there will appear the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004498_0029_100D5A484683F800"/>
higheſt Reaſon why they ſhou'd obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: He is the LORD; the SON.</p>
            <p>CHRIST is here ſpoken of both with Reſpect to his eternal Deity, and his Office of Mediator. He is the <hi>Son of GOD</hi> by eternal Generation; and he is the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> i. e. God-man, Mediator: And all Men are bound to ſerve him, not only on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his eternal Deity, but his Office as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. His Supremacy over the World, is a Prerogative annex'd to his being Head of the Church. For GOD hath now <hi>ſet him at his own right Hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his Feet, and given him to be Head over all Things to the Church, which is his Body.</hi> So that he is Lord Paramount of the whole Creation. He has a Title both by Inheritance and by Appointment. A natural and delegated right. A <hi>natural</hi> one, as he is the true GOD,<note place="margin">John 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>by whom were all things made that are made;</hi> and a <hi>delegated</hi> one, as he is Mediator: So he is inveſted by the Father, who is the Fountain of Power, with the ſole Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Kingdom of Providence as well as of Grace. Thus he is <hi>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 72 11</note> 
               <hi>the bleſſed and the only Potentate: All Kings ſhall how down before him,</hi> and <hi>all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Title and Character of <hi>Lord</hi> given to Chriſt in the Text, ſuggeſts to us theſe following Reaſons why the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges of the Earth,</hi> Rulers of all Degrees, ſhould <hi>ſerve</hi> him.</p>

1. HE is the LORD, and ſo their Authority is <hi>deriv'd from him.</hi> It is ſo with reſpect to the <hi>Conſtitution of Government</hi> it ſelf: for Dominion and Rule are his Appointment in the World; the Original of Power is from Heaven, as has been ſhewn already.—And it is ſo with reſpect to the <hi>Deſignation of the Perſons</hi> cloathed with it. In whatever Way, by whatever Means and Methods, Men are advanc'd to their ſeveral Stations, the Providence of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd and ador'd therein. <hi>For both Riches and Honour come of thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and in thy band it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all.</hi> We many times ſee ſtrange and unexpected Turns, and are ſurpriz'd at the ſudden Diſgrace of ſome," and Elevation of others: But we ſhould conſider" that <hi>the moſt high ruleth in the Kingdom of Men,</hi>

This is a great Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting GOD's providential Government of the World, which the Pſalmiſt has inſtructed us in, Pſal. 75. 6, 7. <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South; but God is the Judge: He putteth down one,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſetteth up another.</hi> When there are Candidates for an Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a Poſt of Government, and a Struggle among the Electors, the King of the World ſits Umpire, and in a powerful tho' inviſible Way, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the matter, ſo as to bring about his own Counſels, and ſerve his own Purpoſe. <hi>The Lot is caſt into the Lap,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 16. 33.</note> 
               <hi>but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> This is a good Reaſon why they

            <p n="2">2.

               <hi>The Lord of theſe Servants cometh,</hi> and will <hi>reckon</hi> with them, for the Improvement of their Power, Honour and Influence, which were Talents committed to them to occupy for Him.</p>
            <p>RULERS, as well as others, muſt appear before the Judgment of Chriſt; to give an Account as well of their <hi>publick</hi> as of their private Life. <hi>I ſaw the Dead ſmall and great ſtand before God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 12</note> And here ſurely is a powerful Reaſon why they ſhou'd endeavour to acquit themſelves as <hi>good Stewards</hi> of the <hi>manifold Grace</hi> of GOD, that ſo when they muſt give an Account of their Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they may do it <hi>with Joy and not with Grief,</hi> and may eſcape the Rebuke and Puniſhment of the wicked and unfaithful Servant. This brings me to a third Motive and Argument in the Text, which is taken from</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>high Diſpleaſure of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>utter Ruin</hi> conſequent thereupon, which thoſe Rulers who refuſe to comply with this Counſel, will bring upon themſelves. <hi>Be wiſe now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O ye Kings; be inſtructed ye Judges of the Earth: Serve the Lord; Kiſs the Son; leſt He be</hi> ANGRY, <hi>and ye</hi> PERISH <hi>from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THE SON can be angry, tho' he be the Saviour. Gracious and condeſcending as he is, he can be ſeverely angry. He has Jealouſy as well as Love; Wrath as well as Compaſſion and Grace. And
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004498_0034_100D5A53562839D8"/>
if He be angry, who is the Mediator between GOD and Man, what will become of us? who then will interceed for us with a GOD already offended?</p>
            <p>"CHRIST is call'd the <hi>Lamb;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev.</note> yet he is <hi>the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Judah: and <hi>the Wrath of</hi> this <hi>King,</hi> of this King of Kings, <hi>is as the roaring of a Lion,</hi> and eno' to make the ſtouteſt Heart to tremble.</p>
            <p>A <hi>little</hi> of his Wrath is eno' to be the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sinner. <hi>Leſt ye periſh in the way,</hi> in the Courſe of your Sin and Rebellion againſt him, <hi>when his Wrath is kindled but a little.</hi> How then can the proudeſt Sinner ſtand before his <hi>flaming Wrath,</hi> when his Jealouſie burns like Fire.</p>
            <p>THE Kings and Judges of the Earth muſt not think themſelves above the Reſentment of Chriſt, or too big for him to deal with. He will be angry with <hi>them</hi> as ſoon as with others; and they will be as little able to ſtand before his Indignation. Whatever Prerogatives they may lay claim to here, they will be of no Service to them in the Day of Death,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 33.</note> and the Day of Judgment. <hi>Tophet is ordain'd of old, for the King it is prepared,</hi> that will not ſubmit to this King of Kings, and become his Servant.</p>
            <p>NAY, he will <hi>get</hi> himſelf more <hi>Honour</hi> upon theſe, in the Execution of his righteous Diſpleaſure againſt them, if they refuſe to honour him now: For in Proportion to the Talents which Men have neglected or miſimprov'd in this World, will be the Degrees of Wrath inflicted on them in the next. And ſo we find <hi>the Kings of the Earth, and the great

Men</hi> are the foremoſt of thoſe who in the great Day of the Wrath of the Lamb, will <hi>run to the Rocks and Mountains</hi> for Shelter,<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 15.</note> as if his Face car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried more of Diſpleaſure in it towards <hi>them.</hi> Let the Rulers of the World then be ſo wiſe as to give their Power to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they may not fall under his Diſpleaſure; that they may be <hi>accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things which ſhall come to paſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 21. 36.</note> 
               <hi>and to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi> This Counſel in our Text is inforc'd by one more Argument, which we may not quite paſs over; and this is</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE <hi>Happineſs of this Submiſſion:</hi> BLESSED <hi>are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> That thus <hi>Submit</hi> to him as their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and put their <hi>Truſt</hi> in him as their <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE his Wrath burns againſt others, his Face will ſhine upon <hi>theſe.</hi> While his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſtrikes others into killing Terrors, it will fill theſe with warmeſt Tranſports of Joy.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 30.</note> 
               <hi>and caſt him into outer Darkneſs,</hi> they will hear that applauding commendation, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> and be bid to <hi>enter into the Joy of their Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN <hi>ſubordinate Rulers</hi> who have well fill'd their lower Places, will have it ſaid to them, <hi>Thou has been faithful over a few things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">23. v.</note> 
               <hi>I will make the Ruler over many things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN the <hi>Kings of the Earth</hi> who religiouſly and dutifully caſt their Crowns at the Feet of Chriſt, will have a weighter, brighter, and more
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004498_0036_100D5A57E01EA800"/>
durable one than that which they wore here, ſet upon their Heads; the heavenly Crown of Glory and Life, of which they will never be depriv'd.</p>
            <p>IN a word,</p>
            <p>ALL they who have rul'd for Chriſt, in their ſeveral Orders of Government, ſhall at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all Things, <hi>reign with Him for ever and ever;</hi> ſet down with him on his Throne, even as he is ſet down with his Father on his Throne. An Honour and Bleſſedneſs this, ineffable, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable! What an Incentive is this to the Men of Ambition, that ſeek and court Honour! But, Oh! where is the Faith of it?—The Thing is future and inviſible, therefore few believe it, and ſeek after it, tho' it be not the leſs real and certain.</p>
            <p>THUS I have diſcours'd upon the Text in the ſeveral Diviſions of it; and muſt haſten to bring Home what has been ſaid in a diſtinct Application to the two Diviſions, of <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Ruled,</hi> which take in this whole Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>AND,</p>
            <p n="1">1. OUR <hi>honoured Rulers,</hi> of every Degree and Order in the Government, are taught what their Duty to Chriſt is, and what are His juſt Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them. Since he is the ſupream Lord, and the Fountain of Power: Since the Inſtitution of Government is from Him, and your own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to your ſeveral Truſts and Offices is by him: Since you are employ'd in Subordination to him, and with a View to the ſame Deſign for which he has receiv'd all power in Heaven and Earth: Since you depend upon him, who is <hi>Lord both of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004498_0037_100D5A598A26A9D0"/>
the Dead and Living,</hi> for the Continuance of your Lives and publick Advantages: Since you are accountable to him, and muſt very quickly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up your Account: And ſince you will then, according as you acquit your ſelves now, either fall under his terrible Diſpleaſure which is worſe than Death, or receive the diſtinguiſhing Marks of his Favour, which is better than Life in all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or Injoyments of it: Since it is thus, I ſay, Duty, Gratitude and Intereſt conſpire, all the Rules of Juſtice, Decency and Honour unite, to oblige you to act in your particular Poſts and Stations, according to his Will, and for his Glory.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be this Meſſage of Heaven may the more awaken your thinking and active Powers, and come with a greater Force and Weight upon you, if it be more particularly applied.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, let the Counſel of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which has been given, be acceptable to your EXCELLENCY, to whom with a moſt dutiful Reſpect it is now addreſs'd.</p>
            <p>AND it is our great Pleaſure and Happineſs this Day, that we can addreſs <hi>our Governour in Chief,</hi> as one who has openly choſen the LORD to ſerve him, and that in <hi>the Way of theſe Churches.</hi> Suffer me then, SIR, to remind you, That you publickly devoted your ſelf to the Service of the exalted Son of GOD, when you had juſt entred the World in ſuperiour outward Circumſtances and Advantages; and it was a great Pleaſure to your own and your
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004498_0038_100D5A5C55D9DB58"/>
Fathers Friends, and the Friends of Religion, then to obſerve it; from the Hopes it gave them that Chriſt and his People here would afterwards have much Service from you, by the Will of GOD: And doubtleſs you look upon your Covenant Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be ſtrengthn'd, by the Honours to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Providence has ſince advanc'd you.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is a Character which <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> have no reaſon to be aſham'd of; a Title which they ſhou'd be ambitious of: For it will be found their trueſt Honour, when all the Glory of this World ſhall vaniſh like a Blaze in Straw; and will turn to their greateſt Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when all the Prerogatives they were poſſeſt of here, will be forgotten and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>THE Honour of Chriſt and his Intereſt are very much concern'd in your <hi>Excellency's</hi> Conduct and Adminiſtration. Religion is not in ſuch a State at this Day, but it needs the Example of the greateſt amongſt us to render it more reputable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. But while your <hi>Excellency</hi> is ſeen to pay a ſolemn Regard to the Day of GOD, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Reverence and Devotion upon his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, and to live in the Practice of thoſe private and publick Vertues which adorn the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Character, <hi>this</hi> will go very far to prevent its falling into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rther Contempt and Neglect.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY if together with this the Honours of the Government, which are ſo much at your <hi>Excellency's</hi> Diſpoſal, are conferr'd on true Piety, and not given in Courſe or out of Compliment. I humbly conceive your <hi>Excellency</hi> cannot give a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004498_0039_100D5A5E75966A10"/>
better Sanction and Security to the Religion that remains amongſt us, than by this wiſe Diſtinction in your <hi>Commiſſions</hi>—And here, I think we ſhou'd be ungrateful to GOD and your <hi>Excellency,</hi> if we did not acknowledge the Countenance and Encouragement which the Religion of the Country has receiv'd, under your <hi>Excellency'</hi>s Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from your Example and Authority both.</p>
            <p>PROVIDENCE has plac'd your <hi>Excellency</hi> over a People, who ſtand in a ſpecial Relation to Chriſt and are a diſtinguiſh'd Part of <hi>the Lot of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance:</hi> And all your faithful Services to <hi>them,</hi> He will accept as done to <hi>Him.</hi> For I truſt we are ſtill belov'd for our Father's Sake; and for the Sake of a precious Number thro' the Land, who are yet <hi>faithful with the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY are alſo <hi>your own People;</hi> and, as you have been pleas'd to ſay of them, <hi>Bone of your Bone,</hi> and <hi>Fleſh of your Fleſh.</hi> And we may ſuppoſe the Intenſeneſs of your <hi>native Affection</hi> is encreas'd, by the <hi>publick Relation</hi> in which you have ſo long ſtood to them.</p>
            <p>AND ſuffer me to ſay, <hi>Sir,</hi> the diſtreſs'd State of this People at this Day, loudly calls for your paternal Compaſſions, your wiſe Councils, and beſt Endeavours for their Relief. Their Caſe reſembles that of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Time of <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> and like them they look to their <hi>Governour</hi> for Help and Redreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:004498_0040_100D5A6002F3AD20"/>
IT may be many think it is more in your <hi>Excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency's</hi> Power to gratifie and eaſe them, than it really is; and do not eno' conſider the Reſtrictions you are under.</p>
            <p>BUT you will at leaſt diſcover your Tenderneſs for them in your Speeches from the Chair, and Repreſentations of their State to the Government at Home; and even become an <hi>Interceſſor</hi> for them, as in your Wiſdom you judge you can ſerve them: This cannot fail to engage them to you more and more in Duty and Affection.</p>
            <p>IF now I have gone too far in what I have ſaid, I muſt rely on your condeſcending Goodneſs to forgive me. The Searcher of Hearts knows it proceeds, as from an ardent Affection to my <hi>dear Country,</hi> ſo from a ſincere perſonal Regard to <hi>your Excellency,</hi> and an unfeigned Deſire that your <hi>Excellency</hi> may long ſit eaſy in the Chair of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and this People ſit with Delight under your Shadow.</p>
            <p>YOUR Power, Honour and Influence employ'd for Chriſt and for his People, <hi>this,</hi> SIR, will be a <hi>Crown</hi> which no Man can take from you: This will give you undiſturb'd Serenity in a Receſs from the Cares and Burthens of Government, and cauſe the Bleſſings of an obliged People to follow you into Retirement; or it will brighten the Shades of Death to you, and carry you from the Chair of Government, to the Sepulchre of your Fathers, with the publick Praiſes and Lamentations; and will finally give you a bleſſed Part in the noble Triumphs of the Saints of the moſt high, in the

Fulfilment of that Word of our Saviour, <hi>If any Man ſerve me,</hi>

               <hi>let him follow me: And where I am there ſhall alſo my Servant be. If any Man ſerve me, him will my Father honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. LET this word of God be in the next Place addreſs'd, with all Decency to the honourable his MAJESTY's COUNCIL, and the honourable <hi>Houſe</hi> of REPRESENTATIVES, this Day in General Court Aſſembled. The Demand of the King of Heaven from you <hi>all</hi> is, That you ſerve Him, and ſhew your ſelves faithful to his Intereſts in your ſeveral publick Capacities, and this upon Pain of his higheſt Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>AND here I would firſt of all apply my ſelf to you, as having the Power of <hi>Election</hi> to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd this Day. Herein you are entruſted with a ſingular Opportunity to ſerve Chriſt and this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And He that <hi>ſtandeth in the Congregation of the mighty</hi> critically inſpects you in, and will call you to a ſtrict Account for the Management of this Day's Work.</p>
            <p>IT is an Affair of no ſmall importance you are to tranſact this Afternoon; to <hi>elect his Majeſty's Council for the Province:</hi> Theſe, in the Frame of our Government, do, as it were, ſtand between the King and the People, both of which do in a Sort meet in <hi>them;</hi> and while they are to guard the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the one, they are to preſerve the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege</hi> of the other: They are one Branch of the <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> and bear a diſtinct Part in the framing and enacting of our Laws: Without their Conſent on <hi>Civil</hi> Officers can be appointed in the <hi>Province;</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004498_0042_100D5A65F1572A20"/>
and the <hi>College,</hi> in which the Churches thro' the Land are ſo deeply concern'd, falls in Part under their Inſpection and Government. Theſe Things render it a Matter of no ſmall Moment, who that Board conſiſts of from Time to Time. And tho' they are choſen but for a Year, great may be the Benefit or Detriment of ſuch a Choice; for in one Year are often laid <hi>the Foundations of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the Importance then of this Days Work lie with a due Weight upon the Mind of every one concern'd; and let none act in ſo weighty an Affair with a <hi>triffling,</hi> a <hi>partial,</hi> or a <hi>party Spirit.</hi> Let me tell you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> your Votes are not your own; you vote for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and for his People; and therefore muſt look to the Qualifications of thoſe you vote for. You know the Rules of Election into Poſts of Government preſcrib'd in the Oracles of GOD: Conſider them, and act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Direction and Awe of them. The Advice of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jethro</hi> are indeed the Charge of GOD to Electors from Time to Time. Deut. 1. 13. <hi>Take ye wiſe men, and underſtanding, and known among your Tribes.</hi> Exod 18 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs, and place ſuch to be Rulers.</hi> Men of a general Character for Capacity, Integrity, publick Spiritedneſs, and Piety. Men of a Genius for Government, and who underſtand the civil and religious Intereſts of their People: <hi>True Men,</hi> that will act upon Principle, and not be daunted by Frowns nor Clamours: Men not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by narrow and ſelfeſh Views, but that can generouſly ſacrifice their private Intereſt to that

of the publick, when they ſtand in Competition: And Men that appear to act in the Fear of GOD in their private Life; for only ſuch will act for his Glory in a publick Station; and they are the moſt likely to be favour'd with the divine Preſence and Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>IT were ſad indeed, if among our Tribes, in the ſeveral Parts of our Land, there could not be found Perſons of theſe Characters, eno' to fill every Seat at the Council Table. Your Buſineſs is to look for them—And may <hi>He who ſits in the Heavens,</hi> and preſides over the Affairs of the Children of Men, lead you in your Choice, to his own Glory, and the Advantage of this People; and therein give us a happy Token that He is ſtill in the Midſt of us!</p>
            <p>WHEN the Election of this Day is over, the three Parts of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> will come to act in their <hi>legiſlative Capacity:</hi> and they that give Law to others, muſt conſider themſelves as <hi>under the Law to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VAST is the Truſt committed to you in this Capacity: The Vertue and Religion, the Liberties and Priviledges, the Trade and Riches, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Defence of this People, are very much in your Hands. And you muſt be entreated by the Honour you bear to Chriſt, and your Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Him,</hi> to ſerve this his People in theſe and all their Intereſts, to the utmoſt Reach of your Power.</p>

AND I ſuppoſe never did the State of this People call for more conſummate Wiſdom, tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, inviolable Fidelity, and unceaſing Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for their Welfare, from their Fathers in the Government, than at this Day.</p>
            <p>AN <hi>empty Treaſury,</hi> a <hi>defence leſs Country,</hi> and <hi>embarraſs'd Trade,</hi> are indeed melancholy Things. How to ſupply the one, fortify the other, and relieve the third, will to be ſure be the Matters of your Attention. But here you expect no Advice from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> And indeed the Wiſdom of the wiſe ſeems to fail them, and humane Contrivance to be at a <hi>non plus.</hi> But when we know not what to do, <hi>our Eyes ſhou'd be unto the Lord:</hi> For he has ſaid,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 14. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Counſel is mine, and ſound wiſdom: I lead in the Way of Righteouſneſs, in the Midſt of the Paths of Judgment.</hi> And innumerable Ways are open to <hi>his</hi> View, when all are ſhut up to ours.</p>
            <p>AMIDST theſe Cares which will now preſs upon you, you will not forget that you are the <hi>Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Religion;</hi> but will do what you can to maintain the the Kingdom of Chriſt among us, in its Light, Purity and Glory. It is for the Sake of the Church that the World ſtands, and Chriſt is <hi>Head over all Things for the Church:</hi> Therefore they that rule by <hi>Him</hi> ſhou'd employ their Care and Power for <hi>that</hi> in the firſt and chief Place. So the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their March tho' the Wilderneſs, <hi>pitched their Standard, at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God,</hi>

               <hi>about the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> to ſecure it. You will therefore think it your Duty to ſtrengthen the Hands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Hearts of the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt; and do your Part that there may be a

Succeſſion of ſuch in Times to come, by ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Means of Education, and cheriſhing the <hi>College</hi> from whence the Churches look for their Supply: Your generous Smiles on that Society we thankfully acknowledge as an Inſtance of your juſt Care that Religion and Learning may ſtill flouriſh amongſt us.</p>
            <p>WHETHER any new <hi>Laws</hi> need to be bro't forward, for the ſuppreſſing our growing immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, You, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who live in the ſeveral Parts of our Land, can beſt judge.

            <p>LET your <hi>Courts</hi> therefore be always <hi>open'd in His Name:</hi> I mean that you pay Him your publick Homage, and adore him as the ſupream <hi>King, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> by ſolemn and open Prayer. This is done, I ſuppoſe, in our ſeveral Courts of Juſtice thro' the Land: And I think that all the <hi>Officers</hi> of the Court, and thoſe who have Buſineſs at it, ſhould be order'd reverently to attend—Realiſe his <hi>Preſence,</hi> Preſidency and Inſpection, and act under the Awe and Influence thereof: For <hi>He ſtandeth in the Congregation of the mighty, and</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IN <hi>civil Cauſes</hi> let there be ſhewn the moſt ſteady Impartiality, and unreproachable Integrity. The Charge which King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> gave to his Judges, is the Charge of the King of Heaven to <hi>you, Take heed what you do;</hi>

               <hi>for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherefore let the Fear of the Lord be upon you: For there is no Iniquity with the Lord our God, nor Reſpect of Perſons, nor taking of Gifts.</hi>—And in <hi>criminal Caſes,</hi> let the Edge of the Law be ſharpned in Proportion to the Nature of the Crime, and the Boldneſs of the Tranſgreſſor. While you ſit on the Seat of Judgment, Sinners ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Face as <hi>the Face of God,</hi> which is <hi>ſet againſt them that do wickedly:</hi> And the Day of <hi>Aſſize</hi> ſhould be a little Image of that Day, when the Lord will come <hi>to judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and the People with his Truth;</hi> and ſhall <hi>render Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh, to every Soul of Man that doth Evil.</hi> The Judge on the Bench ſhould be worthy of that Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which Chriſt gave to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>BUT as the wiſe Conſtitution of our Government has put the Execution of our Laws very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of a <hi>ſingle Magiſtrate,</hi> ſo I would apply my ſelf here to thoſe who are in <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Peace</hi> thro' the <hi>Province.</hi>

You, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> may do much in your <hi>ſingle Capacity,</hi> to reſtrain the Sons of Wickedneſs; to ſtop the Mouths of profane Swearers and Curſers; to prevent Sabbath-breaking, Drunkenneſs and Idleneſs; and to break up ſuch Houſes as are Places of Debauchery, and Cages of unclean Birds. <hi>Courts</hi> can take Notice only of what is preſented to them; but <hi>you</hi> can <hi>ſearch out</hi> Iniquity, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it into its hiding Places. And let me <hi>beſeech</hi> you for Chriſt's Sake, and <hi>charge</hi> you in his Name, to ariſe and exert your ſelves. For, is there not Occaſion? Is not the preſent Generation looſe and diſſolute in Manners? Does not Iniquity come in upon us like a Flood? And Vice almoſt ride tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant? Will you then let the Sword of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>ruſt</hi> in your Hands? Shall our good Laws prove a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and lie by as waſte Paper, only for want of a vigorous Execution? And ſhall the Enemies of GOD and Godlineſs, find Security under <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates?</hi>—Certainly they who receive ſuch an important Truſt as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of our Laws, and accept of the Honour attending the Title of Magiſtrates, ſhould be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Diſcharge of their Office.</p>
            <p>THANKS be to GOD! We are bleſs'd under the preſent Adminiſtration with a Number of ſuch Magiſtrates. And the Zeal of <hi>ſome</hi> of them in this <hi>Town</hi> is truly laudable, and has had a viſible good Effect—Go on, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> with new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Vigour, in your pious Endeavours for the legal Suppreſſion of ſcandalous Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

            <p>II. IT is now Time for me to haſten to apply my ſelf to the <hi>Body of the People,</hi> thoſe who are only in a <hi>private Capacity,</hi> and fall into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the <hi>Ruled.</hi>

               <q>Is it not a valuable Bleſſing, that we don't ſee ſuch Madneſs and Folly ſet in great Dignity over us, which would make Vice reputable?

and Sobriety; openly wallowing in the groſſeſt Pollutions of Senſuality? Ought not this to be eſteem'd a Favour of Heaven, which challenges a Tribute of Gratitude and Praiſe.</q> For the Lives of ſuch Rulers would give a <hi>Sanction</hi> to Wickedneſs; and what a Torrent of it would then break in upon us, and bear away all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition before it? It is an ancient Obſervation, and will always be found true, <hi>The Wicked, walk on every Side,</hi>

            <p>FINALLY,</p>
            <p>I am to demand <hi>Subjection</hi> and Obedience to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, from <hi>every one of you all.</hi> If <hi>Kings and Judges of the Earth,</hi> are to kiſs the Son of GOD, and ſerve the Lord with Fear, <hi>Common People</hi> cannot be excus'd. Chriſt is your rightful Sovereign: But does he reign in your Hearts, and in your Lives? Are none of you in a foreign Service? He that hath your Obedience, the ſame is your Lord and King. <hi>To whom ye yield your ſelves Servants to obey,</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004498_0050_100D5A762D7D4B50"/>
Commands of Chriſt, or the Solicitations of Satan, and your own Luſts?—<hi>The works of the Fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> which are theſe, Drunkenneſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Wrath, Hatred, Variance, &amp;c. How many by living in theſe Sins, and alſo in the Neglect of thoſe holy ſpiritual Duties of Religion which Chriſt requires, trample upon his Authority, and declare <hi>They will not have this Man to reign over them?</hi> This is the Language of Sinners, <hi>Let us break thoſe Bands aſunder</hi> which bind us to Chriſt, and <hi>caſt away his Cords from us!</hi>—But will You, O Sinner! perſiſt in this Rebellion? If you do ſo but a little longer, it will iſſue in your utter Ruin, and his Power and Righteouſneſs will raiſe Satisfaction and Glory to themſelves from your deſerved eternal Deſtruction. Luke 19. 27. <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies, that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEAR then the Counſel of Heaven, and obey the Command of the Goſpel this Day; every one of you without Exception. <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> with a Kiſs of Loyalty and <hi>Subjection;</hi> and henceforth ſerve in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the Days of your Life:<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 9.</note> For he is <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation, only to them that obey him.—Kiſs the Son</hi> with a Kiſs of <hi>Affection:</hi>

Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Rulers</hi> of all Degrees: <hi>Be inſtructed all ye People,</hi> high and low, rich and poor together, <hi>Serve the</hi> LORD <hi>with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling: Kiſs the</hi> SON, <hi>leaſt He be angry, and ye periſh from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little: Bleſſed are all they that put their Truſt in Him!</hi>
