            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <speaker>SIR GEO.)</speaker>
               <p>WELL Mr. Flint, tho' I acknowledge that the late <hi>revenue acts, reſtrictions, regulations,</hi> and new conſtructed <hi>admiralty courts,</hi> are abſurd in themſelves, as well as hurtful to both the mother country and theſe colonies; and that they are now ſeen to be ſo by almoſt all the ſenſible part of the nation; yet, there is one thing that has always ſurprized us very much in England, and that is, we have been told that ye are as much divided among yourſelves in ſentiments about theſe affairs as we are in England; nay it has been repreſented to us by <hi>top hands,</hi> that the better ſort of people in the colonies acquieſce in thoſe meaſures, and that it is only a ſmall <hi>Faction</hi> that oppoſe them.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. FLINT.)</speaker>
               <p>I am ſenſible, ſir, that it has been ſo repreſented, but in the courſe of your travels through this country, I doubt not but you will find it quite otherwiſe; you'll find that the late meaſures are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by all orders of people thro' the continent, a few individuals excepted, that have rewards in view for profeſſing different ſentiments; I ſay <hi>profeſſing,</hi> for there is no man that can entertain real ſentiments in favor of either the juſtice or policy of the late meaſures; but I won't enter upon the ſubject now; let us take a walk upon 'change.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR GEO.)</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart; this is your goal that was burnt down the other night, I ſuppoſe, and that your ſtate houſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. FLINT.)</speaker>
               <p>Yes, this, ſir, is what we call our town houſe: Here our <hi>politicians, lawyers, merchants,</hi> and <hi>idle people</hi> walk an hour before dinner to ſettle the nation, while they are creating an appetite. Do you obſerve you group of people upon thoſe ſteps at the north ſide of the 'change? thoſe are the people that have <hi>aſſumed</hi> to themſelves the name of <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men,</hi> while in fact every man has in view ſome reward for putting on that character; for you muſt know that the real diſintereſted <hi>prerogative men,</hi> are thoſe who have been repreſented home as Sons of Liberty and licentiouſneſs. And I muſt now tell you, however ſurprizing, that thoſe now diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>prerogative</hi> men, are altogether compoſed of theſe four ſorts of people; high <hi>jacobites,</hi> men that have made all that they have by <hi>ſmuggling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> officers of the R—e <hi>that have defrauded the Crown</hi> of all that they are worth;—and poor <hi>indigent</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011225_0004_0F86ACF22533AA98"/>creatures that are ſeeking little places or <hi>penſions</hi> from G—t: Theſe are the ſort of people that wholly compoſe that <hi>prerogative group,</hi> as they are ironically ſtiled in this place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir GEO.)</speaker>
               <p>Ah! you ſurprize me very much: Pray who is that <hi>meager Tall-Man</hi> among 'em, that they ſeem ſo attentive to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. FLINT.)</speaker>
               <p>That Sir,—(under <hi>Verres</hi>) is their chief leader; he is now a provincial ſtate officer, with a <hi>penſion;</hi> was once an unſucceſsful <hi>ſmuggler</hi> and merchant in this town; he is the idol of that group, and ſome few more in the country, but has loſt the confidence and eſteem of the people, which was once his glory; he has two paſſions that prevail with great ſtrength; <hi>ambition</hi> and <hi>avarice,</hi> all others being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abſorbed; theſe are in great force indeed, and frequently interfere with each other, yet his moſt intimate friends cannot determine which moſt predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates, they are alternately uppermoſt, and having none of the common paſſions of life to diſturb him, he remains a man of aſſiduity and application; in whatever he undertakes, he is thoro'ly accompliſhed in every art both to make a friend, or take off an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as he may have occaſion, and is the maſter-piece of human nature for <hi>diſſimulation</hi> and <hi>diſguiſe.</hi>

               <p>I have heard of him in England—but in a very different character from that you give,— tho' lately his duplicity has been ſuſpected by thoſe he pays court to there; pray who is that grave, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant <hi>Spaniſh Phiz</hi> by the ſide of him?</p>

               <p>That Sir, is a retailer of tea in this town; he has been all his life poor till within a few years,—his private life is good; and as he is ſuppoſed to have laid by two or three thouſand pounds, he has a great inclination to the <hi>county bench,</hi> which his countenance is well ſuited for; yet for all that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>ſpaniſh gravity,</hi> diſcourſe him for a whole year together, and you'll find that that appearance incloſes nothing but lead; having the place I have mentioned in view, he is a down right <hi>prerogative man</hi> Sir, quite ſtanch indeed, and humbly devoted to the <hi>Tall-Man.</hi>
