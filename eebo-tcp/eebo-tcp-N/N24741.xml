            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN July laſt, the following letter was tranſmitted to the perſon to whom it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and a few weeks ago it was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under cover, without a ſyllable in reply.

            <head>EXPOSTULATORY LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.</head>
            <p>IT will generally be admitted, Sir, and perhaps with juſtice, that the great family of mankind were never more benefited by the military abilities of any individual than by thoſe which you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played during the memorable Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can conteſt. Your country was injured, your ſervices were called for, you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aroſe and after performing the moſt conſpicuous part in that blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained tragedy, you again became a private citizen, and unambitiouſly reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to your farm — I here was more of true greatneſs in this procedure, than the modern world, at leaſt, had ever beheld; and while public virtue is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by your country-men, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo exalted, will not be forgotten.—The effects which your revolution
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032785_0004_0FF564D4E4A59398"/>
will have upon the world are incalcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. By the flame which you have kindled, every oppreſſed nation will be enabled to perceive its fetters; and when man once knows that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved, the buſineſs of emancipation is half performed—France has already burſt her ſhackles, neighboring nations will in time prepare, and another half century may behold the preſent beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Europe, without a Peer, without a Hierarchy, and without a Deſpot. If men were enlightened, revolutions would be bloodleſs; but how are men to be enlightened, when it is the intereſt of governors to keep the governed in ignorance? "To enlighten men," ſays your old correſpondent, Arthur Young "is to make them bad ſubjects." Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes ſpread devaſtation: yet hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes are not only tranſient, but gives ſalubrity to the torrid regions, and are quickly followed by azure ſkies, and calm ſunſhine. Revolutions too, for a time, may produce turbulence; yet revolutions clear the political atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere and contribute greatly to the comfort and happineſs of the human
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032785_0005_0FF564D66D6667F0"/>
race. What you yourſelf have lived to witneſs in the United States is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to elucidate my poſition. In your rides along the banks of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite Potowmack, in your frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions through your own extenſive grounds, how gratifying muſt be your ſenſation on beholding the animated ſcenery around you, and how pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt be your feelings, on reflecting that your country is now an aſylum for mankind; that her commerce, her agriculture, and her population are greater than at any former period, and that this proſperity is the natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of thoſe rights which you defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt an abandoned cabinet, with all that ability which men, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheath the ſword in the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature will, I truſt, ever diſplay. Where liberty is, there man walks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and puts forth all his powers; while ſlavery, like a torpedo, benumbs the fineſt energies of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>But it is not to the commander in chief of the American forces, nor to the Preſident of the United States, that I have aught to addreſs; my buſineſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032785_0006_0FF564DFEC3FE180"/>
is with George Waſhington, of Mount Vernon, in Virginia, a man who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his hatred of oppreſſion and his ardent love of liberty, holds at this moment hundreds of his fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a ſtate of abject bondage.—Yes! you, who conquered under the banners of freedom—you, who are now the firſt magiſtrate of a free people, are, (ſtrange to relate) a ſlave-holder. That a Liverpool merchant ſhould endeavor to enrich himſelf by ſuch a buſineſs is not a matter of ſurpriſe, but that you, an enlightened character, ſtrongly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of your own freedom; you who, if the Britiſh forces had ſucceeded in the Eaſtern ſtates, would have retired with a few congenial ſpirits to the rude faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Weſtern wilderneſs, there to have enjoyed that bleſſing, without which a paradiſe would be diſguſting, and with which the moſt ſavage regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not without its charms; that you, I ſay, ſhould continue to be a ſlave hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a proprietor of human fleſh and blood, creates in many of your Britiſh friends both aſtoniſhment and regret.</p>
            <p>You are a Republican, and an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032785_0007_0FF564E178094E70"/>
for the diſſemination of knowledge and for univerſal juſtice—where then are the arguments by which this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs dereliction of principle can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported? Your friend Jefferson<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Beſides thoſe of color, figure and hair, there are other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical diſtinctions, proving a difference of race. They have leſs hair on their face and body. They ſecrete leſs by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the ſkin, which gives them a very ſtrong diſagreeable odor. This greater degree of tranſpiration renders them more tolerent of heat, and leſs ſo of cold, than the whites. Perhaps too a difference of ſtructure in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary aparatus, which a late ingenious experimenteliſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Crawford, Stockdale, London.</note> has diſcovered to be the principal regulator of animal heat, may have diſabled them from extricating, in the act of inſpiration, ſo much of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, to part with more of it. They ſeem to require leſs ſleep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſlighteſt amuſements to ſit up till midnight, or later, tho' knowing he muſt be out by the firſt dawn of the morning. They are at leaſt as brave, and more adventure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. But this perhaps may proceed from a want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, which prevents their ſeeing a danger till it be preſent. When preſent, they do not go through it with more coolneſs or ſteadineſs than the whites. They are more ardent after their females; but love ſeems with them to be more an eager deſire, than a tender delicate mixture of ſentiment and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Their griefs are tranſient. Thoſe numberleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which render it doubtful whether Heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are leſs felt, and ſooner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with them. In general, their exiſtence appears to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate more of ſenſation than reflection. To this muſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed their diſpoſition to ſleep, when abſtracted from their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and unemployed in labor. An animal whoſe body is at reſt, and who does not reflect, muſt be diſpoſed to ſleep of courſe. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reaſon and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reaſon much inferior, as I think one could ſcarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the inveſtigations of Eucl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to ſhew that the negroes are an inferior order of being; but ſurely you will not have recourſe to ſuch a ſubterfuge. Your ſlaves, it may be urged, are well treated—That I deny. Man never can be well treated who is deprived of his rights. They are well cloathed, well fed, well lodged, &amp;c. Feed me with ambroſia, and waſh it down with nectar, yet, what are theſe, if liberty be wanting? You took arms in defence of the Rights of Man—Your negroes are men—Where then are the rights of your negroes,? They have been innured to ſlavery, and are not fit for freedom. Thus it was ſaid of the French; but where is the man of unbiaſſed common ſenſe who will aſſert that the French Republicans of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, are not fit for freedom? It has been ſaid too by your apologiſts, that your feelings are inimical to ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and that you are induced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in it at preſent merely from motives of policy; the only true policy is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and he who regards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of an act rather than the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032785_0009_0FF564E48E25DB50"/>
of it, gives no very exalted proof of the greatneſs of his character.</p>
            <p>But if your feelings be actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to ſlavery, then are you more culpable than the callous hearted plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who laughs at what he calls the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful whining of the Abolitioniſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believes ſlavery to be juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while you perſevere in a ſyſtem which your conſcience tells you to be wrong. If we call the man obdurate who cannot perceive the attrociouſneſs of ſlavery, what epithets does he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve who, while he does perceive its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trociouſneſs, continues to be a proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of ſlaves. Nor is it likely that your own unfortunate negroes are the only ſufferers by your adhereing to this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious buſineſs; conſider the force of an example like yours, conſider how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many of the ſable race may now be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in bondage merely forſooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Preſident of the United States, who has the character of a wiſe and good man, does not ſee cauſe to diſcontinue the long eſtabliſhed prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Of all the ſlave holders under Heaven, thoſe of the United States
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032785_0010_0FF564EECE0C9A78"/>
appear to me the moſt reprehenſible; for man never is ſo truly odious as when he inflicts upon others that which he himſelf abominates. When the cup of ſlavery was preſented to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, they rejected it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and appealed to the world in juſtification of their conduct; yet, ſuch is the inconſiſtency of man, that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands upon thouſands of thoſe very people, with yourſelf amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are now ſedulouſly employed in holding the ſelf-ſame bitter draught to the lips of their ſable brethren. From men who are ſtrongly attached to their own rights, and who have ſuffered much in their defence, one might have expected a ſcrupulous attention to the rights of others; did not experience ſhew, that when we ourſelves are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, we perceive it with a Lynx's eye; but when we become the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, no noon-tide bats are blinder. Proſperity perhaps may make nations as well as individuals forget the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of other times; yet ſurely the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of America cannot ſo ſoon have forgotten the variety and extent of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032785_0011_0FF564F061F567B8"/>
their own ſufferings. When your country lay bruiſed by the iron hand of deſpotiſm, and you were compelled to retreat through the Jerſeys with a handful of half naked followers; when the bayonet of the mercenary gliſtened at your back, and liberty ſeemed about to expire, when your farms were laid waſte, your towns reduced to aſhes, and your plains and woods were ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the mangled bodies of your brave defenders; when theſe events were taking place, every breaſt could feel, and every tongue could execrate the ſanguinary proceedings of Britain; yet what the Britiſh were at that period; you are in a great degree at this—you are boaſtful of your own rights—you are violators of the rights of others, and you are ſtimulated by an inſatiable ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, to a cruel and relentleſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. If the wrongs which you now inflict be not ſo ſevere as thoſe which were inflicted upon you, it is not becauſe you are leſs inhuman than the Britiſh, but becauſe the unhappy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of your tyranny have not the power of reſiſtance. In defending your
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032785_0012_0FF564F1EB90A620"/>
own liberties you undoubtedly ſuffered much; yet if your negroes, emulating the ſpirited example of their maſters, were to throw off the galling yoke, &amp; retiring peaceably to ſome uninhabited part of the weſtern region, were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on liberty or death, what would be the conduct of the ſouthern planters on ſuch an occaſion? Nay, what would be your conduct? You who were <q>born in a land of liberty,</q> who, <q>early learned its value,</q> you, who <q>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a perilous conflict to defend it,</q> you who, <q>in a word, devoted the beſt years of your life to ſecure its permanent eſtabliſhment in your own country, and whoſe anxious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, whoſe ſympathetic feelings and whoſe beſt wiſhes are irreſiſtibly excited, whenſoever in any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try you ſee an oppreſſed nation unfurl the banners of freedom.</q>

and animating a movement as the revolt of your ſouthern negroes!</p>
            <p>No! I fear both you and your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen would rather imitate the cold blooded Britiſh cabinet, and, to gratify your own fordid views would ſcatter among an unoffending people, terror, deſolation and death. Harſh as this concluſion may appear, yet it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by your preſent practice; for the man who can boaſt of his own rights, and yet holds two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his fellow beings in ſlavery, would not heſitate in caſe of a revolt to employ the moſt ſanguinary means in his power, rather than forego that which the <hi>truly</hi> republican laws of his country are <hi>pleaſed</hi> to call his property. Shame! Shame! That man ſhould be deemed the property of man, or that the name of WASHINGTON ſhould be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the liſt of ſuch proprietors!</p>
            <p>Should theſe ſtrictures be deemed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere or unmerited on your part, how comes it that while in the northern and middle ſtates, the exertions of the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Quakers &amp; all other philanthropiſts, have produced ſuch regulations as muſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032785_0014_0FF564FFD02B82D8"/>
ſpeedily eradicate every trace of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that quarter; how comes it, that from you theſe humane efforts have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received the leaſt countenance? If your mind has not ſufficient firmneſs to do away that which is wrong the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you perceive it to be ſuch, one might have expected, that a plan for ameliorating the evil would have met with your warmeſt ſupport; but no ſuch thing. The juſt example of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the State has made no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect upon you; and as to the men of Maryland, of Virginia, of the two Carolinas, of Georgia, and of Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, they ſmile contemptuouſly at the idea of negro emancipation, and, with the State Conſtitution in one hand, and the cow-ſkin in the other exhibit to the world ſuch a ſpectacle, as every real friend to liberty muſt from his ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Then what is man, and what man ſeeing this,</l>
               <l>And having human feelings, does not bluſh</l>
               <l>And hang his head to think himſelf a man.</l>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:032785_0015_0FF564FE48D75DE0"/>The hypocritical bawd who preaches chaſtity, yet lives by the violation of it, is not more truly diſguſting, than one of your ſlave-holding gentry bellowing in favor of democracy. Man does not readily perceive defects in what he has been accuſtomed to venerate; hence it is that you have eſcaped thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions which your ſlave proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip has ſo long merited. For ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en years you bravely fought the battles of your country, and contributed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the eſtabliſhment of her liberties; yet you are a ſlave-holder! You have been raiſed by your fellow-citizens to one of the moſt exalted ſituations upon earth, the firſt magiſtrate of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet you are a ſlave-holder! A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of your countrymen have recently diſcovered that ſlavery is unjuſt and are gradually aboliſhing the wrong, yet you continue to be a ſlave-holder! You are a firm believer too, and your letters and ſpeeches are replete with pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Divine Being, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, &amp;c. yet you are a ſlave-holder! Oh! Waſhington. 'Ages to come will read with aſtoniſhment' that the man
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032785_0016_0FF565015A93B600"/>
who was foremoſt to wrench the rights of America from the tyrannical graſp of Britain, was amongſt the laſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his own oppreſſive hold of poor and unoffending negroes! In the name of juſtice, what can induce you thus to tarniſh your own well earned celebrity and to impair the fair features of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican liberty with ſo foul and indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a blot? Avarice is ſaid to be the vice of age. Your ſlaves, old and young, male and female, father, mother and child, might, in the eſtimation of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian planter, be worth from fifteen to twenty thouſand pounds. Now, ſir, are you ſure that the unwillingneſs which you have ſhewn to liberate your negroes, does not proceed from ſome lurking pecuniary conſideration? If this be the caſe, and there are thoſe who firmly believe it is, then there is no fleſh left in your heart; and preſent reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, future fame, and all that is eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among the virtuous, are, for a few thouſand pieces of paltry yellow dirt,
irremedibly renounced.</p>
