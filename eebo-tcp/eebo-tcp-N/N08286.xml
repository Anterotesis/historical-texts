            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORDINATION SERMON.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ACTS XVII. 2, 3.</bibl>
               <q>"And Paul, as his manner was,—reaſoned with them out of the ſcriptures; opening and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, and riſen again from the dead; and that this Jeſus, whom I preach unto you, is the Chriſt."</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE apoſtle Paul (an account of whoſe preaching is tranſmitted to us in theſe words) was, in point of natural abilities, and humanely acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accompliſhments, the greateſt by far of all the apoſtles. More than this, he was exceeded by none of them in gracious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as a chriſtian; or extraordinary gifts as an officer in the kingdom of God, which was now ſetting up in the world. Perhaps, we have in him, after due prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010580_0004_0F80D0DF60FCA420"/>
to our great Maſter and Lord, the moſt compleat pattern of the good man, eſpecially the good miniſter. Who, among thoſe, whether inſpired or uninſpired, that have been thought worthy to be entruſted with the diſpenſation of the goſpel, were ever better qualified for their work, ſpirited to it, or that laboured in it with more prudence, diligence, fidelity, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reſolution, amidſt the greateſt trials and difficulties? Were directions to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to form the moſt reſpectable miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial character, they could not be fetched from a more ſtriking and inſtructive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (our Saviour's only excepted) than this of the apoſtle Paul's, as ſet forth in the ſacred books.</p>
            <p>TWO things eminently exemplary in him, and worthy of the particular notice of all goſpel-miniſters, are recorded in my text, and may employ our preſent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; the MANNER in which he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the SUBJECTS he preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>AS to his manner of preaching, it was RATIONAL, and SCRIPTURAL. Says the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010580_0005_0F80D0E09D023560"/>
text, "he reaſoned with them out of the ſcriptures."</p>
            <p>HIS preaching was RATIONAL; that is to ſay, he made uſe of good arguing in his diſcourſes. He did not ſpeak to his hearers in a confuſed, incoherent, way; but there was a clear and juſt connection in what he ſaid. One thing depended on another, was illuſtrated by it, or deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from it. He applied to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of men for their enlightning, to their judgments for their information, to their conſciences for their conviction; and not merely to their affections and paſſions to warm and melt them.</p>
            <p>THIS was the way in which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Theſſalonian Jews. And it was his MANNER in preaching at other times, and in the audience of other people. To be ſure, if we may judge of his preaching, either by his epiſtles, which make ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part of the new-teſtament; or by his apologies for himſelf; or by the goſpel he preached, the record of which we have in the book of <hi>Acts,</hi> it was not in the way of a looſe, unconnected application to the affections of men; nor in the way
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010580_0006_0F80D0E10B1D1BA8"/>
of mere authoritative, magiſterial affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in virtue of his apoſtleſhip, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary character as a meſſenger from God; but by reaſoning upon what he ſaid, by making good what he delivered by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inference and deduction. This was his MANNER of preaching. And by it, as one obſerves, "he has ſanctified reaſon to the purpoſes of religion, and ſhewed us that one ſort, and indeed the beſt ſort, of good preaching conſiſts in good arguing".</p>
            <p>SOME there are, I am ſenſible, who are rather offended than pleaſed, when preachers ſpeak to them upon things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the kingdom of God and Chriſt in a way of reaſoning; though they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in copy after the example of an inſpired apoſtle. They have no reliſh for diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, unleſs adapted to excite their paſſions. If theſe are put in motion, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the preacher, and imagine they have gained ſpiritual profit: Whereas, if he ſo opens his ſubject, by good reaſoning, as to ſet it before their underſtandings in a clear and ſtrong point of view, it is in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, a poor inſipid buſineſs, not at all calculated to the purpoſe of godly edifying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010580_0007_0F80D0E1A80DD478"/>
BUT they are herein egregiouſly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. It ſhould always be remembred, the paſſions may be moved, when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, far from being inſtructive, is crude, rambling, unconnected, and, it may be, inconſiſtent with itſelf. The excitement of ſenſations that are pleaſing may be the effect, not of light operating in the mind, but of mere ſounds modulated in a certain way. And whenever this is the caſe, as it too often is in fact, the motion in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is nothing more than the mere working of animal nature. 'Tis wholly a mechanical production, and of no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the ſpiritual ſenſe: Whereas, when truth, by juſt reaſoning, is let into the mind ſo as to be clearly perceived and well underſtood, real good is done; yea, good that may, if it be not our own fault, turn out to ſaving advantage. The apoſtle Paul therefore, who was well acquainted with human nature, reaſoned with his hearers, as the wiſeſt and moſt effectual method he could take to promote their religious improvement. He knew that warmth in the paſſions was, at beſt, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and vaniſhing, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fail of anſwering any good end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010580_0008_0F80D0E25EE59B60"/>
light and truth were firſt conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind. He knew he was ſpeaking to men, who, as they are endowed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual powers, ought chiefly to be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by their underſtandings, not their affections, and muſt be ſo influenced, if they are ever influenced to good purpoſe in the buſineſs of ſalvation. It was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly his main care to reaſon with them, offering what was proper to open and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their minds, and "fill them with the knowledge of God's will in all ſpiritual wiſdom and underſtanding."</p>
            <p>NOT that the paſſions ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. They have their uſe in religion, as well as in common life; and may with pertinency, and to good purpoſe, be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up. But then care ſhould be taken as to the way in which this is done. Surely, it ought not to be attempted by a ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolemn uſe of mere words and phraſes, which though pious in their ſound, yet have no plain, if intelligible, meaning; nor by a noiſy fervor in ſpeaking that is only hiſtrionical and affected; nor by that management of voice and geſture which is nothing more than the effect of worldly policy. This was not the way in which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010580_0009_0F80D0E64B5E3B88"/>
the apoſtle Paul endeavoured to affect his hearers. He deſpiſed the thought of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing admiration, or any profitable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on it, by crafty addreſſes, artfully contrived to pleaſe his hearers by tickling their fancies, and raiſing a uſeleſs motion in their paſſions. Says he to the chriſtians at Corinth, 1 Cor. ii. 4. "My ſpeech and my preaching was not with enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing words of mans wiſdom." What does the apoſtle here mean by "enticing words of mans wiſdom"? If he had any meaning at all, his view was directly pointed at that artful manner of placing and pronouncing words, by which deſigning men, in that day, ſo moved the affections of the people, as, under this influence, to perſuade them to will and do juſt as they would have them. And why did he not endeavour, in this way, to allure thoſe he converſed with, and preached to? Surely, not becauſe he wanted ability in this kind! His invention was ready, his imagination lively, he had words at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Beſides, having been educated under the care of the great Gamaliel, he was learned in "the wiſdom of words," that is, in all the invented arts to work mechanically upon men's paſſions to lead them blindfold. But he eſteemed it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010580_0010_0F80D0E7020A79E8"/>
to the goſpel of the bleſſed God, a debaſement of its infinitely intereſting truths, to deliver them in this worldly-wiſe manner; as though they needed the help of man's wiſdom to give them force to touch the heart, and ſet the affections into all the motion that would ſerve to any religious purpoſe.</p>
            <p>NOT that he reaſoned with his hearers in a dull, cold, lifeleſs manner, having up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mind no juſt ſenſe of the important weight of eternal concerns. His heart was thoroughly warmed when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and he uttered himſelf, without all doubt, as one that was in real earneſt, and ſo as that it might be ſeen that he was ſo. The God of nature has ſo formed us, that we cannot ſpeak upon matters which lie with weight upon our minds, and greatly affect us, without the diſcovery of it in the very manner of our ſpeaking. There are certain outward ſigns by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feeling of the heart is indicated; and they are ſo obvious, and naturally ſtriking, that they cannot eaſily be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood: And they have the ſtrongeſt tendency to arreſt the attention, and tranſmit the like ſenſations to thoſe who are ſpoken to. In this naturally and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010580_0011_0F80D0E7A4C6A470"/>
powerfully affecting way the apoſtle Paul delivered his reaſonings with the people, upon the great affairs of their ſouls and everlaſting ſalvation; and it is the beſt, perhaps the only proper way in which they ſhould be delivered. Theatrical airs are well enough ſuited to performances on the ſtage, where the putting mens paſſions and affections into a pleaſing commotion for the preſent is all that is aimed at. But the pulpit does not ſeem a fit place for acting a part. By mimicking nature, if it is done well, or, what means, in this caſe, preciſely the ſame thing, by artfully play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hypocrite, preachers may move the paſſions of their hearers: but the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this way excited, is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of the ſame kind with that which is occaſioned by "the ſounding of braſs, and the tinkling of a cymbol;" and of as little uſe or profit in the affairs of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and ſalvation.—But I muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle Paul's preaching was SCRIPTURAL, as well as rational. The meaning is, he made uſe of ſcripture-arguments in his diſcourſes; in this way illuſtrating and confirming the truths he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010580_0012_0F80D0E867E43C08"/>
delivered, wherein he could do it with propriety. Says the text, "he reaſoned with them out of the ſcriptures." He did not merely cite a paſſage or two from thence, but argued upon the texts he had occaſion to mention; entering into their true ſpirit, opening their ſenſe, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their pertinency as proofs of this or the other truth he was upon. And it was his manner to be thus ſcriptural, when he had to do with the Jews, as was the caſe at preſent.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES his hearers, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects moſt proper to ſpeak to them upon, were ſuch, that arguments from reaſon were the fitteſt to be uſed with them. And, in this caſe, his arguing was from mere rational principles. Thus, when he was called to preach before Felix, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man governor, conſidering his character as an unjuſt and adulterous man, he "reaſoned with him of righteouſneſs and temperance," as well as "a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxii. 5.</note> So when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the idolatrous people at Lyſtra, his ſubject was, "their turning from vanities," or idols, "to the living God." And the method of reaſoning he uſed was, a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010580_0013_0F80D0E985BA56D0"/>
repreſentation of God to them not only as "the maker of heaven and earth," but the God who had given to all nations ſufficient evidence of his being and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential government, for that "he had done them good, and given them rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xviv. 15. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT whenever he preached to the Jews, who were well acquainted with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the old-teſtament, and received them as given by inſpiration of God, "he reaſoned with them out of theſe ſcriptures." And it was his cuſtom to do ſo. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpecimen of this we have in my text, to which I may add that ſimilar one, in Acts xiii. from the 16th to the 37th verſe; where, from the heads, at leaſt, of a long ſermon which he preached, it appears to have been a chain of ſcripture-reaſoning calculated and intended to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and upon this baſis to publiſh that moſt intereſting goſpel-doctrine, in the 38th and 39th verſes, "Be it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you therefore, men and brethren, that,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010580_0014_0F80D0E9EBB93CC0"/>
through this man, is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins; and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes."</p>
            <p>AND reaſoning from the ſcripture is the beſt way of preaching. The apoſtle Paul ſhould herein be imitated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſters of the goſpel. Not that we may not, as prudence may direct, preach upon ſubjects that will require other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. There are truths it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, at certain times, and upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to bring into the pulpit, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which is derived primarily, at leaſt, from reaſon, not from revelation. And it cannot be expected that preachers, in regard of theſe truths, ſhould enlarge on ſcripture-arguments, any more than Paul did, when he was proving to the Athenians a principle of natural religion: Though, even in theſe points, all the light ſhould be fetched from the ſcripture that their nature will admit of. But the main ſubjects to be inſiſted on by goſpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſcripture-ones, "the myſteries that were hid from ages and generations,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010580_0015_0F80D0EAA1BA5E70"/>
but have been made manifeſt" by Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles. And ſcripture-reaſoning is the fitteſt to be uſed upon theſe ſubjects: Nor indeed, without this, will any other do.</p>
            <p>IT may be worth obſerving here, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing truths of chriſtianity, which the apoſtle Paul preached, he received, not in a way meerly human, but by immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God. It is by revelation alſo that goſpel-miniſters ever ſince have derived their knowledge of theſe truths; but in a different way. It is not directly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them from the fountain of light, but mediately by the ſcriptures, which were "wrote by holy men as moved by the holy Ghoſt." This difference between the apoſtle Paul, and goſpel-miniſters in theſe days, obviouſly points out a difference in that method of reaſoning which was uſed by him, and that which ought to be uſed by them. He freely and openly ſpake of the doctrines he delivered as what he had immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord; which it would be high arrogance in them to preſume to do. Not that he expected, or deſired, that his hearers ſhould give credit to his meer affirmation. He reaſoned with them to convince them, upon the foot of juſt and ſolid evidence, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010580_0016_0F80D0EDC3CB0220"/>
he was authoriſed by God to be his meſſenger to make known the counſels of his will rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to man's ſalvation. And he reaſoned with them alſo to ſhew them the conſiſtency of the truths he declared with the revelations of Moſes and the prophets; and not only ſo, but with the dictates of right reaſon, as being worthy of God, honorary to his perfections and government, and fit to be believed by all who profeſs to have underſtanding. This ſame way of reaſoning is proper for goſpel-miniſters at preſent, and will be ſo in all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time. But beſides this, the ſcriptures being to them the only true ſource of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the chriſtian ſcheme of doctrine and practice, theſe eminently are the ſource alſo from whence they ſhould fetch their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon this head. They may, in this way, convey to their hearers "the truth as it is in Jeſus;" and it ſhould be their main ſtudy to do ſo. Having, by a due uſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning powers, always depending upon the divine guidance and help, collected from the ſcriptures a clear, diſtinct, and full idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truths, they ſhould, in the ſame way communicate it in their preaching. They cannot be too ſtrong and cogent in thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from the ſcriptures, if, at the ſame time, they reaſon with perſpicuity, and ſo as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010580_0017_0F80D0EF0DF46EF8"/>
to be readily underſtood. It is, indeed, the beſt, the only proper way, in which they ſhould apply to people to let them into "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God," as it has been manifeſted in the goſpel-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>SOME there are, I know, who have an ill opinion of the uſe of reaſon in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. What, ſay they, has reaſon to do with revelation? It is unfit to be employed by goſpel-preachers, and not worthy of the notice of goſpel-hearers.</p>
            <p>IT is readily acknowledged, it would be a great impropriety in chriſtian miniſters, and juſtly offenſive, if they ſhould ſubſtitute rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the room of revelation, either by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly upon meer rational ſubjects, or by making reaſon, not the ſcripture, the ſource of their arguings upon revealed truths. But it muſt, at the ſame time, be ſaid, they cannot take a more effectual method to honor reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and render it profitable to their hearers, than by the help of reaſoning to lead them into a clear, juſt, and thorough conception of its true meaning. 'Tis a groſs miſtake to imagine, that revelation ever was intended to ſuperſede the uſe of reaſoning in goſpel-preachers
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010580_0018_0F80D0EF2A841050"/>
with reference to it. How could they ſatisfy their hearers, that what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as a divine revelation is not an impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their underſtandings, but by the uſe of reaſoning? Or if they have been before perſuaded, and upon good grounds, that the revelation they receive, really came from God, how ſhall they let them into an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of its meaning, but by ſtill reaſoning with them? In what other way can they make it evident to them, that this, and not that, is its true ſenſe? Nay, if reaſoning is to be thrown by as uſeleſs, will not every ſenſe that can be put on the ſcripture be equally proper? Yea, may not the moſt contrary ſenſes be admitted at the ſame time, ſince reaſon only can point out the inconſiſtency between them? There is, in ſhort, no way but this of reaſoning to open the ſcripture, trace out the connection of its ſeveral parts, and aſcertain preciſely the ſenſe in which this and the other part ought to be underſtood. Nor can miniſters properly guard their people againſt any extravagancies, either in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or practice, but by a due application to their underſtandings. This only will give check to wantoneſs in their imaginations; and unleſs they will hearken to what may be offered in a way of juſt reaſoning, can they be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010580_0019_0F80D0EFDF8F44F8"/>
hindered from following every idle fancy, till they have loſt themſelves in the wilds of falſehood and inconſiſtency.</p>
            <p>MINISTERS, 'tis true, may, by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, pervert the ſcripture; giving it a wrong ſenſe, or ſo mixing corruption with the right one, as that the truth can ſcarce be diſcerned. But it will by no means follow from hence, that they muſt lay aſide reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as of no ſervice in things pertaining to God and religion. The proper improvement of their being thus liable to miſuſe the noble power of reaſoning is for people, on the one hand, not to eſteem them "lords of their faith," and implicitly give credit to all that they ſay; but, looking upon them as frail, imperfect, and falible men, to receive noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they deliver for truth, only as they are convinced it is ſo upon an impartial cloſe compariſon of it with the word of God: And for miniſters, on the other hand, to keep as much as may be from all undue influence in the exertion of their reaſonable powers. In order whereto, they cannot, in too ſerious and humble a frame of mind, put themſelves under the guidance of the Spirit of truth in their enquiries into the mind of Chriſt as revealed in the ſcripture: Nor can they be too much
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010580_0020_0F80D0F0A3F1EF50"/>
upon their guard, either againſt that "fear of man," on the one hand, "which brings a ſnare," or that fondneſs for praiſe, and its pleaſing appendages, on the other, which is equally dangerous. They ſhould alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of paying an undue regard to venerable names and writings, having recourſe to the BIBLE as their ORACLE, their TOUCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE, their ONLY SURE RULE of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the excluſion of all other compoſures of all kinds whatever. And they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to this ſacred book with an honeſt mind, an upright intention to find the truth; and having ſo done, they ſhould, in their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſet it before their hearers in an eaſy, and yet ſtrong, point of light, as nearly as may be according to the purity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in which it lies in the ſcripture itſelf.—</p>
            <p>BUT 'tis time that I paſs, from the manner, to the SUBJECT-MATTER of the apoſtle Paul's preaching. And this was, that "Jeſus is the Chriſt"; that "he muſt needs have ſuffered, and have riſen again from the dead."</p>
            <p>THE firſt truth, I would mention as inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by Paul in his preaching, was, that "Jeſus is the Chriſt"; that is, the Meſſiah pointed out in the writings of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010580_0021_0F80D0F19E05D638"/>
and propheſied of as the ſon of God, and Savior of men. This was a truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary his hearers ſhould know, an eſſential requiſite in order to their being chriſtians. He accordingly not only alledged, but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully proved to them, that that perſon, who had been ſpoken of among them by the name of Jeſus, was "the Chriſt of God."</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be remembred here, the apoſtle Paul was now preaching to Jews, among whom there might be ſome proſelyted Greeks, that is, Gentiles who had embraced the Jewiſh religion ſo far, at leaſt, as to own the authority of the ſcriptures of the old-teſtement, Moſes and the prophets. It was therefore "out of theſe ſcriptures," that he "reaſoned with them" in proof that that "Jeſus whom he preached was the Chriſt." Doubtleſs, in proſecution of his argument, he pointed their view to thoſe paſſages in the ſacred books, in which the promiſed Meſſiah was particularly deſcribed, and on purpoſe that he might be known and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all others, when he ſhould come; making application of them to Jeſus, and ſhowing their exact and punctual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in him. And, as among the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive marks given in the old-teſtament of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010580_0022_0F80D0F221637858"/>
the Meſſiah, one was, that, in his day, and upon ſetting up his kingdom, "the eyes of the blind ſhould be opened and the ears of the deaf unſtopped; the lame man ſhould leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing"; I ſay, as theſe miraculous works were to be wrought in the Meſſiah's day, we may be ſure the apoſtle Paul enlarged in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon the wonders which had been done by Jeſus himſelf, and by his apoſtles in his name, and by power communicated to them from him, in proof of his being the Chriſt, "he that was to come," as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Iſrael. And having made it indiſputably evident, that, in fulfilment of the ancient propheſies, "the blind had received their ſight, the deaf their hearing, the lame their feet, and the dumb their tongues"; and this, by a touch only of the hand, or the ſpeaking of a word; not in a ſingle inſtance or two, but in multitudes; not in the caſe of friends only, who might be ſuſpected of deſign, but of ſtrangers, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, any who happened to fall in the way of Jeſus, or his apoſtles: I ſay, having clearly pointed out the fulfilment of the ſcripture-propheſies, in theſe miracles which had been wrought in the times of the goſpel, by Jeſus, or his apoſtles, his reaſoning was little ſhort
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010580_0023_0F80D0F30E592820"/>
of demonſtration; and if his hearers were not convinced, it could not be for want of evidence, but the perverſeneſs of their minds.</p>
            <p>IT would not be miſpent labor in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſters of the goſpel, if they ſometimes reaſoned with their hearers in proof that "Jeſus is the Chriſt." The ſtate of things 'tis true, is quite different now from what it was in the apoſtle Paul's days. Thoſe, he preached to, were, for the generality, ſtrangers to the religion of Jeſus, having ſcarce ever heard of his name. One of the firſt things therefore he had to do was, to convince his hearers, upon the foot of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence, that "Jeſus was the Chriſt." This was "the corner-ſtone" he had to lay. And till this was laid, in vain muſt he have endeavored to raiſe the goſpel-ſuperſtructure. Thoſe we commonly preach to are chriſtians in name. They profeſs faith in Jeſus as the Chriſt, and receive his religion as what came from God. It is not therefore neceſſary, that, "leaving the principles of the doctrines of Chriſt," we ſhould mainly endeavor to "lay again the foundation of faith" in a proof of the divine miſſion of that Jeſus whoſe religion we preach: Tho' if the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for this truth was oftner ſet in a clear
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010580_0024_0F80D0F640D201B8"/>
and full point of light before our hearers it would not be a needleſs labor. It could do no hurt to "the ſtrong in faith;" and it might be beneficial to thoſe of another cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. It would happily tend to confirm the weak, and eſtabliſh the wavering. Where the faith of any was nothing more than the effect of education and cuſtom, it might fix it upon its proper baſis, and render it not eaſily liable to be ſubverted. And, above all, it might convince unbelievers, if it may be ſuppoſed any ſuch there are among us; at leaſt, it would make it appear, that the faith of chriſtians was not owing to their credulity; but that they had good "reaſon for their hope," as founded on the goſpel-revelation.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER truth the apoſtle Paul enlarged on was, "that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered." The great thing that hindered the Jews, who were now his auditors, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus as the Chriſt, was, his having ſuffered death. "Chriſt crucified is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly often ſpoken of, in the new-teſtament-books, as "a ſtumbling-block to the Jews." They expected the Meſſiah would appear a mighty temporal deliverer; conquering their enemies, and making them the greateſt and moſt flouriſhing kingdom in all the world.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010580_0025_0F80D0F76BB9DCE8"/>
But, as "Jeſus of Nazareth," inſtead of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the pomp and grandeur of an earthly king, ſubmitted to a ſuffering life, and an ignominious death, they were "offended." This was "the ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence," or, in more plain words, the great obſtacle in the way of their faith. The apoſtle Paul, in order to remove away this ground of offence, "reaſoned with them out of the ſcriptures" upon the neceſſity of the croſs of Chriſt; "opening and alledging, that he muſt needs have ſuffered," that is, according to the propheſies of the old-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which could not otherwiſe have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their accompliſhment. He may be ſuppoſed to have reaſoned with them after ſome ſuch manner as this. It may be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to you to hear Chriſt preached as one that has been crucified and slain; but it "behoved Chriſt to ſuffer," it was really a matter of neceſſity that he ſhould die. Your own ſcriptures ſpeak of his ſufferings and death. Thoſe very writings which you own had their original from God, declare, that "the Meſſiah ſhould be cut off." He muſt needs therefore have died. He could not have been the Meſſiah, if he had not. This very thing, in the character of Chriſt, his ſuffering death, at which you are offended,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010580_0026_0F80D0F8878C2CB8"/>
is what muſt have been. The writings of Moſes and the prophets rendered it neceſſary. Your rulers, it is true, were inſtrumental in his death; but they were ſo "becauſe they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which are read every ſabbath-day;" yea, "theſe they fulfilled in condemning him."</p>
            <p>NOT that the apoſtle Paul contented himſelf meerly with ſpeaking of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt as a neceſſary fact, according to the propheſies of ſcripture. He would have been very deficient in his diſcourſe, if he had gone no further. Without all doubt, he took care to let his hearers into the grand deſign of the death of Chriſt; repreſenting its neceſſity as an expedient contrived by the wiſdom of God to atone for the ſins of men, and in this way to procure their pardon. For this alſo was pointed out, though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, in the old-teſtament books. The ſacrifices under the law, the expiatory ones in ſpecial, were, in the view of God, and the deſign of their appointment, prefigurations of the death of Chriſt, as an offering and ſacrifice to atone for tranſgreſſion. And Paul, as he might with propriety and force, probably ſpake to theſe Jews concerning the legal ſacrifices in their reference to Chriſt as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010580_0027_0F80D0F8E0088020"/>
types and ſhadows, which muſt have been anſwered in him as the great propitiation for the ſins of men. And, as it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly propheſied by the prophet Iſaiah, that "he ſhould be wounded for our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, bear our iniquities, and make his ſoul an offering for our ſins;" and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Daniel, that he ſhould "finiſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, make an end of ſin, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs;" he, doubtleſs, in his reaſoning from theſe texts, opened to them the great goſpel-doctrine of "forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through the blood of Chriſt." He did not meerly alledge and prove, that Chriſt had "ſuffered according to the ſcripture;" but that he "ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt," that God might, in a way honorary to his perfections and government, diſpenſe forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſinful ſons of men. In a word, he ſo reaſoned upon this ſubject of Chriſt's death, and the neceſſity of it, as to open to his hearers thoſe great goſpel-truths which are connected there with, and dependent thereon, as the baſis of our hope in the divine mercy for pardon and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>AND in this way ought goſpel-miniſters in theſe days to preach upon the ſufferings and death of Chriſt. 'Tis not enough to tell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010580_0028_0F80D0F9B3111EC0"/>
that he "became obedient to death, the death of the croſs;" or that, by dying, he confirmed the truth of the chriſtian revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and gave a perfect pattern of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces. Theſe things, it is acknowledged, are truths, and proper to be preached, and in their place ought to be preached. But they are truths of ſmall importance in compariſon with the great doctrine of "remiſſion of ſins," as founded on the "propitiation" made for them by the "blood of Chriſt," when he was nailed to the croſs. This was the grand point aimed at, by the wiſdom of God, in the ſufferings and death of his ſon Jeſus. And 'tis this that takes off the ſcandal of the croſs, and repreſents it as the reſult of the allwiſe counſel of the merciful God for the pardon of ſinful men.</p>
            <p>IN fine, another thing "opened and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged" by the apoſtle Paul, in his preaching was, that "Chriſt muſt needs have riſen again from the dead." He probably placed before the view of his preſent hearers the evidence of the truth of the fact. This he did, when he preached upon the ſame ſubject to the people at Corinth. We have, from his own pen, a recapitulation of the proofs he offered for their conviction upon this head; as you
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010580_0029_0F80D0FB0FB8AC68"/>
may read at large in his firſt epiſtle to them, the fifteenth chapter towards the beginning. But, beſides the truth of the fact itſelf, he enlarged on the <hi>ſcriptural</hi> neceſſity of it; making it indiſputably clear, by his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he "muſt needs have riſen from the dead," that the ancient propheſies fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling this event might have their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. It would be needleſs, though it might be eaſy, to point out the particular texts, in the ſacred books of the old-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is probable he argued from. The ſum of his reaſoning might be to this effect. Let it not be thought an incredible thing among you, that Chriſt, after he had been dead, was raiſed again to life. His death and reſurrection were inſeparably connected with each other in the plan of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own ſcriptures. The Meſſiah was "firſt to ſuffer, and then," by riſing from the dead, "to enter into glory." He could not have been the Chriſt of God, the Meſſiah deſcribed in the writings you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be of divine authority, if what I preach to you is not the truth. By his ſuffering death, you have a full completion of thoſe ſcripture-propheſies, which muſt have been fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:010580_0030_0F80D0FB71AC00E0"/>
NOR did the apoſtle treat of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt meerly as a fact, or a fact in completion of the ſcriptures; but, if we may judge from his preaching upon this ſame article at other times, he conſidered it as a truth eſſentially connected with the honor of Chriſt, and the peculiar important doctrines of his religion. If Chriſt is not "riſen from the dead," he was not the ſon of God and Savior of men in reality and truth, but in pretence only.—If Chriſt is not "riſen from the dead," we are "yet in our ſins;" as his death was not an atonement for them, to which God has teſtified his acceptance.—If Chriſt is not "riſen from the dead," he could not be "the firſt fruits of them that ſleep in him," the given pledge and aſſurance of their reſurrection to a glorious life that ſhall never have an end.—If Chriſt is not "riſen from the dead," he is not exalted at the right hand of God in heaven; he does not appear there as our advocate with the father, whom he heareth always; he is not the authoriſed king and judge of the world; nor is there any good reaſon to expect, that any of the ſons of Adam ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed by him, "according to their deeds done in the body." In ſhort, if Chriſt is not "riſen from the dead," the whole
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010580_0031_0F80D0FC098B09F8"/>
goſpel-ſcheme of ſalvation is a nullity. He "died in vain"; our "faith" in him as the Chriſt "is vain"; and ſo is our "faith in any of the doctrines of his religion.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be ſuppoſed, that the apoſtle Paul, an extraordinary meſſenger of God, ſhould; in treating on Chriſt's reſurrection from the dead, neglect to "open" this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in its neceſſary connection with thoſe great truths of chriſtianity, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on it. We may beſure, he not only affirmed, and proved, that that Jeſus, who was once dead, is now alive; but that he is alive in heaven, the approbated Savior, and authoriſed interceſſor, king and judge of men, by whom they will all be raiſed from the dead, and made happy, or miſerable, in another world, as their character in this has been either good, or bad.</p>
            <p>AND "Chriſt riſen from the dead," with the great truths comprehended in it, are ſtill neceſſary to be inſiſted on by thoſe who are goſpel-preachers: Nor will they deſerve this name, if they ſeldom, or in a curſory way only, make them the ſubject of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Theſe are doctrines that eminently reflect honor on Chriſt, and they enter deep
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010580_0032_0F80D0FC9EBD52E0"/>
into the ſcheme of divine mercy as it relates to man. They ought therefore to be the frequent theme of the pulpit. It will not ſuffice, that they are mentioned only now and then, as it were by the bye; but they ſhould often be enlarged on as truths highly worthy of the attention of hearers, and that need inculcation that their faith in them may be well rooted and eſtabliſhed. For their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is as truly dependent on a "a riſen and glorified" Chriſt, as a "crucified" one. They could no more have been ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the one than the other.</p>
            <p>ONE of the brighteſt patterns of good preaching, both as to its MANNER and SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECT-MATTER, has now been plainly, tho' imperfectly, ſet before you. And it would be eaſy to ſhow, wherein we might all receive benefit from it, whether we ſuſtain the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſpeakers, or hearers. But the time obliges me to confine what I would further ſay to the perſon, who may preſently be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated to the goſpel-miniſtry, and to the chriſtian ſociety of which he is to take the charge.</p>
            <p>IT was, Sir, with a more ſpecial eye to you, devoting yourſelf this day to "the miniſtry
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010580_0033_0F80D10020B4D168"/>
of the word," that I ſelected for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the noble pattern of good preaching that has been brought to view. Permit me to recommend it to your imitation. The copy was ſet by an apoſtle of Chriſt, one immediately commiſſioned by him, and that all along acted under his extraordinary guidance and direction. While therefore you conform yourſelf to it, you will approve yourſelf a good miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. You cannot, ſpeak to your people upon more proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects than thoſe that were the main ſcope of Paul's preaching. Your hearers indeed are chriſtians by profeſſion; for which reaſon, you may, ordinarily, in your diſcourſes, take it for granted, that they are believers in "Jeſus as the Chriſt:" Though, if you ſometimes enlarged on the evidences of this foundation-truth, it might be of good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But you cannot dwell too much in your preaching upon the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of Chriſt. They are truths of eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial importance in the religion of Jeſus. And they are comprehenſive ones alſo; for they include in them the whole doctrine of the goſpel. It ſhould be your great buſineſs to unfold their meaning in its juſt latitude; and if you do this from the ſcriptures, making them your guide and rule, in all your reaſoning
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010580_0034_0F80D100BAE06EF8"/>
upon them, you will declare to your people "the whole counſel of God" relative to their ſalvation; for it is all ſummarily contained in theſe articles; it is all deducible from them, and it has all been actually deduced by the ſacred penman, in the new-teſtament-books.</p>
            <p>You will imitate the great apoſtle of the Gentiles in the manner of your preaching al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; making it your principal care to apply to the underſtandings and conſciences of your hearers, and not to their paſſions and affections. You poſſeſs the intellectual powers in too great a degree to be in danger of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off with looſe, unconnected, empty harangues, which, if they ſhould give heat, can convey little or no light; nor would they be eaſy under ſuch preaching: They have been too much uſed to another and more excellent way to be ſo. This may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly appear a diſadvantage; you may be ready to think it had been better had it been your lot to ſucceed one not ſo diſtinguiſhed as Doctor MAYHEW was known to be for his talents as a preacher, and that made ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous a uſe of them; but it may be of ſervice to you, it can't fail of being ſo, if you improve it as a ſtimulus to excite your
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010580_0035_0F80D1016F724550"/>
ambition, and animate your endeavors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel as he did. With the apoſtle Paul, he conſidered his hearers as intelligent agents, and made it evident he entertained this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them by forming his diſcourſes ſo as to enlighten their minds in the knowledge of what he himſelf really believed, from the ſcriptures, to be "the truth as it is in Jeſus" without adulteration. Go you, and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; making it your care, in preaching, not ſo much to warm the affections of your hearers, as to touch their hearts by the light of truth, fetched from the ſcriptures as nearly as may be in its original purity. After the example of inſpired Paul, diſdain the uſe of craft to raiſe a uſeleſs, however pleaſing, heat in their paſſions; and allow not yourſelf to ſubſtitute "wiſdom of words," either in your compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or the delivery of them, in the room of that ſcriptural, rational light, without which heat in the paſſions will do no good; yea, ſhould it be raiſed to too great an height, it would rather tend to make men wild, than religious; as has too often been the caſe in fact. Let your "reaſonings out of the ſcriptures" be delivered from a heart deeply impreſſed with a ſerious ſenſe of the infinite importance of goſpel-truths; and you will then naturally ſpeak in the beſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010580_0036_0F80D101F03E5398"/>
adapted, and moſt powerful manner, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite affection, ſo far as it can be ſerviceable to any of the purpoſes of real chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>AND you would do well to remember, that the apoſtle Paul was as bright a pattern of GOOD LIVING, as of good preaching. Often take a view of his character in this point of light. And if, by being a "a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of him as he was of Chriſt," your conduct is ſuch as that you may be able to appeal to the conſciences of your people, and ſay as he could, "you are witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamably, I have behaved among you," it would eſtabliſh in their hearts a reverential love to you, and tend, more powerfully than you may be ready to imagine, to give life and efficacy to all your applications to them, whether public or private.</p>
            <p>THE effect of your miſſion this day is a ſecret "hid in God." It may eventually turn out an occaſion of making "hard hearts harder, and blind eyes blinder." An affecting thought this! but ſhould not be too diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging. Prophets and apoſtles have mourned, that they ſhould "labor in vain, and ſpend their ſtrength for nought:" Yea, our Maſter and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010580_0037_0F80D102B4F17398"/>
Lord had reaſon to adopt that language of the prophet Iſaiah, "who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Even an unſucceſsful miniſtry ſhould not therefore lie with two great weight upon your mind. But our hope is; that you are ſent of God to be his inſtrument in beginning, and carrying on, in multitudes, the work of grace in this world, that they may be formed to a meetneſs for "the un-incorruptible inheritance reſerved in heaven for them." "For this cauſe, we bow our knees" in humble prayer "to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;" and, I doubt not, this great aſſembly unite as one in ſaying, AMEN, ſo be it, O Lord! But whether your ſucceſs in the goſpel-miniſtry is great, or ſmall; whether few are ſaved by means of it, or many hardned; if you are faithful to Chriſt, and to the ſouls committed to your care, you will aſſuredly "be glorious in the eyes of the Lord."</p>
            <p>Go forth, my ſon, in the ſtrength of God. He that ſends you has ſaid for your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, "lo, I am with you alway." And if the great Savior is preſent with you to ſupport, comfort, and help you, what ſhould diſhearten you? Let nothing move you from
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010580_0038_0F80D103626EE930"/>
the path of duty; yea, "count not your life dear to you, ſo you may but fulfil the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry you have received of the Lord Jeſus;" and he will, in the day of his appearing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce you, before the general aſſembly of angels and men, "a good and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant," and "crown you with glory, honor, and immortality, in the kingdom of his father."</p>
            <p>I NOW turn myſelf to the chriſtian ſociety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who uſually worſhip God in this houſe. Brethren, as we lately mourned with you under the rebuke of heaven, which awfully bereaved you of your paſtor, highly eſteemed for the eminency of thoſe gifts with which it pleaſed the Father of Spirits to furniſh him for the work of the miniſtry, we now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of your joy in that goodneſs of the great "head over all things," which has given you, with ſo much unanimity, peace and love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong yourſelves, another paſtor, as we truſt, "after his own heart," one who is ſo well qualified to "reaſon with you from the ſcriptures" upon the important concerns of your ſouls ſalvation. Receive him as ſent to you from Chriſt, "not to have dominion over your faith," but to be "the helper of your joy." Cultivate the affection you bear
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010580_0039_0F80D10494852898"/>
towards him; and, while he acts in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as we truſt he will, let it diſcover its increaſing ſtrength and fervor in thoſe offices of chriſtian kindneſs, which may render his life comfortable and pleaſant to him. Bear with his infirmities; for, in common with others, he is a partaker of frail humanity. Ceaſe not to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in your applications to the throne of mercy: He needs your prayers, he deſires your prayers. Be upon your guard againſt evil ſurmiſings againſt him, taking riſe either from your ſelves, or others; and keep at the utmoſt diſtance from all needleſs and unjuſt prejudices: for nothing will more unhappily tend to obſtruct his uſefulneſs among you. Be conſtant in your attendance on his public adminiſtrations. Let your ears be ever open to his reaſonings with you; but make it your practice to compare them with the ſcripture, and do not ſuffer yourſelves to be influenced by them; only as you perceive their agreement with that ſacred and only teſt of chriſtian truth. Call nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, nor any man on earth, "your maſter;" for you have "a maſter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even Chriſt:" and he is the only one
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010580_0040_0F80D104F3AFC020"/>
you may unreſervedly ſubmit to. Above all, let your profiting under his miniſtry appear to all around you. Should he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no good effects of his labors among you, it would be an occaſion of "great heavineſs, and continual ſorrow in his heart;" but ſhould he be able to ſay, theſe and thoſe "I have begotten" to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life "through the goſpel;" theſe and thoſe, who were before born to God, are daily making progreſs in the life of grace, growing more and more up to "the fulneſs of the ſtature of men perfect in Chriſt," it would give him both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and vigor in doing the work, God is committing to his care. He would, in this caſe, need no commendation from you; you would appear in the world living evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his ſerviceableneſs as a good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the kingdom of God: And what is much more, you would be his "joy, and crown of rejoicing, in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his coming."</p>
            <p>"AND now brethren, we commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:010580_0041_0F80D10895ECD2D0"/>
AND may "the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that great ſhepherd of the ſheep, thro' the blood of the everlaſting covenant, make us all perfect in every good work to do his will; working in us that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory forever, and ever."</p>

In this Branch of your Duty, ſtudy to ſhew thyſelf approved unto God, and by Manifeſtation of the Truth to commend thyſelf to every Man's Conſcience, in the Sight of God, a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth; and giving to every one his proper Portion. In Doctrine, ſhew Uncorruptneſs, Gravity, Sincerity, ſound Speech that cannot be condemned. Shun not, through Fear of Man, to declare the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God; that you may be pure from the Blood of all Men.

            <head>THE Right Hand of Fellowſhip; By the Rev. Mr. APPLETON.</head>
            <p>THE grand Deſign of the GOSPEL MINISTRY ſhows it to be an high and honorable, as well as holy Calling. The Angels in Heaven eſteem it their Honour to be miniſtring Spirits; and rejoice when they are ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation. And yet, this ſacred precious Treaſure of the Goſpel we have in Earthen Veſſels, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of Man. To ſome of the ſinful Children of Men is this Grace given to preach the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND when God is pleaſed to confer this Favour upon any, by putting them into the Miniſtry; the Rules of Chriſtianity, as well as of Decency and Civility, teach us to congratulate them upon the Honour that Chriſt has done them: Publickly to own them as his Miniſters, and welcome them into
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010580_0049_0F80D111E4B195D0"/>
the Service of their Lord: And that ſuch who are in the Miniſtry before, ſhould take them into Fellowſhip with themſelves, and publickly receive them as their Brethren and Companions in the Kingdom and Service of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND the Behaviour of the Apoſtles towards one another was but agreable hereto: For when <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John perceived the Grace;</hi> that is the Grace of the <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> which was given to <hi>Paul.</hi> That is, when they perceived that he was called and commiſſioned to be an Apoſtle as much as they themſelves; they gave to <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Companion in the Miniſtry, <hi>the Right Hands of Fellowſhip,</hi> as a public Sign and Token hereof.</p>
            <p>AND altho' it is not pretended that this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Action of the Apoſtle amounts to the force of a <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> yet we look upon this apoſtolical Precedent as that which very well war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the Cuſtom of theſe Churches upon ſuch an Occaſion as this before us.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, in Conformity hereto let me ſay, that as the Apoſtles <hi>perceived; ſo Dear Sir,</hi> we <hi>perceive</hi> the Grace that is in you. We <hi>perceive</hi> the Favour of God in the intellectual Faculties, and mental Powers he has given you. We <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the Grace and Favour of God in beſtowing a liberal Education upon you; thereby training you up for the Service of the Sanctuary. We <hi>perceive</hi>

            <p>AND we can aſſure you further for your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, That he is a good Maſter whom we ſerve, and who has ſaid, <hi>Lo I am with you always;</hi> who knows our Work, our Labour and our Patience; and who will reward, us not altogether according to our Succeſs; but according to our Diligence and Fidelity. <hi>Our Work is with the Lord, and our Reward with our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE then we leave you to ſtand and labour in your Lot, till the End of the Days appointed for you: ſending up our Wiſhes and Prayers for you that the Hand of the Lord may be with you, to ſtrengthen your Hands and encourage your Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſucceed your Work.—And, Dear Brother, if you and we do but obtain Mercy of the Lord to be faithful unto Death, we ſhall meet and dwell, and ſhine together in the Kingdom of our Father forever. AMEN.</p>

I HAVE nothing further to add; but a ſhort Word to the <hi>Church and Chriſtian Society</hi> uſually meeting in this Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dearly Beloved in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE truſt that we ſincerely ſympathiſed with you the laſt Year, in the ſore and grievous Breach that God, in his holy and righteous Providence, made upon you, in the Death of your late worthy and beloved Paſtor. And we now congratulate you upon the Reſettlement of the Goſpel Miniſtry, and Ordinances among you. We ſee, that altho' Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are not ſuffered to continue by Reaſon of Death; yet <hi>the Redeemer,</hi> who is <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Head of the Church, liveth:</hi> with whom is the Reſidue of the Spirit. And he, who is the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, has found a Man to ſet over this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that he may go in before you, and go out before you, and lead you out and lead you in; that ye may no longer be as Sheep without a Shepherd. BEHOLD THE MAN, your <hi>Paſtor,</hi> your <hi>ſpiritual Guide</hi> and <hi>Leader!</hi> Receive him as we truſt and hope he is a precious Gift of our aſcended Saviour; and love and honour him as your Miniſter.—We beſeech you Brethren to know him who is called to labour among you, and who is ſet over you in the Lord to admoniſh you: and eſteem him very highly in Love for his Works Sake; and be at Peace among yourſelves: And the God of Love and Peace be with you all, AMEN.</p>
