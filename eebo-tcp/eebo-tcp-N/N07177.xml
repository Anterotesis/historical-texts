            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Mathematical Queſtion.</head>
            <p>AMONGST a variety of pleaſing cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, which, in the bloom of youth, attracted my attention, I found a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar taſte to <hi>mathematical ſtudies.</hi> I fancied myſelf qualified to anſwer hard queſtions, ſolve difficulties, and determine things abſtruſe; but, in the courſe of my purſuits, I was accoſted by an accompliſhed mathematician, who confounded all my ſkill, by propounding to me a queſtion, ſtated in the following order.</p>
            <p>There is a certain large country, formerly a kingdom, ſo rich and flouriſhing, that for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and dignity, it was the ſecond in the univerſe; an iſland, ſituate in the midſt of the temperate zone, and ſurrounded with the pacific ocean; free from all ſcorching heat, chilling cold, or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſtorms; no barren land, unhealthful wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or infectious air, were found therein; no prickling bramble, poiſonous herb, or unhwholſome fruit, grew therein; no ravenous bird, voracious beaſt, or venomous reptile, infeſted the land: it abounded with all the ſubſtantial bleſſings of life: and was embelliſhed with all the beauties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations of nature. There was no deficiency of any thing that might conduce to the felicity of the inhabitants, who enjoyed uninterrupted health and peace, liberty and plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:009151_0003_10310C0DB3089728"/>This delightful realm was ſubject to the grand Monarch of the world, who honoured it with many gracious viſits, conferred on it many royal favours, and granted the inhabitants all the privileges that were neceſſary to conſtitute them a free and happy people: and, to conſummate their glory, a king of their own nation; he dignified in the throne, and crowned with glory had honour, the eldeſt prince of the blood; a perſon endued with amplitude of all natural perfections, a noble genius, untainted virtue, and of perfect ſtature, without blemiſh; and gave him to wife a royal princeſs, a perfect virgin, of exquiſite beauty, accompliſhed with all the virtues, and amiable qualities, which adorn the female ſex.</p>
            <p>And for the ſafety of the ſtate, becauſe the coaſts were not inacceſſible, neither were the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations impregnable, and the prince was but young; therefore, the univerſal Sovereign recommended him, and all his ſubjects, to the ſuper-intendency of his <hi>grand Geometrician;</hi> by whoſe infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections the univerſal empire is juſtly proportioned, and all the affairs thereof accurately regulated; whoſe repreſentations are all the ſtated in the exacteſt manner; his deſcriptions appear in the moſt curious figures, and all his rules are models of perfection: his draughts are a compleat ſyſtem of rectitude and harmony, and his inſtructions are perfectly refined; so that he is a conſummate pattern of abſolute infallibility. No cauſe can miſcarry that is directed by his council, nor can any people ceaſe to be happy, ſo long as they yield ample ſubjection to his dictates. —This great maſter of ſcience was appointed guardian, regent, vicegerent, or governor of the whole realm, to preſide over, and inſpect all the affairs of the prince and the people: to him they were accountable for all their actions; and, to prevent any infraction or confuſion

in the land, every circumſtance was ſubject to his cognizance; and the tenure whereby all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants held their eſtates and enjoyments, was, conformity to his moſt excellent preſcriptions. Thus this beatific region was amply accommodated with every enjoyment that was neceſſary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate its felicity.</p>
            <p>But a foreigner, of the race of the giants, who, for their rebellion againſt the King of kings, were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the royal palace, into the unilluminable deſert, found means, in diſguiſe, to enter this ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious country; and, by falſe pretences, and feigned addreſs, obtained acceſs to the princeſs; until, by ſubtile arts, and deluſive flatteries, he prevailed againſt her chaſtity: ſo ſhe committed adultery with him, and conceived by him. And, while ſhe was advancing in her pregnancy, ſhe prevailed againſt the virtue of the prince, ſo that he polluted himſelf, by committing adultery with her. For, though ſhe was his wife, it was adultery for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his ſtation to have converſation with her, ſince ſhe was ſo baſely deflowered. And ſo it was, that he conceived by her, and they both became pregnant with the ſame thing, and brought forth a <hi>monſter.</hi> As ſoon as this monſter was born, the prince and princeſs fell from the throne, and had no more capacity to ſway the ſceptre, or maintain their dignity; for he poiſoned, with his firſt breath, the man and the woman who brought him forth: all their excellent qualities were corrupted, all their beauties deformed, and all their glory laid in the duſt. They died a lingering death, in exile, ſhame, and ſorrow; and their names have been had in execration throughout the world ever ſince.</p>
            <p>The form of this unnatural production was ſo horrible, as aſtoniſhed every eye that beheld him; his roaring ſo hideous, as made every ear tingle <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

every one ſick where the ſcent came; and he grew to ſuch an enormous ſize, that his ſhadow filled the whole land with darkneſs; and ſo invincible in his power, that no army upon earth was able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him; and he became ſo voracious, that he ſpread death and deſtruction wherever he came; ſwallowing up men and women alive, devouring every living creature, and making the whole land a deſolate wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding the horrors that appear in this monſter, the miſcheif done, and miſery intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him, which manifeſtly proves him to be an enemy to nature; yet, he is ſuch a maſter of enchantments, and has the deluſive art of diſguiſing himſelf, and infatuating the people, that he has drawn all the inhabitants of the land into a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with him, to break all the meaſures of the governor: and they accordingly have caſt off all allegiance to, and deſpiſed all the admonitions of, their faithful guardian, and are in open rebellion againſt him. They, like a diſtracted banditti, follow their mortal foe, and execute his curſed projects; while he is ſporting himſelf with their wretchedneſs; diſtreſſing them with all kinds of torture, and deſtroying them by all kinds of death. None eſcape him, of whatever condition, age, or ſex they be; he tyrannizes over all. And every creature, that is ſubjugated by him, muſt fall a prey to his rapacious fury, and is deſtined to ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable deſtruction.—And, if he be permitted thus to proceed, there will not be left alive a ſoul to breathe in the whole land.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, the deſign of the enſuing queſtion is, to diſcover, whether there be a poſſibility of any expedient being found, to ſtop the ravage of this horrible monſter, to prevent the direful effects of his tyranny, and ſave the country from total ruin.</p>

ſubject of ſerious attention; and thought to ſolve it, as a diverſion only: but, having pondered a while thereon, and finding ſome difficulties ariſe, I aſked him, whether he himſelf was the projector?</p>

            <p>I told him, I took it to be an enigmatical prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, propoſed to puzzle, or try the ſkill of the ingenious.</p>
            <p>But he gravely replied, that it was not fiction, but reality; that the matter was too ſerious to be made a <hi>droll of wit;</hi> and that a determinate ſolution was a concern of the utmoſt conſequence.</p>
            <p>I aſked him, whether it immediately concerned himſelf?</p>
            <p>He told me, he himſelf was the rightful gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the country, which this monſter had ſo long infeſted; and that all the damage done, was againſt his honour; to the injury of his government, and the deſtruction of subjects, under his juriſdiction.</p>

            <p>He told me, it was utterly out of his power to deſtroy him, to ſtop his progreſs, or prevent the effects of his fury; otherwiſe he would not have ſuffered him to proceed in his violence, to that outrageous degree as he had done: for, before this monſter was born, he took all proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to prevent any ſuch unnatural birth; and, as ſoon as he was brought forth, he purſued him with the utmoſt diligence, to ſeize and deſtroy him, but unſucceſsfully; and, ſince he grew ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he had ſtill continued to uſe all poſſible means, both offenſive and defenſive, to prevent his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive meaſures; but the utmoſt ſucceſs he had ever been able to obtain againſt this deadly enemy, was only, at ſome times, a little to retard his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009151_0008_10310C1C8AD4B480"/>
but never to withſtand his force; but, in ſpite of all his endeavours, the whole land was become a prey to this tyrant; not a creature had eſcaped, but what either followed him as a willing ſlave, groaned under thraldom to his mercileſs cruelty, or had already periſhed by his inſatiable voracity. And ſince it appeared utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the governor to ſave the life of one of his ſubjects, he was determined to vindicate his honour, and defend his right ſome other way; for which reaſon he preſented to me this queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a determinate anſwer.</p>
            <p>Upon this, I began to deliberate on the queſtion with more cloſe attention: but the more I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, the more difficult it appeared; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be convinced of my miſtake, in imagining it a meer <hi>puff of pedantry:</hi> for I found it truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate; not only far ſurpaſſing my capacity, but aſtoniſhing to my Mind whereupon, I offered to return it again to the governor, deſiring to be excuſed.</p>
            <p>But he told me, he could not accept any excuſe, for he was determined to have juſtice.</p>
            <p>I aſked him, how he could expect juſtice, where a tyrannical and invincible monſter reigned.</p>
            <p>But, with a fire in his countenance, which made my heart tremble, he replied, that altho' he had not power to withſtand the ravenous deſtroyer, he had power to deal with his own ſubjects, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him, in giving ſuccour to, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alliance with, ſuch an enemy; and inaſmuch as I was one, that did of right belong to his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but had been found in thoſe treaſonable practices, I might expect condign puniſhment, if I did not give a definitive anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
            <p>At this ſentence I began to be ſeized with an uncommon horror; for I was aware that I was converſing with a perſon, not of a common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009151_0009_10310C1FCA1D8210"/>
and tho' I could not form any juſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his meaning, yet my heart ſmote me, upon the remembrance of ſome paſt tranſactions; ſo that I was convinced, it was ſomething more than fiction; and I ſet myſelf to ponder the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters laid before me, with the utmoſt ſeriouſneſs: but, in ruminating on this deep queſtion, I found the more I attempted to find a ſolution, the more I was embarraſſed; the more expedients I tried to diſcover the myſtery, the more I began to deſpair of a poſſibility. My heart fainted, my fleſh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and my countenance was turned to paleneſs; I was filled with a multitude of ſtrange conjectures, all which turned to my confuſion, but none to my relief. The ſublimity, and tremedouſneſs of the ſubject, over-powered my mind, ſo that I was obliged (for while) to quit the ſtudy, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relax, and compoſe my mind as well as I could, but the impreſſion it had made upon me, prevented me from having much repoſe.</p>
            <p>In this diſtreſs, I began to reflect on my former vanity, in imagining myſelf able to number the ſand, to weigh the mountains, to ſound the depth of the ſeas, and to meaſure the heavens; to deſcribe the magnitudes, diſtances, and revolutions of the planets; and to ſolve the moſt abſtruſe problems, relating to terreſtrial operations, or celeſtial ſigns; which was (now) an extreme mortification. But the moſt piercing, was the levity and contempt with which I firſt looked on the queſtion before me; by which I found my underſtanding confounded, and my pride laid in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Bye and bye, I made another eſſay, to work out a ſolution, but finding myſelf at the greateſt non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, my mind began to be filled with reſentment, and I complained of the governor's ſeverity, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on my performing a taſk impracticable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009151_0010_10310C24A462A2E0"/>Then the governor turning upon me, with lightening in his his eyes, challenged me to prove my charge againſt him: telling me, that tyranny was not in his nature, but juſtice was his <hi>element;</hi> and he would convince me, that his demand was juſt and reaſonable; and, if I failed in the preformance, I had nothing to expect but death, by a moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and unalterable determination.</p>
            <p>Upon this I trembled and fell at his feet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the injuſtice of my complaint; intreating him to allow me time, promiſing the utmoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. I alſo earneſtly requeſted his aſſiſtance, for my better information into the nature of theſe things, hoping I ſhould be able to ſatisfy his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>But, concerning the time, he gave me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at all; concerning the ſtate of the queſtion, he told me, the two laſt branches could never be ſolved, unleſs the two firſt were duly underſtood; notwithſtanding, the ſolving of the former would not be of any benefit, unleſs the latter could be fully demonſtrated; that, as to the firſt two parts, he was perfectly acquainted with them, in every punctilio; nor was it poſſible for any thing relating thereto, to eſcape his cognizance. And according to the beſt rules of calculation, he had ſtated the whole account, in the moſt accurate order, in his <hi>book of records,</hi> and <hi>tables of proportion;</hi> which, for my better information, I was at fully liberty to peruſe. But as to the laſt two parts, (tho' it would be greatly to his honour and ſatisfaction, to have them ſolved) they were utterly beyond his line. He had never been able to penetrate into the leaſt, branch thereof, or to diſcover whether a ſolution was poſſible, or not; nor could he give me the leaſt aſſiſtance therein.</p>
            <p>This anſwer was ſo pathetic and circumſtantial, that, in deliberating thereon, it made my heart
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009151_0011_10310C27D38A3E38"/>
faint, my blood chill, and all my bones to ſhiver. Howbeit, I pretended great ſubmiſſion to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, (for tho' I loved him not, I dreaded his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and feignedly ſet myſelf upon a very diligent ſearch into all the rules he gave me; but I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with ſuch deſpairing thoughts, that I made very little proficiency; even in thoſe things which were ſtated in a very intelligible light.</p>
            <p>But a conceit came into my head, (which, for a while, yielded ſome relief to my imagination,) <hi>viz.</hi> that he was only a ſubordinate governor, with a limited power, and that his threatenings might exceed his authority, and that by appealing to ſuperior authority I might find redreſs, ſo as to eſcape his ſeverity, altho' I did not anſwer his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; whereupon, I began to make ſuch enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as theſe, concerning him: <hi>viz.</hi> Who is this governor? Whence did he receive his authority? How far doth his power extend? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I was anſwered, that he was the king's vice-gerent, once of his houſhold, and inſeparable from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; that he had full power of life and death, and from him there was <hi>no appeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the governor, with all the ſerenity of a judge, and with ſuch majeſty as ſeemed to ſpread death thro' all my powers, told me, I ſhould know his authority; then calling for his ſecretary, I felt a ſhock like that of an earthquake; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the door of a certain apartment was burſt open, from whence a certain perſon ſprang forth and made obeiſance to his highneſs, who familiarly received him. This perſon was my domeſtick companion, whom I had formerly treated with much inſolence, uſing him as a ſlave to bear my burdens: and when he proteſted againſt my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, I would not ſuffer him to ſpeak, but often attempted to ſtrangle him; and, at laſt, found means to confine him in a dark vault, having
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009151_0012_10310C295C112A58"/>
faſtened the door with bars of iron. It is not to be expreſſed, nor ſcarcely to be conceived, how ſurpriſing this ſhock was! But much more ſo, when I obſerved how his mien was altered, and perceived that he was the governor's ſecretary.—Then he bid him produce his accounts, and he laid open a train of accuſations againſt me, conceived in terms ſo ſtrong, and delivered in expreſſions ſo emphatical, that it was like ſo many arrows of fire piercing my heart. Likewiſe, the burden which I formerly obliged him to bear, he now fixed unmoveable upon me, which I found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable weight; I trembled under it, and was not able to ſtand, and to remove it I found impoſſible. — The governor alſo called his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, who took and bound me with chains, beat me with many ſtripes, and caſt me into a horrible dungeon: during theſe proceedings, I cried for mercy, but in vain; for the governor aſſured me, that as his authority did not admit of any appeal, ſo neither did his ſeverity admit of any <hi>mitigation:</hi> therefore, I was committed to the vigilant inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſecretary, and the unrelenting rigour of the executioner; confined in a dark priſon, bound in ſtrong chains, and cruſhed under the weight of an inſupportable burden, which did not admit me to move any way, to get a little eaſe. And if I made any complaint, the ſecretary, would ſilence me, by reminding me of my former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; upbraiding me in the moſt piercing manner, and galling me with ſuch grinding accuſations, as even to tear my heart to pieces: and then I was ſure to feel moſt dreadful laſhes from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, ſo ſtinging as none can deſcribe, but thoſe that have felt his ſtripes.</p>
            <p>In this deplorable condition I ſuſtained a variety of inexpreſſible tortures; ſometimes wrecked with anxious thoughts concerning the queſtion propoſed,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009151_0013_10310C2C8C87E6A8"/>
debating in my mind whether there was any hope, or poſſibility of finding an anſwer, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my liberty; ſometimes ſinking down in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, wearineſs, and deſpair; ſometimes ſwelling with rancour againſt the governor, and ſometimes reſtleſsly deſiring to abandon my mind to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, thereby to forget my wretchedneſs: but the moſt diſtracting thought, was an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the governor's return, to call me before him, concerning which I was in perpetual ſuſpence, as I could not obtain the leaſt hint of certainty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the time; nor had I any room to expect any further reſpite; but that the indictment exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited againſt me by the ſecretary being fully proved in open court, I ſhould receive the ſentence of the governor, be cut aſunder by the executioner, and my carcaſs caſt out to be devoured by the monſter; for that is the <hi>law of the country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe circumſtances I continued, till my ſpirit was exhauſted with anguiſh and diſtraction, and my heart was hardened through vexation and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: and I began to conceive hopes of obtaining relief by the aſſiſtance of the monſter, inaſmuch as the governor had not power to deſtroy him. And as I had formerly been ſtrongly attached to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and had never violated my allegiance to him, he was ready to give me all the aid in his power; but it was thought expedient to be done without noiſe; therefore he ſent me his apothecary with ſome mollifying ointments, hoping thereby to enable me to ſlip my chains. And by theſe I found ſome preſent eaſe, ſo that I began to fancy I ſhould outwit my keepers, and creep away; but, after all endeavours, I found my chains <hi>inextricable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus diſappointed, he ſent me a cunning pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, with ſome inſtruments very artfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, to looſe my chains; when I ſaw the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of theſe inventions, I thought the right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009151_0014_10310C316FE66F98"/>
was found imagining the device ſufficient to unravel the moſt intricate gordian knot; but, upon trial, I found my expectations diſappointed, for my chains were cemented <hi>beyond the reach of art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I began to be in deep deſpair, but my maſter encouraged me once more to try another ſtratagem; ſo he prepared me an anvil, and choſe ſome of his own ſervants (who appeared beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for ſuch an enterpriſe) to attend me in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, as often as poſſible, with files, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with hammers, or other inſtruments, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhould ſerve, hoping to wear off my chains in time: but all means were ineffectual, for my chains proved <hi>infrangible.</hi> Neither could this work be done ſo ſilently, as to eſcape the vigilant obſervation of the ſecretary, whoſe accuſations were like the ſtinging of an adder, and his rebukes like the biting of a ſerpent: and whenſoever I awaked his reſentment, he awaked the executioner, whoſe ſtrokes were like the torments of a ſcorpion.</p>
            <p>At laſt, finding all ſtratagems vain, and being quite tired out with pains and diſappointments, I began to grow deſperate; and the monſter, flaming with malice againſt the governor, hoping (by open force) to vanquiſh my keepers, break the priſon, and carry me away in triumph, reſolved to appear in perſon, with all his might; which he did, and approached in the moſt formidable manner, and proceeded to the attack with the utmoſt fury, and with great ſucceſs; for the caſt up ſuch banks that the ſecretary was buried under them, and made ſuch a terrible fire, that I imagined the foundations of the priſon gave way, and the ſmoak darkened the air, ſo that the executioner was obſcured from my ſight, and I thought he had been fled: I alſo fancied my chains had been broken, and was ready to ſhout for victory. But on a ſudden the governor
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009151_0015_10310C34E33127C0"/>
appeared with a glittering ſword in his hand, and with a voice like thunder, called the ſecretary, who ſtraight aroſe out of the rubbiſh, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner appearing cloſe by me, ſtruck me ſuch a blow, as made me lie like one dead, expecting inſtantaneous deſtruction: then the monſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing diſconcerted, marched off; but I remained in the moſt invincible fetters, under the moſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent torture, encompaſſed with the moſt amazing horrors.</p>
            <p>I now gave up all hope; all thoughts of finding an anſwer to the governor's queſtion ceaſed, and all expectation of deliverance vaniſhed; nothing but apprehenſions of inevitable ruin poſſeſſed my breaſt. But, after ſome time, my old maſter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed another expedient for my relief, by ſending his orator, in diſguiſe, as an ambaſſador, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or negotiate with the governor, for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. This orator interceded for me like an accompliſhed rhetorician, with all the alluring terms of ſophiſtry, with many ſpecious promiſes and propoſals to make, or comply with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that ſhould be required; and delivered himſelf with ſo much eloquence, good temper, and pompous appearance, as ſeemed to attract the attention of the ſecretary; and I fancied he began to look favourable upon me, which I took for an indication, that the governor inclined to accept of terms. I likewiſe imagined, that the executioner began to treat me with more gentleneſs, which I conceived muſt proceed from ſome milder orders from the governor. Thus I ſunk into a fond dream; for being brought ſo low by the fatigues I had ſuffered, a little relaxation eaſily compoſed me to ſleep: but upon my awaking, I heard the governor reply to the ambaſſador, that all propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals were vain; for juſtice was his province, and he ſhould for ever be found inexorable. But this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009151_0016_10310C367827EE48"/>
ambaſſador (with all elegance of ſtile, and ſoftneſs of addreſs) continuing to urge for further audience; the governor ſtepping to him, plucked off his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby his nakedneſs was diſcovered, and he appeared ſuch an ugly deformed creature, as fully betrayed him to be a limb of the monſter: when finding himſelf expoſed, he ſculked behind a thicket, like a dog that had done ſome miſchief.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſight I fainted away, being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the <hi>juſtice, penetration</hi> and <hi>inflexibility</hi> of the governor; knowing, that to eſcape from him is impracticable, and to anſwer his demand is, to me, impoſſible; and unleſs ſome deliverer, or deliverance, ſhould appear, which to me is yet unknown, I have no reſource left, but am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably bound over to deſtruction; inextricable bondage, exquiſite pains, and inſupportable terrors, are now my fixed portion, where I lie <hi>comfortleſs, friendleſs, helpleſs,</hi> and <hi>hopeleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my confinement was more ſevere than ever; I was deprived of all liberty or power to act or move, only to gnaſh my teeth, gnaw my tongue, and torture my own mind: I ſaw nothing but darkneſs and diſmal ſpectres; I heard nothing but roarings, thunders, and doleful groans; I felt nothing but chains, bars, ſickneſs, and pain; I ſmelled nothing but ſtench and nauſeouſneſs; I taſted nothing but gall and wormwood: in this condition, without relaxation, I languiſhed many days, perpetually expecting my final execution. At laſt I was alarmed with ſomething, which I apprehended like muſick, at a great diſtance, which attracted my attention, and awaked ſome ſenſation of pleaſure; though I could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſound diſtinctly; but as I liſtened to hear it, it ſeemed to draw nearer, and I plainly perceived it was the ſound of a trumpet. The meaning of it I could not conceive, but I found
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009151_0017_10310C39AEB32B70"/>
the nearer it approached, the more my paſſion was excited into an ardent deſire to know whence it came, and what it might portend. While my ſoul was thus alert in attending, the found conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued advancing, and raiſing ſome faint joy in my heart, rather from the ſweetneſs of the melody, than any reaſon I could render for my taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; until it approached ſo near, that I heard three blaſts diſtinctly ſounded, and in the ſounds I heard theſe words pronounced, GOOD-WILL, PEACE, PARDON: theſe words ſeemed to give ſome reviving to my ſoul, I lifted up myſelf to hearken if any thing further would be expreſſed; when the trumpet ſeeming ſtill nearer, I heard three blaſts more, pronouncing theſe words, LOVE, WISDOM, POWER. Upon this I found a ſweetneſs of joy ſeize my heart, though I underſtood not the meaning, but ſtill gladly attended to hear the ſound repeated: bye-and-bye I heard the trumpet exceeding loud, as it were, juſt before the priſon-gate, ſounding three alarms expreſſing theſe words, REDEMPTION, RECONCILIATION, SALVATION.</p>
            <p>Theſe words came with ſo much power, that they ſpread new life through all my faculties; I felt the foundation of the priſon ſhake, and a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (which before was cloſe ſhut up) burſt open, whereby light ſhined into the priſon; for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſtrong wind joined with the voice, which made way wherever it touched, though I knew not whence it came, nor whither it went; but by this means I enjoyed ſome light, and found opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to look about, to ſee whence the joyful ſound proceeded; and ſeeing a man ſtanding before the gate, with a banner diſplayed in one hand, and a trumpet in the other; I aſked him who he was, and what his deſign?</p>
            <p>He told me, he was the king's meſſenger, ſent to proclaim good tidings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009151_0018_10310C4042802EB8"/>I aſked, What king?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, King SHILOH,</p>
            <p>I did not know any king of that name; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſired to be informed who he was, of what line or family, in what realm was his dominion.</p>
            <p>He told me, that he was the only ſon of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſovereign; a prince of ſuch excellent dignity and merit, that he was made lord-chancellor in his father's court, and intruſted with the direction of all the affairs of the empire; and his mother being a native of that (once happy, though now mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable) country, he had a natural indubitable right to the ſovereignty of the realm; which, ſince the other prince had loſt, and the governor was not able to recover, his father had appointed him, to take into <hi>his own hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I enquired what good news he brought?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, healing to the broken hearted, liberty to the captives, opening of the priſon to thoſe that are bound, relief to them that are ready to periſh, comfort to all that mourn, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the joyful year.</p>
            <p>The balſamick influence which theſe words had upon my ſoul none can know, but ſuch as have been in the like condition, and favoured with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the like kind!</p>
            <p>I aſked him, if he had authority to perform ſuch great things?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, that he was the king's herald ſent to publiſh the glad tidings of his good pleaſure, in thoſe places where his majeſty deſigned himſelf to come, in whoſe hand alone the power was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>I aſked, if the king was come that way?</p>
            <p>He told me, it was the king's delightful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, to viſit the moſt deſolate places, to ſeek out ſuch as were in diſtreſs, and to deliver them; and for that purpoſe had ſent his royal proclamation,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009151_0019_10310C41CB4D18D0"/>
that every poor wretched priſoner that ſhould hear the news, and wait for his ſalvation, might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all bondage or miſery whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Then I aſked, if the king did not inſiſt on ſome conditions, to be performed by the perſons to whom he would grant ſuch favours? for I knew it was not in my power to do any thing, but muſt periſh.</p>
            <p>But the meſſenger told me, the redemption was <hi>free</hi> to ſuch as have no power, wiſdom, riches, or any thing to recommend them; it being beneath the honour of his majeſty to make terms with poor miſerable ſlaves, but to deliver them freely, of his own royal beneficence.</p>
            <p>I further enquired, if his royal bounty was not confined to ſome particular favourites, ſo as that many may wait for it and not be diſappointed?</p>
            <p>He replied, that ſuch bleſſings as the king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed might well be eſteemed <hi>peculiar favours;</hi> but that none was ever rejected who gladly accepted his bounty: and if there were any who were not favoured with it, they were ſuch (only) as did not ſeek it. But that it was reaſonable to ſuppoſe, his majeſty's wiſdom would beſtow his favours where they would be received with gratitude, and upon ſuch perſons whoſe circumſtances rendered the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit neceſſary and acceptable; as gifts, not to the rich, but to the poor; deliverance, not to perſons at liberty, but to thoſe that were bound; healing, not to the whole, but the ſick; proviſions, not to the full, but to the hungry; and there was no other reſtriction in the king's bounty. That is, though it is not given to ſuch as never ſaw their need, and conſequently do not deſire, but deſpiſe it; it is richly extended to every one, who (through his majeſty's goodneſs) is made willing to wait for, and thankfully receive, ſuch bounty; ſo that none ever was denied, who earneſtly deſired the bleſſing.</p>
            <p>—Therefore, as no perſon ever had reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009151_0020_10310C43A0609EB8"/>
of <hi>injuſtice</hi> in the governor; neither had any perſon the leaſt reaſon to complain of the <hi>want of generoſity</hi> in the king.</p>
            <p>I gave audience to this word with all my exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and internal powers; and as I found the words, I eat them; for they were as cold water to a thirſty ſoul: but when I heard mention made of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, I made a pauſe, and aſked him, if there was any intimacy between the governor and the king his maſter?</p>
            <p>He told me, there was an inviolable friendſhip between them inaſmuch as that the one never did any thing in oppoſition to the other. But the king ratified all the acts of the governor, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor approved all the edicts of the king.</p>
            <p>I replied, how then can the king ſet any one at liberty from his bondage?</p>
            <p>The herald anſwered tho' the king is an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible warrior againſt his enemies, he never uſes hoſtilities againſt the governor of this country; but all things are done by means ſo amicable, as to iſſue in their mutual honour and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>I then enquired whether the king had ſo much influence, or intereſt in the governor, to bring his inexorable diſpoſition to become flexible? or had the governor a right to reſign his commiſſion into his majeſty's hand during his ſtay.</p>
            <p>He replied, that the governor's authority was <hi>perpetual;</hi> nor would the king ever offer him ſuch an indignity as to recall his commiſſion for a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> neither would he ever attempt to obtain the leaſt mitigation of juſtice from his hand, which would be a diſhonour to the king himſelf, ſince all the rules and decrees of the governor are according to the king's own heart; and whatſoever is done by either of them, is for the reciprocal honour of them both.</p>
            <p>I aſked him, how this could be, and yet that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009151_0021_10310C4529DE1420"/>
the king ſhould deliver a condemned wretch out of ſuch a deplorable condition as mine was?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, by making ample ſatisfaction to all, and every individual, of the governor's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; ſo as that the governor himſelf ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, and honourably diſcharge, the criminal from all his offences, and fully cancel every indictment exhibited againſt him, and at the ſame time ſecure his own prerogitive, his honour, and his juſtice, <hi>inviolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this declaration I apprehended ſuch a beauty, that it was like the moſt ſalutary cordial to me; and I began to enquire when the king would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, that the preciſe time was in his majeſty's own breaſt; but that he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my condition, and never made any delay in time of neceſſity, or ever ſuffered any one to periſh that waited for his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I told him my caſe was ſo deſperate, that if I had not ſpeedy relief, I could not live.</p>
            <p>He encouraged me not to fear, but wait for the arrival of his majeſty, who perhaps, might be nearer than I conceived; and, probably, I might obſerve ſomething to my conſolation, if I pleaſed to take a deliberate view through a perſpective, which he preſented to me.</p>
            <p>With eager joy, and intenſe application, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to look, according to his direction. I found the teleſcope exceeding clear, and curiouſly fixed; and though it was too extenſive for my hand to guide, it was directed to my eye with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing exactneſs, by an inviſible hand, (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was matter of much contemplation and admiration, though at the time it almoſt eſcaped my obſervation through the amazing proſpect which ſaluted my eyes, and the delightful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment I found therein;) and, upon a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009151_0022_10310C4D63652840"/>
mountain I ſaw a perſon of a moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded appearance and exquiſite beauty: ſuch a ſight my eyes never beheld before; nor is it poſſible for any to deſcribe it, except ſuch as can ſpeak with <hi>new tongues;</hi> and ſuch a tranſport of joy was raiſed in my ſoul as I never felt before; nor is it poſſible for any to feel the ſame, but thoſe that have ſeen the ſame ſight! and ſuch a flame of love aroſe in my breaſt towards the perſon, as I had never felt; nor can any ſoul feel the ſame love, unleſs it be to the ſame <hi>object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I had beheld this ſight, and feaſted my eyes and all my paſſions, with the effulgent glories and ineſtable beauties of this ſhining one, and had conſidered the amity between the governor and this glorious prince, all my old enmity againſt the governor vaniſhed away: for as the flame of love kindled more and more in my heart towards the king of glory, it alſo produced ſincere regard, and high veneration towards the governor. I thought of him with delight, and fully convinced, that all was equal juſt, and good, that he had done to me; yea, I was ſatisfied, that if was to die by his hand I muſt juſtify him and love him; for I could not <hi>deſire</hi> to live at the <hi>expence of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I laid before the meſſenger all my caſe, how I had been embarraſſed with that intricate four-fold queſtion, and the miſery which had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; increating the beſt advice in my preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
            <p>To which he replied, that as to the two laſt parts of the problem, none in heaven or earth could touch upon them, ſave that king of glory. But reſpecting the first parts, the governor had rules to illuſtrate them, which I might have had opportunity to have ſeen already; though none were able to form ſuch juſt conceptions of thoſe rules, or underſtand them in a ſuch a perſpicuous
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009151_0023_10310C4F3AAEA8C8"/>
light, as thoſe who had their intellectuals enlarged, through acquaintance with the glorious prince.</p>
            <p>I told him I had ſeen thoſe rules, and wearied myſelf with poring on them, but could make very little of them, only what quite puzzled my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>He told me, that it was my <hi>enmity to the governor</hi> that prevented ſucceſs in my ſearches; but that he could appeal to myſelf if I did not find much pride, enmity, murmuring, and reluctance, and that I wanted a good-will in my enquities.</p>
            <p>I confeſſed, what he ſaid was true, but that I now found a real <hi>change in my diſpoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He told me, that ſince I found my mind well affected to the governor, the ſtudy of his records would become pleaſant; and that while I waited for the king's approach, it would be neceſſary for me to inform myſelf the beſt I could, in thoſe things wherein I had opportunity to be inſtructed; for the more I was acquainted with thoſe two firſt branches, the better I might underſtand, and with more pleaſure take in, the ſolution of the other parts, whenſoever it ſhould be the king's pleaſure to favour me with it.</p>
            <p>I was fully perſuaded of the ſeaſonableneſs of this advice, and I ſet myſelf (in earneſt) to examine the rules given me by the governor; and when I began to attend to it with affection, approbation, and chearfulneſs, I found the paradoxes open, with an <hi>intelligible conſistency,</hi> through the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>But when I entered into a cloſe peruſal of theſe records, and began to form juſt conceptions of the things therein contained, to view them in a true light, and deliberate thereon with underſtanding; I found it not only the deepeſt ſtudy, but attended with the moſt <hi>awful conſiderations,</hi> that ever my thoughts had been employed in. All the anguiſh and terror which had diſtreſſed me heretofore, did
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009151_0024_10310C50CAA94B38"/>
ſcarce bear any compariſon with the tremendous aſpect now before me; the hideouſneſs of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter! the devaſtation made by him! the majeſty and juſtice of the governor! and the inexpreſſible miſery of my own condition! appeared ſo amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as no heart can conceive, ſave thoſe who have had a diſtinct view of theſe things: and had it not been for the comfort I had received from the king's meſſenger, the light which was opened into my dark ſituation, and the proſpect I had of the king's perſon, it had been impoſſible for me to have ſurvived, without falling into diſtraction or deſperation.—And frequently, when my very ſoul was overwhelmed with deep enquiries and ſhocking diſcoveries, I ſhould be rouſed up by the melodious ſound of the trumpet, which would tranſport my mind, and relieve my weary ſpirits: for the herald continued often to paſs that way, with whom I had frequent conferences concerning the king, his perſon, grace, glory and expected approach. And ſometimes I had the proſpect of his beauties and excellencies repeated to me, which afforded comfortable meditations in my weary hours. Thus I was refreſhed and ſupported, while ſearching into the profound <hi>rules of juſtice,</hi> and dark <hi>abyſs of miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I found the queſtions and ſolutions ſtated with the utmoſt accuracy and coherence, but ſo deep and extenſive, that all my powers were abſorbed in the diſcoveries; for my faculties had never been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded to a capacity for receiving things ſo <hi>ſublime.</hi> And I was convinced, that the moſt profound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems I had ever exerciſed myſelf upon were mere childiſh toys, in compariſon of this: yet, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent application I arrived at a conſiderable degree of diſtinct underſtanding, both in the deſcription of the monſter, and the effects of his outrages: but a perfect knowledge I could not obtain; for I
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009151_0025_10310C525672A888"/>
continually found, the more diſcoveries I made, the more <hi>profound</hi> and <hi>unſearchable</hi> the myſtery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>In this condition I continued for a ſeaſon, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſe engaged in this neceſſary ſtudy, and ſometimes ſeized with fear, and cruſhed down with dark apprehenſions: for tho' I had received much comfort. I was ſtill in bondages, and I began to think the time very long, inſomuch, that I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ready to give up all hope. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

And as the ſound grew more clear, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſtill more diſtinct and glorious, I judged the king was making ſome nearer advances; ſo that my joy would be unſpeakable, until ſome duſky cloud would overſpread my mind, and caſt a gloom upon all my conceptions; or, ſome freſh diſcovery of the monſter's horrible aſpects, would ariſe before me; which would chill my very heart, and ſtrike a piercing ſhock through all my powers Thus my ſoul would be filled with fears, doubts, and queſtionings; but when I could enjoy a freſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the king's beauty, grace, and near approach, all my fears would vaniſh away.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009151_0026_10310C5A860BCE48"/>The reaſon of theſe waverings and heſitations, I conceive to proceed, both from the weakneſs of my judgment, and the inſtability, or imbecility of my inward powers.—As to the former, the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I had of the king, and his deſigns, carried ſuch demonſtration of love, mercy, faithfulneſs, and ſufficiency, that there was not the leaſt to diſtruſt the accompliſhment of all that the herald declared; but the darkneſs, and contractedneſs of my underſtanding, prevented me from forming clear and diſtinct conceptions, or digeſting thoſe things in due order. —As to the latter, my mind was ſo weak, that when I was favoured with thoſe manifeſtations, I found myſelf filled with ſuch exſtatick joy, that at theſe ſeaſons, I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of a deluſion: therefore, I did not employ my underſtanding, (as I ought to have done) in ſcrutinizing into the nature of what I heard and ſaw; whereby, I might have been better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; but taking all for undeniable fact, (nor apprehending any need of cloſe enquiry, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reality, or fictitiouſneſs thereof) while I found myſelf in the enjoyment; I ſhould find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite at a loſs at other times, when thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments were withdrawn: and ſome horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance preſented itſelf; and I was fainting with wearineſs and impatience; I was not able to form any juſt conceptions, nor make any proper reflections upon thoſe things which had formerly given me comfort, but were not preſent before my eyes. For then I ſhould be filled with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoughts, of the poſſibility, and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a deception; and of the miſerable miſtakes which many have fallen into, by taking fancies for realities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſhould fall into doubts and queſtionings, concerning the propriety, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of the things which I had ſeen and heard; as, whether the bleſſing I had hoped for, were only
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009151_0027_10310C5C10845138"/>
for others, and not for me; whether the good news brought by the herald, were to be confided in; whether my miſerable ſtate and earneſt deſire of deliverance, had not induced me to impoſe upon myſelf, by conſtruing things in my own favour, contrary to their natural intentions; whether the real favours which I did enjoy, ever ſince the light was opened into my apartment, were granted by the king's order, as a preparative to my full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, or only a relaxaction granted by the goaler, before my final ſentence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And amidſt theſe mutual debates, all my faculties would be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped, that I could not come to any fixed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, nor reaſon concluſively upon any thing, relating to my preſent circumſtances; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my ſpirits would be ſo far exhauſted, that I was ready to doubt, whether all that I had ſeen and heard, from whence I had conceived hope or comfort, was any more than a fond dream.—Thus for want of clearneſs in judgment, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in mind, I ſhould be in the greateſt ſuſpence, even, after receiving the fulleſt demonſtrations, and after enjoying the richeſt conſolations.</p>
            <p>But, in all my doubts and waverings, I never wavered in this one thing, that if ever I muſt find relief, it muſt be by the <hi>king alone;</hi> and that there was no poſſibility of help in any other. Therefore, whether my hope was ſtronger or weaker, or my comfort more or leſs, it was only according to the encouragement I received, or the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I formed to myſelf, concerning his majeſty's ſufficiency, good-will, near approach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For I neither expected, ſought, nor deſired deliverance from any other. Yea, I found ſuch a flame of love, and ſoul ſo powerfully drawn towards him, that I ſhould ſooner have choſe to periſh at his feet, than that any other ſhould claim the glory of my deliverance; and in my moſt joyful hours,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009151_0028_10310C5DDA7AD2E8"/>
the height of my ambition, was to wait on his majeſty all the days of my life; for I thought, if I was at full liberty, and muſt not enjoy the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to attend on the king, it would be as great a diſtreſs to me, as any thing I ever underwent, for he had truly conquered my heart with his love; and if I did not enjoy comfort and ſatisfaction in him, I enjoyed it no where at all: for though my ſpirits would ſometimes grow flat, and exceeding low, thro' drowſineſs, wearineſs, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whenſoever I received any freſh conſolation, it was from him alone: and whenſoever I enjoyed any good degree of vivacity, I ſtill found my mind intenſely fixed upon the glorious prince, waiting for the happy hour of his arrival, to ſee his beauty, and enjoy his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>At laſt the trumpet ſounded exceeding loud and diſtinct, as it had been talking to the intellectual powers of my ſoul; and light ſhined around me exceeding clear; as it had been the beams of the ſun in the meredian altitude; my ſoul became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding alert, all my faculties were expanded, and all my paſſions took fire! and I ſaw the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf approaching the priſon-gate.—The appearance was ſuperlatively glorious, that I melted away, and there remained no ſpirit in me: I was not able to ſuſtain ſuch a conjunction of joy and glory, and I fell at his feet as dead. But he laid his right-hand upon me, and ſaid, <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt.—I have the key of</hi> David, <hi>I open and no man ſhutteth, I ſhut and no man openeth.—I ſay to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, go forth; to them that are in darkneſs, ſhew yourſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I was ſtrengthened and aroſe and ſtood upon my feet, but I was not able to behold his glory; for his beauty, and the majeſty of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance were ſo overcoming, that I was obliged to turn away my eyes.—But there was a perſon along
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009151_0029_10310C5F636CD518"/>
with him, (whom for quality, was equal with his majeſty, but not clothed in the ſame garments,) whoſe office is, to attend the king in all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; to atteſt and ſeal all his edicts, to diſpenſe all his royal bounties, to illuſtrate the glory of his majeſty, and his kingdom, and to interpret all myſteries belonging to the ſtate; whoſe dignity and authority, I cannot find words to expreſs: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the counſels of the court, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſubject, and all tranſactions in the ſtate, came under his recognizance; I ſhall call him the <hi>king's ſecretary.</hi> This is the perſon who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the king's trumpet to my diſmal cell, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my eyes to take a proſpect of his majeſty; with many other kind offices, which I have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with, tho' I know not whence they came. He now anointed my eyes and my ears, and gave me a ſtrengthening cordial; whereby my eyes were enabled to <hi>behold the king in his beauty,</hi> my ears to hear tremendous voices, and my heart to meditate terror. And, I lift up my face and looked ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon the king.</p>
            <p>Then the king aſked, what was my requeſt?</p>
            <p>I anſwered, that it might pleaſe his majeſty, to conſider my condition, and deliver me from my bondage.</p>
            <p>He aſked me, whether I underſtood my own condition?</p>
            <p>Then I laid before him my diſtreſs, as far as I was capable of deſcribing it, and told him I had no expectation from any, but himſelf; being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that I muſt either be ſaved by his goodneſs, or inevitably periſh. And, therefore, I earneſtly implored his compaſſion, in caſe he did not find my condition too hopeleſs to admit of relief; but, if that ſhould be the caſe, I was willing to die at his feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:009151_0030_10310C679670A4E8"/>To which he replied, <hi>Is there any thing too hard for me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this word I took courage, drew near, and took hold of his girdle; and falling down at his feet, beſought him, to get himſelf honour in my deliverance.</p>
            <p>Then he aſked me, which way I expected to be ſet at liberty?</p>
            <p>I told him, I was very ſenſible of the juſtice of my confinement, and the direful ſentence paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and did not deſire liberty upon any other terms, but what might be to the honour of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and of his majeſty; but that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his own meſſenger, that he undertook to ſatisfy all the demands of the governor, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſuch helpleſs wretches as I was.</p>
            <p>He aſked, what were thoſe demands, which his excellency the governor made upon me?</p>
            <p>Upon this, I produced all the accounts which I had gathered from the tables and records laid before me.</p>
            <p>Then the king's herald told me, my calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were very juſt in many particulars, but in many things deficient. That it was well for me to have a competent underſtanding in thoſe things, that I might know the neceſſity, the nature, and the greatneſs of the king'ſalvation; but, that it was not ſufficient, that his majeſty ſhould anſwer the queſtion according to my accompts; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the governor's perfect deſcription, which was already compleatly done betwixt the king and the governor, and therefore the king had a right to demand my liberty when he pleaſed. And that as I had been embarraſſed with thoſe hard queſtions, and had borne the diſtreſs of ſeeing my own cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; it was his majeſty's will, that I ſhould enjoy the pleaſure of beholding the whole tranſaction, wherein all things had been adjuſted between the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009151_0031_10310C6968B36F00"/>
king and the governor; and that I might peruſe all his majeſty's ſolutions to my full contentment, and ample ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>I heard theſe words with earneſt attention, and drank them in with eagerneſs; and being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by what the king's ſecretary had done to me, I was able to underſtand in a diſtinct light, and ruminate upon what was ſpoken with ſuch ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind, as I never felt before; and it was attended with ſuch attactive power, as if my very ſoul had gone out of myſelf, into the boſom of the king; or, as if I had ceaſed to be, and I had found myſelf become a member of his body; or, as if my life had expired, and I had been inſpired with new life from his breath. Therefore, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquired, if there were any hopes that I might enjoy ſuch a bleſſing, when ſet at liberty, as to dwell in his dominion, or become one of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; for to be wholly denied in this, I thought would be a grief equal to my preſent confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>He told me, all that the king redeemed were his own property, and he would take care to have them duly qualified for, and ſecurely fixed in the ſtation for which he deſigned them; which was to attend his perſon and continue his domeſticks for ever.</p>
            <p>This declaration was adequate to my ultimate wiſhes and ſpread tranquility thro' my faculties; and I found my ſoul filled with such compoſure, ſatisfaction, and delight in the king, as if every thing in the univerſe had been dead but himſelf; or as if every excellency in the creation had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and all their glories centered in him alone. Then I had ſuch a view of the beauties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his majeſty, as my eyes had never ſeen; for tho' the former diſcoveries were tranſcendently ſtriking and glorious, ſo as to raiſe the higheſt rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009151_0032_10310C6AF3608AC8"/>
in my ſoul, yet I was too weak to view his glory in a diſtinct light; but now I had ſtrength to make deliberate obſervations, and form juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of what my eyes beheld; but the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſon, the light of his countenance, the luſtre of his garments, the ſplendor of his throne, the glory of his crown, the rectitude of his ſceptre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſuch, as nothing but the new ſtrength I had received could have enabled me to behold; nor ſhall I ever be able fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them.</p>
            <p>After my eyes were feaſted, and my ſoul ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with this incomparable viſion, the king took a key in his hand, which the herald very amply deſcribed to me; and the ſecretary directed my eyes to behold the curious make of it, that I might underſtand the form and powers thereof. And with this key he opened every lock belonging to the priſon, and to my chains; and did it in ſuch an open, deliberate manner, as gave me opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to obſerve by what power he removed every bar, diſengaged every ward, and turned every ſpring. Thus I was brought out of priſon, ſet at full liberty, and found myſelf made free indeed. I now rejoiced with joy unſpeakable and full of glory to ſee my long expected deliverance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate in ſuch a perfect, undeniable manner: I can ſcarcely ſay, whether I was more delighted with my ever memorable, and unſpeakably happy <hi>deliverance,</hi> or with the myſterious excellency of his majeſty's <hi>performance.</hi> But I confeſs, that till this time, I had never ſo clearly underſtood, as now I did, how inexplicable the depth and nature of my miſery, and how abſolutely inextricable my bondage were, to any but him that underſtood all myſteries, and poſſeſſed invicible power; for an operation ſo <hi>maſterly</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> I had never ſeen before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009151_0033_10310C716F0C53A8"/>Then the herald informed me, it was the king's pleaſure that I ſhould have a ſatisfactory demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how compleat and honourable my deliverance was; and therefore, I ſhould be admitted to take a deliberate view of the tranſactions relative to my acquittance, and the <hi>deciſive ſtroke</hi> whereby all the demands of the governor were undeniably ſatisfied by the king's majeſty: whereupon he led me to a ſpacious plain where I ſaw the governor walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a garment <hi>white as ſnow,</hi> and his ſecretary familiarly walking by his ſide; and when he came to a certain place, he put upon his white raiment a veſture of <hi>flaming ſcarlet,</hi> and called his executioner, who immediately came with a glittering ſword in his hand. Thus he ſtood with a countenance full of terrible majeſty, having his ſecretary on his right-hand, and his executioner on his left; and immediately I ſaw the king upon the diſtant mountains riding in a glorious chariot, <hi>ſwift as lightning;</hi> and when he came near, he alighted and made very low obeiſance to the governor, but the governor did not move, or made any obeiſance to the king. Then the king placed himſelf over againſt the governor, having his ſecretary on his right-hand, and his herald on his left; and here I had an opportunity to behold the majeſty of <hi>two courts,</hi> diſpoſed in the moſt regular order. So awful was the appearance! ſo grave the mien! it ſpread ſilence and had ſerenity through the whole plan; there was neither voice nor motion to be heard or ſeen, till the court was opened; nor during, the whole proceſs did the wind blow, or a leaf ſhake; but all the elements appeared in a <hi>total ſtagnation.</hi> So I ſaw, and heard the whole <hi>procedure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The governor firſt ſounded a trumpet exceeding loud, which made the earth tremble; then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his great authority, the extenſiveneſs of his commiſſion, and the juſtice of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009151_0034_10310C72F7E38690"/>
which the king acknowledged by a very low bow, and all the king's court made their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignals of reſpect; and audience was given while he diſtinctly opened the two firſt branches of the queſtion, and gave a very accurate deſcription of the monſter in all his unbounded enormities; and an ample definition of the miſchief done, and damage ſuſtained, by him; with a juſt repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heinous and aggravated crimes of thoſe who had entered into alliance with ſuch an enemy. When he ſpake of theſe things, his voice was like thunder, his breath was flames of fire, and a cloud of ſmoke darkened the air round about him; from his breath, the executioner's ſword took fire, and burnt with a vehement flame; and when he had ended every paragraph, his ſecretary atteſted the truth thereof, and ſigned it with a <hi>pen of braſs;</hi> then his executioner brandiſhed his flaming ſword over the whole plain.—And all the king's court kept ſilence, and gave audience, till the governor had finiſhed all his declarations.—And when he had made an end, having demonſtrated every thing in a diſtinct and obvious light, he again ſounded a trumpet, and made proclamation; <q>That if any one had any objection againſt the light in which theſe things were repreſented; or any reaſon to render, why vengeance ſhould not be taken on all thoſe rebellious ſubjects, who had committed treaſon againſt their rightful governor, and joined with the deſtroyer of their country, <hi>Let him draw near.</hi>
               </q>—But no anſwer was made.—Then he commanded his executioner to go forth and ſlay, without mercy or diſtinction, every creature that was found in rebellion, or had deſerted his allegiance to his ſerene highneſs.—Then the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner rendezvouſed a formidable hoſt, mounted a pale horſe, lifted up a black flag, and began his march, with all the enſigns and terrors of death;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009151_0035_10310C74C85DB940"/>
and his fiery ſword ſhot darts of lightning <hi>through all the land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, the king's herald ſounded his trumpet ſo loud, that it not only made the earth ſhake, but the heavens alſo, and proclaimed his majeſty <hi>umpire.</hi> And there was profound ſilence.</p>
            <p>Then his majeſty ſpake, with a ſerene voice, to the governor, and bid him ſtay his hand; for he had undertaken to ſave thoſe offenders, and they ſhould be ſaved; and on them no vengeance ſhould be taken.</p>
            <p>The governor replied, that vengeance againſt rebels was <hi>inevitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The king told him, he was not come to offer violence to his honour, nor intrench upon his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, neither to intreat any favour, nor yet to abett, or excuſe offences; but to be the repreſentative of thoſe miſerable offenders; having engaged in their behalf, and made their caſe his own, he would ſtand in <hi>their place;</hi> therefore, whatſoever his highneſs found againſt them, lay it to his charge, impute all their tranſgreſſions to him, and deal with him as the <hi>very criminal;</hi> ſpare him not, but let all the deſerved vengeance fall <hi>upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This declaration of his majeſty, ſtruck a total ſilence, and ſtagnation, through all the plain; there was neither voice nor motion; the heaven and the earth ſtood in aſtoniſhment, and amazement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in every countenance, for about an hour; during which period, the two potentates ſtood unmoveable, having their eyes fixed upon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, without the leaſt change of countenance in either.</p>
            <p>Then the governor made a ſignal to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner to bend all his force againſt the <hi>king's perſon,</hi> which he accordingly did; whereupon all the king's guards, and attendants, opened to the right and left, leaving his majeſty expoſed; and the executioner
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009151_0036_10310C77F777B118"/>
marched againſt him, with ſuch tremendous fury, as I never beheld before, nor was ever the like ſeen under heaven. The ſun cloſed his eyes, the world ſhook, the rocks burſt aſunder, and the whole frame of nature was diſtorted; and he came upon his majeſty like a torrent, and (without ceremony, or reſiſtance) pierced him <hi>through the heart,</hi> with his <hi>flaming ſword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the moſt awful ſight that my eyes ever ſaw; nor did I ever hear of any that had ſeen the like. The blood guſhed out; his countenance turned to paleneſs; all his powers trembled; he fainted away, and reſigned his life.—Thus fell the prince of perfect glory and merit; and the moſt valuable of all lives was taken away?</p>
            <p>But what tongue can declare? What pen can deſcribe? What heart can conceive? the effects of this ſtupendous ſtroke! the world was in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the heavens ſtood amazed; celeſtial angels came down to behold the wonder; infernal angels felt the tremor, thro' all the coaſts of hell; living men trembled, and became as dead; and dead men came out of their graves to ſee what was done! None can expreſs the love, compaſſion, humility, patience, juſtice, goodneſs, veracity, fortitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which this meritorious prince manifeſted in this action! Nor can all the annals of time furniſh us with an inſtance, worthy to be named in compariſon with this!</p>
            <p>By this ſurprizing ſight my ſoul was abſorbed, all my mental powers were exhauſted, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no more ſpirit in me; I was fainting away; but the king's ſecretary ſustained me; and, directing my eyes to behold this dreadful <hi>cataſtrophe,</hi> he gave me a diſtinct view of the moſt ſurpaſſing glorious and indelible trophy, ariſing from thence.</p>
            <p>The blood that iſſued from the prince's wound, quenched the flame of the ſword; and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009151_0037_10310C7B45C4EDC0"/>
(without any violence offered to him) expired upon the ſpot; the moment he ſtruck his majeſty the laſt ſtroke, all his army vaniſhed away, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of hoſtility ceaſed; and what remained was a moſt ſhocking aſpect like unto a field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, where two armies had deſtroyed one another, 'till nothing remained alive. Thus all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a total ſtagnation for a certain ſpace; but quickly a troop of guards arrived from the palace, and placed themſelves in order about their prince's dead body; and his ſecretary embraced him, and he revived, and appeared alive, in his full vigour.—This ſtupendous victory inſpired all nature with exſtatick joy; the heavens rejoiced; the morning ſtars ſang together; the earth was full of gladneſs; the mountains dropped new wine; the trees clapped their hands; the flowers appeared all in bloom; the birds warbid all around; the ſea roared with joyful murmurs; and ſhouts of triumph ran thro' all the hoſt.—I was attentive to this unparalleled tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till my ſoul was ſwallowed up in exſtacy, and loſt in wonder; I was tranſported into ſuch raptures of joy, that it had almoſt overcome all my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual powers, and elevated my mind into a ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but my comforting ſuſtainer ſtrengthened my heart with a vivifying cordial, whereby I was enabled to retain the uſe of my faculties; and my mind was much alert, to attend to the whole ſcene.—The king, ſeeing the executioner dead at his feet, asked the governor, if he had any more hoſts to ſend forth; and he anſwered, no. He asked again, if he had any more vengeance, or any thing to lay to the charge of thoſe perſons whoſe cauſe the king had eſpouſed; and the governor answered, no. Again he asked, if what had been done was ſufficient ſatisfaction to his juſtice, and adequate to his honour; and he anſwered, yes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009151_0038_10310C81C911EA28"/>Then the king and the governor ſaluted one another, with all the tokens of friendship; and all the nobles and attendants, in each court, kiſſed and embraced one another; there appeared ſuch perfect amity, and every thing ſo harmonious, as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded any thing I had ever ſeen; the two courts <hi>became one:</hi> the governor acknowledged the king's ſupremacy, gave him his right-hand, and the pre-eminence in all things, yet abated nothing of his own dignity; likewiſe the governor's ſecretary, and all his retinue (only his executioner who was dead) kept every one his proper ſtation; and without compulſion or reluctance, were entirely ſubſervient to his majeſty's pleaſure.—Now I ſaw the ſplendor of a <hi>king's court indeed!</hi> The majeſty, the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the ſimilarity, the regularity, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this court! with the refulgent rays of glory, ſhining in the king's perſon, and reflecting luſtre upon every face! did excel all the glorious appearances that ever my eyes beheld; nor had I ever heard, or read, of the like, or ever conceived in my heart, any thing equal to what I now ſaw!—For, tho' the glory proceeded from the king alone, yet it had ſuch an extenſive influence, that it poured an incomparable brilliancy upon all around him; every object took the reflection, and every face ſhone with peculiar beauty; and, among the reſt, I found myſelf illucidated within and without: my vital parts were in a flame, illuminating my whole body; and my garments glittered like beams of light; my heart was abundantly enlarged, and the faculties of my ſoul ſtrengthened, more than ever I had found them before; and I was inſpired with ſuch vivacity and agility, that I became as ſprightly as a roe, or a young hart.—Here my ſoul regaled itſelf in unſpeakable pleaſure, bathed in fountains of inexpreſſible delight, and floated in the midſt of an ocean of inconceivable joy; for the king's ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009151_0039_10310C8353D60C78"/>
anointed my eyes to make my ſight clear and ſtrong; and directed me to behold ſuch a variety of ſplendid objects, in ſuch harmonious contexture, and exquiſite order; all ſhining in the radiancy of the ſupreme <hi>origin of glory;</hi> until my ſoul was ſo expanded, that I ſcarcely knew whether I was on earth, or in heaven.</p>
            <p>But when my ſoul was largely ſatiated with theſe extatic delights, and my mind returned to a ſettled compoſure, I ſtill found inceſſant deſires to hear the king's ſolution to the governor's propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Then the king's herald ſounded his trumpet ſo loud, that it echoed through all the celeſtial orbs: the mountains trembled and melted away; the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies aroſe, and were exalted; ſprings dried up, and dry land flowed with waters; fruitful ground wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and barren deſarts appeared in bloom; the ſea dried up, and the heavens opened; all the glory of man totally ſubſided; and there was profound ſilence.</p>
            <p>And he proclaimed the glory of the king's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the rectitude of his kingdom, his ample per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and his immenſe riches; whereby he is ſufficient to ſubdue every enemy, to compleat every work he pleaſes to undertake, to bleſs all his ſubjects with every enjoyment which their hearts can deſire, and to maintain their happy ſtate for ever.</p>
            <p>Then he diſtinctly anſwered to all the particulars, which were contained in the governor's queſtion. He fully demonſtrated the qualifications of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be far ſuperior to all the formidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the hideous monſter; ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his reign, and extirpate his being; and alſo to make ample reparation of all the damage done by him; ſo as that the governor ſhould neither ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſs or diſhonour, nor his ſubjects ſuffer diſtreſs or diſgrace, no more than if the monſter had <hi>never been born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:009151_0040_10310C85172C05A8"/>But in the opening of theſe things, there was ſuch a diſplay of wiſdom, love, and power; ſuch excellency, glory, and majeſty; that it frequently exhilarated my ſoul into rapturous agitation; but the ſecretary ſtayed my paſſions, and would not ſuffer me to give way to too much extacy, becauſe the importance, and ſublimity of the ſubject, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the moſt <hi>fixed attention.</hi> So I was favoured with a full, diſtinct, and accurate manifeſtation, of that which had filled my mind with ſo much anxiety; and which I had ſo long, and ſo earneſtly deſired to ſee. But the comfort, ſatisfaction, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largedneſs, eſtabliſhment, ſolid peace, and ſerenity of mind, which I enjoyed, in ſeeing and hearing the explication of thoſe deep myſteries, did excell all that ever I had experienced before, or what I ſhall ever be <hi>able to deſcribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when the herald had ſpoken every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paragraph, relating to the excellencies, or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful performances of the king; his ſecretary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the truth thereof; inſcribed it upon <hi>living tables,</hi> and ſealed it with the king's <hi>immutable ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</hi> And when he had made an end, his majeſty ſtood up, and made proclamation, that if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, would contend with him, undertake to accuſe him in any thing, or found any thing to object againſt his proceedings in any punctilio; <hi>let him draw near.</hi>—But no anſwer was made. Then the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounded, and all the harps anſwered in chorus; and the harmonious noiſe reſounded through all the heavenly domes; triumphal acclamations ran thro' all the court; and all the kingdom was filled with ſhouts of joy; which made the earth and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ring: the royal ſtandard was erected; and all the enſigns of majeſty, victory, peace, and glory, were diſplayed; the mountains and foreſts broke forth into ſinging, the lower parts of the earth
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009151_0041_10310C8B961DC228"/>
ſhouted; and the morning ſtars ſang together; the light of the moon became as the light of the ſun; and the light of the ſun was ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven days; and rays of ſtupendous glory ſhined through the whole creation.—Now my ſoul was abſorbed with wonder; loſt in admiration; I was obliged to give way to the overcoming rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and indulge my exſtatick paſſions; for I could not refrain from ſongs of gladneſs, ſhouts of joy, and all the demonſtrations of delight, that my ſoul was able to expreſs. And ſtill, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I recollect the magnificence of this triumph, I cannot refrain being tranſported with pleaſure, and crying out with unſpeakable joy; HOW GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOUS LOOKED THE KING OF ISRAEL THAT DAY!</p>
            <p>Then the king called me unto him, and told me, he accepted me as his ſon; that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things neceſſary to give me a princely education; and as ſoon as I had attained to the due qualifications, he would take me to his royal palace; where I ſhould abide in his preſence for ever; and enjoy all the delights that my heart could deſire. And in the mean time, I ſhould have free acceſs to him, in every thing that might be needful to call upon him for.—The king's ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary told me, he would always continue preſent with me, to aſſiſt, inſtruct, and comfort me; to introduce me into the king's preſence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me his bounties; and to improve me in every thing that might be conducive to my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.—The king's herald aſſured me, he would be ready at all ſeaſons, to inform me in all matters that could be neceſſary for my inſtruction relating to the king, his excellencies, his riches, his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the orders of his houſe, my relation to him, and intereſt in him.—Alſo the governor told me, he ſhould no more exerciſe juriſdiction over
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009151_0042_10310C8D1E614478"/>
me; but, as it would be for my benefit to receive his inſtructions, he would always attend me in quality of a counſellor; and I ſhould always find an equal pleaſure and profit in all his admonitions.—Alſo the governor's ſecretary told me, he ſhould no more act toward me in the ſame character as he did before; ſince I now belonged to another prince; but ſeeing I ſtill might be liable to many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, through my own inſtability, or want of preſence of mind; to prevent which, his aſſiſtance might be very uſeful; he ſhould continue my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion, under the king's direction, in the capacity of a monitor.—Then all the king's guards, and nobles of the court, ſaluted me in the quality of a prince. And the herald further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that I was to remain at his majeſty's country-ſeat, (with others of the king's children) where I ſhould enjoy all accommodations fit for a prince; and might expect frequent viſits from his majeſty; having princes for my companions, and the royal guards for my attendants; till the king ſhould come, and carry me in triumph, and ſtate, to his royal city.</p>
            <p>Then the king wrote me a diſcharge from all offences, paſt, preſent, and to come; with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance from all ſervitude, or allegiance, to any lord, or governor, but himſelf: he alſo beſtowed on me an inſtrument of adoption; whereby he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and declared me to be his own ſon, and to have a right to all the enjoyments in his kingdom. And alſo promiſed me every neceſſary accommodation, during my ſtay at his lower houſe; and that he would be expeditious in returning to fetch me to himſelf, in his ſerene palace.—Theſe things he ſigned, ſealed, and delivered to me, in the preſence of three faithful witneſſes; aſſuring me they were enrolled in the council-chamber, by three infallible recorders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:009151_0043_10310C8EA9983D38"/>And when his majeſty had regularly ſtationed me in his inferior palace, and given proper directions for my education, and noble accompliſhment; he mounted his triumphal chariot, and haſted with all his train, to the imperial city; where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all the demonſtrations of joy, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; and where he reigns ſupreme <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> to whom every creature yields ſubjection, every knee bows, and every tongue aſcribes praiſe and glory.</p>
            <p>I find this country-palace is the king's acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; where the royal ſciences are taught; which are not to be learned in any ſchool in the univerſe beſide; nor can be taught by any but the king's inſtructors; who are his herald, and his ſecretary. For notwithſtanding the governor and his ſecretary remain with us, and are of ſpecial uſe among us, in their own province (being well ſkilled in other ſciences) they are entire ſtrangers to the ſciences peculiar to the palace. Nor can any man learn, or is it poſſible for them to be taught theſe things, ſo long as they dwell in any part of univerſe, ſave in the king's own country. All other climates are incompatible with theſe ſciences; the air they breathe in, and the food they live upon, render them incapable of receiving the inſtructions; yea, the very nature, and complexion of the inhabitants of all other realms, are foreign, and indocible to any of theſe things.</p>
            <p>The ſciences taught in this ſchool, and learned by all the royal princes, are chiefly four, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature, extenſiveneſs, and perfection of his majeſty's anſwers, to the governor's problems; for though we had heard them publiſhed, we were far from apprehending them in their fulleſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; they being of ſo ſublime a nature, as require the cloſeſt application, and deepeſt penetration, to conceive of them in a <hi>diſtinct light.</hi> Theſe are
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009151_0044_10310C91DBE73428"/>
much deeper ſtudies than the tables of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor (notwithſtanding the intricacy, and amazing depths thereof;) for the perfections, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of the king, do far out-vie all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the monſter, and the miſchief done by him; and do abound beyond all that ever was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or mentioned by the governor: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we have opportunity to peruſe all the herald's curious deſcriptions, drawn in the moſt lively figures, and apt repreſentations, as well as hearing his excellent lectures, upon the great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, undertakings, performances, and victories, of his majeſty; they ſo far tranſcend any thing that ever was preſented to our eyes, or ears, or that ever our minds were exerciſed in before; that our capacities could never conceive of the dephs thereof, were it not that the king's ſecretary opens, interprets, and guides our underſtandings into theſe myſteries. He not only leads to the true chain, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us to compare one thing with another, ſo as to ſee the conſiſtency, and perfection of the whole ſyſtem; but alſo anoints our eyes and ears, with an <hi>unction peculiar to his excellency;</hi> and refreſhes us with vivifying cordials, to keep our minds, and ſenſes alert. Thus the ſtudy becomes delightful; both as it is moſt excellent in its own nature, and as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſo much intereſted therein: and we make a comfortable proficiency; notwithſtanding the knowledge is unattainable by any creature that is not inſtructed the ſame way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To underſtand the foundation, conſtitution, oeconomy, and privileges of the kingdom; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the king and his ſubjects; the royal grant whereby they hold their title to all the rich bleſſings of the kingdom; with the glory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity wherein they ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is ſtudy more ſublime than the former. But as it bears ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009151_0045_10310C985BDC4360"/>
to it, it becomes more eaſy, when the other is well underſtood; eſpecially as they both depend upon the perfections of the king. And we have the ſame inſtructors, and the ſame advantages in this, as in the former branch; but the ſtupendous depths, and glories, that do herein appear, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to aſtoniſh the moſt enlarged and moſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed mind; nor is it poſſible for any one to form juſt conceptions thereof, without ſuch <hi>preparations</hi> as we are favoured with, through the bounty of the ſecretary, our grand tutor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To learn the court-language. As this is the moſt elegant of all languages, ſo the ſtudy of it is moſt excellent and curious. It is a language which no perſon was ever able to learn, who lived under the governor's juriſdiction, or in any other realm, but in the king's proper dominions only; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, this language never could be carried into any foreign country. It has no affinity with any other language in the univerſe; nor is it (like all other languages) ſubject to any mutations; but continues one pure language through all ages. The grounds of it are amply laid down by the king's herald, with all neceſſary inſtructions therein; but the <hi>pronunciation</hi> can never be attained but by the moſt refined and immediate crudition received from the king's ſecretary, in which he is always ready to aſſiſt us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To learn the behaviour of the court. This ſcience (like the reſt) is what none can learn in any other ſchool. The herald lays down proper direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this branch of learning; but the ſecretary alone can inſpire us with the <hi>princely mein,</hi> to adorn our behaviour with a becoming grace.—Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons confound the demeanour of the king's court, with that of the governor's court; but it is a groſs miſtake: for, though all the excellency of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's court is common to the king's court, there
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009151_0046_10310C99E2D64238"/>
is a peculiarity attending the palace, both in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and mein, which none of the proper ſubjects of the governor were ever able to learn: for, when his court was in its utmoſt ſplendor, theſe peculiar excellencies were utterly unknown in his dominion; and, ſince the glory of his court was ruined, by the inroads of the monſter, he has not a loyal ſubject in the univerſe, properly belonging to himſelf. For thoſe that are in league with the monſter, are rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſubjects, whatever pretences they make of loyalty: and thoſe that have been brought back to give due honour to his excellency the governor, (as it was not his, but the king's power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby they were reclaimed) they are not properly his, but the king's ſubjects. And though many of thoſe pretendedly loyal, but really rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects of the governor (confounding the two courts, one with the other, through there being real ſtrangers to both) have imagined, they had attained to the accompliſhments of the palace; and could mimick the king's ſubjects, ſo far as to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ignorant; yet, in reality, they were as far from attaining to the truth thereof, as parrots, monkeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are from attaining to the proper actions of men.—But the king's ſons (and they only) being endowed with privileges peculiar to themſelves, are capable of learning the royal ſciences, which are peculiar to their dignity. For, the air they breathe in; the waters they drink, and bathe in; the food they live upon; the clothing they wear; the clear and large proſpects they view; the ground they walk upon; with the ſociety they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo many preparatives to qualify them for receiving thoſe ſublime inſtructions. And thus they become proficients to thoſe profound ſciences, which remain impenetrable ſecrets to the moſt learned, wiſe, and ingenious of all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:009151_0047_10310C9B77402658"/>But we differ much from ſome celebrated bands, who have been much gazed at by the world, and much valued by themſelves, on account of their keeping ſome branches of knowledge ſecret from the vulgar; for we never uſe art to conceal our learning and knowledge, nor amuſe perſons by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but, in a ſincere open manner, are ready to give an anſwer to any one that aſketh us a reaſon, of any thing that we profeſs; yea, we are glad to inform any perſon as far as we can; and rejoice to find any deſirous or capable of receiving inſtruction. Therefore, it is not want to public ſpirit, in them that are initiated into theſe myſteries, that they are kept ſecret from all other people; (for all the grounds, and rules, belonging to each of theſe ſciences, are made public, to be ſeen by all) but it is owing to the rudeneſs of their capacities, the groſſneſs of their taſte, and indocibleneſs of their natures, that things ſo refined are too ſublime for their conceptions. And all the nations upon earth are ſtrangers to the king's ſecretary; (who alone can inſpire perſons with an apt genius for learning the royal ſciences) except thoſe in his majeſty's own realm. Some are inſenſible, and unconcerned; ſome deſpiſe and contemn him; and others give him nominal honours, but eſteem him as a being meerly <hi>ideal.</hi> And while it is thus with them, they muſt remain ſtrangers to the excellencies of the kingdom; for the knowledge thereof, is, to them, impoſſible.</p>
            <p>In this college we remain ſtudents, and become true mathematicians; our ſtudies being all upon ſubſtantial things, and all our ſolutions grounded upon facts. We practiſe no chimera nor exerciſe ourſelves in empty flights of fancy, only thoſe things which are uſeful and durable, and admit of juſt demonſtration, are objects of our re-ſearches. Our purſuits are not follies of ſpeculation, but true

wiſdom and reality; ſo that however uſeful other ſciences, and the inſtructions given in other ſchools, may be, in their proper place; there is not any learning in the world that is worthy to be eſteemed any more than chaff or dung, when compared with the profound wiſdom, taught by the great <hi>maſter of our aſſembly</hi>—And we purſue the ſtudy of theſe things with great delight, not only as they yield us much pleaſure and profit, in our preſent ſituation; but as they inſpire our hearts with future hopes of ſolid and everlaſting felicity. For we are aſſured, that when we are arrived to ſuch a degree of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accompliſhed with thoſe qualifications, which the king deſigns for us, he will come in the glory of his majeſty, and carry us home in triumph, and make us fellows of the royal ſociety, at his imperial court, where we ſhall be bleſſed with the knowledge of ſuch myſteries, as never yet <hi>entered into the heart of man.</hi>

ſin, in that abandoned creature; for the devil is the moſt finiſhed image of ſin.—The curſe introduced by ſin, cauſed all the antipathy that appears in the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part of the creation; therefore, whatever is frightful in beaſts, deteſtable in reptiles, irkſome in vegetables, or inclement in any of the elements, is the ſimilitude of ſin.—Sin produced all the evil that is in mankind: therefore, all internal wickedneſs, whether ſpiritual; as atheiſm, hypocriſy, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hatred againſt God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or natural; as pride, envy, malice, deceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all external wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether verbal; as prophaning the name of God, blaſphemy, curſing, threatning, defaming, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, filthy communication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or actual; as murder, adultery, theft, drunkenneſs, and all abominations, are the image of ſin.—Likewiſe, ſin is its own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or all puniſhment is its natural production: therefore, all internal grief, diſtraction, and horror of mind; all external pain, ſickneſs, ſorrow, anguiſh, and miſery; all the ghaſtly appearances of death, and all the dark horrors of hell and damnation, do bear the very image and true repreſentation of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What number of limbs, and members, pertain to ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are called a <hi>multitude.</hi>—But to form a judgment of their number, we muſt conſider their <hi>modifications</hi> and <hi>operations.</hi> The former appears in the numbers of ſinful actions; which actions are multiplied by the number of ſinful words attending every action; which words are again multiplied by the number of ſinful thoughts from whence thoſe words proceed; which thoughts are alſo multiplied by the number of ſinful principles, from whence they are produced. For inſtance, <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s wicked thought ſprang from a number of ſinful principles; as, contempt of the pure worſhip of God, deſpiſing his commandment, diſtruſting his faithfulneſs, ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:009151_0057_10310CBFAB1FF678"/>
to his great benefactor, covetouſneſs, pride, ſlaviſh fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, as it was ſupported by ſo many roots, it diffuſed itſelf into as great a number of ſinful branches. Thus ſin is multiplied into itſelf.—The latter appears in the oppoſition which ſin makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. For ſin cauſes a diſregard of all the rich diſcoveries which God gives of himſelf; an abuſe of the multitude of his mercies; a breach of all his commandments; a deſpiſing of all his counſels; a miſimprovement of all gracious opportunities; and a corruption of all the powers of nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus, the numbers of ſins are encreaſed, by the multiplication of all theſe, one into another. For every command of God which we break, is attended with ſo many ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, as we had been favoured with diſcoveries of the will of God, to inform us; mercies to engage us; counſels to guide us; powers and opportunities to prevent the evil; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all theſe are enrolled in the books, which ſhall be opened at the laſt day</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What is the meaſure of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is ſaid of ſin, that is reaches to <hi>heaven.</hi>—But to find the true dimenſion of its ſtature, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how high it has prevailed: for no effect can be greater than its cauſe; and all defection, miſery, and deſtruction, are the effects of ſin; therefore, whereſoever any of theſe effects have prevailed, ſo high ſin hath aſcended.—In the creation it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, over the ground, in bringing a curſe; over the mountains, in bringing a deluge; over the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, in deſtroying their beauty and virtue; over the animals, in cauſing them pain and ſorrow; over the clouds, in cauſing reſtraint; over the ſun, moon, heavens, and ſtars, in bringing darkneſs upon them; over angels, in caſting them down to hell; over all the excellencies of human nature, in bringing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, miſery, and death; yea (ſo far as he is a creature) over the ſon of God himſelf, in ſubjecting
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009151_0058_10310CC1332BA3D0"/>
him to death.—Alſo the height of ſin appears in its <hi>attempts</hi> and <hi>deſigns.</hi> For, whether they be carried into execution, or not, the malignity, the guilt, and juſt deſert of ſin, are equal to the deſign; and the heinouſneſs is aggravated, according to the excellency of the being, againſt whom the deſign is formed—Againſt the eternal perfections of God; againſt his omniſcience; againſt his omnipotence; againſt his holineſs; againſt his righteouſneſs; againſt his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; againſt his faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Likewiſe the extent of ſin appears in the depth of the miſery which enſues; for ſo low as any creature is caſt down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſo deep doth ſin extend:—to the loweſt hell, beneath all the rays of light; beneath all comfort; beneath all mercy; beneath all hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the breadth of ſin; it is as the <hi>thick cloud.</hi>—But the extent is beſt underſtood, by the diſtance it ſeparates one being from another, whereſoever it comes between. It ſeparates creatures from God; it has fixed ſuch ignorance, alienation, and enmity in all mankind, that they can neither know, deſire, nor ſeek after God: it has filled the conſciences of men with guilt, ſo that they cannot enjoy peace with God, nor have courage to approach his preſence; but find themſelves held in exile, by an unpaſſable gulph.—It ſeparates man from his original purity: he was made upright, in the image of God, but by ſin is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altogether vanity; made very good, but by ſin degenerated, to be only evil. The heart is become as adamant; and the whole conſtitution of nature is corrupted. Thus, ſo far as the eaſt is from the weſt, ſin hath ſeparate man from God; and, ſo far as the ſouth is from the north, ſin hath ſeparated man from his original purity.—Sin is not infinite in his exiſtence, for it reſides in finite beings; nor in its prevalency, for God reſtrains it. But as it is againſt the infinite perfections of God, as it tends to an infinite ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009151_0059_10310CC2FA493038"/>
from God, and ſo to the creature's infinite loſs and miſery; it contains infinite hatefulneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves infinite puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What is the weight of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This appears in its <hi>inſupportableneſs.</hi>—The earth is not able to bear it; the pillars of heaven tremble, and cannot ſuſtain it; the angels that ſinned, are eternally ſunk under it; the corporeal conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man cannot ſuſtain, but is conſumed and cruſhed to duſt by it; the ſoul of man is not able to ſupport itſelf under ſin, but is utterly overwhelmed; the human nature of Chriſt was not able to ſuſtain the load of ſin, but alone through the power of the God-head.</p>
               <p>Again, it appears in its <hi>unmoveableneſs.</hi>—The law being the ſtrength of ſin, it is eaſier to remove heaven and earth: all the improvements that can poſſibly be made of earthly riches are of no avail; no legal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices can take away ſin; all moral obedience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtify a ſoul from it; no prayers, or religious performances, can procure remiſſion of it; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abundance of oblations, or event the fruit of a man's body, cannot atone for the ſin of his ſoul: therefore, it is heavier than the whole creation, ſince all the creation ſhall be cruſhed to pieces by it. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> ſuſtains the whole creation by his word; but could not remove ſin, without pouring out his ſoul unto death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>What is, and wherein lies, the ſtrength of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This may be underſtood by its number, weight and meaſure: <hi>for, as the man is, ſo is his ſtrength.</hi>—But, in particular, its power appears in its <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>—Every creature that enters the paths of ſin, is made captive thereby, and held in perpetual bondage. Nor was it ever known that any created being (when once enſnared) was able (in the leaſt degree) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009151_0060_10310CC6310433D8"/>
himſelf out of the chains of ſin. They may ſhift hands, and by changing the forms of ſin, may impoſe upon themſelves, to fancy they obtain liberty; but they that think themſelves moſt at liberty, are frequently moſt in bondage. Likewiſe, ſin hath power to fill the ſoul with diſtreſs and anguiſh; to kill and deſtroy all its hope and comfort; to bring natural death upon all mankind univerſally; and to torment both ſoul and body in hell, to all <hi>eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſtrength of ſin centers in carnality of mind; whereby all the powers are held in bondage: in guilt and horror of conſcience, whereby the ſoul is filled with anguiſh and diſtreſs; and in alienation from God, whereby all bleſſings are abdicated, life, and all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments forfeited, and death and miſery become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable.—Alſo the damnatory power of ſin, is the <hi>law.</hi> And the power of damnation, or miſery of the damned, lies in a reſtleſs deſire after ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, or ſeeking ſatisfaction in ſomething that is not God; which is that gnawing worm that never dies.—In enmity againſt God; which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire in the ſoul. And in rebellion againſt God; which provokes the burning wrath of God; and brings it down upon the ſoul, unquenchable and eternal. Therefore, ſin is <hi>invincible</hi> in its power, to every created being.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>What is the loudneſs of the voice of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is to be conceived of, by the diſtance at which it may be heard; which is from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And it hath been found by many, that neither diſtance of place, or time, nor change of company, or circumſtances, could ſilence or allay the <hi>dreadful ſound,</hi> which ſin cauſeth in the ears.—Alſo by the piercing ſhocks it gives where the ſound comes; cauſing every ear to <hi>tingle;</hi> and every heart to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—It was ſin that cauſed all the camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to tremble at mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> The law could not have
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009151_0061_10310CC9641D5C80"/>
cauſed terror, had it not been joined by the echo of ſin in their conſciences. For there is nothing terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any creature, but where there is antipathy; and there is no antipathy between the law of God, and the creatures of God, only ſo far as ſin has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in them. No terror attended the giving of the law, when man was in ſinleſs ſtate. And every voice that proceeds from God, or manifeſtation of God, that raiſes terror in men's hearts, it is ſin alone that is that <hi>cauſe.</hi>—It is impoſſible there ſhould be fear, ſorrow, or ſhame, where there is no guilt; or guilt where there is no ſin. Though guilt in the conſcience, frequently brings fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concerning things which have no real exiſtence,—And the ſtrength of the voice of ſin may be judged of, from the obſtacles it pierceth through: through the ſhade of the trees of <hi>Eden:</hi> through the courage of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; through the grandeur of monarchs; through the religion of the ſtricteſt <hi>Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c.—Thus, the voice of ſin appears to be ſo loud as to alarm and ſhake the whole <hi>creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>How poiſonous is the nature of ſin?</hi>

               <p>

And where ſin prevails, in any particular form, it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate itſelf in the ſame form, if there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or ſo much as an inſpection.—The <hi>depth of the infection.</hi> It hath penetrated through all the powers of nature, the head, heart, mind, conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, it hath overſpread all the faculties of the ſoul, and all the members of the body; ſo that no part is free from the moſt mortal diſeaſe.—That <hi>rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inflammation.</hi> It continually burns with reſtleſs torture, raging, and diſtraction.—The <hi>irrevokeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the plague thereof.</hi> No antidote in nature

can eradicate, no medicine in the creation of God can remove it; the hurt is utterly incurable; ſo that all the balm in <hi>Gilead</hi> (that is, all the excellency in man) is not ſufficient to yield the leaſt <hi>relief.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is to be learned by the perſons which are beguiled thereby, which, in general, are the <hi>whole world;</hi> and in particular the <hi>innocent,</hi> the <hi>wiſe,</hi> and the <hi>religious.</hi>—The means whereby ſin deceives ſouls: imaginary pleaſure, which infatuates the mind; imaginary hopes, which encourage them to perſiſt; pride of heart, which makes deſpiſe ſubmiſſion to the moſt high; and vain-glory, which fills them with imaginations of ſelf-ſufficiency.—The things wherein they are deceived; the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things appear in a baſe light: they imagine God to be like themſelves; Chriſt a vile perſon; the Holy Ghoſt a daemon; the law of God unjuſt; the goſpel a deluſion; the worſhip of God contemptible; and his people a reproach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the baſeſt things appear in a commendable light; evil like good; darkneſs like light; ſinners like ſaints; and devils like angels of light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—The effects of the theſe deceptions: hardening men's hearts; ſtupifying their minds; s;ettling them in a form of godlineſs, without the power; deluding them with imaginary peace, and ſafety, till eternal deſtruction come upon them.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the deceit that dwells in the ſervants of ſin. Their heart is replete with hypocriſy; their practices are with all <hi>deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs;</hi> and their ſubtil devices, artful inventions, and deluſive ſchemes, are contrived with deſign (if it were poſſible) to <hi>deceive the very elect.</hi>—Therefore, ſin is myſtery of iniquity, too deep for any to fathom, but he alone who ſearches the hearts, and tries the reins.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>With what weapons, and in what manner, doth ſin fight?</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The weapons of ſin, are, <hi>firſt,</hi> Offenſive; whereby iniquity prevails, ſouls are overcome, and ſatan's kingdom is enlarged: which, when he attacks in front, to carry ſouls headlong from God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all virtue and morality, are <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> But when he charges in flank, or fights in ambuſcade, to break the lines of reaſon, or ſurprize the guards of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; then his weapons are a <hi>corrupt mind, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> and <hi>unbelief.—Secondly,</hi> Defenſive weapons; whereby ſinners are held in bondage, and defended againſt repentance or conviction: which are, hardneſs of heart, blindneſs of mind, ſtupefaction, pride, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-reaſoning, ſelf-righteouſneſs, hypocriſy, enmity againſt God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By theſe, ſin maintains his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſoul; they being the <hi>armour wherein he truſteth.</hi> But when the ſoul is ſo cloſely beſieged with light and conviction, that any of theſe ramparts give way, then ſin prepares a murdering-piece [deſpair] by which he rends all to pieces. For the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtracted with deſpair, is frequently thrown into a ſtagnation; which terminates in a kind of lethargy, and ſo all remorſe ceaſes. Or elſe the perſon gets the ſtorm allayed by a form of religion, and ſettles there; and purpoſely avoids any further ſearches into his ſtate, leſt it ſhould caſt him into deſpair again.—And as to his way of fighting, ſin hath two engines, with which he manages all his weapons, in every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, <hi>[deceit and violence]</hi> and by theſe, the ſoul is drawn away, and entangled in the ſnare; or driven, with rapid force, into exceſs and miſery; ſo that the wiſeſt man cannot eſcape, nor is the ſtrongeſt able to withſtand.</p>

Having diveſted them of every thing that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially good; and brought them into the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty and wrethchedneſs, and deprived them of all ſolid conſolation; and reduced them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt depth of anguiſh and miſery; having introduced death unavoidable, upon every creature in this world, and damnation in the world to come.—And according to his victories, ſo are his <hi>dominions.</hi> The whole world, and every creature therein, with every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and faculty of thoſe creatures, are held in total ſubjection to his tyranny; and in them he reigns with deſpotick power, proclaiming himſelf, <hi>The invincible univerſal monarch.</hi>

               <p n="12">12. <hi>What is the age and duration of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Sin hath had an exiſtence from the beginning; ever ſince creatures choſe their own ways: for it entered into the world by the <hi>firſt man.</hi>—Sin muſt have a duration of abſolute neceſſity, whereſoever it has once had a being; until the Son of God ſhall be pleaſed to take to him his great power, and reign, to the deſtruction of his enemies. For ſin is not a <hi>creature:</hi> if it was, it muſt be dependent on God to ſuſtain it in being; or otherwiſe it muſt naturally and unavoidably ceaſe to be.

               <p>In order to a diſcovery of the damage done, it is neceſſary to underſtand, who are the <hi>ſufferers,</hi> and wherein they have <hi>ſuffered</hi> by ſin. The ſufferers are, <hi>the holy law of God,</hi> and <hi>the creature, man.</hi> And the things wherein they have ſuffered, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by comparing their <hi>original ſtation,</hi> with their preſent <hi>poſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the law of God, it is undeniably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the whole world is under it; and every ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> is indiſpenſably bound to live in ſubjection, and perpetual conformity to it. And that the law is abſolutely inviolable, appears from a two fold conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The natural and neceſſary obligation, which all creatures are under to God, as their creator, ſuſtainer, and benefactor. This is founded in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fitneſs of things. For as we have received our being, and every degree of well-being, from him alone; we are under a natural, and indiſpenſible obligation, in point of gratitude, to live to his glory, and to devote all the powers of ſoul and body, to the will of him, in whom we live, move, and exiſt. All juſt laws are originally founded upon <hi>natural obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and all reaſonable obedience to ſuperiors, is no other than <hi>ſtrict gratitude;</hi> which becomes their proper due, in conſequence of favour received from them. This is the true ground of the moral law, and ſo long as God is God, and creatures continue
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009151_0066_10310CDD0A2D6090"/>
to be intelligent beings, the obligation can <hi>never ceaſe;</hi> nor is it poſſible for any circumſtance to make it <hi>void.</hi>—The angels of glory are debtors to JEHOVAH, for all their excellencies; conſequently they are bound in duty to ſhew forth his praiſe. The devil is a creature, and every creature of God is <hi>good;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (notwithſtanding the evil he has contracted) ſo long as he has a being, he enjoys ſome good from God; and conſequently continues under an obligation, or law of gratitude. <hi>The devil ſinneth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;</hi> but if he were not under a law, he could not ſin; for, <hi>Where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi>—Likewiſe, among the ſons of men, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature is under obligations to God, according to the favours he enjoys: the greater the favours, the greater the obligations. So that ſaints in glory will eternally remain under the higheſt obligations of <hi>gratitude;</hi> that is, under the law of God, conſidered ſimply as a law, not as a covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The divine authority ſtamped upon the ſimple law of nature, gives ſanction to this obligation. And this authority conſiſts in three things:—1. Doctrine whereby God has revealed to mankind his will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way in which they are to ſhew their gratitude to him; having taught and inſtructed them, how they might obey him in an acceptable manner.—2. The commandment whereby God requires from the creature that obedience, ſubmiſſion, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his will, which his goodneſs to that creature juſtly deſerved; which, therefore, that creature is under a native obligation to perform; and God has a native right to demand.—3. A covenant, ſtipulating the conditions of obedience, and diſobedience, to the holy precept; with promiſes and threatnings, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and curſes, annexed thereto.</p>
               <p>From theſe two fountains, the law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſovereign power over all creatures. For all

that God enjoins, is purely natural; as, <hi>To love God and our neighbour,</hi> is an obligation inſeparable from our being, our relation to God, and to our fellow-creatures. And whatſoever is a concomitant of the natural obligation, is included in the injunction, <hi>With all thy heart,—ſoul,—ſtrength,—mind,</hi>—and <hi>as thyſelf.</hi> So that a natural obligation, <hi>founded on our very being,</hi> and inforced by the <hi>divine ſanction,</hi> muſt be ſuperlatively, univerſally, and eternally binding, to every intelligent being in the creation. Therefore, the authoritative power of the holy law, extends to every creature, in every capacity; whilſt innocent, to command, to promiſe and to threaten; and when ſinful, to convince, to condemn, and to curſe; but is not inveſted with any influential power, either to prevent, or remove ſin. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the law is not deficient in all ſuaſive means, warnings, inſtructions, admonitions, reproofs, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But inaſmuch as its power is only <hi>mandatory,</hi> not <hi>physical; judicial</hi> not <hi>operative;</hi> all its meaſures to prevent the evil, to heal the plague, or repair the damage, have proved abortive. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the law has no other way to do itſelf juſtice, or vindicate its honour, but by the deſtruction of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for it cannot poſſibly recover what it has loſt by ſin. Which is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. All mankind have revolted from under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the holy law, and become the ſervants of ſin; and hereby the law is ſpoiled in its dominion; its authority is wrongfully taken away; its govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wreſted from it; and it is deprived of its right and property in its <hi>ſubjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Perfect and perpetual obedience is due to God's law; but all the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> are become <hi>children of diſobedience:</hi> being the ſervants of ſin, and yielding obedience thereto, whereby the law of God is injuriouſly deprived of all its juſt <hi>revenue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:009151_0068_10310CE0348A2648"/>3. The heart is the proper reſidence, or dwelling-place, of God's law. But by ſin it has been violently ejected, and every apartment in its palace, poſſeſſed by its implacable enemy: the will, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the affections, the conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inhabited with rebellion, darkneſs, enmity, and pollution; ſo that the holy law is baniſhed from its indubitable right, and from its native <hi>habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The holy law of God is worthy of the higheſt honour, profound reverence, ſacred regard, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obedience, from every rational being; but, thro' the prevalence of ſin, is eſteemed a ſtranger, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly rejected, violently treated, and contemptuouſly deſpiſed; inſomuch that all its honour and dignity are taken away, and <hi>trampled in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning mankind, it is certain, that his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate was perfection, unblemiſhed beauty, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dignity, and princely glory; which, compared with the wretched depravity, in which his whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is now involved, diſcovers the damage it hath ſuſtained by ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Man was made upright. As he came out of the hands of his Maker, <hi>very good,</hi> he muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in purity; but, by ſin, he is become altogether <hi>filthy, only evil continually, no part clean;</hi> nor can any clean thing be produced from him; for all his original purity is <hi>periſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Man was made in the image of God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was <hi>crowned with glory and honour;</hi> being the moſt excellent piece of God's handy-work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſtars; but, by ſin, he is degraded to a level with the beaſts and worms; and all his dignity is <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Man was placed in the imperial throne, having ſovereign dominion over all the works of God, in this world; but, by ſin, this dominion is loſt: the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:009151_0069_10310CE364CE0EE0"/>
creatures now yield obedience no farther than they are tamed by force, to fear and dread; or ſoothed by art, to become gentle. And by turns they rebel, and put mankind in the greateſt fear. Yea man has loſt the dominion over himſelf, and is enſlaved to a brutiſh appetite; and captivated under ſubjection to the devil himſelf, who has uſurped the throne, which man abdicated, and is become the prince of this world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Man was perfectly free from evil: but, by ſin, he is ſubjected to all manner of evil. His body is ſubject to every ſickneſs, and every ſore; to every painful, and every loathſome diſeaſe. His ſoul is ſubject to every wicked conception; and to every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable diſtraction. So that all he is, all he does, and all he enjoys, is perpetually attended with ſome plague, or annoyance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Man was bleſſed with compleat enjoyment of all good things which the earth could produce, or whereby his nature might be made happy. But, by ſin, all things in the world are become ſubject to corruption. Every bleſſing beneath the ſun is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncertain, and mixed with bitterneſs; ſo that in all terreſtrial excellencies, nothing remains but the <hi>ſhadow;</hi> the real ſubſtantial enjoyment is <hi>vaniſhed away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Man was free from all guilt, fear, or ſhame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. But, by ſin, all his powers are filled with guilt, horror, and confuſion. For a ſinful man is not able to endure the majeſty of the Lord. They cannot bear the ſigns of heaven, or meditate on the omniſcience of God; nor think of his approach in death, in judgment, but it fills their hearts with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Man in his primitive ſtate, had frequent viſits from God, and enjoyed communion with his <hi>Maker.</hi> But, thro' ſin, he was baniſhed from God's preſence,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009151_0070_10310CEA1C26AE28"/>
and is become an alien and ſtranger to God; being <hi>far off, without hope, and without God in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, by ſin, the greatneſs of God, as creator, has been contemned; his power, as ſuſtainer, has been deſpiſed; his goodneſs, as benefactor, has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully diſregarded; his majeſty, as governor, has been inſulted; his holineſs, as law-giver, has been prophaned; his juſtice, as judge, has been provoked; and his wrath, as executioner, incenſed. So that man hath intirely cut himſelf off from all property in God. He has no right to any favour or bleſſing whatſoever; nor has he any way to eſcape divine vengeance; nor is it poſſible for a ſinner to approach the holy God; or to form any juſt conceptions of the eternal Jehovah, but as <hi>a conſuming fire.</hi>

               <p>The only glimpſe of hope that remains for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is in the revelation which God has made of himſelf, in his ſacred word; or in the goſpel of his ſon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Wherein he has revealed himſelf under a different character from any thing that could be diſcovered by the law, or with which the law could have any concern; and wherein he is manifeſtly declared to ſtand in a different capacity, and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, a FATHER. This is a peculiar name; expreſſing the nearneſs of the relation, between God and his only begotten ſon, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and alſo the nearneſs of the relation betwixt him and his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, as they ſtand adopted in Chriſt; as well as the riches of his love and grace, freely flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' his beloved Son, to all the heirs of God. This appellation is never uſed in ſcripture, to expreſs God's relation to mankind, as the creator, or God of nature; nor does God ever give the appellation of ſons, or children, to any, but in conſideration of their being the peculiar objects of his love, in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus;</hi>

or at leaſt, profeſſors, aſſociating with his people, and externally ſeparated from the world; to ſuch (if hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites) the term may be uſed ironically. In the ſame peculiar ſenſe, his name GOD is always to be underſtood, when uſed with terms of appropriation; as, <hi>thy God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. This is that inſeparable relation, which no power in heaven, earth, or hell, can break; nor can time, or eternity, wear it away; neither can ſin, or death, or guilt, or enmity, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or wrath, or miſery, penetrate between God and the objects of his love in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This is the alone foundation of hope to ſinners; and the alone ſource of grace and mercy.</p>
               <p>The love of God the Father, to his elect, did not ceaſe, when the obedience of the creature ceaſed; and therefore he undertook to provide deliverance for ſinners; <hi>he laid help upon one that is mighty;</hi> and promiſed, that he ſhould not fail, nor be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged;—that he ſhould <hi>make an end of ſin;</hi> and ſhould be the <hi>ſalvation of God;</hi> in whom his people ſhould be eternally ſaved.</p>
               <p>This great deliverer proceeded forth, and came from God. He, therefore, is God, equal with the Father, having in himſelf all the divine perfections: or all the glorious attributes of deity.</p>
               <p>He is infinite, eternal, immortal, immutable, ſelf-exiſtent, independent, incomprehenſible, inviſible, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, omniſcient, omnipreſent, all-ſufficient, holy, juſt, good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Where is Chriſt's dwelling-place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He dwells in God the Father; in his eſſence; in his will; in his love; in his counſels and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:009151_0073_10310CEEB76ECBC0"/>
in all his perfections; and all the perfections of God dwell in him. Therefore, as Chriſt is God, he dwells in all created beings; and all created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings dwell in him. Yea, he fills infinite ſpace, and eternal duration.</p>
               <p>His preſence is univerſally manifeſt, by his ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, in every creature, time, and place: in heaven; where ſin is not, he appears in his glory; in earth, where ſin is permitted, ſo far as he pleaſes, and reſtrained when he pleaſes, he appears in his goodneſs; in hell, where ſin rages without controul, he appears in his terror. His preſence is manifeſt in all inanimate creatures, as they poſſeſs virtues; in all animals, as they are endued with uſefulneſs; in the devil, as he is poſſeſſed with intelligence and activity; in the angels of God, in holineſs, power, wiſdom, and vivacity in obeying his will; in wicked men, by intelligence in their ſouls, and power of action in their bodies; in his ſaints, in quickening, tranſforming, and comforting grace; and will dwell in them, by communications of his glory, to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Now be it obſerved, That all that has an exiſtence, is of <hi>God,</hi> the creator of all things; to whom infinity of ſpace, and eternity of duration, are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.—<hi>Creatures</hi> are the work of his hands.—<hi>Sin</hi> is the corruption or privation of the creature's purity.—And it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould dwell in ſin, or ſin in him; but he dwells in every other being.—He dwells in God, where ſin never did, or ever can exiſt; he inhabits eternal duration, and fills infinite ſpace; but ſin cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt, either in dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſpace, only ſo far as it poſſeſſes ſome creature. And in thoſe creatures, where ſin has no reſidence, there Chriſt dwells in his uprightneſs, and in thoſe creatures, where ſin prevails, Chriſt muſt reſide in his ſuſtaining power; otherwiſe the creature could not ſubſiſt, and conſequently ſin could have no being. Therefore, he is ſufficient to diſpoſſeſs ſin.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He is the <hi>expreſs image,</hi> and <hi>form of God.</hi>—Therefore, all the glories, beauties, and excellencies, that ever were beheld by men or angels, ſhine in him. For all that is precious, or deſirable, muſt either be in God, or in ſome part of the creation; but there never was any diſcovery of the glory of God, but as it ſhined in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; nor was there ever any beauty, or excellency in any creature, but what was received from him. Therefore, Chriſt is the perfection of beauty; the glorious mirrour of all perfection, created and uncreated; the glory-ſun, in whom meet, and center, all the refulgent rays of <hi>light and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, thoſe bright beams of holineſs, which proceed from Chriſt, are ſufficient to ſwallow up all the horrible appearances of ſin; the glory of his grace is able to diſpel every terrible aſpect of wrath and damnation; his perfection of rectitude (from whom every creature received its original beauty) is ſufficient to reſtore the native excellency of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how far ſoever it has been ruined; or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate an excellency, equal, or ſuperior, to what was loſt by ſin. And the rays of divine glory, that ſhine in the Son of God, are ſufficient to transform, into his own likeneſs, every creature on whom he is pleaſed to reflect the luſtre of his perfections; ſo that Chriſt is able to diſſipate all the deformity bro't by ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What number is contained in Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His number is <hi>One,</hi> without diviſion; his number contains <hi>Three,</hi> without multiplication.—And, in this number are contained all that is in God, and all that is in the creation of God.</p>
               <p>All the divine perfections, all the wiſe counſels, all the immuteable purpoſes, yea, all the thoughts,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:009151_0075_10310CF86DB4E1C8"/>
words, and works of God, are in Chriſt. In him are opened all the teſtimonies relating to the nature and will of God; by him are performed all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God; in him are fulfilled all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God.—Chriſt gives being, every creature in heaven, earth, and hell. And every thought, word, and action, of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (whether they be <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> or whether they be <hi>ſinful</hi>) are performed by power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or permitted from the Son of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuppoſe the number of his divine <hi>diſpenſations,</hi> multiplied into the number of creature-<hi>operations,</hi> it muſt infinitely exceed all the numbers of ſin.—And further, to prove that Jeſus is more than a match, to cope with all the numbers of ſin; there has been a general rendezvous of all the infernal hoſt; and the captain of ſalvation has been attacked, and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encountered by every warriour, both in the right and left wing; that is, every <hi>temptation</hi> to ſin, and every <hi>puniſhment</hi> merited by ſin.—And having ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all principalities and powers, and led captivity captive, he now abounds with all rich mercies, and all ſpiritual bleſſings, for his people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What is the meaſure of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He cannot be deſcribed by any <hi>meaſure.</hi> For he is incomprehenſible, infinite, and eternal. And as his nature is divine, and his glory cannot poſſibly be circumſcribed, nor does his perfection come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of any dimenſion, ſo is his love and grace, paſſing all the knowledge of men and angels.</p>
               <p>In height, he is <hi>far above all heavens,</hi> and above every <hi>creature, thing,</hi> or <hi>name;</hi> he reigns invincible, above all the attempts or deſigns of ſin, in the midſt of the throne, where ſin never was, or ever ſhall be, able to aſcend.—In depth, below all the <hi>deeps</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery;</hi> below all the <hi>deeps</hi> of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>hell.</hi> Therefore, is able to ſuſtain his people in the utmoſt
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:009151_0076_10310CFA33E47C20"/>
diſtreſs; to raiſe them up from the utmoſt depths of darkneſs; and to ſave them from ſin's loweſt abyſs.—In length, from everlaſting to everlaſting. The new covenant, of which he is mediator, and all the bleſſing thereof, are everlaſting; therefore, it is not poſſible that ſin ſhould ever extend itſelf beyond the limits of his grace; becauſe his grace is boundleſs, without beginning and without end: or that it ſhould find a vacancy in his goodneſs; becauſe that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and immutable.—In breath, beyond all the <hi>aboundings of ſin.</hi> And therefore, how far ſoever ſin has ſeparated any creature from God, from their primitive excellency, or from the enjoyment of any bleſſing; Chriſt is all-ſufficient to bring them near, and to remove ſin as far off.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What weight doth Chriſt bear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He is not to be deſcribed by any <hi>balance.</hi>—Nothing can ponderate againſt him, to whom all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are lighter than vanity, or like the ſmall duſt, whoſe weight is imperceptible; at whoſe approach the earth and the heavens <hi>fly away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the weight of ſin, it has been laid upon Chriſt, in all its heinous nature, aggravations, guilt, condemning power, juſt deſervings, and dreadful effects; with whatſoever is ponderous, piercing, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive in it; it came upon him in all its force, like <hi>thick clouds,</hi> with <hi>hailſtones,</hi> and <hi>coals of fire;</hi> and he did actually bear it, in his ſoul, and in his body. He ſuſtained the curſe due to ſin, like an impregnable rock. His dying for ſin, did not ſhew any want of power, (but depth of love) ſince he had <hi>power</hi> to lay down his life, and <hi>power</hi> to take it again.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt hath removed ſin: he had taken away and extinguiſhed it; yea, he hath ſo far vanquiſhed, and extirpated it, that the curſe, and condemnation thereof, can no more be found; the aggravation, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:009151_0077_10310D00B7E4E238"/>
guilt thereof, can no more be remembered.—And he is purging out, and will effectually eradicate, from his people, all the pollution, and all the concomitants of ſin, ſo as nothing of the nature, nor any remains of the effect, nor any conſequence, or production of it, ſhall have a being any more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>What is (and wherein lies) the power of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He hath all power in heaven and in earth; which nothing can deſtroy, repel, or withſtand. He is the creator, ſuſtainer, benefactor, and ſovereign diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of every creature that has a being.—He hath power over all his enemies, to deſtroy their being; to reduce them to ſubjection, though againſt their wills; to puniſh them with everlaſting deſtruction from his preſence; or to convert them from their rebellions, and make them willing ſubjects.—And he hath power to extirpate ſin out of the ſouls of his people; to deliver from every malady that it has brought; to ſecure from all the evils, from all the dangers, and from all the fears of it, <hi>to all eternity.</hi>—Yea, has power to enrich his ſaints with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places; to dignify their natures, and raiſe them to the higheſt degree of perfection; and to communicate to them the brighteſt rays of heavenly glory, <hi>in immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of Chriſt conſiſts in his divine omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, or being God over all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All things are in his hands, hence he hath a <hi>deſpotick</hi> power; he is mediator of the better covenant, hence he hath a <hi>ſaving</hi> power; he is head over all things to his church, hence he hath a <hi>communicative</hi> power, to bleſs his elect with grace and glory.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> This is known by its <hi>effects.</hi>—1. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful voice of Chriſt moves all the powers of nature;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:009151_0078_10310D02439AE1D0"/>
the heavens ſhake, and the earth melts.—2. It brings vengeance and deſtruction upon all his enemies.—3. It ſounds to the uttermoſt bounds of the creation; none of his choſen people can be ſo far off, but his voice can reach them.—4. His voice pierces through every intervening obſtacle; no depth of miſery, no grave of ſin, no hardneſs of heart, no blindneſs of mind, no enmity againſt God, no helliſh tumult in the ſoul, no worldly temptation, no vanity of mind, no plague of the heart, nor any terrors of wrath, or any thing that can poſſibly interpoſe, are able to hinder the joyful ſound of grace from the ſoul, when Jeſus ſpeaks, and the Lord opens the heart.—5. The effects, or operations, wrought by the voice of Chriſt, are many; it is ſo powerful, as to raiſe dead ſouls out of their ſins, and dead bodies out of their graves; ſo clear and diſtinct, as to be underſtood by all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſo ſweet and pleaſant, as to raviſh their hearts, and ſpread joy through all their powers.—6. His voice is ſo loud, that it entereth into the ears, and into the boſom of his Father; ſo as it is always heard, and always anſwered.—7. So loud is the voice of his <hi>redeeming blood,</hi> and his <hi>prevailing interceſſion,</hi> and the peace that reſounds from it, that the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of ſin cannot be heard, either before the <hi>throne of God,</hi> or in the <hi>conſcience.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. <hi>What is the nature of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is perfect <hi>abſtracted holineſs;</hi> or ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity, and excellency; ſuch as no creature in heaven or earth can claim, or pretend to vie with. The brighteſt luminaries are dark before him; the moſt exalted intelligences are conſcious of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and vail their faces in his preſence, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence, crying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy.</hi>—So holy is his nature, that no poiſon or impurity can poſſibly touch him; nor any uncleanneſs abide in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. He cannot look upon an unclean thing; nor
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:009151_0079_10310D03CB65FBE8"/>
can any unclean thing look upon him.—The holineſs of his nature ſanctifies every <hi>perſon, place,</hi> or <hi>thing,</hi> where he pleaſes to manifeſt his preſence.—And his purifying virtue cannot fail to be a ſufficient antidote againſt all the poiſon of ſin, to heal every diſeaſe, and remove every plague thereof; ſince his grace is ſo diffuſive, and it is his delight, and conſtant employ, to <hi>ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>—His healing and cleanſing grace, is ſo influential, that a touch (even of the hem of his garment) produces a cure; ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, as to reach the deepeſt retreats of the ſoul; ſo balſamick, as to cool every inflammation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move every torture of ſin; and ſo efficacious in its operation, as no malignant humour, nor mortal potion, can prevent its effect. This is that infallible medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which ſuceeds, when all other things fail.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>What is the depth of the wiſdom of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He is <hi>God only wiſe,</hi> the true wiſdom of God; to whom all the craft and ſubtilty of creatures is mere folly.—Chriſt is omniſcient, to know all things <hi>that are:</hi> His Father's whole will; all that has any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in every creature; and all the deep machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deluſive forms, and dark haunts of ſin, with all the progreſs and effects thereof.—He is wiſe, to ſearch out, and unravel all the ſubtilties and deceits of ſin; to diſconcert all its meaſures; and to deliver his people from all its inchantments: by pure light to expel the darkneſs, and by truth to expoſe falſhood; to diſtinguiſh between truth and error; and ſeparate the precious from the vile.—He <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> prudent to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and diſpoſe all things that <hi>ſhall be;</hi> to bring his people out of darkneſs, and illuminate them with the light of life; to cauſe them to know themſelves, and their miſeries by ſin; to bleſs them with the knowledge of the only true God, and the bleſſings freely given them in him; to prevent the deceptions of ſin from ſeducing their minds, or bringing them

any more under its dominion; to direct the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his grace in ſeaſon; to anſwer their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; to order his providential diſpenſations to work together for good; and to conduct all his little ones with honour and ſafety to his eternal kingdom.—His wiſdom is unſearchable; no deſign can be formed to fruſtrate any of his purpoſes; for his <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhall ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>What are Chriſt's weapons; and in what manner doth he fight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The alone weapon with which he makes war, is his <hi>word.</hi>—Chriſt is repreſented on horſe-back, to ſhew his ſwiftneſs and warlike appearance; with a bow, to ſhew his ſtrength; with arrows, to ſhew how exactly he hits the mark, ſtriking the heart; and with a ſword, to ſhew how ſharp he cuts, dividing one thing from another: but all theſe are but emblems of that one irreſiſtible weapon, <hi>The word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By his quick and powerful word he vanquiſhes all enemies; and, by the ſame word, he will judge all creatures, and conſume all that dare rebel againſt him. This word endureth for ever; and no adverſe power can deſtroy or wear it out; nor is any creature able to withſtand it: for, by this <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> Chriſt breaks through all the oppoſition, and deſtroys all the power of ſin; drives it out of its cloſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and delivers his children from its tyranny. And the ſame word, being full of grace, is a preſervative from all the attacks of horror and deſpair; and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt all the fiery darts of ſatan.</p>
               <p>The way of Chriſt's making war, is in <hi>righteouſneſs and judgment.</hi>—And herein his proweſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and dexterity; for when he comes to reſcue his people, he finds them coupled with ſin, cemented as cloſed as the fleſh and bone, joints and marrow, or ſoul and ſpirit; yet, he manages his weapons with
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:009151_0081_10310D0A720EE160"/>
that <hi>maſterly ſkill,</hi> as never to ſtrike a ſtroke in vain; or by an inadvertant ſhot to annoy any of his friends, while he wounds his enemies. He never fails to ſave the ſoul, and deſtroy the ſin. No obſtacle can be ſo difficult as to baffle him; nor ſo intricate as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him; nor any enemy ſo powerful as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, nor ſo ſubtile as to eſcape him.—They that experience the power of his word in their hearts, can witneſs the convincing, humbling, quickening, attracting, transforming, comforting, and eſtabliſhing <hi>power thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>What are the victories, and dominions of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. His right-hand his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.—He hath broken the gates of braſs, and cut the bars of iron in ſunder.—He hath tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed gloriouſly.</hi>—Every thing within the creation of God is ſubjected (or in ſubjection) to his ſovereign diſpoſal; <hi>for he muſt reign, till he hath put all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet.</hi>—He hath bruiſed the ſerpent's head; he hath ſpoiled principalities and powers; he hath ſwallowed up death in victory; he hath trampled on all the power of the enemy; he hath deſtroyed all the works of the devil; he hath taken away the dominion of ſin; he hath <hi>led captivity captive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now he proclaims liberty to the captives, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the priſoners, and deliverance to them that are bound. And all the powers of earth and ſin, death and hell, are not able to detain them; for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> hath gained the victory, and he gives the victory to all his choſen; and cauſeth them to triumph over all enemies, infernal, external, internal, and eternal. And henceforth all his children wear this motto, <hi>More than conquerors, through him that loved us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for his dominion, God the Father hath (without reſerve) <hi>given all things into his hands;</hi> and he rules with deſpotick power over every thing in
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:009151_0082_10310D10EA596A58"/>
heaven, earth, and hell. He holds all his elect in his hand, as jewels in his crown; and all other parts of the creation he holds at his command, in actual readineſs to ſerve his church; and the ſubjects of ſin (who are not willing that he ſhould reign over them) he holds in chains, and makes them his footſtool.—Therefore, there is no inchantment againſt Chriſt, or againſt his children; nor can the gates of hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt his church, or againſt any individual ſoul that flies to the Son of God for <hi>refuge.</hi> For he is absolute sovereign in all the creation of God, and his elect are his <hi>peculiar treasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>What is the age, or duration of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In his divine nature he is <hi>abſolutely eternal;</hi> for <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt—are one. Whoſe name alone is</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, who only hath immortality.</hi>—And the eſſential living God, who is ſelf-exiſtent, independent of all beings, the life and being of all creatures, and in himſelf unchangeable, muſt be without beginning, eternally enjoying himſelf, when neither ſin had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any creature did <hi>exiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his human nature he is <hi>the firſt-born of every creature, ſet up from everlaſting, poſſeſſed of God in the beginning of his way; the beginning of the creation of God.</hi>—Theſe things cannot be ſpoken of his divine nature; whoſe eſſential perfection ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no advancement or progreſſion; nor can be <hi>ſet up,</hi> or <hi>born.</hi> Neither of the open, and actual exiſtence of his human nature; which, ſo conſidered, is really a work of God; whereas Jehovah poſſeſſed him <hi>before his works of old.</hi> But the myſtery of his will, the fellowſhip between the divine and human natures, or the dignity of his human nature, in union with the divine, are here intended. In which capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he was conceived, brought forth, and ſet up, in the infinite mind, and eternal counſel of God; wherein
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:009151_0083_10310D1292F31300"/>
he was beheld in the perfect view of his Father, as his everlaſting delight; being the very original in Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah's grand deſign, and the foundation of all his works; whoſe purpoſes being unchangeable, and his decrees unfruſtrable; he beholds all things imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſent with himſelf; therefore, in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perfection of the divine mind, Chriſt ſtood, prior to all ſin and miſery.—From which unconceivable period or rather eternal duration, he was (in the ſame myſterious deſign) the head of his church; the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place of his people; the inexhauſtible treaſury of grace; the vital fountain thro' whom all bleſſings flow to God's elect; who, being the image and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Godhead, is the center of love; through whom the love of God proceeds; and in whom the Father delights in his children: for it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the human nature of the Son of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was alone, but always ſtands in the eternal word; and all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling in him: neither is his divine nature manifeſted to us alone; but all his <hi>goings forth</hi> are in the woman's ſeed. He, therefore, was the life and glory of his people; and they were his portion and delight; the objects of his unchanging love before they became objects of wrath by ſin.—And foraſmuch as God, in his eternal om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, foreſaw the introduction, progreſs, and dreadful effects of ſin, he did verily foreordain before the foundation of the world, that his beloved Son ſhould ſtand as mediator between God and men; that he ſhould (according to the tenor of his ſuretiſhip) bear and iniquities of his people; that he ſhould be their redeemer, their righteouſneſs, and their eternal ſalvation; <hi>That whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Therefore, the ſalvation of God's elect was ſecure, in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin had ſo much as a <hi>conception.</hi>—And as to his continuance, in his mediatorial office, it is for-ever, unchangeable; or, 'till time ſhall be no more; when
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:009151_0084_10310D141BCA9020"/>
ſin ſhall be extinct; and his whole church ſhall be preſented, in the perfection of the Son of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, without blemiſh, in the preſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's glory: and, from thenceforth, he ſhall ſhine in his <hi>eſſential glory;</hi> and his church, ſhall ſhine in his <hi>communicated glory;</hi> and he ſhall reign with his ſaints, and they with him, <hi>world without end.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <div n="4" type="answer">
               <head>The fourth part of the queſtion anſwered; or the reparation made by Chriſt, for the damage done by ſin.</head>
               <p>It appears undeniable, in every deſcription given of the monſter, ſin, that Chriſt is ſuperior to it; and, conſequently, he muſt be able to deſtroy it. And as he is the author and maintainer of the holy law (of which ſin is the tranſgreſſion) he is ſufficient to reſtore the honour of his own law. And as he is not only ſuperior to ſin, but to every created being; and the eſſence of every creature ſubſiſts in himſelf; he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is able to diſtinguiſh, and divide, between the nature, and the putrefaction of the creature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is undeniably ſufficient, with reſpect to his own perfection, to extinguiſh all the miſchief done by ſin. The only remaining enquiry is, <hi>Whether he has done, or certainly undertaken to do it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath done the greateſt honour to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law, in regard to its authority; in that he, who is the Holy One of God, became ſubject to it: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized the law in all its holy commandments; and he himſelf is become guarantee, to ſee due honour done to all the precepts of it.—And he hath engaged to bring to all his people in proper ſubjection to it. For, tho' the word ſays, to believers, <hi>Ye are not under the law;</hi> the meaning cannot be, <hi>Ye are not under the obligation of it;</hi> but, <hi>Ye are not under it as a legal covenant.</hi> For all the children of God are under the law, as creatures, but not under it, as believers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt has made atonement for their ſin. So
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:009151_0085_10310D174C1AE468"/>
long as they remain creatures of God; they muſt be under his law, conſidered <hi>ſimply as a law</hi> but <hi>not as a broken law,</hi> ſince Chriſt has fulfilled it for them. They are under the <hi>commandment,</hi> but not under the <hi>curſe;</hi> for Chriſt has redeemed them from it. They are under its <hi>direction,</hi> but not under a <hi>ſpirit of bondage;</hi> for Chriſt has made them free. So then, it is only thoſe concomitants of the law, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſin, which the ſaints are not under; nor it is poſſible they ſhould be under them, conſidered as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Jeſus; for ſin being taken away by Chriſt, there is nothing for the condemnatory part to take place upon. But, whatſoever is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the law itſelf, the heaven-born ſoul is under; and it is his delight ſo to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath rendered ample obedience to the whole law: his whole life was perfectly conformable to every command and precept of it; he alſo yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience unto death, ſubjected himſelf to the curſe, and ſuffered all the penalties that the ſins of his people did deſerve, or the juſt law did require.—And he hath likewiſe undertaken to bring all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a practical obedience to the holy law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt hath always retained the righteouſneſs of the law in his heart; his mind did never deviate from it; nor did any pollution ever enter his ſoul; but his whole nature perpetually remains an unmoleſted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of God's holy law.—And he hath engaged to put it in the hearts of his children, and to write it in their minds; and ſo to impreſs it upon their ſouls, that it ſhall abide forever. And it is the experience of God's choſen, that, by his grace, their wills are wrought into a holy conformity to the will of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt hath honoured and magnified the law to the higheſt degree that is poſſible for its glory to be advance: for, whatſoever was its proper due, from creatures, has been fully rendered unto it, by him
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:009151_0086_10310D1DCC7D8E38"/>
that made all creatures.—His nature is a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the perfection of its holineſs; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the law is a repreſentation of the holineſs of his nature. His life was one continued courſe of ample conformity to all its requirements; his death was a compleat ſurrender of himſelf to its juſt ſeverity; his exalted ſtation, before the throne of God, as advocate for his people, is a continued vindication of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of the law; inaſmuch as it is his own perfect ſatisfaction, made to the law, which he there pleads as the juſtifying righteouſneſs of his people. And, when he comes in his glory, at the great day, it will be to diſplay the enſigns of the glory of the righteous law, by which he will judge the world.—And, in honour of this righteous Governor of the creation, Chriſt (by his ſpecial grace in the hearts of his children) renews and purifies them, and makes them love, deſire, and rejoice in the holy law, with all their ſouls; and to delight in the excellencies thereof, more than in any thing they can enjoy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, or deſire, below the ſun: and they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to delight therein, for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Thus the honour, glory, and dignity, of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſyſtem of rectitude, the divine law, does, and will ſhine much more conſpicuous, through Chriſt, than if it had never been violated by ſin.</p>
               <p>And concerning the loſs ſuſtained, and ruin bro't upon mankind by ſin,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt reſtores, to his elect, perfect purity, and uprightneſs; and will perform his work in them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he has compleatly made them free from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pollution, irregularity, or depravity whatſoever; and will ſo perfectly <hi>finiſh his work,</hi> that they ſhall ſtand compleat in holineſs; adequate to the ultimate perfection of the holy law, and <hi>without fault</hi> before God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:009151_0087_10310D1F786C03F8"/>2. Chriſt ſhall bring all his children to bear his own image; not only his image of moral rectitude, but his image of heavenly glory; and crown them with glory and honour; not only in ſetting them over the works of his hands, in this lower world, but in making them kings, and prieſts, unto God: and ſhall make them the moſt excellent of all beings; not only to exceed all things in this world, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all the glory of the angelick hoſts, and all the dignities in the regions of light.—Thus the ſaints ſhall be raiſed to a dignity, far more excellent than what man poſſeſſed <hi>before his fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is ſet at God's right-hand, ſupreme Lord and Governor of all things; not only in this world, but in the world to come. And whatſoever has an exiſtence in the creation of God, is made ſubject to him. And the glory which Chriſt himſelf is poſſeſſed of, he gives to his church; and they ſhall reign toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him. For he makes them victorious over all their enemies; and every thing whereby they have been led captive, ſhall be led captive by them: through <hi>his Spirit,</hi> they mortify their corrupt paſſions; through <hi>the faith of Jeſus,</hi> they overcome the world; and, by <hi>the blood of the Lamb,</hi> they vanguiſh the prince of darkneſs. And, when the Captain of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhall have compleated his conqueſts, for them, and in them, they ſhall ſit with him, as joint-heirs in his throne, and his crown ſhall flouriſh on their heads for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt is the great deliverer, who ſets his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren free from every evil, and every plague: for he took upon himſelf their ſins, and their ſorrows; and in his own ſoul, and body, he finally bare them away from all his people. The effect whereof, will iſſue in their perfect freedom, from every grief, bondage, or incommodity whatſoever; and the ſalvation ſhall be eternal. Their ſouls ſhall be perfect in light;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:009151_0088_10310D2107904B68"/>
their bodies ſhall be incorruptible; and whatſoever they are, do, or enjoy, ſhall be <hi>perpetual delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is the alone center, and repoſitory of all good, not only natural, but ſpiritual, and eternal; and all the plenitude of bleſſedneſs dwells in him, in the higheſt perfection; and through vital union with him, and ſpiritual communications from him, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are enriched with more exalted natures, and more enlarged capacities, than what the human nature was poſſeſſed of, before the fall. And for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, he will appoint to them a kingdom, replete with all rich bleſſings, and abundantly ſtored with every good thing; which their more elevated natures can poſſibly enjoy, or deſire. And theſe new enjoyments ſhall be free from all corruption; and all his ſaints ſhall regale themſelves therein, to the <hi>days of eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt has already removed ſin, in its condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power, from all his elect, by the blood of his croſs; and, from all his called he has taken away ſin, in its reinging power, by regeneration; and, in all the regenerate, he ceaſes not to purſue the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, in its defiling power, by the ſanctification of the Spirit; and, in all the ſanctified, he will put a final period to ſin, in all its appearances and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, at his ſecond coming.—All guilt, fear, and ſhame, are the effects of ſin; and muſt neceſſarily ceaſe, when the cauſe is taken away: therefore, the diſciples of the Lord have boldneſs now, before the throne of grace; they have courage to confeſs his name, before all adverſaries; and ſhall boldly ſtand before God, in the day of judgment: nothing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, earth, or hell, can confound their countenances, nor diſmay their hearts, for <hi>Jeſus is their confidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Chriſt is the man of God's right-hand, his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, his delight, his equal, and his counſellor. He alſo is head over all things to this church; the husband,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:009151_0089_103109E9884B8518"/>
the portion, the life, and glory of his choſen. The union between him and his Father, is ſo abſolute, and indiviſible, that he muſt inherit all his Father's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and glories; and the relation between him and his people, is ſo cloſe, and inſeparable, that they muſt partake of all his fulneſs and enjoyments. Therefore, in the Lord Jeſus, they are made nigh to God; he dwells among them, and they dwell in his preſence; all diſtances are removed; all interpoſing clouds are diſperſed; and they enjoy ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with JEHOVAH. Yea, he is their God, and their Father; and nothing can be able to ſeperate them from his love; but they ſhall dwell in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for evermore.</p>
               <p>Thus, through the infinite fulneſs of divine grace, and the mediatorial performances of EMMANUEL, there is a total extirpation of ſin. Wrath is no more; death is vanguiſhed; miſery hath no place; for there is no more curſe.—The honour of the divine law is amply reſtored, and abundantly magnified, and eſtablished, in all its rights; with the utmoſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, glory, dignity, and authority.—All that believe in Jeſus, ſhall poſſeſs a far richer inheritance, than <hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradiſe: their relation to God is more near; their natures more dignified; their faculties more enlarged; their knowledge more extenſive; their view of God's glory more clear; their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God more abundant; and their ſtanding more ſecure.—And they ſhall breathe in the pure air of divine love; regale themſelves in the glories of everlaſting light; and bathe in the uninterrupted ſtreams of immortality, which proceed <hi>out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.</hi>—And ſongs of adoration, joy, and triumph, ſhall ſound from all the church, and reſound through all the celeſtial domes, to the INFINITIE, ETERNAL, THREE-ONE, <hi>world without end.</hi> Amen.</p>
