            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Break forth into Joy, ſing together ye waſte Places of Jeruſalem; for the Lord hath comforted his People: He hath redeemed Jeruſalem: The Lord hath made bare his holy Arm in the Eyes of all Nations, and all the Ends of the Earth ſhall ſee the Salvation of our God.</p>

            <p>GREAT and incomprehenſible is Jehovah the ſovereign of heaven and earth; his greatneſs is unſearchable, nor can the brighteſt Seraph in his preſence declare the full extent of his wiſdom, power and goodneſs. Yet part of his ways are made known to us both in his word and in his works: He hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the moral perfections of his nature from the moment he firſt ſpake into being moral creatures, whether angels or men, down to the preſent day. The divine diſpenſations towards the angelic hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, thoſe ſublimer ſpirits who miniſtered before the throne of God, declare the glorious excellence and infinite perfection of their ſupreme Lord: Some indeed are the awful monuments of divine juſtice and omnipotence, being, for their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, "reſerved in chains under darkneſs unto the judgment of the great day;" others in loud acclamations of praiſe aſcribe righeouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009403_0004_0F7403C348084640"/>
the Lord, "and cry one to another, ſaying, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty."</p>
            <p>But we are more acquainted with the divine diſpenſations towards the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and much more intereſted in the diſcoveries which God has made of his being and perfections in relation to the human, than the angelic nature. When we reflect on the divine memoirs as they reſpect our ſinful race, what abundant reaſon have we to break forth into joy, and ſing anthems of praiſe to him who hath viſited us with his mercy, after we had ſhamefully violated the moſt ſacred engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, broke his covenant, and juſtly might have been caſt off forever! All praiſe to him who laid the great plan of our redemption, and gave early intimations of his grace, and promiſed the deliverer in the very ſentence he pronounced on our arch foe: All praiſe to <hi>him</hi> who has made all things ſubſerve this moſt gracious deſign, in which every moral perfection of the deity is illuſtrated; and none can ſay whether his juſtice or his mercy, his holineſs or his love ſhine with more diſtinguiſhed luſtre. All praiſe to <hi>him</hi> who has planned and executed this gracious method in a manner every way uniform and conſiſtent, that all the parts which have been diſcloſed in the reſpective periods of the church, coincide to the grand purpoſe, and form one beautiful <hi>whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Known unto the Lord are all his works from the beginning, he hath directed the whole to promote the honour of his great name and the welfare of his church, in a manner which ſpeaks his univerſal government, and declares that he is the <hi>moſt high</hi> over all the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009403_0005_0F7403C3F9991630"/>Thus, his diſpenſations to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to illuſtrate the honors of his name, being abundant proof of his ſupreme authority, of the holineſs of his law, and the gracious purpoſes of his love: As the jewiſh polity was deſigned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit lively repreſentations of the divine purpoſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people; ſo the moſt material and leading diſpenſations in their government were typical of events which have their fulleſt accompliſhment in the goſpel church. While the prophets, therefore, addreſſed the Iſraelites in the name of the Lord, whether in the way of admonition or conſolation, their language was abundantly ſignificant, and well adapted to throw ſome light on the grand plan of divine grace which reſpects not the jews only, but the gentiles alſo, even the true church of Chriſt in all ages.</p>
            <p>Thus emblematical was the moral and political ſtate of the Jews. Their being carried captive into Babylon and God's dealings with them there, their reſettlement in their own land again, and the whole ſeries of divine providence towards them, down to the incarnation of the Meſſiah were all full of inſtruction; ſo that while the prophets ſpake on theſe topicks, they were often tranſported into far diſtant times, and diſcribed the important characters and offices of Chriſt, and the ſtate of the goſpel Church.</p>
            <p>Accordingly while Iſaiah, the great evangelical prophet of the jewiſh diſpenſation, was ſpeaking of the ſignal deliverance of Iſrael from the land of their captivity, and their reſettling in the land of Judea, he is moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to ſpeak of the great <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s kingdom, and of that joy and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009403_0006_0F7403C599CFA698"/>
gladneſs which his goſpel ſhall inſpire, when it ſhall be ſpread thro' the world, and the ends of the earth ſee <hi>his</hi> ſalvation. This divine Saviour is the <hi>comforter</hi> and <hi>redeemer</hi> of his people. He has, in an emphatic ſenſe, peculiar to himſelf, aſſumed this amiable character; and his works evince that he has a juſt right to it. For this purpoſe he hath made bare his holy arm from age to age, while he has maintained the cauſe of his church, and made the ends of the earth ſee his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Were we to trace the hiſtory of his church from <hi>Adam</hi> to the preſent time, we ſhould find the viſible footſteps of this divine Saviour, thro' the whole, and a moſt happy coincidence with the promiſes and propheſies relating to him on ſacred record.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the paſſage before us leads us to conſider the words as they had reference,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To the great ſalvation wrought for the Jews when they were redeemed from their babyloniſh captivity, and put into the full enjoyment of their invaluable liberties under <hi>Jehovah</hi> their king.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As particularly pointing out the great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wrought by Chriſt, and the joy of the goſpel church.</p>
            <p>We ſhall view them,</p>
            <p n="3">III. As accommodated to the remarkable interpoſitions of God's holy providence in favour of the Proteſtant church, in it's riſe and progreſs down to the preſent day. Particularly in the late war.</p>
            <p>We are to conſider the words,</p>
            <p n="1">I. As they deſcribe the great ſalvation wrought for the <hi>Jews</hi> when they were redeemed from the babyloniſh captivity, and put into the full enjoyment
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009403_0007_0F7403C63822D1B0"/>
of their invaluable liberties under <hi>Jehovah</hi> their King.</p>
            <p>The prophet Iſaiah foretold the captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> for their idolatry and rebellion againſt God; he likewiſe predicted their reſtoration, after they ſhould be humbled in the land of their diſtreſs. As the threatning took place upon them, and their land was laid waſte 70 years; ſo the promiſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, received a punctual accompliſhment. For at the end of 70 years the decree went forth under the hand of the great <hi>Perſian</hi> monarch, to releaſe the jewiſh captives and rebuild Jeruſalem. "Thus ſaith <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him an houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is in <hi>Judah:</hi> Who is there among you, of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jeruſalem which is in <hi>Judah,</hi> and build the houſe of the Lord God of Iſrael (he is the God) which is in Jeruſalem: And whoſoever remaineth in any place where he ſojourneth let the men of his place help him with ſilver and with gold and with goods." To this important event the words of my text primarily refered. <hi>Then</hi> Zion's waſte places rejoyced, becauſe they were ſurprizingly repleniſhed and greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. Thoſe parts of Jeruſalem which had been forſaken and appeared moſt deſolate, "broke forth into joy and ſang together." For God "turned again the captivity of Judah as the ſtreams in the ſouth. They repented of their idolatry and God forgave them their tranſgreſſions: he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred them in the land where they were led captive and delivered them from their oppreſſors. He
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009403_0008_0F7403C9E7C98C00"/>
made thoſe who had led them captives, help them with their ſubſtance in their journey to Jeruſalem, in rebuilding the walls of the city, and the houſe of the Lord. "They had ſold themſelves by their tranſgreſſions, and the Lord redeemed them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money." He inriched them with the treaſures of the <hi>Perſian court,</hi> owned them his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rebuked princes for their ſake. He planted them in Jeruſalem, and made them once more a flouriſhing ſtate, a reſpectable nation. He comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with his preſence and promiſes: He re-inſtated them in the free enjoyment of their religious as well as civil priviledges which were granted them as the ſeed of Abraham, the children of the covenant, and in a peculiar ſenſe ſubjects under Jehovah their king. The hiſtory of theſe things we have particularly related in the books of Ezra, Nehemiah and the leſſer prophets, who were ſent to incourage the Jews in rebuilding the temple, &amp;c. and to declare unto them the word of God unto the coming of Chriſt. And thus God was both the <hi>ſaviour</hi> and <hi>comforter</hi> of his people.</p>
            <p>In accompliſhing this great ſalvation for the jewiſh church, the holy arm of the Lord was made <hi>bare</hi> in the eyes of all nations. For, beyond all diſpute it was his arm, his uncontroled influence over princes, and his univerſal providence in the government of the world which effected all for Judah, and wrought this great ſalvation for his inheritance; could they aſcribe any thing to their own power or policy with regard to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable event? Alas! they were broken and ſcatter'd thro' the whole Perſian monarchy, and were a people hated of all nations. They were on
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009403_0009_0F7403CA51C748E8"/>
the brink of total ruin, in the days of <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> But God prevented the fatal blow. (This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you have, at large in the book of Eſther.) As they were weak and contemptible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were likewiſe without all hope from other nations. They had no powerful <hi>Ally</hi> to riſe up, eſpouſe their cauſe, and compel their conquerors to reſign their conqueſts and captives. Nay, ſo very far from that, the nations around them laughed at their calamity, and ſhook their head's in ſcorn, deriding the <hi>ſeed of Abraham</hi> under the awful rebuke of the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> ſaying, <hi>ha, ha,</hi> ſo would we have it. When the Princes of Judah were rebuilding Jeruſalem and the temple, the neighbouring nations united their power and policy to hinder the work, and prevent Judah from being any more a diſtinct body. But, behold the arm of the Lord is revealed, blaſting all the deſigns of Sanballat and Tobiah, and carrying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this great work by a ſeries of remarkable providences, which abundantly demonſtrated his ſupreme government and peculiar care of his church: He turned the heart of Cyrus and Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus as the rivers of water are turned, and made them nurſing fathers unto his Jewiſh church; he removed obſticles inſuperable to all human power, and ſpake to his people in this comfortable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. "Not by might nor by power; but by my ſpirit ſaith the Lord of hoſts: Who art thou O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou ſhalt become a plain, and he ſhall bring forth the head ſtone with ſhouting, crying, <hi>grace, grace</hi> unto it:" Iſrael and all the nations around were taught thus to aſcribe the reſtoration of Judah, the rebulding of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009403_0010_0F7403CBC12409B8"/>
Jeruſalem and the temple, to the power and grace of the moſt high: Thus he redeemed Jeruſalem, comforted his people, revealed the arm of his power and grace in the eyes of all nations, and the ends of the earth then ſaw his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But all this was emblematical of a far more important event, in which divine power and grace have illumined the world, and ſhone with the benign beams of ſalvation unto the ends of the earth: We accordingly propoſed to conſider the words,</p>
            <p n="2">II. As pointing to the great ſalvation wrought by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the joy of the goſpel-church. That this is no forced conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſſage before us, but agreeable to the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt, is evident from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the whole paſſage is refered to, in the New-Teſtament: The introduction to the text in hand, is quoted by St. Paul and applied to goſpel times: And truly it is admirably adapted to expreſs the glad tidings of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publiſheth ſalvation, that ſaith unto Zion thy God reigneth"! How joyful is the voice of him, that declareth this meſſage to a loſt world, that the deliverer is come out of Zion,..... that he is come a "<hi>light</hi> unto the Gentiles and the glory of his people Iſrael"— that he is come not to condemn the world; but that the world thro' him might be ſaved?" In what loud acclamations of praiſe ſhould a ſinful world, expoſed to unutterable and everlaſting puniſhment, welcome this divine Saviour, and the tidings of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009403_0011_0F7403CC47A8C120"/>
peace which his goſpel proclaims? Surely, they ſhould brake forth into joy, they ſhould ſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in conſort with the angelic choir, "Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men." To this moſt joyful event the whole jewiſh oeconomy had a very material and principal reference. Indeed ſo great is this goſpel ſalvation, that the deliverance of the Jews from their captive ſtate, was but an imperfect emblem of the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. The meſſengers ſent expreſs by Cyrus to publiſh the gracious edict, and proclaim his royal favor, were not ſo welcome to Jews inſlaved in a ſtrange land, as the meſſengers of the goſpel, and the gracious deſigns of the <hi>Lord Jehovah</hi> to ſuch as have any proper ſenſe of their moral ſtate.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>The caſe of the Iſraelites in Babylon did but imperfectly repreſent the deplorable ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind led captive by their own luſts and the prince of darkneſs: Jeruſalem all in ruins was a <hi>faint</hi> emblem of the ruin which ſin had introduced into the world; and the bad ſtate of the jewiſh polity, while the whole head was ſick, and the whole heart faint, was but a weak repreſentation of the moral ſtate of the world. For, all had rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt their rightful ſovereign, broke covenant with God, and incurred the penalty of his holy law: all had ſinned, and were cut off from all reaſonable hopes of juſtification by the deeds of the law. All were concluded under ſin, both the natural and judicial conſequence whereof were <hi>darkneſs, diſpair,</hi> and <hi>death</hi>: Thus all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had deſtroyed themſelves; but in Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009403_0012_0F7403CD0F469948"/>
was their help: When there was no eye to pity, no human or angelic arm that could ſave, the Lord pitied, and his omnipotent arm wrought ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Our help was laid on one mighty to ſave, who was revealed firſt, in promiſes and propheſies, in types and figures under the jewiſh ritual. But when the fulneſs of time was come, he appeared in our nature—fulfiled all righteouſneſs—confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his divine miſſion by a ſeries of miracles— taught the way of God in truth; and made his ſoul an offering for ſin: For "he was wounded for our tranſgreſſion, and bruiſed for iniquities, the chaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſment of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed." "He once ſuffered for ſins the juſt for the unjuſt that he might bring us unto God." And as he was delivered unto death for our offences, ſo he roſe again for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and aſcended into the higheſt heavens as our advocate and interceſſor. God has accepted this ſatisfaction, and peace is preached in his name: All that believe "obtain redemption thro' his blood even the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified." Thus the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord Jeſus hath redeemed his people. He hath paid the full price of their redemption— wrought out perfect righteouſneſs, and prepared the way for their reſtoration to the divine favour. He has likewiſe purchaſed for them the renewing and ſanctifying influence of the holy ſpirit. He is the glorious head of divine influence, and of his fulneſs they receive, and grace for grace. In a word, "he is made of God unto them that believe, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." Thus he has made bare his holy arm, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009403_0013_0F7403CDC439A270"/>
ſaves his true Iſrael from their ſins, and from wrath to come.</p>
            <p>He not only redeems, but <hi>comforts</hi> his people; and this is one of thoſe amiable characters under which he is repreſented in the text. Nor is it among the leaſt of the glories of his goſpel that it is calculated to miniſter the moſt rational <hi>conſolation,</hi> where conſolation was moſt wanted;—that it throws the full blaze of day on a ſubject which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was either totally hid, or at beſt, ſeen only in the faint gleam of imperfect light: For "life and immortality are brought to light by the goſpel:" "and God in Chriſt is evidently reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing unto men their treſpaſſes." So that with the ſtricteſt propriety, our gracious Saviour may be ſtiled the comforter of his people.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the great <hi>Immanuel</hi> open'd his public commiſſion, by applying to himſelf thoſe very memorable words in the 61ſt of Iſaiah: Jehovah anointed <hi>him</hi> to preach good tidings unto the meek,—he was ſent to bind up the broken hearted......to proclaim liberty to the captives.....and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound— to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord—to comfort all that mourn ...... to give unto them the oyl of joy for mourning. What matter of infinite joy and conſolation is it to a ſoul under a deep ſenſe of ſin, to hear that there is pardon purchaſed for ſins of the deepeſt dye!.....that the everlaſting Father is well pleaſed with the mediatorial character of his Son our Saviour...... that he has accepted his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and ſufferings; that Chriſt is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins, and "the end of the law for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009403_0014_0F7403CE861C9728"/>
righteouſneſs unto every one that believes!" O how welcome to a ſelf-judging, ſelf-condemned ſinner, muſt be the pure goſpel of Jeſus, removing at once all diſtinctions among ſinners in point of juſtification, and aſſuring that the blood of Jeſus cleanſes from all iniquity,.......that God juſtifies the ungodly merely on account of the perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed to all ſuch as believe—that Jeſus Chriſt is paſſed into the heavens, a great high prieſt, and is indeed "able to ſave unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all them that come unto God by him!" Truly theſe "are glad tidings of great joy," with which our gracious Lord is comforting his people.</p>
            <p>But with theſe muſt neceſſarily be connected, the promiſe of the holy ſpirit to impreſs on the mind the <hi>truth</hi> and infinite <hi>importance</hi> of theſe doctrines,...... to renew and transform the ſoul and to "unite us to Chriſt in our effectual calling." How comfortable, how joyful then, muſt be the goſpel of Chriſt to ſuch as are properly convinced of their impotence, as well as their guilt! To hear that he is the Lord our <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as well as our righteouſneſs,.......that "he is exalted to God's right hand to give repentance and the remiſſion of ſins"— that whoſoever cometh unto him is drawn of the Father, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> VI, 44,—</note> and ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out. <note n="‡" place="bottom">37.</note>....... That if men being evil, know how to give good gifts to their children, much more will our Father in heaven give the holy ghoſt to ſuch as aſk;...... "aſk and ye ſhall receive, ſeek and ye ſhall find, &amp;c." "Behold I will pour out my ſpirit upon you, and I will be your God and ye ſhall be my people." Surely, here is all the incouragement, we can
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009403_0015_0F7403D03A8648D8"/>
reaſonable deſire; and ſuch paſſages rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, muſt preſerve the ſoul from ſinking into diſpair under a ſenſe of it's moral impotence. They are powerful motives to human <hi>endeavors,</hi> while at the ſame time, they teach us that, "all our ſufficiency is of God."</p>
            <p>Thus the goſpel of Chriſt is indeed matter of great joy to a guilty helpleſs world, as it points us to one, whoſe perfect righteouſneſs juſtifies, whoſe powerful ſpirit ſanctifies..... Who has fully atoned for our ſins, and "Works in us both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> of his own good pleaſure."</p>
            <p>Moreover, he comforts his people with his gracious preſence and the conſolations of his holy ſpirit. He is with them not only as his image is portray'd on their ſouls, and his word committed unto them; but alſo by the ſpecial comforting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his ſpirit. When we are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by his ſpirit, and have entered upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life, we are received into the family of Chriſt, are children of the <hi>Moſt-High,</hi> and co-heirs with Chriſt Jeſus unto an eternal inheritance: We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the earneſt of this inheritance in the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and comforting influence of the ſpirit: "And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying <hi>Abba Father</hi>:" By this divine ſpirit believers are ſealed unto the day of more perfect redemption. By <hi>this,</hi> they are not only formed to a divine temper, but aſſiſted in the trial of their ſtate by the word, and enabled to apply the exceeding great and precious promiſes of the goſpel to their own ſouls; and ſo are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthened and eſtabliſhed thro' the word. By the preſence and ſpirit of Chriſt they are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009403_0016_0F7403D0B876DD50"/>
in all their conflicts with their ſpiritual enemies, and "endure <hi>hardneſs</hi> as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt;" for he hath ſaid, "I will never leave thee nor forſake thee": through Chriſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them they can do all things.</p>
            <p>In fine, he comforts all true believers, with the ſure hopes of eternal glory. For he is riſen from the dead in our nature and aſcended into the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world as our <hi>fore-runner.</hi> And it is his will that where he is there his faithful ſervants ſhall be alſo. He is at the right hand of God to diſcover unto us the heavenly glory, to convince us of the reality of the inviſible ſtate, and to attach us to that ſpiritual world. He roſe from the dead and aſcended into heaven, that he might ſupport our hopes, and conſole us while we are walking thro' the valley of the ſhadow of death; and inſpire us with the joyful hope of a glorious immortality: For we are to conſider <hi>his</hi> reſurrection as a pledge of our reſurrection, and the glory which he has received as a bright example of that glory, with which he will crown all his faithful ſubjects in his Kingdom above. For his gracious language is, "be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a crown of life;" and "to him that overcometh will I grant to ſet with me in my throne, even as I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſet down with my Father in his throne."</p>
            <p>Thus the words may be conſidered as pointing to the great ſalvation wrought by Chriſt Jeſus, and the gracious manner in which he redeems and comforts his people.</p>
            <p>They may likewiſe be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="3">III. As accommodated to the remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitions of divine providence in favour of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009403_0017_0F7403D3E3B9B4C8"/>
proteſtant church, in its riſe and prgreſs down to the preſent day, and particularly in the late <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among all the remarkable events ſince the commencement of the chriſtian <hi>Aera,</hi> ſuch as have had reſpect to the proteſtant church are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. The great governor of the world, and ſaviour of his church, has marvellouſly diſplayed his holy arm in the eyes of all nations, in ſpreading proteſtant principles and carrying forward a great work of <hi>reformation,</hi> in ſo many ſtates and nations at once, with ſuch ſurpriſing rapidity, contrary to all human probabilities; and then, in defending the proteſtant church, when it has been threatned from every quarter, with immediate and total deſtruction.</p>
            <p>To give a particular detail of all the remarkable diſplays of divine power and grace on this ſubject, would far exceed the limits of a ſermon, and ſoon ſwell into volumes of church hiſtory. <note n="§" place="bottom">As ſome of the following hiſtorical hintsly ſcattered in large tracts of political and church hiſtory, not lately in the author's power to peruſe, it is hoped the candid reader will excuſe their not being more accurately and circumſtantially related.</note> I muſt only hint a few, which ought never to be forgot, and ſhould, on every remembrance of them, excite our gratitude to him, who has called his church from myſtical Babylon....delivered his choſen, from the chains of <hi>Rome</hi> ..... inlightned and comforted his people with the uncorrupted word of life, and defended them, from age to age, with the protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arm of his univerſal providence.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the ſtate of the chriſtian world under the great papal apoſtaſy,....the general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption both in doctrine and manners, which ſpread thro' all orders, and ranks of men,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009403_0018_0F7403D53A532700"/>
in all nations and kingdoms which bore the name of chriſtian.....the dark abyſs of ignorance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in which all were immerged.....the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited influence of the great roman <hi>pontiff,.</hi>...the pernicious blending of the civil and eccleſiaſtical <hi>polity,.</hi>..the immenſe treaſures of the papal clergy... if we add to all theſe, the genius of their religion, adorned with all external pomp and magnificence, ſuitable to ſtrike the ſenſes with peculiar energy, and flatter all the falſe hopes of a corrupt heart, ſurely we ſhall obſerve no human probability could preſage a reformation: But "all things are poſſible with God." He poured out his ſpirit on thoſe whom he had ordained inſtruments in his hand of effecting a glorious <hi>reformation:</hi> He raiſed up, qualified and ſpirited <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> and others, to caſt off the papal yoke under which all Europe was at that time, ſubjugated,....to declare the pure goſpel of Jeſus, and to aſſert the liberty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers enjoy in Chriſt their only Lord.</p>
            <p>The firſt reformers were, both defended from the rage of their enemies, and ſucceeded in a manner truly wonderful. So that the period from 1560, to 1650, is filled with accounts little ſhort of miraculous, in which a worthy author obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Dodderidge on Rev.</note> it is more than probable that the "fifth angel poured out his viol on the ſeat of the beaſt, and his Kingdom was full of darkneſs, and they gnawed their tongues for anguiſh." During this period ſeveral nations renounced ſubjection to the Pope, and have continued free unto this day; and in other nations his power has been greatly abridged and reſtrained. This appears more remarkable by conſidering, how numerous and formidable were the enemies of proteſtants in the infancy of the reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:009403_0019_0F7403D604034C48"/>For,</p>
            <p>The Pope claimed authority over all chriſtian princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this authority had long been ceeded to him by univerſal conſent. By this means, he had the moſt powerful nations under his dictatorial influence, and wholly at his command. Nor did he fail to make uſe of this uſurped authority over all catholic princes, to extirpate <hi>this new hereſy,</hi> (as he was pleaſed to term the <hi>pure religion</hi> of the goſpel.) When the britiſh monarchs dared to aſſert the independant rights of their crown, and throw off their ſubjection to his pretended holineſs, that great deceiver arrogated to himſelf the right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning princes, and of releaſing ſubjects from all allegiance to their rightful ſovereigns. Accordingly after thundering out his <hi>anathema</hi>'s againſt thoſe powers who refuſed obedience to his bulls, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and commanded thoſe deluded princes, whom he ſtill retained under his influence, to unite all their endeavors to carry his anathemas into effect. (But, the curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come,) "he that ſets in the heavens laughed, the Lord had them in deriſion." He made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all theſe nations; he appointed his ſalvation around his church, and <hi>proteſtants</hi> were daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing. Again,</p>
            <p>Do we conſider the many <hi>perſecutions</hi> which have been carried on, with infernal rage by catholic princes in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> ſurely, in a view of the ſword, the gibbet, the halter, the ſtake, and all the dreadful <hi>apparatus</hi> of tortures and deaths in a thouſand other forms, the higheſt probability ſuggeſts that theſe will put a final ſtop to the progreſs of the reformation, and the very name of proteſtants ceaſe from the earth.

But behold and adore the wiſdom and ſtrength of his holy arm, who can fruſtrate all human proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and bring to nought the deepeſt deſigns of the wicked! He ſupported thoſe holy martyrs. ... He gave them a mouth which none of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries could gainſay...He inſpired them with true chriſtian <hi>Heroiſm,</hi> while they made one intire ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of all things on this ſide of eternity to the honour of Chriſt and the great cauſe of truth: The eye of their faith too keenly penertrated the thin veil which ſeperates time from eternity, to ſuffer them to tremble at the impotent wrath of mortals; and their hopes were too precious to be reſigned in exchange for a momentary life: They indured all the agonies of death as "ſeeing him who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible," not accepting deliverance on ſo diſhonorable terms as might in the leaſt be conſtrued into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation of their proteſtant principles. Thus the ſcaffold and ſtake were conſecrated to the ſervice of the true church, and the martyr's, (Sampſon-like,) were honored with more ſucceſs againſt the enemies of Chriſt and his true church, at their death than in their life; while the very means which were deſigned by <hi>antichriſt,</hi> to ſuppreſs the proteſtant faith were over-ruled for the greater increaſe and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Hence it became a proverbal ſaying that the "blood of the <hi>martyrs</hi> was the feed of the church." The church like the ſacred <hi>buſh</hi> of old, has been long burning, yet not conſumed. The proteſtant cauſe has been ſupported under every diſadvantage; and many at this day, in thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting nations embrace the proteſtant faith, riſqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that this world calls good and great. The power of the <hi>beaſt</hi> has been viſibly declining for more than two centrys, while the ſtone which is

cut out of the mount without hands, has been prevailing, and there have been many remarkable overtures in theſe foreign nations in favour of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s kingdom.</p>
            <p>Or, ſhall we conſider the diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards our own nation, which as it has long been the grand <hi>Bulwork,</hi> and principal <hi>ſupport,</hi> under Chriſt, of the proteſtant church, has been the principal object on which the enemies of Chriſt and his church have endeavored to take a final revenge? <note n="§" place="bottom">About the Year 1758.</note> Witneſs the catholic league, as it was called, in the reign of Elizabeth: many roman catholic princes had formed the execrable deſign of exterpating the proteſtant church, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Britain to the obedience of Rome. To this purpoſe they leagued together,....and many attempts were made to dethrone queen Elizabeth, and to place on the Britiſh throne the queen of the Scotts who was a bigoted papiſt. "Accordingly towards the cloſe of the ſixteenth centry, the king of Spain prepared the greateſt fleet the world had ever ſeen, which was impiouſly called the <hi>invincible armada.</hi>" This fleet put to ſea, and actually moored in the britiſh channel. Then britiſh liberties and the proteſtant church were (to human apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) on the very confines of total deſtruction: This fleet came equipped with all the dire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of torture and death; and England was to have no other alternative, than <hi>death</hi> or the <hi>papal yoke</hi>: But God made bare his holy arm, and in a moſt remarkable manner diſapointed their deſigns; <note n="‡" place="bottom">This grand Event is circumſtantially related in the <hi>Naval</hi> Hiſtory of Great-Britain: vide Vol. I.

While England ſung an anthem in language like that in the 46th Pſalm, "God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble: therefore will we not fear, tho' the earth be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and tho' the mountains be carried into the midſt of the ſea, tho' the waters thereof rore and be troubled, tho' the mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof....Come behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made in the earth... The Lord of hoſts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge."</p>
            <p>But we have not been in danger only from foreign enemies and combined princes abroad; .... Alas! my brethren, we have ſometimes been a kingdom divided againſt it's ſelf, and Britain's <hi>monarch</hi>'s have not always been Britain's friends. Time would fail me to recount the ſteps which have been taken by ſuch as have been in power, to ſap the foundation of our religious liberties, and cruſh the proteſtant faith. The britiſh throne has ſometimes been filled, either with profeſſed <hi>catholicks,</hi> or with ſuch as have been ſhamefully under the influence of catholic courts. Can we ſay, that the britiſh throne has never been ſtained with the blood of proteſtant martyrs? what then mean the annals of perſecuting <hi>Mary,.</hi>..? why did Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field burn with ſuch raging flame? or what occaſion was there for the happy <hi>revolution</hi>?

And when they have been favored with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the prince, they have not failed to acquaint proteſtants, with the perſecuting genius of their religion, and make them feel the force of the fire and the ax, thoſe inhuman arguments by which they indeavor'd to proſylite England to the catholic faith.

all theſe important inſtances God has made bare his holy arm, redeemed his Iſrael, and comforted his proteſtant church.</p>
            <p>But in this review we cannot fail to obſerve the diſpenſations of divine providence towards this country. "We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us what works thou didſt, in their days, in the times of old, how thou didſt drive out the heathen with thy hand, and planteſt them, how thou didſt afflict the people and caſt them out. For they got not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſword, neither did their own arm ſave them; but thy right hand and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a favour unto them." When a cloud was gathering over England and began to diſcharge itſelf upon our father's, <hi>hither</hi> the divine hand of providence led them...<hi>here</hi> they ſought an <hi>aſilum,</hi> and took their abode among ſavage beaſts and more ſavage men.</p>
            <p>They left their dear native country, their pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant habitations, and indured a train of hardſhips, ſcarce credible to their poſterity, that they might worſhip God according to their conſciences, and maintain the proteſtant religion free from thoſe corruptions which the high-church party had introduced at home.</p>
            <p>When we reflect on their deſign, it appears truly noble, becoming the diſciples of Chriſt, who has taught his followers, "to call no man <hi>maſter</hi> on earth," nor to receive for "doctrines the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men;" but when we conſider the difficulties which were oppoſed to this deſign, meer reaſon ſurely repreſents it altogether impracticable.

in a difficult ſeaſon...into a wilderneſs, not deſolute indeed....but far worſe....full of cruel men, void of humanity, ſubtil, inured to want, expert in cruelty, &amp;c. what ſurprizing attempt is this! yet the <hi>moſt High</hi> ſucceded it; he prepared room for this his Britiſh vine, ſwept away thouſands of <hi>Indians</hi> by an epidemical ſickneſs the proceeding year, and overuled thoſe that ſurvived; ſo that many of their tribes aſſiſted the new ſettlement of our fathers, when (humanly ſpeaking) it was in their power to have fruſtated the whole deſign, and cut all off at one blow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then</hi> the pure goſpel of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſaviour viſited this <hi>new world</hi> and the glorious ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs aroſe on theſe benighted ends of the earth: <hi>then</hi> the waſte places of <hi>America</hi> broke forth into joy, "the wilderneſs began to bloſom as a roſe" and "the trees of the foreſt ſang together."</p>
            <p>But theſe tranquil ſcenes ſoon cloſed, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribes combined together, (many of them in open violation of their plighted faith) to make an utter end of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> So few and defenceleſs were our ſettlements at that time; and ſo remote from their mother-country, that human probability devoted them an eaſy prey to their adverſaries: and ſurely our fathers "had faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had they not believed to ſee the ſalvation of the Lord," But the <hi>puiſiant Jehovah</hi> was on their ſide. <q>He taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight;</q> ſo that in them the promiſe made to Iſrael, was almoſt literally verified, viz. that "five ſhall chaſe an hundred, and an hundred put ten thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and to flight." Then the holy arm of the Lord was made bare in the eyes of all theſe <hi>Indian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009403_0026_0F7403DCF3D16950"/>
and the infant church of Chriſt in <hi>America</hi> ſaw the ſalvation of God.</p>
            <p>The righteous ſovereign, in whoſe hand the wicked are often the rod of his anger," has indeed ſuffered the ſavages to ſhed much Engliſh blood, and ſorely ſcourge the Britiſh colonies, even as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> afflicted Iſrael of old; yet HE has greatly reſtrained their rage, deminiſhed their numbers, and enlarged the borders of his church. nor can we reflect without aſtoniſhment on the happy change this land has undergone in the courſe of one centry: the aboriginals have been moſt remarkably declining: they have melted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as ſnow before the ſouthern breaze and ſcorching ſun; while the churches of Chriſt have been greatly increaſing, and are now become nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in theſe teritories of the <hi>Prince</hi> of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The <hi>Lion</hi> of the tribe of Judah has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his ſtrength, and the holy arm of Jeſus has bound "the ſtrong man armed" and ſpoiled him of much of his armory wherein he truſted; ſo that our colonies have long ſince had little to fear, from the unaſſiſted natives.</p>
            <p>But while the Indian tribes were diminiſhing, a more dangerous enemy has been increaſing, and incroaching upon us. <hi>Canada</hi> has been the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> of New England; and the <hi>French</hi> have long endeavoured both by artifice and arms to drive us from this good land which the <hi>Lord God</hi> gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our fathers.</p>
            <p>How have they fomented ſtrife, and ſent forth their Indians on our frontiers! while they have been foſtering new claims, and drawing a <hi>chain</hi> of forts around us. Together with theſe, they were

            </p>
            <p>What juſt apprehenſions of danger ſpread thro' our land, when (beſides land forces) a formidable fleet of French ſhips under the command of <hi>Duke D' Anville</hi> actually arrived on our coaſt, and according to human probability, were within a few days of executing their bloody deſign, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſolation and death all along our ſea coaſts.</p>
            <p>But God blew with his wind and diſcomfited them: the ſtars in their courſes fought againſt them. Our God broke their ſhips, and ſent his deſtroying angel, who ſlew thouſands of them; then, the arm of the Lord was made bear before the enemy, while the language of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to us was, in a ſtrain like that to Iſrael under the hand of Moſes (that eminent tipe of Chriſt) "ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God:" this is an event never to be forgot: ſo remarkable was our deliverance, that even our popiſh enemies were obliged to confeſs the finger of God in it.

How black was the cloud which then hung over the proteſtant church! how ſolemn, how tremendous the view! how did the <hi>many,</hi> who wantoned in their liberties and luxuries, turn pale thro' fear; and the <hi>few</hi> who love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and are praying for the proſperity of his Zion, (with good old Eli) tremble for the <hi>Ark</hi> of the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> God ſurprized us with his mercy, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhifted the important ſcene.</p>
            <p>He preſides in all human Affairs, and will be acknowledged as ſupreme <hi>Ruler</hi> in the kingdom of providence. He turned to us the brigh ſide of the cloud, which, like the pillar of fire and cloud of old, afforded light to us, but was portending blackneſs and diſpair to our enemies: He, inſpired our miniſtry with wiſdom, our officers with mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſkill and braveneſs, and our armies and navy with true valour. He divided the councils of our enemies, ſpread darkneſs before them, and "turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back the weapons of war in their hands." He has, in a manner which will ſurprize poſterity, and is indeed, little ſhort of miraculous, ſupported the cauſe of our ally of <hi>Pruſſia:</hi> that <hi>little</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality had to meet three of the moſt powerful ſtates in <hi>Europe</hi> in the field, who, truſting to their great ſuperiority in numbers, forſtalled the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of intire conqueſt, and cantonned his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions among them. But he who was with Pruſſia is the God of armies, who always preponderates the doubtful ſcale of victory, &amp; claims all the praiſe. The famous battles of <hi>Roſback</hi> and <hi>Liſſa,</hi> of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt</hi> and Zorndorff <note n="*" place="bottom">The battle of Roſbach was fought Nov. 5. 1757. in which the king of Pruſſia gained a complete victory over the united force of France and Auſtria: the ſame prince beat Count <hi>Daun</hi> at Liſſa, Dec. 5. 1757.

of God in favour of our Allies, and the proteſtant church. By a ſeries of remarkable interpoſitions and ſignal victories <hi>Pruſſia</hi> has been delivered from the very brink of ruin, and is at this time in very reſpectable circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The ſame divine hand is viſibly diſplayed, in ſaving our nation from the ambitious deſigns of our enemies: "the Lord hath been our ſhield and buckler, our high tower and rock of defence." Nay! he has much more than <hi>ſaved us</hi>: he has made us every where victorious; ſo that we, who were deſtined by <hi>Burbon</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> to be the tail, are, by the holy arm of our God, become the <hi>head</hi> of the nations; and our Engliſh monarch ſhines with diſtinguiſhed luſtre among all the crowned heads in Europe.</p>
            <p>To recount the particular inſtances of our ſucceſs in the late war, and point out the remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and wonderful interpoſitions of divine providence in our favour, is too copious a ſubject to fall within the compaſs of our preſent deſign: it is hoped, ſome able hand will do juſtice to this agreeable ſubject; that our children's children may be taught the loving kindneſs of the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Britiſh Iſrael, in theſe memorable years, and "talk of all his wonderful works."</p>

            <p>Nor may we omit, in our review, the merciful hand of God towards us in regard to the court of <hi>Spain,</hi> who, unprovoked opened a war with us; leagued with our enemies; and afforded them all the aſſiſtance in their power. But, the moſt high has brought their councils to nought; and given into our hands the vaſt riches and ſtrength of the <hi>Havannah,</hi> and the Spaniſh navy there: ſo that Spain, after augmenting our fleet with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of their navy, and inriching us with <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> in the compaſs of one year, is glad to accept ſuch terms of peace as Briton generouſly propoſes. May we not, without arrogating any merit to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſpeak on this occaſion, in the language of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and ſay, "the Lord is known by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he executeth": the kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the rulers took council together, againſt the Lord, and his Engliſh Iſrael; but the Lord had them in diriſion: "the Lord of hoſt hath been with us, the everlaſting Jehovah has been our refuge:" all praiſe to <hi>him</hi> who hath thus main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our right....fruſtrated the deſigns of theſe powerful popiſh <hi>ſtates,</hi> comforted his people, and defended the cauſe of his <hi>proteſtant church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As God is to be acknowledged in theſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſſes, which have raiſed the britiſh glory to an unuſual hight, and will mark the Annals of England with the moſt reſplendent lines; ſo we are likewiſe to <hi>adore</hi> his governing providence in the preſent happy and glorious PEACE.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:009403_0032_0F7403E2DDAD4E28"/>Whatever conqueſts we have made, you well know, all might have been loſt by <hi>treaty</hi>; and a daſh of a miſs-guided pen might have blotted all the glory of Britain, and reſigned the price of ſo much blood and treaſure. But, as the <hi>Moſt-High</hi> preſides over all ſtates, makes war, and creates peace; as it is by him that "Kings rule and princes <hi>decree juſtice</hi>;" ſo it is by his governing providence that we have ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> and ſo <hi>faithful</hi> a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> through whoſe wiſdom and fidelity, we have preſented before us a hopeful proſpect of reaping very eſſential advantages from the late bloody and expenſive war.</p>
            <p>He that beholdeth every one that is proud, and abaſes him," has very greatly humbled the pride of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Theſe AMBITIOUS powers have gained nothing....They have loſt very MUCH. Beſides advantages ceeded to <hi>Britain</hi> in other parts of the world, how much have <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> loſt,....how much have WE gained in this?...Truly a territory more than ſufficient for three kingdoms. We have ceeded to us all that we can reaſonably wiſh on the continent: a large field indeed, for argiculture; our trade much inlarged; our fiſhery on a better footing than before the war; the ſavages neceſſarily allied unto us; and a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended country before us: ſo that God, in his holy providence, ſemes to be ſaying to us, as once to Abraham his friend, (O that we were indeed the children of Abraham, and imitated his faith and holineſs) "Lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art, north-ward, and ſouth-ward, and eaſt-ward, and weſt-ward. For all the land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed forever."</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009403_0033_0F7403E3794F91E0"/>Conſidering the very material advantages, which will accrue to our mother-country, from this great inlargement of her colonies, and will become more and more ſenſible, as our land is filling with inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; conſidering the uncertain event of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the war; the danger <hi>Portugal</hi> (our ally and correſpondent in trade,) was in of being over-run by the Spainards; And the human prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which ought to govern the conduct, and bound the ambition of all chriſtian princes,....in this view, notwithſtanding our Britiſh <hi>Sovereign</hi> has reſtored ſome of theſe places which were his by conqueſt, his crown ſhines with an additional luſtre; while He ſo apparently unites in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the principles of true <hi>policy,</hi> and the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Truly, "the Lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad." He has wonderfully ſhifted the ſcene, which opened upon us in the firſt years of the war: Is not the change in our circumſtances ſo ſurprizing, that we may, with great propriety, adapt the language of the 126 pſalm to our <hi>caſe</hi>? "when the Lord turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: <hi>then</hi> was our mouth filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and our tongue with ſinging, &amp;c." or ſpeak in the ſtrain of our text, "break forth into joy, ſing together ye waſte places of Jeruſalem, for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; the Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all nations."</p>
            <p>We ſhall now conclude with a few <hi>Inferences</hi> and ſerious reflections ſuggeſted by our ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What comfortable evidence may be deduced from the diſpenſations of divine providence, in favour
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009403_0034_0F7403E73818CB48"/>
of the truth, and importance of the proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion!</p>
            <p>This is far from being the only proof that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtaniſm is the true religion of the goſpel, and the cauſe of God. It's purity, its ſpirituality, its ſimplicity, its divine force on the hearts of thouſands, their dying teſtimony in favour of it, and above all, its being agreeable to the uncorrupted word of God, are the main <hi>baſis</hi> on which it is ſupported, and by which it muſt carry conviction to all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judges. But methinks, when we reflect on the wonderful providences of God, in ſupport of the proteſtant faith; and obſerve, that God hath all along interpoſed to prevent the total extirpation of it, even when earth and hell have been combin'd againſt it; when we conſider how papal powers have been weakened; and the proteſtant nations from time to time, preſerved and increaſing in their numbers, and reſpectibility; and eſpecially, when we review the hand of God in the late war; ſuch reflections muſt afford a devout mind ſome ſingular ſatisfaction. Verily, God hath been in the midſt of proteſtants, "a very preſent help": he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the cauſe his own, and been as a "wall of fire around us, the glory in the midſt of us, and on all our glory he hath created a defence."</p>
            <p n="2">2. What infinite gratitude ſhould inſpire our hearts? all honour and glory be to <hi>Him,</hi> who hath not left us without a witneſs of his infinite mercy and loving-kindneſs toward our nation and land. "Not unto us, not unto us, but to the Lord <hi>moſt High</hi> be all praiſe and glory:" God is the ſovereign judge: he putteth down one and ſitteth up another: "he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contempt on princes, and gives the kingdoms of the earth to whom he pleaſes."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009403_0035_0F7403E79D3A3938"/>Allowing all due honour to our <hi>Britiſh Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> and miniſtry, to our officers and ſoldiery, (and much honour is ſurely their due, yet) laying all circumſtances together, it was never more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than in the late war, that, "the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, but victory is from the Lord." Let our hearts bound, then, to <hi>Him,</hi> who has made us to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with a very great diſparity of numbers, and brought our enemies to ſubmit themſelves. Let our hearts bound in gratitude to him, who direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the councils of our nation, and afforded his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence in forming and ſucceeding the plan of the preſent peace; which, conſidering the high <hi>precedency</hi> of the Britiſh Sovereign above other princes; his regard to the intereſt of his ſubjects; his tender concern for the common good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and the truly benevolent and generous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which he proceeds, renders him as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable</hi> in PEACE as he is <hi>revered</hi> in war.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How humble ſhould we be under a ſenſe of our <hi>great unworthineſs</hi> of ſuch ſignal interpoſitions?</p>
            <p>When we conſider our moral ſtate, ſurely we cannot arrogate any merit to ourſelves. What a <hi>reverſe</hi> of providence have we deſerved? how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might God have delivered us to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the ſword, or ſold us into the hands of our enemies, as <hi>he</hi> did, backſliding Iſrael? let pride and vain glory then, be forever hid from our eyes, and baniſhed from our hearts. What ſhame and bluſhing muſt cover our faces before the holy one of Iſrael, while we reflect on the number and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of our iniquities? not for our righteouſneſs has the Lord wrought this great ſalvation for us, for we are a people laden with iniquity, but for his

            <p n="4">4. How greatly does it concern us as a people to make a right improvement of theſe mercies?</p>
            <p>All our advantages are tallents intruſted us by the ſupreme ruler of all. It behoves us to be faithful in our ſtewardſhip, to improve public mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the honour of Jehovah, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Redeemer's kingdom; leaſt our proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſhould prove to be the "proſperity of fools which deſtroys them." Let us not (Jeſurun like) "wax fat and kick,"....Let us not wanton under divine ſmiles, and riot on the undeſerved favour of the <hi>moſt high.</hi> For "the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity," all nations ſhall He ſummons to his dread tribunal, and every man ſhall receive according to his works.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of what vaſt importance is it to each one of us: to obtain a part in that great goſpel-ſalvation, which extends its influence beyond the limits of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life; and to be intereſted in his favour who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all human affairs with a ſpecial reference to the higheſt intereſt of his choſen?</p>
            <p>However important the fate of kingdoms may be in the preſent ſtate, as they are made up of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and have a greater or leſs influence on the general ſtate of the church; yet, in the moſt intereſting caſe, we are to conſider ourſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from all political bodies, and remember,

that to our own maſter we muſt <hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>fall.</hi> Let us realize this ſolemn truth that we are, each one for himſelf, a Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner on the great <hi>Theatre</hi> of the world, and acting a part for eternity. Nothing will ſtand us in any ſtead, when we are called off the ſtage, but faith in Chriſt and obedience to his goſpel. We muſt all appear before his judgment ſeat, and render an account, every man ſingly for himſelf, of the talents intruſted him, and the goſpel priviledges he has enjoyed. <hi>Then</hi> there will be no reference had to our being of this, or the other nation, our living in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> age, any farther than we have thereby, had greater or leſs advantages to ſerve the Lord. Oh! important, ſolemn Day! when we muſt lay aſide all our preſent worldly connections; when it will no more avail us to plead, that we have been viſible members in the proteſtant church, or lived under the happy reign of GEORGE the third; than for Jews to plead, that Abraham was their father, and Moſes their lawgiver. All muſt then be determined by this ſingle Qeſtion, "<hi>art thou a ſincere diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the great ſalvation which he has wrought for his people?</hi> O my brethren; let nothing hide this ſolemn day from our view; let nothing divert our chief attention from this, of all others the higheſt concern of mortals: let us lay hold on the goſpel-hope ſet before us,—build our hopes for eternity on our intereſt in the adorable ſaviour,—live up to the dignity of our calling and the ſublimity of our hopes,—and ſo "lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life."</p>
            <p>To conclude,</p>
            <p>How ardently ſhould we pray for the inlargement of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's kingdom? how much ſhould we deſire and endeavor the ſpreading of his glorious goſpel thro' the world, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly among the <hi>Aboriginals</hi> of this land; that theſe ends of the earth may, in a yet more perfect manner, ſee the ſalvation of our God? in how diſtinguiſhing a manner are we favored by the great Lord of nature and of grace? Surely it ſhould be our hearts deſire and prayer to God that the ignorant nations may be acquainted with the glorious light of the goſpel which has long been ſhining around us with ſuch divine brighteneſs. We are waiting, and we ſhould be praying, in the moſt fervent manner, for the Day of the church's greater inlargement, and divine glory—when nations ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks—when men ſhall learn war no more—when the wolf and the lamb ſhall lie down together, —And PEACE and univerſal righteouſneſs ſhall reign trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant through all the Earth. Even ſo, Lord Jeſus come quickly. <hi>Amen.</hi>
