            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>To diſcipline and direct our meditations, and reflections, in the various circumſtances of life, and occurrences of providence, is no ſmall or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>important duty. In every event of providence there is a voice; the heart of the wiſe ſhould ſtudy to anſwer, and meet the juſt expectations of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and righteous Sovereign.</p>
            <p>We inhabit a world ſubject to many and great changes, by any of which our intereſts may be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and materially affected. The changes in the heavens and in the earth are reacted in the walks of civil, political, and ſocial life. And no man knoweth what may be on the morrow, or what may be the iſſues of the paſſing day. But, as men, and as chriſtians, we believe theſe changes are not the effect of chance, or of unintereſted deſign; they are a part of the majeſtic government of him, who is above all changes, 'the ſame yeſterday, to day,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037064_0003_100C3FDD83724360"/>
and forever.' In this view, the importance of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the volume of providence is greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; and the duty of regarding the work of the LORD, and of conſidering the operations of his hand, appears more eminent.</p>
            <p>We live in an eventful period—a period, replete with changes, ſerious in their nature, and extenſive in their operation and conſequences. We hear of wars and rumors of wars, read of nations riſing up againſt nations, and kingdoms againſt kingdoms, and tremble for the fate of empires, involved in wild confuſion, apparently tottering to their baſe.</p>
            <p>Remote from the ſcene of terror, and preſerved hitherto, in a good degree of tranquillity, by the ſmiles of heaven, upon the wiſdom of our counſels, the purity of our principles, and the firmneſs and independence of our patriots, we flattered ourſelves with the hope of impunity and peace. But the melancholy tidings, which the laſt week ſaluted our ears, carried from town to town by the reiterated knell of death, excite a juſt and alarming appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that GOD is coming out in ways of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us, and calling home his ſervants from the gathering ſtorm.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, the great—the GENERAL the STATESMAN, the COUNSELLOR, the FRIEND of AMERICA and of MAN is DEAD! He, who combined a greater aſſemblage of talents, virtues, and excellencies neceſſary to form the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent human benefactor, than are perhaps left to any ſurvivor, is no more. Weep, O AMERICA, defended by his arm, in the time of danger, guided by his wiſdom, prudence, and patriotiſm, in ſcenes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037064_0004_100C3FDF0A635128"/>
of political embarraſſment and perplexity, taught by his counſels and example in proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, weep o'er thy FATHER ſuddenly taken from thy head.</p>
            <p>Whatever ſhades, envy or malice, party ſpirit or ingratitude, may attempt to draw over the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or exploits of our departed Sage, it will be univerſally acknowledged, that 'a Prince and a Great Man has fallen among us.' To pay no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of reſpect to the memory of ſuch a Benefactor would be the height of ingratitude; and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt no religious improvement of an event in providence, that has ſo deeply wounded the public mind, would be a height of impiety at which mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern infidelity might bluſh, and modern ſtupidity ſhudder.</p>
            <p>It will not, however, be expected that I ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to delineate the character of GENERAL WASHINGTON, or to do juſtice to the merits and exploits of this firſt and beſt of men. This is a theme that requires other talents, and other data, than I poſſeſs, and will doubtleſs command the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of the moſt brilliant geniuſes in poetry and proſe. I ſhall only ſay, That the MAN, whom we lament, appeared, ſpecially deſigned, raiſed, and formed by Heaven, for the times in which he lived: the ſpheres in which he moved, and the events of which he was to be the important inſtrument; that no man ever diſcovered more patriotic firmneſs and integrity, or more diſintereſtedly ſerved his fellow men, and that he never ceaſed to deſerve well of his country.</p>
            <p>To endeavour to direct and regulate your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037064_0005_100C3FE101796548"/>
and reflections on ſo affecting an occaſion, and to aſſiſt you in making a religious improvement of an event ſo impreſſive in its nature, and intereſting in its probable conſequences, falls more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately within my province; and is a duty which it would be unpardonable for a miniſter not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, tho' he ſhould fall far below his wiſhes, or the expectations of his hearers.</p>
            <p>Apprehenſive that the firſt impreſſion, from a ſhock ſo great, ſo ſudden, and unexpected, muſt be of the depreſſing kind, I choſe the words of my text to meet a ſpirit of deſpondence, and check the fainting ſoul, ſinking in the day of rebuke. <hi>The LORD liveth—WASHINGTON, the great and good; great in himſelf, great in all ſtations, in principle, purpoſe; and execution; illuſtriouſly great in ſcenes of difficulty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding human energy and deciſion, is DEAD:</hi> but He who made him great ſtill lives—lives above all changes, and reigns above control.</p>
            <p>The Sovereign Proprietor of talents, in various proportion, beſtows them upon his ſervants. To one he gives ten talents, to another five, and to others one; filling up the intermediate ſpaces, as occaſion and circumſtances require. The moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed of our race have nothing but what they receive. A native ſenſe of this, a regular and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout acknowledgment of dependance upon divine providence, and of indebtedneſs to divine influence and intepoſition, formed a luminous trait in the character of our departed General. To glory over others, for that which is altogether received, is the mark of a little, or a baſe mind; as it is of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and unprincipled one, not to acknowledge the author of its benefits. The talents with which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037064_0006_100C3FE2AB1DB458"/>
we are intruſted, add not a cubit to our ſtature; in our improvement of them conſiſts our glory and reward. Our illuſtrious fellow citizen, who was honored with as many talents as were ever intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mortal man; and who honored himſelf more than others by his uſe and improvement of them, is called to his account, leaving a bereaved country, and a weeping nation, crying, 'My father; my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the chariots of Iſrael and the horſemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.' Yet, the LORD liveth, who intruſted him with theſe talents. The ſource is inexhauſted, and inexhauſtible, from whence they were derived; with GOD is the reſidue of the ſpirit. He can form and furniſh other characters as exactly ſuited to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting or expected circumſtances, as our departed <hi>Hero, Stateſman, &amp; Politician,</hi> was to thoſe threatening ones, which have paſſed over us. 'Have paſſed over us,' exclaims the alarmed and fainting ſoul! "Never was there a ſeaſon of more imminent danger to our country; never a time that called louder for thoſe peculiar talents, which diſtinguiſhed this illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Patriot, this beſt of men. Europe is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. The nations, with whom we have prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal connection, are moſt deeply intereſted in the threatning ſcene; envying our growing greatneſs, they are reſpectively jealous of its preponderating influence, and fruitful in expedients to convert it to their own benefit. An important negociation is now depending with the French nation, the ſucceſs of which muſt depend more upon intereſted than honorable views and motives—When they ſhall hear that WASHINGTON is dead, the ſoul of our armies, the center of our union, the inſpirer of our counſels, whoſe name was a hoſt, and his virtues a pavilion, revered by the virtuous, and dreaded by the unprincipled of all climes; they will ſpurn our
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037064_0007_100C3FE513E83CB8"/>
generous and pacific overtures, repeating the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities they have already offered. Other rival or deſpiſing nations will riſe in their exactions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and inſults, when they ſee, that our defence and glory are departed from us."</p>
            <p>If theſe fears are juſt and rational, as probably they are, and this tribute of reſpect is due to the virtues and talents of the great deceaſed, yet let us meet theſe fears with the language of the text, and pay divine honors to the perfections of <hi>Jehovah. 'The LORD liveth,</hi> and bleſſed be our rock, and let the GOD of our ſalvation be exalted.' 'He ſitteth in the congregation of the mighty, He judgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gods.' 'He is the wonderful counſellor, the Prince of peace!' It is indeed God's uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to work by probable means and inſtruments; yet he can accompliſh his purpoſes without them; and often diſplays the glory of his adminiſtration by diſappointing the moſt rational expectations; and pouring the bluſh upon all human conjecture. 'He turneth wiſe men backward, and maketh diviners mad!' He has intimate acceſs to the hearts of men, and can influence and overrule them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 'There is no counſel, underſtanding or might againſt the LORD!' 'He can look upon every one that is high and bring him low; he can make a little one to become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong nation.' If national pride and inſolence, impiety and profaneneſs ſhould take occaſion, from the afflictive viſitation of heaven, to tyrannize and oppreſs, to treat with inſolence and ſcorn thoſe whom 'GOD hath wounded', let us remember 'the LORD liveth.' In ſuch a caſe, may we not expect the ſpecial interpoſition of providence, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of divine aid in the mount of difficulty. 'If
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037064_0008_100C3FE70E219D60"/>
thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poor, marvel not at the matter; He who is higher than the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth, and there be higher than they.' Tho' we have great reaſon for deep humiliation under this bereaving ſtroke, which has weakened our defence, and veiled our glory; and cannot but be concerned for its probable influence upon our foreign intereſts and relations, yet we have no ſufficient cauſe for terrifying fears, or deſponding apprehenſions; for, the LORD lives, who has ever been the ſhield and defence of America, permitting no weapon formed againſt her, ultimately, to proſper. 'He is a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble, he knows all them that truſt in him.'</p>
            <p>Scarcely are theſe fears ſoothed, reſpecting our foreign relations, e'er others more formidable ariſe, reſpecting our domeſtic intereſts, expreſſed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents like theſe. "While our honor and proſperity, our ſafety and comfort, if not our exiſtence as a nation, depend upon our union; upon harmoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and concentrating public ſentiment and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>great band of our union is broken.</hi> The Man greatly beloved, univerſally eſteemed, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of confidence in the camp and the Senate houſe—who has once and again huſhed the voice of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſilenced the clamour of party, and conciliated contending intereſts and deſigns, is removed from the midſt of us, and this at a time when diviſion and animoſity are at a threatning height, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, diſcord, drowns the voice of reaſon, of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, of intereſt, and of religion."</p>
            <p>The juſtneſs of theſe accents thickens indeed the gloom of this afflictive event, and darkens the ſhades in which it is ſhrouded; giving us reaſon to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037064_0009_100C3FE8990C2BA0"/>
apprehend that GOD in judgment is viſiting us, preparing ſorer chaſtenings for an ungrateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Ancient diſpenſations of providence may lead us to conclude, that, in mercy to our deceaſed Guardian, of whom we had rendered ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, GOD has called him off from the evil that is coming, upon the country which he emancipated. By this event, ſo afflictive to us, tho' we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope, joyful to him, ſaving him the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſeeing the evil accelerated, by any farther diſregard of his parental advice and intreaty, which he poured forth, with ſuch ardent affection, when he retired from the patriarchal Chair. We have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that GOD is angry with us; but, that we provoke him no farther. Let us lay to heart this awakening ſtroke, 'let us hear the rod, and him that hath appointed it,' and let us give no occaſion for the repetition of the complaint by the prophet. 'The righteous dieth and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none conſidering that the righteous are taken away, from the evil to come.' But while we carefully avoid 'deſpiſing this chaſtening of the LORD;' let us as carefully avoid 'fainting under his rebukes'. Our earthly media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between contending parties indeed is dead. He whoſe voice was harmony, and his accents peace, is ſhrouded in the tomb; but, our heavenly Peace. Maker ſtill lives. 'He has the hearts of all men in his hands, to turn them as the rivers of water.' 'He ſtilleth the raging of the ſea, the noiſe of its waves, and the tumults of the people'. The human heart, indeed, ceaſes to beat, that was the center of American affection; the tongue is ſilent in the grave, that poured forth the moſt conciliating ſtrains of perſuaſive eloquence; yet he being dead ſtill ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us, in that admirable addreſs to the people
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037064_0010_100C3FEADB4A3C90"/>
of theſe States which he poured forth with ſo much patriotic ardor, and parental concern, when he retired from the chair of State. This legacy, more valuable than the bequeſt of millions, will be reviewed and peruſed with affectionate emotion; the tears of grateful ſenſibility, which it cannot fail to excite, may ſo water the precious ſeed that it ſhall ſpring up to a plentiful harveſt; and the ſpirit of the addreſs, caught by every boſom, may ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize public ſentiment, and correct the errors of patriotic ardor, as that all ſhall turn indignant from foreign influence and intrigue, and glory only in the title of Americans. Happy, thrice happy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, could this be effected! The ſpirit of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Waſhington would look down with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upon ſuch a fruit of his departure; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it the conſummation of his earthly glory. GOD is able to effect this.</p>
            <p>While we pay the tribute of grateful reſpect to the memory of our departed Hero, and mingle our tears with a weeping country, let us not indulge deſponding apprehenſions, but reſt on the aſſurance that the LORD lives, that it is his prerogative to bring light out of darkneſs, and good out of evil, and charge his darkeſt providences with the higheſt bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Loudly does this event ſummon us to 'ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils;' and as loudly does it call us to truſt only in the LORD. If ſo much worth and excellence muſt fail, let us deſpair of finding, below the ſkies, an object of human confidence. And let our truſt be in GOD, all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional expectation is from him. Has there not been 'verily' a fault in us, in this particular? May not our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037064_0011_100C3FEDC35224B8"/>
merciful FATHER deſign to correct our impiety, by this grievous ſtroke? We have venerated and extoled him, who was <hi>greateſt</hi> among men—Have we ſuitably remembered who made him great? We have honored and praiſed the Defender of his country, the Guardian of her rights—but, have our praiſes ultimately ariſen to the throne of GOD, who alone forms and furniſhes human benefactors? WASHINGTON is no more with us, to receive our aſcriptions, to be the occaſion of feſtal aſſemblies, or the object of patriotic homage, but the LORD liveth, to receive our acknowledgments. To him, they are moſt juſtly due, that He raiſed up for us ſuch a character, furniſhing him with talents admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſuited to the parts aſſigned him on the theatre of time. That he crowned with ſucceſs all his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enterpriſes in his country's cauſe—That He made him great in the field, great in the cabinet, and ſtill greater in his retreat from public life; crowning all his glory, with a reſplendent luſtre, by the eminence of his private virtues, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of his religious aſcriptions. When a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful country loaded him with praiſes, he laid his laurels at the feet of Him who ruleth in the Heavens: exclaiming with the Pſalmiſt. 'Not unto me, not unto me, but to thy name be the praiſe.' The Idol of an Empire vaniſheth, but, the LORD lives to receive our acknowledgments. To him the tribute of praiſe is due, to him let the incenſe of aſcription riſe.</p>
            <p>While our praiſes are preſented, as moſt juſtly due, for the diſtinction confered, upon our age and nation, by the life and virtues of ſo eminent a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. Let us earneſtly pray, that God would ſanctify, to an afflicted and weeping country, the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037064_0012_100C3FEF4B49B5A0"/>
grievous rebuke of his providence in ſummoning him from us. That He would heal the breach, which his hand has made. That He would cauſe a double portion of the ſpirit of his aſcending favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to reſt upon his ſucceſſors in office; and cover them reſpectively with his falling mantle. That He would take us into his holy keeping, and be himſelf our Father, Guide, and Guardian. That He would give us grace, religiouſly, to improve a providence ſo affecting, and learn the leſſons it is deſigned to teach.</p>
            <p>In what piercing accents does this event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, the frailty and feebleneſs of man—the vanity of all earthly honors and diſtinctions. He, who has been the 'terror of the mighty, in the land of the living,' has no terror for the tyrant death. He, who has been the ſhield of thouſands in the time of danger, and the confidence of millions in the ſeaſon of perplexity, has no ſhield againſt death's fatal arrow, nor power in the day of diſſolution. Rank, ſtation, and merit make diſtinctions and difference among men here; and they promote the order of ſociety, and the happineſs of ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But death confounds them all.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>" Earth's higheſt honors end in, here he lies;</l>
               <l>" And duſt to duſt, concludes her nobleſt ſong."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>What little cauſe is there for human pride, envy, or ambition. He is the deſerving man, who acts well the part aſſigned him, performs the duties of his ſtation, with life and vigor, and moves with firmneſs and dignity in his ſphere. What a ſtriking comment is the event we deplore upon paſſages of ſcripture like theſe. 'What is man whoſe breath is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037064_0013_100C3FF0D153E5D8"/>
in his noſtrils, and wherein is he to be accounted of:' 'It is better to truſt in the LORD than to put confidence in Princes.' 'Vanity of vanities, ſaith the preacher, all is vanity.'</p>
            <p>But, while this afflictive event teaches us the frailty and feebleneſs of man, the folly of truſting in an arm of fleſh, or boaſting, in human honor, however eminent; does it not teach us the high importance of the Goſpel revelation, in which 'life and immortality are bro't to light.' And ought it not to excite the livelieſt gratitude that we are in poſſeſſion of this ineſtimable treaſure; and by the light derived from its divine Author, can pierce the ſhades of death, and look with comfort to brighter ſcenes? What accumulated horror reſts on the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſcene of life, if, viewed as the end of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, the grave of our hopes and expectations? How does the mind ſhudder at the idea, and the heart revolt from the apprehenſion, that the moſt diſtinguiſhed and eminent of our race, no leſs than the moſt infamous and uſeleſs ſhould ſink in the gulf of utter annihilation? but the light of nature leaves them in one common ruin. Revelation alone aſſures us that when 'the duſt returns to the earth as it was, the ſpirit returns to GOD who gave it,' that the happy ſoul honored with an approving ſentence from the lips of JESUS, ſhall paſs from glory to glory, in progreſſive elevation, far beyond the limits of our preſent conception. This brings light into the ſhades of death, conſiſtency and glory into the mazy ſcenes of time, and proclaims the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of our cheerfully confiding in the governing providence of GOD, and humbly ſubmitting to his ſovereign hand.</p>
            <p>Let us duly prize this ineſtimable treaſure, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037064_0014_100C3FF2F7F38838"/>
ſcrupulouſly watch againſt every attempt to wreſt it from us. Let us imbibe the ſpirit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel—embrace its doctrines, obey its precepts, and imitate the example of its divine Author. He wept at the tomb of Lazarus, comforted the hearts that were torn with anguiſh, raiſing their thoughts from the darkneſs of death to the brightneſs of the morning of the reſurrection. Thus let us do on the preſent mournful occaſion.</p>
            <p>Our beloved WASHINGTON is dead. 'The eye of him that hath ſeen him will ſee him no more.' He has no more a portion in the land of the living. But he will riſe again, and we muſt meet him at the bar of GOD. Let us ſhew our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of ſo great a character, and act becoming our relation to him as our political FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, SAVIOR, and BENEFACTOR. Let him live in the lively remembrance of a grateful country. Let his counſels be honored—his example be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated—his generous diſintereſtedneſs, firmneſs, and patriotiſm be emulated—and his modeſty, piety, and perſeverance be copied by all ranks in life. And while we gratefully exult in this uncommon gift of Heaven, ſo long continued to us, and praiſe GOD for the bleſſings of which he was the honored inſtrument; let us act worthy of ſuch a Sire. Standing faſt in the liberty wherewith he has made us free, let us never ſacrifice our birth right at the ſhrine of ambition, nor loſe our inheritance in the vortex of Diſcord.</p>

            <head>A SERMON, DELIVERED IN THE FIRST CHURCH IN PORTSMOUTH, JANUARY 5th, 1800. THE HOUSE BEING DRESSED IN MOURNING IN TOKEN OF RESPECT TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</head>
            <p>WHAT mean theſe emblems of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with which I ſtand ſurrounded? What event has ſhrouded the ſacred deſk in ſable? Why theſe traces of deep-wrought ſorrow on every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and theſe badges of grief on every arm?</p>
            <p>"Art thou a ſtranger in America, and knoweſt not the cauſe of theſe appearances? GOD has come out in ways of judgment againſt us, covered with a cloud our dear country in his anger, ſmote the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of it that they tremble, and filled every loin with pain; ſummoning from our head, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentleſs meſſenger of death, our political FATHER, SAVIOR, and BENEFACTOR. He has broken
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037064_0016_100C3FF75F5E6158"/>
the golden pipe, the conduit of his choiceſt national bleſſings, and has dried up the ſtream which water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refreſhed the whole land. He has called home the favorite inſtrument of his moſt extenſive benediction; who, by the ſplendor of his talents, the diſintereſtedneſs of his patriotiſm, the purity of his character, the firmneſs of his principles, and the luſtre of his exploits, ſtands unrivalled among the ſons of fame. WASHINGTON is dead! who led our armies to victory, and our country to indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and peace; who preſided in conciliating the jarring intereſts of America, and combined them in a Conſtitution of General Government, which ſtrengthened us in our weakneſs, raiſed us in our depreſſion, ſurrounded us with honor, and rapidly advanced us in the career of national proſperity. The man to whom all eyes were directed in the day of danger, and in whom, when helpers failed, our hopes were centered, and who was ever ready to extend his ſhield, and ſpread his pavilion at the call of his country, is ſuddenly ſummoned from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with mortals. Theſe emblems of grief are tokens of reſpect to departed worth, expreſſing the ſorrow of our hearts, and evincing a deſire to conform to the aſpects of Providence, and meet the voice of GOD ſummoning to deep humiliation."</p>
            <p>Truly there is cauſe for all that we ſee, there is juſt occaſion for all that we feel. Too great honor, which falls ſhort of divine, cannot be paid to the memory of a character ſo diſtinguiſhed. Too great grief, which does not ſink into deſpondence, cannot be exhibited at the loſs of ſuch a Benefactor. Let America be hung in ſable; let the voice of joy and gladneſs, of vain mirth and diſſipation, be ſilent in her borders, until the aſpects of Providence brighten,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037064_0017_100C3FF9602026D0"/>
and the cloud, which covers her, be taken up. Let the heart of the wiſe be in the houſe of mourning, till it effectually learn the vanity of man, the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of GOD, and the wiſdom of truſting unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly in him. Let the heart of the devout un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly pour forth its ſupplications to the repairer of breaches, and the reſtorer of paths to dwell in, that he would heal the breaches of our land, by reaſon of which it ſhaketh; and that he would make plain paths for our feet in this day of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, 'that the lame among us may not be turned out of the way, but effectually healed.'</p>
            <p>I endeavored, you will recollect, to take early notice of this afflictive event, and pay a ſmall tribute of reſpect to the memory of departed worth. My eſteem and veneration for our deceaſed Guardian and Benefactor would induce me to repeat the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, were I not conſcious, that any ſtrains of mine would be like the pebbled rivulet to the ſtreams of eloquence, which will be poured forth upon the occaſion, or like the dim, trembling taper to the blaze of day.</p>
            <p>Leaving in a meaſure this theme and the event which has occaſioned it, I would lead your attention to another, which this has indeed ſuggeſted; but which you will acknowledge to have been attended with effects, far more intereſting and important to mankind. It is the death of the SON of GOD. For a contemplation of this ſcene the tranſactions of the paſt week, and the event which occaſioned them may have prepared the mind; and the duty of the day calling us to commemorate the dying love of CHRIST, renders it a ſubject highly proper
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037064_0018_100C3FFB95E10F18"/>
for our meditation. The attending circumſtance of his death, which I deſign to make the ſubject of ſome remarks, is recorded—</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>MATTHEW, 27th Chap. 45th Verſe.</bibl>
NOW FROM THE SIXTH HOUR THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER ALL THE LAND UNTO THE NINTH HOUR.</q>
            <p>WHAT an aſtoniſhing event was this! What a mighty cauſe muſt there have been to have produced ſuch an effect—to have occaſioned ſuch a ſcene! We have ſeen the earth covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the abſence of the ſun during the hours of reſt; but this commenced at high noon, when the ſun was at its meridian altitude, and had reached the zenith of its ſplendor. For the Jews began to reckon their time from our ſix o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that their ſixth hour was mid-day, and their ninth, three in the afternoon, including that part of the day in which the light and heat are moſt powerful. We have ſeen partial darkneſs, during a ſhort ſeaſon, and over a limited ſpace, owing to eclipſes of the ſun by the interference of the moon. This can happen at new moon only, nor can it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly continue for the ſpace of three hours; but the darkneſs at the death of CHRIST demonſtrably happened at the time of full-moon, when no ſuch interference could poſſibly take place. CHRIST was crucified at the time of the Jewiſh Paſſover, which happened upon the fourteenth day of the firſt month; and their months, if not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet towards the decline of their ſtate always began with the new moon. This is atteſted by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a Jewiſh prieſt, and therefore an unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037064_0019_100C3FFD92D6EBF8"/>
witneſs, who expreſsly aſſerts, that the Day of Expiation, and conſequently all other feaſts were reckoned by the age of the moon. This muſt have been a preternatural and miraculous eclipſe, a black covering ſpread over the light of heaven. We have ſeen cities, ſtates, and countries covered with gloom, and their inhabitants dreſſed in ſable, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of civil, political, and religious lights, at the death of eminent and exalted characters; but never did we ſee the light of heaven ſuſpended, and the whole land covered with darkneſs.</p>
            <p>What was the mighty cauſe of this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non?—the dreadful plot which ſpread this ſable ſcenery? A cauſe more than ſufficient, a myſtery at which heaven and earth wonder and adore. The SON of GOD was then hanging on the croſs—the SAVIOR of the world was then bleeding on Mount Calvary—the light of Heaven was trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to its extinction—and, what was more than all, the ſpotleſs, innocent, and divine JESUS was dying under the inſults and revilings of rebel worms. The envious and malicious rulers of the Jews had extorted a ſentence of crucifixion from the puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous Roman governor, and early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they prepare for its execution. They load our SAVIOR with his croſs, and lead him forth to Calvary; by the third hour they ſtretch him on the wood, raiſe him between Heaven and earth in company with two notorious malefactors, and with hearts harder than adamant 'ſit down to watch him.' Thoſe who paſſed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and inſulting him with the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had made, that he would build the temple in three days, and that he was the Son of GOD. Chief Prieſts, Scribes, and Elders, forgetting the gravity of age, and deſcending from the dignity of their ſtations, mocked him alſo, and ſaid 'he ſaved
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037064_0020_100C3FFFA74252D0"/>
others, himſelf he cannot ſave.' Even the thieves, crucified with him, 'caſt the ſame in his teeth.'</p>
            <p>This was too much for the light of Heaven to behold. The ſun withdrew from a ſpectacle ſo awful, the foundations of the earth were ſhaken, and 'there was darkneſs over all the land from the ſixth hour to the ninth.' This doubtleſs ſilenced their cruel invectives, and induced an awful ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and uncertainty of what would be the iſſue. During theſe three long hours, we do not read, that a word eſcaped the lips of our SAVIOR. His ſoul, retired within itſelf, was probably in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt agony, conflicting with the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſurrounding darkneſs was an emblem of the greater darkneſs, which ſhrouded his ſoul under the hidings of his Father's face. At the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of this ſcene of horror, JESUS cried with a loud voice 'Eli, Eli, lama ſabachthani! My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!' breathing a prayer of forgiveneſs for his betrayers and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, 'he cried again, and yielded up the ghoſt.'</p>
            <p>But are any ready to aſk, "why was this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous event permitted? why was this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious character immolated?" O my brethren, had there not been a cauſe it would not have taken place. "Could he not have reſcued himſelf from the hands of ruffians, and looked his foes into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion?" Had he not been bound with other bands, than thoſe the ſoldiers uſed, he would readily have reſcued himſelf from ſufferings; but he was bound with cords of love and compaſſion towards a guilty world. We had rebelled againſt our Sovereign, were priſoners of juſtice and objects of wrath. Upon us the full vials muſt have been poured, and we muſt have weltered in everlaſting woe, had not
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037064_0021_100C40012FB83B78"/>
JESUS offered himſelf our ſurety and mediator. 'He who knew no ſin was made a ſin offering for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.' 'GOD laid upon him the iniquity of us all,' 'and he bore our ſins in his own body on the tree, that by his ſtripes we might be healed.' He could not then be releaſed from his ſufferings without relinquiſhing his object. Therefore he cries in the full proſpect of his ſufferings, 'I have a baptiſm to be baptiſed with, and how am I ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened till it be accompliſhed.' His love for a guilty world was 'ſtronger than death, which many waters could not quench nor floods drown. Therefore he ſhrunk not from the proſpect; therefore he delivered not himſelf from his anguiſh, nor refuſed to drink the cup, neceſſary to be drank to ſave a guilty world, though mingled to the brim with the bittereſt ingredients. This indeed was love, benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and compaſſion like a God. 'Though he was in the form of GOD, and thought it no robbery to be equal with GOD, yet he made himſelf of no reputation and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;' and for as much as the objects of his love and compaſſion 'were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part of the ſame,' and put himſelf into a capacity of being 'in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.'</p>
            <p>The life of our SAVIOR was devoted to our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; to the communication of the moſt important inſtruction, and to the deliverance of the human mind from the horrors of ſuperſtition, and the doubts and fears of ignorance, error, and deluſion. He diſtributed the fruits of his beneficence where-ever he went, relieved every afflicted object which ſought his aid, and finally died for our guilty race
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037064_0022_100C40032F8C87F8"/>
under the forementioned circumſtances. By his death he appeaſed the wrath of Heaven, 'ſpoiled principalities and powers,' which had brought us into vaſſalage, 'triumphing over them on the croſs,' and purchaſed for us eternal redemption. Words are too feeble, language too inadequate to give us any idea of the glory of this perſonage, or of the obligation we are under to this 'Captain of Salvation,' this mighty Deliverer of the human race.</p>
            <p>We have heard of eminent characters raiſed up among mankind, who ſeemed to ſurpaſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon claſs of mortals, as much perhaps as angels ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed them. We read of heroes, ſages, and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have devoted their lives to the ſervice of their fellow men, and who have been gloriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in defending, delivering, and exalting their country. We have ſeen one, who perhaps ſtands at the head of the catalogue, who was born for his fellow men, lived the Defender, Guardian, Father, and Benefactor of his country, and whoſe death has covered it with univerſal gloom. But raiſe your eyes, Chriſtians, and behold an object more ſtupendous! Raiſe your eyes, mortals, and behold the divine JESUS—a perſonage ſo exalted, that all the angels of GOD were commanded to worſhip him. HE, laying aſide his glory, and taking the form of a ſervant, devoted his life, not only to the ſervice of a country and an age, but to the ſervice of the world throughout all generations. HE vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſacrificed his life for their ſalvation; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the wrath of GOD, and a conflict with Devils, that they might be delivered from the wrath to come, and from the vaſſalage of Satan, and be exalted, not to the moſt diſtinguiſhed height of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037064_0023_100C4005C2BAC2D0"/>
earthly ſplendor merely, but to 'crowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of glory' in the regions of immortality 'which ſhall never fade away,' to heights of felicity in thoſe bleſſed abodes, 'which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered in the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.' And all this, for whom? For his friends?—For the well-deſerving?—For the virtuouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy? No, my brethren. For his enemies—for the ill-deſerving—for voluntary rebels to his crown and dignity. 'GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet ſinners, CHRIST <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for the ungodly.' Wonder, O Heaven! be aſtoniſhed, O Earth! and let univerſal nature praiſe and adore! What a tribute of praiſe is due to ſuch a benefactor! What obligation we are under to ſuch infinite beneficence!</p>
            <p>Though there is no term of compariſon between this divine perſonage, and the moſt exalted of the creation, though all nations are before him, 'as the drop of the bucket,' and the higheſt human character muſt be loſt in the ſmalleſt of his glories; yet may I not, with adoring reverence, take occaſion from your preſent feelings, and the event which has excited them, to reaſon with you upon your duty to the divine JESUS, whoſe embaſſador I am, and to whom I would eſpouſe you.</p>
            <p>You have tears of gratitude, affection, and reſpect for our beloved WASHINGTON, when you call to mind his virtues, his diſintereſtedneſs, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.

for our SAVIOR? who was infinitely glorious, the joy of Heaven, the beloved of the FATHER, the friend of ſinners, and the infinite benefactor of the human race. You are affected with the death of our venerable Patriot, Chriſtian, and Sage. The emblems of mourning, which every where ſtrike our eyes, are expreſſions of your grief; and are you not affected with the death of JESUS, who died that we might live—do you not grieve for the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous cauſe? You reſolve that the memory of WASHINGTON ſhall never be obliterated from your throbbing hearts—you dwell upon his virtues, his talents, and his exploits; and will you forget the bleſſed JESUS—will you not contemplate his divine perfections, read the hiſtory of his life, and admire the atchievements of his mercy? What eye will not gaze upon the reſembling portraits of our departed General, left behind to aid our recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Will you then, my dear friends, turn away your eyes from beholding the emblems of the SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOR, which he has appointed to refreſh our memories, and affect our hearts? The dear RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER could not leave behind the picture of himſelf. No limner could draw his divine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But he conſtituted bread and wine, adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at his table, to be the emblems of his body and blood, and the memorials of his death; and will you not gaze upon theſe wonderful bequeſts?

            <head>A SECOND SERMON, DELIVERED LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 5, 1800, FROM MATTHEW, 27th Chap. 45th Verſe. NOW FROM THE SIXTH HOUR THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER ALL THE LAND UNTO THE NINTH HOUR.</head>
            <p>OUR preceding diſcourſe contained ſome remarks upon the new and extraordinary phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non mentioned in the text. They were deſigned to prove that the darkneſs could not be the effect of any natural cauſe, but was a miraculous atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the tragedy then acting on earth, expreſſing the ſympathy of heaven with the divine ſufferer.</p>
            <p>The glorious IMMANUEL, by whom the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens were ſpread, the earth founded, and the race of men created, nailed to the accurſed tree, was then ſuſpended between heaven and earth, an object of inſults and abuſe, for rebel worms! The innocent and holy JESUS was then ſhedding his precious blood, and offering his life, an expiatory ſacrifice, for the ſins of men; nay more, He was ſpoiling principalities and powers, who had led us captive,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037064_0027_100C400E388DD050"/>
and drinking the cup of divine wrath filled to the brim by our ſin and tranſgreſſion. Nature, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing with its dying Lord, was convulſed at the tremendous ſpectacle. The ſun withdrew his rays—the heavens ſpread their ſable curtains—and earth was wrapt in awful gloom. Here we find the cauſe of theſe hours of darkneſs, of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary extinction of the light of heaven.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion of many, that this darkneſs was confined to the land of Judea, upon which the principal guilt of the crucifixion reſts. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tranſlation of our Bible is favorable to ſuch an opinion, but the original is as favorable to an univerſal darkneſs. It is however of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which it was; a darkneſs, confined to the land of Judea, was no leſs a miracle, under exiſting circumſtances, than a darkneſs commenſurate with the globe. There was no ſufficient natural cauſe of the former, and the ſame power, that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſuſpended the rays of the ſun from a portion of the globe could as eaſily ſuſpend them from the whole. That the Jews ſhould attempt to ſuppreſs this miracle, or, ſince they could not do that, to leſſen it as much as poſſible, was to be expected, conſidering their obſtinate unbelief, conſummated by the ridiculous tale invented to confute the evidence of the Savior's reſurrection. "But," ſay the advocates for partial darkneſs, "there was not the ſame cauſe for the ſilence of heathen writers, who ſpeak very little of this darkneſs." If there were no monuments of this event among them, it would be preſumptive evidence that the darkneſs did not reach them; but one learned and judicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator ſays, that, 'ſome of the ancients appealed to the annals of the nations concerning this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037064_0028_100C400FC1FB04E0"/>
eclipſe, at the death of CHRIST, as a thing well known, and which gave notice to thoſe parts of the world, of ſomething great then in doing.' Another mentions, by name, <hi>Phlegon</hi> as taking notice of this darkneſs; and moſt ſay, that, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of Heliopolis in Egypt was filled with ſo much wonder, aſtoniſhment, and juſt conviction, of the miraculouſneſs of the event that he exclaimed 'Aut Deus naturae patitur, aut mundi machina diſſolvitur.' <hi>The God of nature ſuffers, or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is diſſolving.</hi> So juſtly thought this renowned Philoſopher, ignorant of the tragedy then acting in Judea. The Roman Centurion and the guard which he commanded, for the purpoſe of aiding and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending the awful tranſactions of the day, who may be ſuppoſed to have been ſelected for their uncommon inſenſibility, and congeniality to the occaſion, when they ſaw the darkneſs, the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the things that were done, loſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ſtupidity, exclaiming, <hi>Surely, this was the SON OF GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never did prodigies, like theſe at the death of CHRIST, mark any other triumph of the King of terrors. Great men have fallen—the greateſt, the wiſeſt, and the beſt, for 'No man hath power over the ſpirit, to retain the ſpirit, neither hath he power in the day of death, there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in that war.' 'The LORD hath taken away the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, the prophet, and the prudent, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counſellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.' GOD may have given, ſome times, premonitions of the death of eminent characters, that an afflicted people might be prepared
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037064_0029_100C4011DDB869E8"/>
for their bereavement.—So deep has been the wound from the loſs of men, in whom all that was great and good centered, that the country they have bleſſed has ſeemed to ſympathize with its inhabitants, and put on, as ours now does,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Winter.</hi>
               </note> a dreary and joyleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; the hoarſe ſounding winds, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blaſts may be imagined to reſpond to the ſighs and groans of the orphan family; but, never was there a death, except this of our divine SAVIOR, at which the heavens ſpread their ſackcloth, dreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in darkeſt ſhades, and earth groaned to its loweſt centre.</p>
            <p>Does not this ſtriking difference at the death of CHRIST loudly proclaim his infinite ſuperiority to all mortals, and afford us an important argument and evidence of his proper divinity? I pay reſpect to human greatneſs, eſpecially when allied to human virtue, and devoted to defend and bleſs mankind. Every token of veneration, gratitude and love, that falls ſhort of divine, is but a juſt tribute to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence like that, of which America has lately been bereaved. But may I not pertinently take occaſion, from this event and the emotions it excites, to bring into view our glorious EMMANUEL, and ſhew how much he excels all human excellence; how juſtly he is intitled to the higheſt homage, ſupreme love, and everlaſting remembrance of our indebted race.</p>
            <p>There are thoſe, who deny divine honors to our SAVIOR, or at leaſt, ſtrip him of his royal crown and diadem, by diſclaiming his title to <hi>divine</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. They place him high, indeed, in the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:037064_0030_100C40136C6F59D8"/>
of GOD, the firſt-born of every creature, as the model after which all human ſouls ſhould be created; but they place him far below the dignity and honor of a divine perſon, and think him intitled to the homage that is paid him, more from his delegated power and authority, than his innate worth and excellence. Others there are, who conſider CHRIST as no other than a mere man. They allow him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to be an extraordinary man, raiſed up and furniſhed as a ſupereminent Prophet, commiſſioned to publiſh the will of GOD to men, and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and example to recover them from the paths of error, ignorance and ſuperſtition, into which they had unhappily declined; that, in execution of his commiſſion, he atteſted the truth of his doctrines by his ſufferings, and ſealed them with his blood. Still, others there are—(it is a lamentation they are ſo many, and an aſtoniſhment they are ſo active in their ruinous attempt!) who reject the whole chriſtian revelation, repreſenting the Goſpel as 'a cunningly deviſed fable,' its hiſtory a forgery, and its author an impoſtor. Bluſh, O human intellect, at ſuch an abuſe of intelligence, ſhudder, O my ſoul, at blaſphemy ſo daring!</p>
            <p>While this latter claſs will feel themſelves but little intereſted in what can be ſaid upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for they ridicule and inſult the ſtory of the crucifixion, with all its tremendous ſcenery; I would aſk the two former claſſes, who ſubſcribe to the truth of the Goſpel hiſtory, and believe this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous darkneſs attending the death of CHRIST, tho' they deny his divinity, and proper atonement for ſin; why this unexampled appearance, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phenomenon? Why this ſympathy of nature with the dying JESUS? Great men have died in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037064_0031_100C4015E701B7C0"/>
every poſſible ſituation. The higheſt human bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors have expired in ſcenes of their greateſt uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—in the full career of glory—and when they have reached its ſummit. Sages and Legiſlators, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Moraliſts, who have waſted the mid-night lamp, and the mid-day ſun, to reform and bleſs their fellow men, have had their purpoſes broken off, and left their benevolent wiſhes unaccompliſhed. And Prophets and Apoſtles, ſealing the truth of their doctrines with their blood, have expired under every ſpecies of torture and ignominy, which the wit and malice of their enemies could invent: yet heaven and earth moved on their uſual courſes, ſilent, and unintereſted ſpectators of the ſcenes. The greateſt and the beſt of men with us has died, the defender of our rights, the avenger of our wrongs, our political Father, friend and Benefactor, the glory of his country, and the boaſt of the human race; but we had no premonition of the event, no attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimonials of his death. The inhabitants of our land have felt the ſhock, and every where exhibit emblems of grief; but, the earth has maintained her uſual ſteadineſs, and the heavens have exhibited their accuſtomed brightneſs. Why was the death of Jeſus ſo greatly diſtinguiſhed from the deaths of all the worthies that have ever fallen? Why ſhould the earth tremble to its loweſt baſe, and the ſun expire for three long hours? O, my brethren, the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion gives us the true reaſon, <hi>'Doubtleſs this was the SON OF GOD.'</hi> And Dionyſius of Heliopolis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and concluded juſtly, <hi>the GOD of nature ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</hi> By which is not intended, that the divine nature, ſimply conſidered, ſuffered; but the divine nature was ſo united with the human nature in CHRIST JESUS, that the perſon, who was dying on the croſs, without the gates of Jeruſalem, was,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037064_0032_100C40180EEBC748"/>
in every proper conſideration, <hi>a divine perſon; GOD</hi> and man myſteriouſly united, conſtituting that <hi>'myſtery of godlineſs, GOD manifeſt in the fleſh,'</hi> into which angels pry with profound aſtoniſhment. And this divine perſonage was then dying in agony, not <hi>merely</hi> to atteſt the truth of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and ſeal his teſtimony with his blood, but to make expiation for the ſins of men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an adequate atonement for their guilt. He was conflicting with the powers of darkneſs, to reſcue us, captives, from their chain. He was ſuffering that we might be happy—dying, that we might live—bearing the wrath of GOD, that we might enjoy his ſmiles, and reign with him forever.</p>
            <p>Here was reaſon ſufficient for the mighty differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the death of CHRIST, and the deaths of all who have ever fallen, abundant cauſe for all the prodigies that attended his crucifixion, nay, is it not matter of wonder, that the hoſts of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en had not interfered and reſcued their belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? They would, had not he, from compaſſion to man, reſtrained their ardor. Is it not matter of ſurprize that nature had not expired, in convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive agonies, at the affecting ſpectacle? It would, had not he ſuſtained it, by his mighty power, that the ſcriptures might be fulfilled, and the great ſalvation be effected.</p>
            <p>Whatever homage, therefore, is due to created excellence, or human worth, infinitely higher is due to the LORD JESUS CHRIST. However deep the impreſſion, made upon the human heart, by the death of the moſt eminent, uſeful, and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted human Benefactor, deeper ſhould be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from the death of CHRIST. No one will imagine that theſe remarks intend the leaſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037064_0033_100C40199744B9E0"/>
upon the emotion that has been excited in the public mind, by the death of our beloved WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, or that they convey the remoteſt degree of cenſure, upon the tribute of grateful reſpect, that has been, ſo univerſally, paid to his memory. To have been unmoved at ſuch bereavment, would have been the higheſt reflection upon our ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to have withholden the tribute of mournful reſpect would have proved us impious and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Every token of human reſpect that a widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country can beſtow will fall ſhort of the merit of its illuſtrious Guardian. When this Father of his Country was performing his continental circuit, viſiting the ſeveral apartments of his great family, to gratify the wiſhes of his affectionate children and give the patriarchal bleſſing; as he approached this town, a juſt and laudible zeal was exhibited, by every claſs of citizens, to remove every obſtacle out of the way, 'to make the crooked ways ſtraight, and the rough places plain.' The pleaſing ſolicitude then diſplayed to give honor to the illuſtrious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of our rights, and prepare the way for his approach, ſuggeſted to me the propriety of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to you upon the importance of preparing the way for the approach of the 'KING OF GLORY' and of removing every obſtacle to <hi>his</hi> favoring us with a viſit, who has ranſomed and redeemed his people, and wrought out eternal ſalvation for them. Is there leſs propriety, that, from the death of this great man, whom 'the multitude of his brethren delight to honor,' and from the multiplied tokens of reſpect paid to his memory, I ſhould take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſcourſe to you upon the importance of paying all poſſible homage to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, our once crucified, but now exalted Redeemer, at whoſe feet, the higheſt of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037064_0034_100C401B21E20E98"/>
hoſts, how in low proſtration? Is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it not acting in character, as a Miniſter of CHRIST, who 'wiſhes above all things' that the whole family of earth, might be influenced to reverence and adore, to love and ſerve the divine SAVIOUR, to take every proper occaſion to diſcourſe of his glories, and recommend him to the homage of guilty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents?</p>
            <p>If departed ſpirits have any knowledge of the tranſactions on earth, and the death of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired General ſhould be the mean of affecting any heart more deeply with a ſenſe of the death of CHRIST; or of exciting it to pay its unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved homage to him—the venerable ſhade, of our departed WASHINGTON, would more rejoice in this fruit of his death, than in all the triumphal arches, marble ſtatues, or mournful monuments that a grateful country will raiſe to his memory. Will he not, then, approve my attempt, to direct your tears, ſhed at his death, into the channel of weeping for your dying Jeſus, and to elevate your veneration for his embalmed memory, to divine veneration of the adorable IMMANUEL, 'who is over all GOD bleſſed forever.' Did not our chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Hero, while running his career of glory, bow dependent at the throne of grace, did he not aſcribe all his honors and ſucceſſes to the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing influence of an overruling Providence? Is he not now, as we fondly hope, caſting his crown at the feet of JESUS, with a, 'not unto me, not unto me, but to thy name be the praiſe?' And, will he not be pleaſed, that earth ſhould, this day, reſemble heaven, and his family left behind, ſhould, at humbler diſtance, be imitating his exerciſes, and preparing for his joys? 'They mourn the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037064_0035_100C401E0BA58D58"/>
dead aright who live as <hi>they</hi> would wiſh.' This is the improvement of the death of others, which reaſon and religion require of us, that we ſhould riſe from the creature to the Creator, 'and ſet our affections on things above where GOD is, and where CHRIST is at his right hand.'</p>
            <p>Who will not be ambitious to have portraits and pictures of our departed Patron and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor? Who will not think them the ornaments of their beſt apartments? Who will not make them the ſubject of converſation, and the occaſion of recalling to a grateful remembrance, the virtues and exploits of their admired original? While pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety may exclude pretended reſemblances of the <hi>Saviour!</hi> will you not by meditation render fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to you his divine perfections, engrave his virtues on the tablet of your hearts; and make him and his benefits the ſubject of converſation, on proper occaſions, that love may be enkindled in your own breaſts, quickened in the breaſts of others, and 'believing you may rejoice with exceeding joy?'</p>
            <p>A grateful public will doubtleſs erect, in one place and another, ſtatues of the deceaſed, and adorn their public places with portraits large as the life, and with hiſtoric paintings emblematic of his deeds; and grateful individuals, on public political occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, will flock to behold them, with emotions honorary to departed worth. And will any be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned to have public places of worſhip, where GOD may record his name? or neglect to aſſemble where he will accept their vows, and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own inſtitutions?</p>
            <p>It has been propoſed to collect and publiſh, in one
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037064_0036_100C402003A61118"/>
volume, the principal public communications of our departed Sage, Stateſman, and Defender, that every ſucceſſor in the ſtations he has filled, and the offices he has ſuſtained, may have a general manual, and poſterity be inſtructed by his uncommon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Who would not poſſeſs ſuch a volume? Who would not give it the moſt conſpicuous place in his library, or have it nearer at hand for habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe? Will you not thus honor the writings of the bleſſed JESUS, which contain the words of eternal life? Will you not give them a conſpicuous place in your dwellings, and have them ever at hand for your inſtruction and comfort? I confeſs, my brethren, I have been ſometimes grieved, to ſee the implements of amuſement occupying the place of the word of GOD, in the dwellings of profeſſing chriſtians; and to find in every corner a novel or a romance,<note n="*" place="bottom">Some writings of this kind may afford inſtruction, but an indiſcriminate reading of them, vitiates the taſte, corrupts the heart, and fills the youthful imagination with romantic fancies that only make wretched in future life.</note> while a Bible, if a tenant of the place, was ſcarcely to be found.</p>
            <p>Ye parents and heads of families, you will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſe with one another, and with your children and dependents, upon the virtues and atchievments of our departed Hero and Stateſman—you will tell them how much they are indebted to his valor, his wiſdom and firmneſs, for the good land they poſſeſs, and the liberties and privileges with which it is diſtinguiſhed; you will not ceaſe the pleaſing tale till emotions of reſpect, for him they never <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſwell their youthful boſoms. And will you not lead them to venerate and adore the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037064_0037_100C4022408FAD40"/>
divine SAVIOR, and aid their devotions by your family examples and prayers? Will you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them upon the glories of CHRIST—and tell them how he labored, bled, and died for their ſakes; is riſen and aſcended to be their interceſſor in heaven, where he is preparing manſions for them that love him? Will you not continue the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting theme, till their young hearts throb with grateful emotions, their eyes fill with the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tear, and they reſolve to lay their bluſhing honors at the feet of JESUS?</p>
            <p>Should you meet with any diſpoſed to depreciate the worth of our illuſtrious Benefactor, to detract from the merit of his well earned praiſe, or fully the glory with which he died ſurrounded, ('for who can ſtand before envy,' or anſwer for the effects of party ſpirit and prejudice) would you not recoil indignant from ſuch accents? Should you meet with eſſays, whoſe open or covert deſign, is to blaſt the fame of WASHINGTON, and reduce him to a level with common men; (for who can tell to what proſtitution preſſes may deſcend) would you give them a patient reading; or feaſt your eyes on the unhallowed page?—And will you lend the liſtening ear, or the apparently grateful attention, to thoſe who deny divine honors to the SAVIOR; and ſtrip him of his royal crown and diadem? Will you, with pleaſure read thoſe monſtrous eſſays which blaſpheme the virtues of the bleeding JESUS, and repreſent him in characters and titles, that I forbear to name? Will you not turn, indignant, from ſuch eſſays and conſign them and their Authors to the oblivion they deſerve?</p>
            <p>Should you, my young friends, in your hours
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037064_0038_100C4023DB8E7180"/>
of buſineſs, or relaxation, find any diſpoſed to make the venerable name of WASHINGTON, a mere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletive in language, to uſe it in common converſa-without meaning or reflection—would not your patriotic ardor burn indignant at ſuch abuſe? Would you not reprove ſuch profanation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the company of thoſe ſo ungrateful? And will you feel no emotion when you hear the name and attributes of Deity ſo abuſed, and our ſtreets filled with oaths and curſes? Will you not frown upon ſuch debaſing abuſe of ſpeech, retire from the polluted region, and leave to themſelves thoſe, whoſe minds are ſo vitiated, their lips ſo profane, and their hearts ſo deſtitute of all religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? In fine. For I know not to what length I might extend the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Had our beloved WASHINGTON, our political SAVIOR and BENEFACTOR, appointed a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative rite, expreſſive of his love to his country, of his exertions for its benefit, and of his ardent wiſhes for its proſperity, and left it in charge to remember him in its obſervance—With what readineſs would you have attended upon it? How ſcrupulouſly would you have regarded his dying requeſt? Would you have made it a neceſſary prerequiſite, that you ſhould fully ſee its beneficial tendency, or as fully comprehend all that his exalted mind might mean and intend? Would not gratitude to your Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and confidence in his diſcernment, have ſurmounted leſſer ſcruples, and made you reſpectful obſervers of his laſt requeſt? Our adorable JESUS, has inſtituted a memorial of his dying love, a feſtal remembrance of his death, in the celebration of which, he is ſet before us, in ſome of the moſt affecting ſcenes of his mediation; upon which he
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037064_0039_100C4025ECA0CA18"/>
has directed us to attend, 'in remembrance of him,' and 'ſhew forth his death till he come,'—yet how many neglect this expreſſive memorial, this dying requeſt of the bleeding JESUS! What is the cauſe, my beloved Brethren? Have you veneration for created excellence—and have you not for excellence divine? Do you love and reſpect the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of temporal benediction—and do you not love and reſpect the <hi>Author</hi> of eternal bleſſings? Should not the friends of JESUS meet at his table? Should not they, who confide in his death, obediently ſhew it forth? But, are any ready to ſay, 'we ſee not the ſpecial benefit of this inſtitution'—And dare you not confide in the dictates of unerring wiſdom? Do any ſay farther. 'We fear we have not thoſe exerciſes of heart which are due, nor that ſenſe of the Savior's worth, and veneration for his memory which will render our attendance a ſincere and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice.' My friends, ſhould there be any of our fellow citizens, in this day of national mourning, who ſhould withhold the tribute of reſpect, due to the memory of our departed Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, from a conſciouſneſs they did not feel that reſpect, which ſuch tribute indicated—What advice would you give them? Would it not be, 'to diveſt themſelves of prejudice—to review the virtues and talents, the character and exploits of the beloved WASHINGTON—to conſider, candidly, his inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble integrity, his diſintereſted patriotiſm, and unaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ardor for his country's good, and emotions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, gratitude, and love will ſpontaneouſly ariſe.' The advice you would give in this caſe, will you, candidly, receive in one much more important? Diveſt yourſelves of prejudice againſt the plan of the Goſpel; liſten to the accents of unerring truth, contemplate the glorious character of JESUS

CHRIST; conſider our extreme need of ſuch a character; read the hiſtory of his love; view him repreſented to the world, as its only hope, in the types and ſhadows of the ancient diſpenſation; ſee him, actually, living on earth, ſcattering the ſhades of ignorance and ſuperſtition by his doctrine; and bringing life and immortality to light; follow him in his courſe of godlike beneficence diſperſing bleſſings all around him; meditate upon the ſcenes exhibited in the garden of Gethſemane, and on the top of Calvary; behold the bleſſed Jeſus, bearing our ſins, carrying our ſorrows, ſtricken, ſmitten of GOD, and afflicted, that he might expiate our guilt; hear him crying <hi>'it is finiſhed;'</hi> when he yielded up the Ghoſt; behold him riſing from the dead, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the right hand of the Majeſty on high, as our Advocate and Interceſſor, and preparing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Glory for all who love him; dwell upon theſe themes 'till your hearts melt, within you, and in the conqueſts of faith you can exclaim, with Thomas, 'My LORD, and my GOD:' And come ſurround his table, taſte of his love, and prepare to dwell with him forever.</p>
