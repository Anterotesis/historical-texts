            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SOME MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF <hi>JOHN ROBERTS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I HAVE had it on my mind, for ſome years paſt, to commit to writing ſome memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſages, the chief of which were tanſacted in my time, together with ſome ſhort account of our family.</p>
            <p>My grandfather's name was JOHN ROBERTS, <hi>alias</hi> HAYWARD. He liv'd at a vilage call'd <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi> within a mile of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> in <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> I have heard he lived reputably on a little eſtate of his own, which he occupied. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried MARY SOLLISS, ſiſter to ANDREW SOLLISS. <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was in the commiſſion of the peace, and ſuſtain'd great ſpoil in the time of the civil war between king CHARLES I. and the parliament. I have heard a colonel and his men and horſes quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themſelves upon him a conſiderable time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, turning their horſes to the corn and hay mows.</p>
            <p>My father and his next Neighbour went into the army under <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and continued till they 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007113_0003_102AFEBBCF6F33D0"/>
heard <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> was taken by the king's party; when they thought proper to return home, to ſee how it fared with their parents and relations.</p>
            <p>As they were paſſing by <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> they were diſcovered and purſu'd by two ſoldiers of the king's party (then in poſſeſſion of the town.) See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves purſued, they quitted their horſes, and took to their heels: but by reaſon of their accoutrements could make little ſpeed. They came up with my father firſt; and tho' he begged for quarter, none would they give him; but laid on him with their ſwords, cutting and ſlaſhing his hands and arms, which he held up to ſave his head; as the marks upon them did long after teſtify. At length it pleaſed the Almighty to put it into his mind to fall down on his face; which he did. Hereupon the ſoldiers being on horſeback, cry'd to each other, <hi>alight, and cut his throat!</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them did; yet continued to ſtrike and prick him about the jaws, 'till they thought him dead. Then they left him, and purſued his neighbour, whom they preſently overtook and kill'd. Soon after they had left my father, it was ſaid in his heart, <hi>Rife, and flee for thy life</hi>; which call he obey'd; and ſtarting upon his feet, his enemies eſpy'd him in motion, and purſued him again. He ran down a ſteep hill, and through a river, which ran at the bottom of it; though with exceeding difficulty, his boots filling with water, and his wounds bleeding very much. They followed him to the top of the hill; but, ſeeing he had got over, they purſued him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was at a loſs which way to take in this wounded and diſconſolate condition, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with enemies on every hand. At length he determined to go to his unkle <hi>Solliſs's</hi>; from whence he ſent a ſervant to a widow at <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> 
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007113_0004_102AFEBE713EB850"/>
(at whoſe houſe the chief officers lay) with whom he was acquainted, deſiring her to come to him; which ſhe readily did, and offered him all the ſervice in her power. He deſired her, as the principal officers lay at her houſe, to uſe her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with them to give command that none of the ſoldiers might offer him any abuſe. Which ſhe effected; and in good will to her they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent their ableſt ſurgeon to him. He was a man of great skill, but of a four diſpoſition; for he told my father, <hi>if he had met him in the field, he would have kill'd him himſelf; but now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I'll cure you</hi>; which he did. When my father found himſelf able, he went to his father's houſe, and found him very ill in bed. They greeted each other with many tears, and a great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of joy and ſorrow. After ſome time my father perceiv'd him to tremble to ſuch a degree, that the bed ſhook under him Upon which my father asked him how it was with him? He repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>I am well: I feel no pain. 'Tis the mighty power of God that ſhakes me.</q> After lying ſtill ſome time, he broke out in a ſweet melody of ſpirit, ſaying, <q>In the Lord only have I righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſtrength! In God have I ſalvation!</q> I don't remember to have heard he ſaid any thing more before his departure.</p>
            <p>The civil war continuing, my father found he could not be ſafe at home; and therefore he went again, and continued till near the concluſion of that dreadful eruption; when he return'd again to his ſorrowful family at <hi>Siddington.</hi> After ſome time he took to wife <hi>Lydia Tindal,</hi> daughter of <hi>Thomas Tindal</hi> of <hi>Slincomb,</hi> near <hi>Durſley</hi>; a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous family, and one of thoſe under the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Puritans. Matthew Hale</hi> (afterwards lord chief juſtice of <hi>England</hi>) was her kinſman, and 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007113_0005_102AFEC1D9DF7578"/>
drew her marriage-ſettlement. It pleaſed God to give them ſix children, <hi>viz. John, Joſeph, Lydia, Thomas, Nathaniel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel. Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi> died young; <hi>Thomas</hi> was kill'd at the age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, by a kick from a mare; the reſt lived to man's eſtate.</p>
            <p>In the year 1665, it pleaſed the Lord to ſend two women friends out of the <hi>North</hi> to <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> who enquiring after ſuch as feared God, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to my father, as the likelieſt perſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them. They came to his houſe, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a meeting. He granted it, and invited ſeveral of his acquaintance to ſit with them. After ſome time of ſilence, the friends ſpake a few words, which had a good effect. After the meeting, my father endeavor'd to engage them in diſcourſe: but they ſaid little, only recommended him to <hi>Richard Farnſworth,</hi> then a priſoner for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of truth in <hi>Banbury</hi> jail, to whom they were going. Upon this recommendation my father went ſhortly after to the priſon, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with <hi>Richard</hi>; where he met with the two women who had been at his houſe. The turnkey was denying them entrance, and telling them he had an order not to let any of thoſe <hi>giddy-headed people</hi> in; and therefore if they did <hi>go in,</hi> he would <hi>keep</hi> them there. But upon my father's deſire they were admitted in along with him, and conducted through ſeveral rooms to a dungeon, where <hi>Richard Farnſworth</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a grate to the people in the ſtreet: but ſoon after they came in, he deſiſted; and, after a little time of ſilence, turning to them, he ſpake to this purpoſe: <q>That <hi>Zacheus,</hi> being a man of low ſtature, and having a mind to ſee Chriſt, ran before, and climb'd up into a ſyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more tree: and our Saviour, knowing his good 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007113_0006_102AFEC374534768"/>
deſires, call'd to him, <hi>Zacheus, come down! This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe.</hi> Thus, <hi>Zacheus</hi> was like ſome in our day, who are climbing up into the tree of knowledge, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find Chriſt there. But the word now is, <hi>Zacheus come down, come down; for that which is to be known of</hi> God, <hi>is manifeſted</hi> within.</q> This, with more to the ſame purpoſe, was ſpoken in ſuch <hi>Authority,</hi> that, when my father came home, he told my mother he had ſeen <hi>Richard Farnſworth,</hi> who had ſpoke to his condition as if he had known him from his youth. From this time he pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bore the croſs; afterwards, when it pleaſed God to communicate to him a portion of the knowledge of his bleſſed <hi>Truth,</hi> a neceſſity was laid upon him one firſt-day morning to go to the public worſhip houſe in <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> in the time of worſhip, not knowing what might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him there. He went; and, ſtanding with his hat on, the prieſt was ſilent for ſome time: but being asked why he did not go on? he anſwer'd, he <hi>could not, while that man ſtood with his hat on.</hi> Upon this ſome took him by the arm, and led him into the ſtreet, ſtaying at the door to keep him out: but after waiting a little in ſtilneſs, he found himſelf clear, and paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. As he paſs'd the market-place, the tie of his ſhoe ſlacken'd; and while he ſtooped down to faſten it, a man came behind him, and ſtruck him on the back a hard blow with a ſtone, ſaying, <hi>There, take that for</hi> Jeſus Chriſt's <hi>ſake.</hi> He anſwer'd, <hi>ſo I do</hi>; not looking back to ſee who is was, but quietly going his way. A few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man came and asked him forgiveneſs; telling him he was the unhappy man that gave him the blow on his back, and he could have no reſt ſince he had done it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007113_0007_102AFEC5125A2690"/>
Not long after, three <hi>Friends</hi> came that way, who found the like concern, <hi>viz. Robert Silveſter, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Grey,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Onyon.</hi> Theſe ſtanding in the ſteeple-houſe with their hats on, tho' they ſaid nothing, the prieſt was ſilent: And being asked if he was not well? he anſwered, he <hi>could not go forward whilſt thoſe dumb dogs ſtood there.</hi> Wherefore the People dragg'd them out: and the prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards informing a juſtice that they had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him in divine ſervice, they were bound over to the quarter-ſeſſions. My father, at their deſire, accompany'd them to the ſeſſions: and when they were called, and the prieſt had accuſed them, the bench, in a rage, without asking them any queſtions, ordered their mittimus's to be made. This unjuſt and illegal proceeding kindled my father's zeal, inſomuch that he ſtepping forward, called to the juſtices, ſaying, <hi>Are not thoſe who ſit on the bench ſworn to do juſtice? Is there not a man among you that will do the thing that is right?</hi> Whereupon <hi>John Stephens,</hi> of <hi>Lipeat</hi> (then chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) cry'd out, <hi>Who are you, ſirrah? What is your name?</hi> My father telling him his name, he ſaid, <hi>I am glad I have you here: I have heard of you: you deſerve a ſtone doublet: there's many an honeſter man than you hang'd. It may be ſo,</hi> anſwered my father: but what do'ſt thou think becomes of thoſe who hang honeſt men? <hi>The Juſtice reply'd,</hi> I'll ſend you to priſon; and if any inſurrection or tumult be in the land, I'll come and cut your throat firſt with my own ſword; for I fear to ſleep in my bed, leſt ſuch fanatics ſhould come and cut my throat: and, ſnatching up a ball of wax, he violently throw'd it at my father; who avoided <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e blow by ſtepping aſide. Their mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus's were then made, and they were all ſent to priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007113_0008_102AFEC7B4B5B6A0"/>
The ſame evening my uncle <hi>Solliſs,</hi> who was one of the juſtices on the bench, came to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and, calling for my father, asked him if he was willing to have his liberty to go home to his wife and family? <hi>Upon what terms uncle?</hi> ſaid my father.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Upon ſuch terms, that the jailor open the door, and let you out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>What! without entering into any recognizance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>Then I accept of my liberty. But admire, uncle, how thou and ſeveral others could ſit upon the bench as with your thumbs in your mouths, when you ſhould ſpeak a word in behalf of the innocent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt learn to live under a law, couſin. And if you will accept of your liberty till next ſeſſions, you may have it: if not, ſtay where you are.</p>

            <p>So they parted; and on the morrow my father went home, having alſo the jailor's leave.</p>
            <p>In the night a concern came upon him, with ſuch weight, that it made him tremble till the bed ſhook under him. My mother asking the reaſon of it, he anſwered: <hi>The Lord requires hard things of me: if it would pleaſe him, I had rather lay down my life than obey him in what he requires at my hands.</hi> To which my mother reply'd: <q>If thou art fully perſuaded the Lord requires it of thee, I would not have thee diſobey him; for he will require nothing of us but what he will enable us to go through: Therefore we have good cauſe to truſt in him.</q> 
               <hi>On which he ſaid,</hi> I muſt go to this <hi>John Stephens,</hi> who is my great enemy, and ſent me to priſon, where he ſaid he would ſecure me; and as my uncle <hi>Solliſs</hi> in kindneſs has 
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007113_0009_102AFECA4528E470"/>
given me leave to come home, I can expect no favor from him, if I now go and run myſelf into the mouth of my adverſary. But I muſt go whatever I ſuffer. He aroſe, and prepared for his journey; but durſt eat or drink nothing. When he mounted his horſe, the command of the Lord was unto him, <hi>Remember</hi> Lot'<hi>s wife: look not back.</hi> So on he rode very chearfully 8 or 9 miles, till he came within ſight of the juſtice's houſe, and then he let in the reaſoner, who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned him out of all his courage, preſenting to his mind, that his uncle <hi>Solliſs</hi> and his neighbors would ſay he had no regard for his wife and family, thus to puſh himſelf into the hands of his greateſt enemy. This brought ſuch a cloud over his mind, that he alighted off his horſe, and ſat down upon the ground, to ſpread his cauſe before the Lord. After he had waited ſometime in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the Lord appeared, and diſhpated the cloud, and his word was to him, <hi>Go, and I will go with thee, and will give thee a threſhing inſtrument, and thou ſhalt threſh the mountains</hi> Now he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly overcome with the love of God: and I have often heard him ſay, he was filled like a veſſel that wanted vent, and ſaid in his heart, <hi>Thy preſence is enough,</hi> proceeding to the houſe with great ſatisfaction. It being pretty early in the morning, and ſeeing the ſtable door open, he went to the groom, and deſired him to put up his horſe. While this was doing, the juſtice's ſon and his clerk came up, the latter roughly ſaid, <q>I thought you had been in <hi>Glouceſter</hi> caſtle.</q>

            </sp>
            <p>They went in; and my father following them, they bid him take a turn in the hall, and they would acquaint the juſtice of his being there. He was ſoon call'd in; and my father no ſooner ſaw him, but he believed the Lord had been at work upon him: for, as he had behaved to him with the fierceneſs of a lion before, he now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like a lamb, meeting him with a pleaſant countenance, and, taking him by the hand, ſaid, <q>Friend <hi>Haywood,</hi> how do you do?</q> My father anſwered, <hi>pretty well</hi>; and then proceeded thus; <hi>I am come in the fear and dread of heaven, to warn thee to repent of thy wickedneſs with ſpeed, leſt the Lord cut the thread of thy life, and ſend thee to the pit that is bottomleſs. I am come to warn thee, in great love, whether thou wilt hear or forbear, and to preach the everlaſting Goſpel to thee.</hi> The juſtice reply'd, <q>You are a welcome meſſenger to me; that is what I have long deſired to hear.</q> 
               <hi>The everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel</hi> (returned my father) <hi>is the ſame that</hi> God <hi>ſent his ſervant</hi> John <hi>to declare, when he ſaw an angel flying through the midſt of beaven, ſaying with a loud voice,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Fear God, and give glory to his name, and worſhip him who made heaven and earth, the ſea, and the fountains of water,</hi>
               </q> The juſtice then cauſed my father to ſit down by him on a couch; and ſaid, <q>I believe your meſſage is of God, and I receive it as ſuch. I am ſorry I have done you wrong: and I will never wrong you more. I would pray you to forgive me, and to pray to God to forgive me.</q> After 
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007113_0011_102AFECD6009D3F8"/>
much more diſcourſe, he offered my father the beſt entertainment his houſe afforded; but my father excuſed himſelf from eating or drinking with him at that time, expreſſing his kind accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his love; and ſo in much love they parted.</p>
            <p>The ſame day <hi>William Dewsberry</hi> had appointed a meeting at <hi>Tedbury</hi>; whether my mother went. But ſhe was ſo concerned on account of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's exerciſe, that ſhe could receive little benefit from the meeting. After the meeting was ended, <hi>William Dewsberry</hi> walk'd to and fro in a long paſſage, groaning in ſpirit; and by and by came up to my mother, and, tho' ſhe was a ſtranger to him, he laid his hand upon her head, and ſaid, <q>Woman thy ſorrow is great: I ſorrow with thee.</q> Then walking a little to and fro, as before, he came to her again, and ſaid, <q>Now the time is come, <hi>that thoſe who marry, muſt be as tho' they married not, and thoſe who have husbands, as tho' they had none</hi>; for the Lord calls for all to be offered up.</q> By this ſhe ſaw the Lord had given him a ſenſe of her great burthen; for ſhe had not diſcovered her exerciſe to any: And it gave her ſuch eaſe in her mind, that ſhe went home rejoicing in the Lord. She no ſooner got home, but ſhe found my father returned from <hi>Lypeat,</hi> where his meſſage was received in ſuch love, as was far from their expectation: the ſenſe of which, brake them into tears, in conſideration of the great goodneſs of God, in ſo eminently making way for, and helping them that day.</p>
            <p>At the next ſeſſions my father and the three <hi>friends</hi> appear'd in court; where, as ſoon as juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>Stephens</hi> eſpy'd them, he call'd to my father, and ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>John,</hi> I accept of your appearance, and diſcharge you, and the court diſcharges you. 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007113_0012_102AFECEEF253AA8"/>
You may go about your buſineſs.</q> But my father thinking his work not done, did not haſten out of court. Upon which the clerk demanded his fees. <hi>What! doſt mean money?</hi> ſays my father. <q>Yes: what do you think I mean?</q> ſays the clerk. My father reply'd, <hi>I don't know that I ow any man here any thing but love, and muſt I now purchaſe my liberty with money? I dont accept it on ſuch terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <stage>(to the chairman.)</stage> An't pleaſe your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>John</hi> won't pay the fees of the court.</p>

               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I don't accept my liberty on ſuch terms.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then he was ordered to priſon with the three <hi>friends.</hi> But in the evening the clerk diſcharged them, and ever after carried himſelf very kindly to my father.</p>
            <p>He was afterwards caſt into priſon at <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> by <hi>George Bull,</hi> vicar of <hi>Upper Siddington,</hi> for tythes. Where was confined at the ſame time, upon the ſame account, <hi>Elizabeth Hewlings</hi> a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, of <hi>Amney,</hi> near <hi>Cirenceſter.</hi> She was a good chriſtian, and ſo good a midwife that her confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a loſs to that ſide of the country; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that lady <hi>Dunch,</hi> of <hi>Down-Amney,</hi> thought it would be an act of charity to the neighborhood to purchaſe her likerty, by paying the prieſt's demand; which ſhe did. She like wiſe came to <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> in a coach, and ſent her footman <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Cornwall,</hi> to the priſon to bring <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to her. And while <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was making ready to go with the man, my father and he fell into a little diſcourſe. He ask'd my father his name, and where his home was; which when my father had told him. <q>What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he, are you that <hi>John Haywood</hi> of <hi>Siddington,</hi> who keeps great conventicles at your houſe?</q> My father

anſwer'd. <hi>The church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>often meets at my houſe. I ſuppoſe I am the man thou meaneſt.</hi> 
               <q>I have often (reply'd <hi>Cornwall</hi>) heard my lady ſpeak of you; and I am ſure ſhe would gladly be acquainted with you:</q> When he returned to his lady, he told her he had met with ſuch a man in the priſon as he believed ſhe would not ſuffer to lie in priſon for conſcience-ſake; informing her withal who he was. She immediately bid him go back and fetch him to her. Accordingly he came to the jail, and told my father his lady want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak with him. My father anſwered; <hi>If any body would ſpeak with me, they muſt come where I am; for I am a priſoner.</hi> 
               <q>Oh (ſaid <hi>Cornwall</hi>) I'll get leave of the jailor for you to go.</q> Which he did. And when they came before the lady, ſhe put on a majeſtic air, to ſee how the <hi>Quaker</hi> would greet her. He went up towards her, and bluntly ſaid, <hi>Woman, wouldſt then ſpeak with me?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>

            <p>Then, ſpeaking to her man, ſhe bid him go to the prieſt's attorney, and tell him ſhe would ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him, and then pay the jailor his fees, and get a horſe for my father to go to <hi>Down-Amney</hi> with her.</p>

            <p>According to his appointment, my father went; and found her very inquiſitive about the things of God, and very attentive to the truths he delivered. She engaged him likewiſe a ſecond time, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with abundance of regard. A third time ſhe bid her man <hi>Cornwall</hi> go to him, and deſire him to appoint a day when he would pay her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother viſit: and then ordered him to go to prieſt <hi>Careleſs,</hi> of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> and deſire him to come and take a dinner with her at the ſame time; and not let either of them know the other was to be there. On the day appointed my father went; and when he had got within ſight of her houſe, he heard a horſe behind him, and looking back, he ſaw the prieſt following him; which made him conclude the lady had projected to bring them together. When the prieſt came up to him, <q>Well overtaken, <hi>John</hi> (ſaid he) how far are you going this way?</q> My father anſwered, <hi>I believe we are both going to the ſame place.</hi> 
               <q>What! (ſaid <hi>Careleſs</hi>) are you going the great houſe?</q> 
               <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid my fathers. <q>Come on then <hi>John,</hi>
               </q> ſaid he. So then they went in together. And the lady being ill in bed, a ſervant went up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her they were come. <q>What! (ſaid ſhe) did they come together?</q> 
               <hi>Yes,</hi> anſwered the ſervant. <q>I admire at that (ſaid ſhe) But do you 
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007113_0016_102AFED86EDAEF20"/>
beckon <hi>John</hi> out, and bring him to me firſt up the back ſtairs.</q> When my father came up, ſhe told him ſhe had been very ill in a fit of the ſtone, and ſaid, <q>I have heard you have done good in many diſtempers.</q>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs I have; but to this of the ſtone I am a ſtranger. Indeed I once knew a man, who lived at eaſe, and fared delicately, as thou may'ſt do, and whilſt he continued in that practice he was much afflicted with that diſtemper. But it pleaſed the Lord to viſit him with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his bleſſed truth, which brought him to a more regular and temperate life, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him more free from it.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>Oh! I know what you aim at.

            <p>She then had the parſon up: and after a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment or two, ſhe ſaid, I made bold to ſend for you to take an ordinary dinner with me, tho' I am diſappointed of your company by my illneſs.

me of popery, in holding this doctrine, which thou thy ſelf haſt confeſs'd too? If I am like a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> thou art, by thy own confeſſion, as like a <hi>Papiſt</hi> as I am. And if it be a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doctrine and dangerous tenet in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is it not the ſame in thy ſelf? Thou told'ſt me I miſtook thee; but haſt not thou miſtaken thy ſelf in condemning thine own acknowledged opinion when utter'd by me? But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt fail'd in making me out to be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in this particular, can'ſt thou do it in any thing elſe?</q> Upon this the prieſt being mute, my father thus proceeded: <q>Well! tho' thou haſt fall'd in proving me like them, it need not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from ſhewing thee to be ſo in many things. For inſtance, you build houſes and conſecrate them, calling them churches; as do the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> You hang bells in 'em, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate 'em, calling them by the names of faints; ſo do they. The pope and the prieſts of the <hi>Roman</hi> church wear ſurplices, gowns, caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocks, &amp;c. calling them their ornaments; here thou haſt the like; and do'ſt thou not ſtile them thy ornaments? You conſecrate the ground where you interr your dead, calling it holy ground; ſo do they. In ſhort, thou art like a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in ſo many things, he need be a wiſe man to diſtinguiſh betwixt them and thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At this the prieſt appear'd uneaſy, and ſaid to the lady, <q>Madam, I muſt beg your excuſe; for there's to be a lecture this afternoon, and I muſt be there.</q> She preſt him to ſtay to dinner, but he earneſty deſired to be excuſed. So a ſlice or two being cut off of the ſpit, he eat, and took his leave.</p>
            <p>The lady then ſaid to my father, had ſhe not ſeen it, ſhe could not have believed Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>, but now I muſt tell you, I am ſo far of your opinion, that if you'll let me know when you have a meeting at your houſe, and ſomebody to preach (not a ſilent meeting) I'll come and hear 'em my ſelf. My father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he expected ſhe would be as good as her word. Not long after came two friends to my father's houſe; and tho' the weather was very ſevere, he found he could not be eaſy without acquainting her with it. So he went to her houſe, but ſhe ſeem'd a little ſurprized, ſaying, <q>What's your will now, <hi>John</hi>?</q> He imformed her of the two friends, and their intention of having a meeting at his houſe. <q>How can you expect (ſaid ſhe) I ſhould go out ſuch weather as this? You know I ſeldom ſtir out of my chamber, and to go ſo far may endanger my health.</q> My father returned, <q>I would not have thee make excuſes, as ſome of old did, and were not found worthy. Thou knoweſt time is none of ours, and we know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may have the like opportunity again. The ſnow need not much incommode thee: thou may'ſt be quickly in thy coach, and, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the glaſſes, may be pretty warm; and when thou comeſt to my houſe, I know my wife will do her beſt for thee.</q> So ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her coach and ſix to be got ready (for the diſtance was ſeven miles) ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>John's</hi> like death, he'll not be deny'd,</q> My father came along with her; and during the time of ſilence in the meeting, ſhe appear'd ſomething reſtleſs; but was very attentive whilſt either of the friends were ſpeaking. She was very well pleaſed after the meeting, and ſat at table with the friends. 
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007113_0021_102AFEE49C5EC1A0"/>
While the reſt ſat ſilent, ſhe would be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiſpering to my mother, till one of them ſpake a few words before meat. She was aſham'd, and told my mother when ſhe was among the great, ſhe was accounted a wiſe woman; but now (ſaid ſhe) I am among you <hi>Luakers,</hi> I am a very fool. Preſently after dinner ſhe return'd home, and came ſeveral times to the meeting afterward; and I am fully perſuaded ſhe was convinced of the truth; but going up to <hi>London,</hi> ſhe was there taken ill, and died.</p>
            <p>Her man, <hi>Alexander Cornwall,</hi> was convinced of the truth, and was afterwards a priſoner with my father in <hi>Glouceſter</hi> caſtle; where the jailor was very cruel to them, ſometimes putting them into the common jail among felons, and other times he would hire a tinker (who lay for his ſees) to trouble them in the night by playing on his hautboy. One time in particular my father being concerned to ſpeak to him in the dread and power of God, it ſtruck him to ſuch a degree, that he dropt the inſtrument out of his hand, and would never take it into hand upon that occaſion any more. When the jailor ask'd him why he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued it, he anſwered, <q>They are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the living God, and I'll never play more to diſturb them, if you hang me up at the door for it.</q> 
               <q>What! (ſaid the jailor) are you bewitch'd too? I'll turn you out of the caſtle.</q> Which he did; and the friends who were there priſoners rais'd him ſome money, cloath'd him, and away he went.</p>
            <p>Some time after my father had three conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with — <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in the following manner. An apparitor came to cite my father to appear at the biſhop's court: but he told my father he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

him to come, leſt they ſhould enſnare him, and ſend him to priſon. At the ſame time they cited a ſervant of my father's, named <hi>John Overall.</hi> My father went at the time appointed, without his ſervant: and when his name was call'd over, he anſwered to it. The diſcourſe that occurr'd was in ſubſtance as follows:—</p>

               <p>No; I no more believe my houſe to be a <hi>church,</hi> than I believe what you call ſo to be one. I call the people of God the church of God, whereſoever they are met to worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. And when I ſay the church comes to me, I mean the aſſembly of ſuch worſhippers, who frequently meet at my houſe. I do not call that a church which you do, which is made of wood and ſtone, that is but the workmanſhip of mens hands: whereas the true church conſiſts of living ſtones, and is built up by Chriſt a ſpiritual houſe to God.</p>

ſatisfy him, to come to him, and he would give him full ſatisfaction.—Some time after the biſhop ſent his bailiff to take my father: but he was then gone to <hi>Briſtol</hi> with <hi>George Fox.</hi> The officers came ſeveral times and ſearched the houſe for him, pretending they only wanted him for a ſmall treſpaſs, which would ſoon be made up, if they could ſee him. My mother anſwered ſhe didn't believe any neighbor he had would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him upon ſuch an account; for if by chance any of his cattle treſpaſs'd upon any, he would readily make 'em ſatisfaction, without further trouble. Which they very well knew. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe always treated them civilly, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſet meat and drink before 'em. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtaying away longer than was expected, they imagin'd he abſconded for fear of 'em; and therefore offer'd my mother, if ſhe would give them twenty ſhillings, to let him come home for a month.

Upon this they flew into a rage, and ſaid, they would have him if he were above ground; for none could pardon him but the king.—My father returning home thro' <hi>Tedbury,</hi> was there inform'd that the bailiffs had been about his houſe almoſt ever ſince he went from home. He therefore contrived to come home after day-light, when he came into his own grounds, the moon ſhining bright, he ſpy'd the ſhadow of a man, and ask'd, who's there? 'It is I,' ſays the man.</p>

            <p>My father came home, and deſired us not to let the bailiffs in upon him that night, that he might have an opportunity of taking counſel on his pillow. In the morning he told my mother what he had ſeen that night in a viſion. "I thought (ſaid he) I was walking a fine, pleaſant green way; but it was narrow, and had a wall on each ſide of it. In my way lay ſomething like a bear, but more dreadful. The ſight of him put me to a ſtand. A man ſeeing me ſurpriz'd, came to me with a ſmiling countenance, and ſaid, <hi>Why art thou afraid, friend? he is chain'd, and can't hurt thee.</hi> I tho't I made anſwer, <hi>The way is ſo narrow, I can't paſs by but he may reach me.—Don't be afraid</hi> (ſays the man) <hi>he can't hurt thee.</hi> I ſaw he ſpake in great goodwill, and thought his face ſhone like the face of an angel. Upon which I took courage, and ſteping forward, laid my hand upon his head."—The conſtruction be made of this to my mother was: <hi>Truth is a narrow way; and this biſhop lies in my way: I muſt go to him, whatever I ſuffer.</hi> So he aroſe, and ſet forward, and call'd upon <hi>Amariah Dreweit,</hi> a friend of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceſter,</hi> to accompany him.

The common-prayer-book was then become (even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the clergy) like an old almanack, very few regarding it in our country. There were two or three prieſts indeed, who ſtood honeſtly to their principles, and ſuffered pretty much; but the far greater number turn'd with the tide: and we have reaſon to believe, that if <hi>Oliver</hi> would have put maſs into their mouths, they would have conform'd even to that for their bellies.</p>

               <speaker>John Roberts.</speaker>
               <p>No, by no means. But what religion was that you were afraid to venture your throats for? Be it known unto thee, I ventur'd my throat for my religion in <hi>Oliver's</hi> days, as I do now.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Our religion, as thou may'ſt read in the ſcripture (<hi>John</hi> iv.) was ſet up by Chriſt himſelf, between ſixteen and ſeventeen hundred years ago: and he had full power to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the true religion in his church, when he told the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that neither at that mountain, nor yet at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the place of true worſhip. They worſhipped they knew not what. For ſaid he, God is a Spirit, <hi>and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is our religion, and hath ever been the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of all thoſe who have worſhipped God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably thro' the ſeveral ages ſince down to this time; and will be the religion of the true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual worſhippers of God to the world's end; a religion perform'd by the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God, becauſe God is a ſpirit; a religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Chriſt himſelf before the maſs-book, ſervice-book or directory, or any of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and traditions of men, which in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now will you be ſo honeſt as this carpenter? You are men who pretend to know more of light, life, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and things pertaining to the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than we do: I would ask in how long a time you would undertake to teach us as much as you know? and what ſhall we give you, that we may be once free from our maſters? But here you keep us always learning, that we may be always paying you. Plainly 'tis a very cheat.

(This piece of ground my father had given to friends for that purpoſe; it lay at the lower end of his orchard.) My father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yes; tho' we are againſt pride, we think it commendable to be decent.</p>

               <p>But there is one thing among you, which I did not expect to ſee; I think it looks a little ſuperſtitious; I mean thoſe grave-ſtones which are placed at the head and feet of your graves.</p>

               <p>That I conſeſs is what I cannot much plead for; but it was permitted to gratify ſome who had their relations there interred. We, notwithſtanding, propoſe to have them taken up e'er long, and converted to ſome better uſe. But I deſire thee to take notice, we had it from among you, and I have obſerved in many things wherein we have taken you for our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern you have led us wrong; and therefore we are now reſolved, with the help of God, not to follow you one ſtep further.</p>

               <p>I had a poor neighbor, who had a wife and ſix children, and whom the chief men about us permitted to keep ſix or ſeven cows upon the waſte, which were the principal ſupport of his family, and preſerv'd 'em from becoming chargeable to the pariſh. One very ſtormy night the cattle were left in the yard, as uſual; but could not be found in the morning. The man and his ſons had ſought 'em to no purpoſe: and after they had been loſt 4 days, his wife came to me, and, in a great deal of grief, cry'd, O Lord!

maſter <hi>Haywood,</hi> we are undone! my husband and I muſt go a begging in our old age! we have loſt all our cows! my husband and the boys have been round the country, and can hear nothing of them, I'll down on my bare knees if you'll ſtand our friend? I deſired ſhe would not be in ſuch an agony, and told her ſhe ſhould not down on her knees to me; but I would gladly help them in what I could. I know, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> you are a good man, and God will hear your prayers. I deſire thee (ſaid I) to be ſtill and quiet in thy mind; perhaps thy husband or ſon may hear of 'em to day: if not, let thy husband get a horſe, and come to me to-morrow morning as ſoon as he will; and I think, if it pleaſe God, to go with him to ſeek them. The woman ſeem'd tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy, crying, <hi>Then we ſhall have our cows again!</hi> Her faith being ſo ſtrong, brought the greater exerciſe upon me, with ſtrong cries unto the Lord, that he would be pleaſed to make me inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in his hand, for the help of the poor family. In the morning early comes the old man, <hi>In the name of God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which way ſhall we go and ſeek them?</hi> I being deeply concerned in my mind, did not anſwer him till he had thrice repeated it; and then I anſwered, "In the name of God we will go to ſeek them (and ſaid before I was aware) we will go to <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and at the horſe fair we ſhall find them." When I had ſpoken the words, I was much troubled leſt they ſhould not prove true. It was very early, and the firſt man we ſaw, I ask'd him if he had ſeen any ſtray milch cows thereabouts? <hi>What manner of cattle are they?</hi> ſaid he. And the old man deſcribing of their marks and number, he told us there were ſome ſtood chewing their cuds in their horſe fair; but thinking they belonged to ſome in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood, 
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007113_0049_102AFF1D44E904E0"/>
he did not take particular notice of them. When we came to the place, the old man found 'em to be his; but ſuffered his tranſports of joy to riſe ſo high, that I was aſhamed of his behavior; for he fell a hallowing, and threw up his mountier cap in the air ſeveral times, 'till he raiſed the neighbors out of their beds to ſee what was the matter. <hi>O</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I had loſt my cows four or five days ago, and thought I ſhould never ſee them again; and this honeſt neighbor of mine, told me this morning by his own fire ſide, nine miles off, that here I ſhould find them, and here I have them!</hi> Then up goes his cap again. I begged of the poor man to be quiet, and take his cows home, and be thankful, as indeed I was, being reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently bowed in my ſpirit before the Lord, in that he was pleaſed to put the words of truth into my mouth. And the man drove his cattle home, to the great joy of his family.</p>

               <p>The truth of the ſtory is this: a neighbor of mine, one <hi>John Curtis</hi> (at that time a domeſtic of <hi>George Bull's</hi>) kept ſome ſheep of his own; and it ſo fell out that he loſt them for ſome days; but happening to ſee me, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went pretty much abroad, he deſired me if I ſhould ſee them any where in my travels, to let him know of it. It happened the next day, as I was riding towards my own field, my dogs being with me, put up a hare, and ſeeing they were likely to kill her, I rode up to take them off, that ſhe might eſcape, and by meer accident, I eſpy'd J.

               </p>
               <p>I ſaid, the horſe being a ſtranger in the place, 'tis very likely he might endeavor to bend homewards, and looſe himſelf in the <hi>Furſen Leaſes</hi>; for there are a great many acres under that name, which are ſo overgrown with furſe-buſhes, that a horſe may lie there conceal'd a long time. I therefore adviſed him to get a good deal of company, and ſearch the places diligently, as if they were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a hare; which if he did, I told him I was of the mind he would find him. The man did take my advice, and found him. And where's the cunning of all this? 'Tis no more than their own reaſon might have directed them to, had they properly conſidered the caſe.</p>

At length I found means, at an aſſize time, to acquaint the judge (by letter) of his illegal proceedings. In conſequence of which we were ordered to be put on the kalender, had a hearing, and were acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

here no longer. Shall I come here to hear and determine cauſes, and ſhall you keep men in priſon during your pleaſure, and not put their names in the kalender?" The jailor coming out of the caſtle was heard by the turnkey to ſay, "It was about <hi>Haywood</hi> that I was ſo ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the judge; and if ever he comes into the caſtle again, he ſhall never come out alive." Upon which the turnkey took an opportunity to find me out, and informing me of it, ſaid, 'I would not have you by any means come back to the caſtle to-night, to fetch any of your things; for if you do, he'll certainly detain you for his fees. I'll take equal care of your things, as if yourſelf were preſent to do it.' I acknowledged his kindneſs, and went home. When the jailor return'd to the caſtle, he ask'd the turnkey where the <hi>Quakers</hi> were? He anſwer'd, he tho't it his buſineſs to take care of the felons, and to leave the <hi>Quakers</hi> to him. Not long after, being conſtable I ſecur'd a felon who broke out of the caſtle, and ſent the turnkey notice of it. He coming over to fetch him back, begg'd, if by any means I could prevent it, that I would not come any more a priſoner to the caſtle whil'ſt his maſter was jailor; "For (ſays he) if you do, he ſwears you ſhall never go out alive; and that hour you come in, I'll leave the caſtle; for I can't ſtay there to ſee you abuſed." Does he ſtill ſay ſo? ſaid I. Yes, he does, ſaid he. "Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me to him (ſaid I) and tell him from me, I ſhall never ſee his face any more! Soon after it pleaſed God to take him away by death; and in a little time I was had priſoner there again.</p>

Which being done, my father ſaid, 'The ſeats are our own, and we may as well ſit as ſtand.' So the friends fat down: but preſently after they were broken up and diſpers'd.—Not long after <hi>John Timbrel,</hi> a friend, of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> wrote to juſtice <hi>Burcher,</hi> and told him (amongſt other things) he had till then a better opinion of him than to think he would ſet his hand to ſuch a work; and that he was ſorry that he ſhould be one in it.

The conſtable who had it to ſerve was ſo civil to inform him of it, and tell him he would not ſerve it on him till his market was over. However, he left his market, came to my father, told him of the warrant, and ask'd his advice.

But at length, ſuſpecting ſomething more than ordinary, ſhe made a cloſer inſpection; and, perceiving his countenance chang'd, ſhe threw open the curtains in a great ſurpriſe. On which, he juſt flaſh'd open his eyes, but ſaid not a word. She ask'd him how he did? but he made no anſwer. Which made her cry more earneſtly; 'Pray, ſir, how do you do? How is it with you? For God's ſake tell me. And all he ſaid to her was, Oh! theſe <hi>Quakers!</hi> Oh! theſe <hi>Quakers!</hi> Would to God I had never had a hand againſt theſe

            <p>Sir JOHN ſeem'd ſurpriſed at this relation, and did not contradict it in the leaſt; which, it is reaſonable to think, he would, and with reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, had it not been true.

But afterwards, taking a walk together in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-green, the breaſt of Sir JOHN being filled with reſentment, he ſaid, Sir ROBERT, you gave me the lye; and I will have ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>—And ſo he had; for he ran him through, in at the belly, and out at the back; on which he fell. Sir ROBERT ſtepp'd up to him, unbutton'd his cloaths, tore his ſhirt down, and gently drew out his ſword; and then, after he had well ſuck'd the wound, taking his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, he roll'd up the corners of it hard, and thruſt it into the orifice: then buttoning of his cloaths, he lifted him up, and deſired him while he was able, that he would acquaint the people of the houſe that his death was owing to his own ſeeking. And when they were come about him, he was ſo generous as to ſay, "If I die, Sir ROBERT is clear; for if he had not kill'd me, I would have kill'd him." Sir ROBERT procur'd him Surgeons: and, after a while, when great pain came upon him, he lamented himſelf much, and ſaid, "It was the juſt hand of God upon me for meddling with the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But, if he will be pleaſed to ſpare me, and try me again, I'll never have a hand againſt them any more. For <hi>Haywood</hi> told me if I went on perſecuting, the ſame hand that overtook my father would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, before I was aware.

The ſteward then told him, 'Pleaſe your worſhip, if you don't ſend for <hi>John Haywood,</hi> I believe you will looſe all your cattie; for now the bull is ſick, and off his meat; and I don't find this man does them any good.

When he has done what he can, pay him, and diſmiſs him. So my father was ſent for, and went (having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that great chriſtian leſſon to return good for evil) and did his beſt for 'em. When he had done, as he was wiping his hands in the entry, the juſtice undeſignedly came by him; and, ſeeing he could not avoid his notice, ſaid, So, <hi>John,</hi> You have done ſomething for my cattle, I ſuppoſe.

Some officers being ſent to her houſe to diſtrain her goods, for being at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſhe was 20 miles from the place.

               </gap> ſaid to be true. When they came before him, and ſhew'd him the warrant, "What a raſcal (ſaid he) is this <hi>Parſons!</hi> Here he ſays he'll take his oath that my tenant was convicted by him of being at a conventicle in <hi>Glouceſter</hi> caſtle ſuch a day of the month; and I'll take my oath ſhe was at home at the ſame time, which is 20 miles off. If you touch any of her goods by virtue of this warrant, be it at your peril. I'll aſſure you if you do, I'll ſtick cloſe to your skirts." <hi>Officer.</hi> What can be done in this caſe?

it? <hi>Landlord.</hi> Carry it back to Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> and tell him to wipe his breech with it; and I'll bear you out in it. So they returned, without giving her any further trouble.—An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other warrant was iſſued out againſt <hi>Francis Boy,</hi> phyſician, on the ſame account, and of the ſame value, who was likewiſe abſent at the time of his pretended conviction. When the officers came to disſtrain his goods, he was not at home. So his cattle were take away to the value of between 20 and 30 l. He afterwards, on inſpection, found by his books, that he was attending a gentleman the time he was ſaid to be convicted. To this gentleman he went, and enquired of him if he could remember the day he attended him? The gentleman anſwer'd, 'He had good reaſon to remember it; for (ſaid he) if you had not done what you did for me that day, I believe I ſhould have been now in my grave.' He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the gentleman of the reaſon that induced him to give him that trouble. 'Well (replied he) I adviſe you to appeal to the next quarter-ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for redreſs; and you may aſſure yourſelf I'll endeavor to ſerve you what lies in my power; for I'll take my oath before any judge or bench of juſtices in <hi>England,</hi> that you was with me that day.' But it ſo fell out that he had no occaſion to appeal. For it ſoon took air that he had ſuch a ſubſtantial evidence in his favor; and his cattle were returned before the ſeſſions.</p>
