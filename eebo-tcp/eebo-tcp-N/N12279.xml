            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <l>"What's in the name of <hi>LORD</hi> that I ſhould fear,</l>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer. His concerns are with all mankind, and though he cannot command their obedience, he can aſſign them their duty. The Republic of Letters is more ancient than monarchy, and of far higher character in the world than the vaſſal court of Britain; he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt reaſon is a real rebel, but he that in defence of reaſon, rebels againſt tyranny, has a better title to "DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENDER OF THE FAITH" than George the Third.</p>
            <p>AS a military man your Lordſhip may hold out the ſword of war, and call it the "ULTIMA RATIO RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUM:" <hi>The laſt Reaſon of Kings;</hi> we in return can ſhow you the ſword of juſtice, and call it, <q>The beſt Scourge of Tyrants.</q> The firſt of theſe two may threaten, or even frighten, for a while, and caſt a ſickly languor over an inſulted people, but reaſon will ſoon recover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, and reſtore them again to tranquil fortitude. Your Lordſhip, I find, has now commenced author and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a proclamation; I too have publiſhed a criſis; as they ſtand, they are the antipodes of each other; both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not riſe at once, and one of them muſt deſcend: And ſo quick is the revolution of things, that your Lordſhip's performance, I ſee, has already fallen many degrees from its firſt place, and is now juſt viſible on the edge of the political horizon.</p>
            <p>IT is ſurpriſing to what pitch of infatuation blind folly and obſtinacy will carry mankind, and your Lordſhip's drowſy proclamation is a proof that it does not even quit them in their ſleep. Perhaps you thought America too was taking a nap, and therefore, choſe, like ſatan to Eve, to whiſper the deluſion ſoftly, leſt you ſhould awaken her.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015493_0003_0F998654A01AC3E8"/>
This Continent, Sir, is too extenſive to ſleep all at once, and too watchful, even in its ſlumbers, not to ſtartle at the unhallowed foot of an invader. You may iſſue your proclamations, and welcome, for we have learned to <hi>"re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ourſelves"</hi> and ſcorn the inſulting ruffian that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys you. America for your deceaſed brother's ſake would gladly have ſhown you reſpect, and it is a new aggravation to her feelings that <hi>Howe</hi> ſhould be forgetful, and raiſe his ſword againſt thoſe, who at their own charge raiſed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to his brother. But your maſter has commanded, and you have not enough of nature left to refuſe. Surely! there muſt be ſomething ſtrangely degenerating in the love of monarchy, that can ſo completely wear a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to lick the duſt that kings have trod upon. A few more years, ſhould you ſurvive them, will beſtow on you the title of an old man, and in ſome hour of future reflection you may probably find the fitneſs of Woolſey's deſpairing penitence, <q>Had I ſerved my God as faithfully as I have ſerved my king, he would not thus have forſaken me in my old age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE character you appear to us in is truly ridiculous. Your friends, the Tories, announced your coming with high deſcriptions of your unlimited powers; but your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation has given them the lie, by ſhewing you to be a Commiſſioner without authority. Had your powers been ever ſo great, they were nothing to us, farther than we pleaſed; becauſe we had the ſame right which other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had, to do what we thought was beſt. "THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA," will ſound as pompouſly in the world or in hiſtory as <hi>"The Kingdom of Great-Britain;"</hi> The character of <hi>General Waſhington</hi> will fill a page with as much luſtre as that of <hi>Lord Howe;</hi> and the <hi>Congreſs</hi> have as much right to command the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> of London, to deſiſt from legiſlation, as <hi>they</hi> or <hi>you</hi> have to command the Congreſs. Only ſuppoſe how laughable ſuch an edict would appear from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but turn the tables upon yourſelf, and you will ſee how your proclamation is received here. Having thus placed you in a proper poſition in which you may have a full view of folly and learn to deſpiſe it, I hold up to you, for that purpoſe, the following quotation from your own lunarian proclamation "And We (Lord Howe and General Howe) "do command, (and in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015493_0004_0F998657390BF930"/>
name forſooth) <q>all ſuch perſons as are aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under the name of general or provincial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes, Committees, Conventions, or other Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by whatever name or names known or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, to deſiſt and ceaſe from all ſuch treaſonable actings and doings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOU introduce your proclamation by referring to your declarations of the 14th of July and 19th of September. In the laſt of theſe, you ſunk yourſelf below the character of a private gentleman. That I may not ſeem to accuſe you unjuſtly I ſhall ſtate the circumſtance: By a verbal invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours communicated to Congreſs by General Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livan, then a priſoner on his parole, you ſignified your deſire of conferring with ſome members of that body as private gentlemen. It was beneath the dignity of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Congreſs to pay any regard to a meſſage that at beſt was but a genteel affront, and had too much of the miniſterial complexion of tampering with private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and which might probably have been the caſe, had the gentlemen who were deputed on that buſineſs, poſſeſſed that eaſy kind of virtue which an Engliſh courtier is ſo truly diſtinguiſhed by. Your requeſt however was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, for honeſt men are naturally more tender of their civil than their political fame. The interview ended as every ſenſible man thought it would; for your Lordſhip knows, as well as the writer of the Criſis, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the king of England to promiſe the repeal, or even the reviſal, of any acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part, you had nothing to ſay, more than to requeſt, in the room of demanding, the entire ſurrender of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and then, if that was complied with, to promiſe that the inhabitants ſhould eſcape with their lives. This was the upſhot of the conference. You informed the conferees that you were two months in ſoliciting theſe powers. We aſk, what powers? for as Commiſſioner you have none. If you mean the power of pardoning, it is an oblique proof that your maſter was determined to ſacrifice all before him; and that you were two months in diſſuading him from his purpoſe. Another evidence of his ſavage obſtinacy! From your own account of the matter we may juſtly draw theſe two concluſions; firſt, that you ſerve a monſter; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that never was a commiſſioner ſent on a more fooliſh errand than yourſelf. This plain language may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015493_0005_0F99865824C86990"/>
ſound uncoothly to an ear viciated by courtly refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but words were made for uſe, and the fault lies in deſerving them, or the abuſe in applying them unfairly.</p>
            <p>SOON after your return to New-York you publiſhed a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill againſt the Congreſs; for it was certainly ſtepping out of the line of common ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, firſt to ſcreen your national pride by ſoliciting an interview with them as private gentlemen, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to endeavour to deceive the multitude by making an hand bill attack on the whole body of the Congreſs; you got them together under one name, and abuſed them under another. But the king you ſerve and the cauſe you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port afford you ſo few inſtances of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your ſituation the Congreſs pardoned the inſult by taking no notice of it.</p>
            <p>YOU ſay in that hand bill, <q>that they, the Congreſs, diſavowed every purpoſe for reconciliation not conſonant with their extravagant and inadmiſſible claim of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</q> Why, God bleſs me! what have you to do with our Independence? we aſk no leave of yours to ſet it up; we aſk no money of yours to ſupport it; we can do better without your fleets and armies than with them; you may ſoon have enough to do to protect yourſelves without being burthened with us. We are very willing to be at peace with you, to buy of you and ſell to you, and, like young beginners in the world, to work for our own living; therefore, why do you put yourſelves out of caſh, when we know you cannot ſpare it, and we do not deſire you to run into debt? I am willing, Sir, you ſhould ſee your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in every view I can place it, and for that reaſon deſcend ſometimes to tell you in jeſt what I wiſh you to ſee in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. But to be more ſerious with you, why do you ſay "their" Independence? To ſet you right, Sir, we tell you, that the Independency is <hi>ours</hi> not <hi>theirs.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs were authoriſed by every State on the Continent to publiſh it to all the world, and in ſo doing are not to be conſidered as the inventors, but only as the heralds that proclaimed it, or the office from which the ſenſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple received a legal form; and it was as much as any or all their heads were worth, to have treated with you on the ſubject of ſubmiſſion under any name whatever. But we know the men in whom we have truſted; can England ſay the ſame of her parliament?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015493_0006_0F99865882FCA218"/>I come now more particularly to your proclamation of the 30th of November laſt. Had you gained an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over all the armies of America, and then put forth a proclamation, offering (what you call) mercy, your conduct would have had ſome ſpecious ſhow of humanity; but to creep by ſurpriſe into a province, and there endeavour to terrify and ſeduce the inhabitants from their juſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the reſt by promiſes, which you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both cruel and unmanly: Cruel in its effects; becauſe, unleſs you can keep all the ground you have marched over, how are you, in the words of your proclamation, to ſecure to your proſelytes "the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their property?" What are to become either of your new adopted ſubjects, or your old friends the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Mountholly, and many other places, where you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled with the precipitation of a purſued thief? What, I ſay, are to become of thoſe wretches? What are to become of thoſe who went over to you from this city and State? What more can you ſay to them than <hi>"Shift for yourſelves?"</hi> Or what more can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds over the face of the earth? You may now tell them to take their leave of America and all that once was theirs. Recommend them, for conſolation, to your maſter's court; there perhaps they may make a ſhift to live on the ſcraps of ſome dangling paraſite, and chooſe companions among thouſands like themſelves. A traitor is the fouleſt fiend on earth!</p>
            <p>IN a political ſenſe we ought to thank you for thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing eſtates to the Continent; we ſhall ſoon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war without expence, and grow rich by the ill policy of Lord Howe and the generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Tories. Had you ſet your foot into this city you would have beſtowed eſtates upon us which we never thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were unwilling to ſuſpect. But theſe men, you'll ſay, <hi>"are his majeſty's moſt faithful ſubjects;"</hi> let that honour then be all their fortune, and let his majeſty take them to himſelf.</p>
            <p>I am now thoroughly diſguſted with them; they live in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful caſe and bend their whole minds to miſchief. It ſeems as if GOD had given them over to a ſpirit of infidelity, and that they are open to conviction in no other line but that of puniſhment. It is time to have done with tarring, feathering,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015493_0007_0F99865934881308"/>
carting, and taking ſecurities for their future good behaviour; every ſenſible man muſt feel a conſcious ſhame at ſeeing a poor fellow hawked for a ſhow about the ſtreets, when it is known that he is only the tool of ſome principal villain, biaſed into his offence by the force of falſe reaſoning, or bribed thereto through ſad neceſſity. We diſhonour our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by attacking ſuch trifling characters, while greater ones are ſuffered to eſcape; 'tis our duty to find <hi>them</hi> out, and their proper puniſhment would be to exile them from the Continent for ever. The circle of them is not ſo great as ſome imagine; the influence of a few have tainted many who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circulation of lies among thoſe who are not much in the way of hearing them contradicted, will in time paſs for truth; and the crime lies not in the believer but the inventor. I am not for declaring war againſt every man that appears not ſo warm as myſelf: Difference of conſtitution, temper, habit of ſpeaking and many other things will go a great way in fixing the outward character of a man, yet ſimple honeſty may remain at bottom. Some men have naturally a military turn, and can brave hardſhips and the riſk of life with a chearful face; others have not, no ſlavery appears to them ſo great as the fatigue of arms, and no terror ſo powerful as that of perſonal danger: What can we ſay? We cannot alter nature, neither ought we to puniſh the ſon becauſe the father begot him in a cowardly mood. However, I believe moſt men have more courage than they know of, and that a little at firſt is enough to begin with. I knew the time when I thought that the whiſtling of a cannon ball would have frightened me almoſt to death; but I have ſince tried it, and find I can ſtand it with as little diſcompoſure, and (I believe) with a much eaſier conſcience than your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The ſame dread would return to me again were I in your ſituation, for my ſolemn belief of your cauſe is, that it is helliſh and damnable, and under that conviction every thinking man's heart <hi>muſt</hi> fail him.</p>
            <p>FROM a concern that a good cauſe ſhould be diſhonoured by the leaſt diſunion among us, I ſaid in my former paper, No. 1. <q>That ſhould the enemy now be expelled, I wiſh, with all the ſincerity of a Chriſtian, that the names of Whig and Tory might never more be mentioned;</q> but there is a knot of men among us of ſuch a venomous caſt that they will not admit even one's good wiſhes to act in

their favour. Inſtead of rejoicing that Heaven had, as it were, providentially preſerved this city from plunder and deſtruction, by delivering ſo great a part of the enemy into our hands with ſo little effuſion of blood, they ſtubbornly affected to diſbelieve it till within an hour, nay half an hour, of the priſoners arriving: And the Quakers put forth a teſtimony, dated the 20th of December, ſigned <hi>"John Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton,"</hi> declaring their attachment to the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole ſocieties of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown ſet of men, who claim to themſelves the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the whole; and while the whole ſociety of Quakers admit its validity by a ſilent acknowledgment, it is impoſſible that any diſtinction can be made by the public; and the more ſo becauſe the New-York paper, of the 30th of December, printed by permiſſion of our enemies, ſays that <q>the Quakers begin to ſpeak openly of their attachment to the Britiſh conſtitution.</q> We are certain that we have many friends among them, and wiſh to know them.</note> Theſe men are continually harping on the great ſin of <hi>our</hi> bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay waſte the world in blood and famine, and they, poor fallen ſouls, have nothing to ſay.</p>
            <p>IN ſome future paper I intend to diſtinguiſh between the different kind of perſons who have been denominated <hi>Tories;</hi> for this I am clear in, that all are not ſo who have been called ſo, nor all men Whigs who were once thought ſo; and as I mean not to conceal the name of any true friend when there ſhall be occaſion to mention him, neither will I that of an enemy who ought to be known, let his rank, ſtation or religion be what it may. Much pains have been taken by ſome to ſet your Lordſhip's private character in an amiable light, but as it has chiefly been done by men who know nothing about you, and who are no ways remarkable for their attachment to us, we have no juſt authority for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it. George the Third was impoſed upon us by the ſame arts, but TIME, at length, has done him juſtice, and the ſame fate may probably attend your Lordſhip. Your avowed purpoſe here, is to kill, conquer, plunder, pardon and enſlave; and the ravages of your army through the Jerſies have been marked with as much barbariſm as if you had openly profeſſed yourſelf the prince of ruffians; not even the appearance of humanity has been preſerved either on the march or the retreat of your troops; no general or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

that I could ever learn, has ever been iſſued to prevent or even forbid your troops from robbery wherever they came, and the only inſtance of juſtice, if it can be called ſuch, which has diſtinguiſhed you for impartiality, is, that you treated and plundered all alike; what could not be carried away have been deſtroyed, and mohogony furniture have been deliberately laid on the fire for fuel, rather than the men ſhould be fatigued with cutting wood.<note n="†" place="bottom">As ſome people may doubt the truth of ſuch wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I think it neceſſary to inform, that one of the people called Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this information at the houſe of Mr. Michael Hutchinſon (one of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) who lives near to Trenton ferry, on the Pennſylvania ſide; Mr. Hutchinſon being preſent.</note> There was a time when the Whigs confided much in your ſuppoſed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and the Tories reſted themſelves on your favour; the experiments have now been made, and failed; and every town, nay every cottage, in the Jerſies, where your arms have been, is a teſtimony againſt you. How you may reſt under this ſacrifice of character I know not, but this I know, that you ſleep and riſe with the daily curſes of thouſands upon you; perhaps the miſery which the Tories have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by your proffered mercy may give them ſome claim to their country's pity, and be in the end the beſt favour you could ſhow them.</p>
            <p>IN a folio general order book belonging to Colonel Rohl's battalion, taken at Trenton, and now in the poſſeſſion of the Council of Safety for this State, the following barbarous order is frequently repeated, <q>His Excellency the <hi>COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDER IN CHIEF</hi> orders, that all inhabitants which ſhall be found with arms, not having an officer with them, ſhall be immediately taken and hung up.</q> How many you may thus have privately ſacrificed we know not, and the account can only be ſettled in another world. Your treatment of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, in order to diſtreſs them to enliſt into your infernal ſervice, is not to be equalled by any inſtance in Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe and his brother, whom the Tories and their three quarter kindred the Quakers, or ſome of them at leaſt, have been holding up for patterns of juſtice and mercy!</p>
            <p>A bad cauſe will ever be ſupported by bad means and bad men, and whoever will be at the pains of examining ſtrictly into things, will find that one and the ſame ſpirit
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015493_0010_0F99865B65ACAB28"/>
of oppreſſion and impiety, more or leſs, governs through your whole party in both countries: Not many days ago I accidently fell in company with a perſon of this city, noted for eſpouſing your cauſe, and on my remarking to him, "that it appeared clear to me, by the late providential turn of affairs, that GOD Almighty was viſibly on our ſide," he replied, "We care nothing for that, you may have HIM, and welcome; if we have but enough of the devil on our ſide we ſhall do." However careleſsly this might be ſpoken matters not, 'tis ſtill the inſenſible principle that directs all your conduct, and will at laſt moſt aſſuredly deceive and ruin you.</p>
            <p>IF ever a nation was mad and fooliſh, blind to its own intereſt and bent on its own deſtruction, it is Britain. There are ſuch things as national ſins, and though the puniſhment of individuals may be reſerved to <hi>another</hi> world, national pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment can only be inflicted in <hi>this</hi> world. Britain, as a nation, is in my inmoſt belief the greateſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful offender againſt GOD on the face of the whole earth: Bleſs'd with all the commerce ſhe could wiſh for, and furniſhed by a vaſt extenſion of dominion with the means of civilizing both the eaſtern and weſtern world, ſhe has made no other uſe of both than proudly to idolize her own "Thunder," and rip up the bowels of whole countries for what ſhe could get;—like Alexander ſhe has made war her ſport, and inflicted miſery for prodagality ſake. The blood of India is not yet repaid, nor the wretchedneſs of Africa yet requitted. Of late ſhe has enlarged her liſt of national cruelties by her butcherly deſtruction of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbs of St. Vincents, and in returning an anſwer by the ſword to the meek prayer for <hi>"Peace, Liberty and Safety."</hi> Theſe are ſerious things; and whatever a fooliſh tyrant, a debauched court, a trafficing legiſlature or a blinded people may think, the national account with Heaven muſt ſome day or other be ſettled: All countries have ſooner or later been called to their reckoning; the proudeſt empires have ſunk when the balance was ſtruck; and Britain, like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual penitent, muſt undergo her day of ſorrow, and the ſooner it happens to her the better. As I wiſh it over, I wiſh it to come, but withal wiſh that it may be as light as poſſible.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS your Lordſhip has no taſte for ſerious things; by your connexions in England I ſhould ſuppoſe not:
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015493_0011_0F99865C3AD81A28"/>
Therefore I ſhall drop this part of the ſubject, and take it up in a line in which you will better underſtand me.</p>
            <p>BY what means, may I aſk, do you expect to conquer America? If you could not effect it in the ſummer when our army was leſs than yours, nor in the winter when we had none, how are you to do it? In point of generalſhip you have been outwitted, and in point of fortitude outdone; your advantages turn out to your loſs, and ſhow us that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts: Like a game of drafts we can move out of <hi>one</hi> ſquare to let you come in, in order that we may afterwards take two or three for one; and as we can always keep a double corner for ourſelves, we can always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be ſo inſenſible as not to ſee that we have two to one the advantage of you, becauſe we conquer by a drawn game, and you loſe by it. Burgoyne might have taught your Lordſhip this knowledge; he has been long a ſtudent in the doctrine of chances.</p>
            <p>I have no other idea of conquering countries than by ſubduing the armies which defend them: Have you done this, or can you do this? If you have not, it would be civil in you to let your proclamations alone for the preſent; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you will ruin more Tories by your grace and favour than you will Whigs by your arms.</p>
            <p>WERE you to obtain poſſeſſion of this city, you would not know what to do with it more than to plunder it. To hold it, in the manner you hold New-York, would be an additional dead weight upon your hands; and if a general conqueſt is your object, you had better be without the city than with it. When you have defeated all our armies, the cities will fall into your hands of themſelves; but to creep into them in the manner you got into Princetown, Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp;c. is like robbing an orchard in the night before the fruit be ripe, and running away in the morning. Your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in the Jerſies is ſufficient to teach you that you have ſomething more to do than barely to get into other people's houſes; and your new converts, to whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all manner of protection, and ſeduced into new guilt by pardoning them from their former virtues, muſt begin to have a very contemptible opinion both of your power and your policy. Your authority in the Jerſies is now reduced to the ſmall circle which your army occupies, and your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is no where elſe ſeen unleſs it be to be laughed at. The mighty ſubduers of the Continent are retreated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015493_0012_0F99865CE38F9B70"/>
a nutſhell, and the proud forgivers of our ſins are fled from thoſe they came to pardon; and all this at a time when they were diſpatching veſſel after veſſel to England with the great news of every day. In ſhort, you have managed your Jerſey expedition ſo very dexterouſly that the dead only are conquerors, becauſe none will diſpute the ground with them.</p>
            <p>IN all the wars you have formerly been concerned in, you had only armies to contend with; in this caſe you have both an army and a country to combat with. In former wars, the countries followed the fate of their capitals; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada fell with Quebec, and Minorca with Port Mahon or St. Philips; by ſubduing thoſe, the conquerors opened a way into, and became maſters of the country: here it is otherwiſe; if you get poſſeſſion of a city here, you are obliged to ſhut yourſelves up in it, and can make no other uſe of it, than to ſpend your country's money in. This is all the advantage you have drawn from New-York; and you would draw leſs from Philadelphia, becauſe it requires more force to keep it, and is much farther from the ſea. A pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty figure you and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the immediate conſequence of your getting here would be, that you would be cannonaded out again and the Tories be obliged to make good the damage; and this, ſooner or later, will be the fate of New-York.</p>
            <p>I wiſh to ſee the city ſaved, not ſo much from military as from natural motives. 'Tis the hiding-place of women and children, and Lord Howe's proper buſineſs is with our armies. When I put all the circumſtances together which ought to be taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering America. Becauſe you lived in a little country where an army might run over the whole in a few days, and where a ſingle company of ſoldiers might put a multitude to the route, you expected to find it the ſame here. It is plain that you brought over with you all the narrow notions you were bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation in the king's name was to do great things; but Engliſhmen always travel for knowledge, and your Lordſhip, I hope, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, if you return at all, much wiſer than you came.</p>
            <p>WE may be ſurpriſed by events we did not expect, and in that interval of recollection you may gain ſome tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantage: Such was the caſe a few weeks ago, but we ſoon ripen again into reaſon, collect our ſtrength, and while
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015493_0013_0F99865DA949EE58"/>
you are preparing for a triumph we came upon you with a defeat. Such it has been, and ſuch it would be were you to try it an hundred times over. Were you to garriſon the places you might march over, in order to ſecure their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, (for remember you can do it by no other means) your army would be like a ſtream of water running to nothing. By the time you reached from New-York to Virginia you would be reduced to a ſtring of drops not capable of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together; while we, by retreating from State to State, like a river turning back upon itſelf, would acquire ſtrength in the ſame proportion as you loſt it, and in the end be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of overwhelming you. The country in the mean time would ſuffer, but 'tis a day of ſuffering, and we ought to expect it. What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go through. If we get but bread to eat, and any kind of rayment to put on, we ought, not only to be contented, but thankful. More than <hi>that</hi> we ought not to look for, and leſs than <hi>that</hi> Heaven has not yet ſuffered us to want. He that would ſell his Birthright for a little <hi>ſalt,</hi> is as worthleſs as he who ſold it for <hi>porridge</hi> without ſalt. And he that would part with it for a gay coat, or a <hi>plain</hi> coat, ought for ever to be a ſlave in buff. What are ſalt, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and finery to the ineſtimable bleſſings of "Liberty and Safety?" Or what are the inconveniencies of a few months to the tributary bondage of ages? The meaneſt peaſant in America, bleſs'd with theſe ſentiments, is a happy man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with a New-York Tory; he can eat his morſel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining, and when he has done, can ſweeten it with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt of wholeſome air; he can take his child by the hand and bleſs it, without feeling the conſcious ſhame of neglecting a parent's duty.</p>
            <p>IN publiſhing theſe remarks I have ſeveral objects in view: On your part they are, to expoſe the folly of your pretended authority as a Commiſſioner; the wickedneſs of your cauſe in general; and the impoſſibility of your conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us at any rate. On the part of the public my meaning is, to ſhow them their true and ſolid intereſt; to encourage them to their own good, to remove the fears and falſities which bad men had ſpread and weak men had encouraged; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in all men a love for union, and a chearfulneſs for duty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſubmit one more caſe to you reſpecting your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of this country, and then proceed to new obſervations:</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE our armies in every part of the Continent were
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015493_0014_0F99865E8FCBEA30"/>
immediately to diſperſe, every man to his home, or where elſe he might be ſafe, and engage to re-aſſemble again on a certain future day; it is clear that you would then have no army to contend with, yet you would be as much at a loſs in that caſe as you are now; you would be afraid to ſend your troops in parties over the Continent, either to diſarm, or prevent us from aſſembling, leſt they ſhould not return; and while you kept them together, having no army of ours to diſpute with, you could not call it a conqueſt; you might furniſh out a pompous page in the London Gazette or the New-York paper, but when we returned at the appointed time, you would have the ſame work to do you had at firſt.</p>
            <p>IT has been the folly of Britain to ſuppoſe herſelf more powerful than ſhe really is, and by that means have arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to herſelf a rank in the world ſhe is not entitled to; for more than this century paſt ſhe has not been able to carry on a war without foreign aſſiſtance. In Marlborough's campaigns, and from that day to this, the number of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man troops and officers aſſiſting her have been about equal with her own; ten thouſand Heſſians were ſent to England laſt war to protect her from a French invaſion; and ſhe would have cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and Weſt-Indian expeditions, had not America been laviſh both of her money and men to help her along. The only inſtance in which ſhe was engaged ſingly, that I can recollect, was againſt the rebellion in Scotland in forty-five and forty-ſix, and in that, out of three battles, ſhe was twice beaten, till by thus reducing their numbers (as we ſhall yours) and taking a ſupply ſhip that was coming to Scotland with cloaths, arms and money (as we have often done) ſhe was at laſt enabled to defeat them. England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been ſuſpected of cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-maſter than a ſoldier, and by the ſample we have taken priſoners we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to give the preference to ourſelves. Her ſtrength of late has laid in her extravagance; but as her finances and her credit are now low, her ſinews in that line begin to fail faſt. As a nation ſhe is the pooreſt in Europe; for were the whole kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put up to ſale like the eſtate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as much as ſhe owes: Yet this thoughtleſs wretch muſt go to war, and with the avowed deſign too of making us beaſts of burthen, to ſupport her in riot and debauchery, and to aſſiſt her
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015493_0015_0F99865F20B039A0"/>
afterwards in diſtreſſing thoſe nations who are now our beſt friends. This ingratitude may ſuit a Tory, or the unchriſtian peeviſhneſs of a fallen Quaker, but none elſe.</p>
            <p>'TIS the unhappy temper of the Engliſh to be pleaſed with any war, right or wrong, be it but ſucceſsful; but they ſoon grow diſcontented with ill fortune, and it is an even chance that they are as clamorous for peace next ſummer, as the king and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were for war laſt winter. In this natural view of things, your Lordſhip ſtands in a very ugly critical ſituation: Your whole character is ſtaked upon your laurels; if they wither, you wither with them; if they flouriſh, you cannot live long to look at them; and at any rate, the black account hereafter is not far off. What lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only bleſſings in diſguiſe; and the ſeeming advantages on your ſide have turned out to our profit. Even our loſs of this city, as far as we can ſee, might be a principal gain to us: The more ſurface you ſpread over, the thinner you will be, and the eaſier wiped away; and our conſolation under that apparent diſaſter would be, that the eſtates of the Tories would become ſecurities for the repairs. In ſhort, there is no old ground we can fail upon, but ſome new foundation riſes again to ſupport us. <q>We have put, <hi>Sir,</hi> our hands to the plough, and curſed be he that looketh back.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR king, in his ſpeech to parliament laſt ſpring, declared to them, <q>That he had no doubt but the great force they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to ſend to America, would effectually reduce the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Colonies.</q> It has not, neither can it; but it has done juſt enough to lay the foundation of its own next year's ruin. You are ſenſible that you left England in a divided diſtracted ſtate of politics, and, by the command you had here, you became a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal prop in the court party; their fortunes reſt on yours; by a ſingle expreſs you can fix their value with the public, and the degree to which their ſpirits ſhall riſe or fall; they are in your hands as ſtock, and you have the ſecret of the ally with you. Thus ſituated and connected, you become the unintentional me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical inſtrument of your own and their overthrow. The king and his miniſters put conqueſt out of doubt, and the credit of both depended on the proof. To ſupport them in the interim, it was neceſſary you ſhould make the moſt of every thing; and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New-York paper what the complexion of the London Gazette is. With ſuch a liſt of victories the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot expect you will aſk new ſupplies; and to confeſs your want of them, would give the lie to your triumphs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the king and his miniſters of treaſonable deception. If you make the neceſſary demand at home, your party ſinks; if you make it not, you ſink yourſelf; to aſk it now is too late, and to aſk it before was too ſoon, and unleſs it arrive quickly will be of no uſe. In ſhort, the part you have to act, cannot be acted; and I am fully perſuaded that all you have to truſt to, is to do

the beſt you can with what force you have got, or little more. Though we have greatly excelled you in point of generalſhip and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we have not entered into the full ſoul of enterprize; for I, who know England and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the people well; am confident that it is eaſier for us to effect a revolution there, than you a conqueſt here: A few thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men landed in England with the declared deſign of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the preſent king, bringing his miniſters to trial, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the duke of Glouceſter in his ſtead, would aſſuredly carry their point, while you were groveling here ignorant of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As I ſend all my papers to England, this, like COMMON SENSE, will find its way there; and though it may put one party on their guard, it will inform the other and the nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our deſign to help them.</p>
            <p>THUS far, Sir, I have endeavoured to give you a picture of preſent affairs: You may draw from it what concluſions you pleaſe. I wiſh as well to the true proſperity of England as you can, but I conſider <hi>Independence as America's natural Right and Intereſt,</hi> and never could ſee any real diſſervice it would be to Britain. If an Engliſh merchant receives an order and is paid for it, it ſignifies nothing to him who governs the country—This is my creed of politics. If I have any where expreſſed myſelf overwarmly, 'tis from a fixt immovable hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel men and cruel meaſures. I have likewiſe an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to monarchy, as being too debaſing to the dignity of man; but I never troubled others with my notions till very lately, nor ever publiſhed a ſyllable in England in my life. What I write is pure nature, and my pen and my ſoul have ever gone together. My writings I have always given away, reſerving only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of printing and paper, and ſometimes not even that. I never courted either fame or intereſt, and my manner of life, to thoſe who know it, will juſtify what I ſay. My ſtudy is to be uſeful, and if your Lordſhip love mankind as well I do, you would, ſeeing you cannot conquer us, caſt about and lend your hand towards accompliſhing a peace. Our Independence, with GOD's bleſſing, we will maintain againſt all the world; but as we wiſh to avoid evil ourſelves, we wiſh not to inflict it on others. I am never over-inquiſitive into the ſecrets of the Cabinet, but I have ſome notion, that if you neglect the preſent opportunity, that it will not be in our power to make a ſeperate peace with you afterwards; for whatever treaties or alliances we form, we ſhall moſt faithfully abide by; wherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it with us at any time. A laſting inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent peace is my wiſh, end and aim; and to accompliſh that <hi>"I pray God the"</hi> Americans <q>may never be defeated, and I truſt while they have good officers, and are well commanded,</q> and willing to be commanded, "<hi>that they</hi> NEVER WILL."</p>
