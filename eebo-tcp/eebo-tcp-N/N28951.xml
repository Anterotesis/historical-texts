            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <q>O LORD, thou haſt ſearched me out, and known me: Thou knoweſt my down-ſitting and mine up-riſing: Thou art about my path, and about my bed, and ſpieſt out all my ways.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>How true, how aſtoniſhing is this thought! Almighty GOD, my maker, is ever preſent with me. He is infinite in being; and therefore muſt be every where. He is infinite in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and therefore every thing muſt be known to him. No creature is too inconſiderable for his notice, who is the maker of all, and <q>careth for all alike.</q> The friends, the relations, and acquaintance, whom I ſee and converſe with every day, know not half ſo much of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as He does, nor are half ſo attentive to it How hourly careful ſhould I be, then, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove myſelf to him! Among my relations and friends there are ſome whom I regard more than the reſt, either out of greater affection for their goodneſs and kindneſs; or out of reverence for their greater wiſdom and dignity; or out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as being capable of doing me more good or hurt. All theſe motives of the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard are joined in Him. His excellence is more than thought can conceive: Whatever is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, or good, or amiable in the world, flows from Him as its ſource. In Him is all great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and majeſty, all wiſdom and knowledge; every thing that is glorious, awful, venerable.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038601_0004_101234FF685C1B88"/>My hourly dependence is upon Him, and all my expectations through an eternity to come. From him I have received my life, my being, every power and faculty of ſoul and body. Every innocent delight I enjoy, is his gift: In every danger he is my preſent help. No power but his could guide me ſafely through the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate mazes of life. Hitherto his providence has carefully watched over me, and his right-hand has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is truth itſelf, has promiſed never to fail me nor forſake me, if on my part I will but ſerve him faithfully, as in my baptiſmal vow I have promiſed to do. That bleſſed covenant I am going to renew, by partaking of the holy ſacrament. Had not our bleſſed Saviour died to redeem mankind, we muſt all have appeared before an all-ſeeing God, of infinite juſtice and holineſs, without ſecurity of being conſidered otherwiſe than as objects of diſpleaſure. But we know that he looks upon us now as objects of the tendereſt mercy. He invites us to <q>pour out our hearts before him</q> at all times: <q>To call upon him in the time of trouble:</q> 
                  <q>To look unto him and be ſaved.</q> O my ſoul, in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths!</p>
               <p>Let me then aſk myſelf, as in his ſight, What is the general turn of my temper, and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my mind? My moſt trifling words and actions are obſerved by him; and every thought is naked to his eye. Could I ſuppoſe the king, or any the greateſt perſon I have any knowledge
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038601_0005_10123501E716E988"/>of, were within reach of obſerving my common daily behaviour, though unſeen by me, ſhould I not be very particularly careful to preſerve it in every reſpect decent and becoming? Should I allow myſelf in any little froward humours? Should I not be aſhamed to appear peeviſh and ill-natured? Should I uſe ſo much as one harſh or unhandſome expreſſion even to my equal, or my meaneſt inferior, even were I ever ſo much provoked? much leſs ſhould I behave irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my parents or ſuperiors. This awful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whom I live and move, and from whom no obſcurity can hide me, by whom the very hairs of my head are all numbered, He knows the obligations of every relation in life: He ſees in their full light their reciprocal duties of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children, of huſbands and wives, of neighbours and fellow-ſervants. He knows the aggravated guilt of every offence againſt theſe ties of ſociety, however we may be diſpoſed to treat them as trifles: and every piece of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and pride, of ill-humour and paſſion, of anger and reſentment, of ſullenneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, expoſes us to his juſt indignation.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>—Our Lord and Saviour has pronounced this bleſſedneſs, and through his grace I hope to partake of it.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038601_0006_1012350486938C48"/>Hunger and thurſt naturally prompt us to ſeek, without delay, the means of ſatisfying them. What then is the food of the mind? Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſtruction and religious meditation. If then I ſincerely do hunger and thirſt after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I ſhall be frequently feeding my mind with pious books and thoughts. I ſhall make the returns of theſe meals as regular as I can, and ſeldom ſhall I find any neceſſity ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make me miſs them a whole day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.—But then it ought to be remembered too, that even theſe, the beſt hours of my life, ought never to encroach upon the duties and employments of my ſtation, whatever they may be. Am I in a ſuperior ſtation of life? My duty then probably takes in a large compaſs; and I am accountable to my Maker for all thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents intruſted with me by him for the benefit of my fellow-creatures. I muſt not think of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to myſelf alone; or of devoting that time to imitate the employment of angels, which was given me for the ſervice of men. Religion muſt be my chief end, and my beſt delight; it muſt regulate all I think or do; but whatever my ſtation is, I muſt fulfil all its duties. Have I leiſure and genius? I muſt give a due portion of my time to the elegant improvements of life; to the ſtudy of thoſe ſciences that are an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to human nature; to ſuch things as may make me amiable and engaging to all whom I converſe with, that by any means I may win them over to religion and goodneſs. For if I am always ſhut up in my cloſet, and ſpend
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038601_0007_1012350703FB5150"/>my time in nothing but exerciſes of devotion, I ſhall be looked upon as moroſe and hypocritical, and be diſregarded as uſeleſs in the world. When this life is ended, we have a whole eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity before us to ſpend in thoſe nobleſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and higheſt delights. But man, in this low ſtate of mortality, pays the moſt acceptable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, by ſerving his fellow creatures.</p>
               <p>Perhaps all theſe conſiderations are wide from my caſe. So far from having leaſure upon my hands, I have ſcarce a moment free from the neceſſary engagements of buſineſs and bodily labour. While I am working hard for bread for myſelf and my family; or attending diligently the commands of a ſtrict maſter, to whom I am juſtly accountable for every hour I have; how can I find frequent opportunities for ſtudying the word of God, or much time to ſpend in devout meditation? Why, happily, much is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, provided I make the beſt uſe of what little I have. Some time I muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeds have on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and this I may improve. I may diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to what I hear at church: I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether my own practice is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what I am there taught; and I may ſpend ſome hours in that day, either in good diſcourſe with ſuch as are able to inſtruct me, or in reading ſuch religious books as are put into my hands. Still enough will be left for cheerful converſation and pleaſant walks. Why ſhould either of them be the leſs cheerful, for a mixture of religious thoughts? What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there ſo gladdening as they are? Be my
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038601_0008_10123508AC38D4D0"/>ſtate ever ſo mean and toilſome; as a Chriſtian, if indeed I behave like one, I am equal to the greateſt monarch upon earth. Be my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and ſorrows ever ſo ſevere; as a Chriſtian, I can look beyond death to an eternity of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, of happineſs certain and unſpeakable. Theſe thoughts, therefore, I ſhould keep upon my mind through the whole week: They ſhould be the amuſement of my labour, and the relief of my wearineſs: And when my heart is thus ready, I ſhall gladly take every opportunity to ſing and give praiſe. I ſhall awake early to worſhip that GOD, who is my defence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and I ſhall cloſe every evening with prayer and thankſgiving to Him, whoſe <q>ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all whoſe paths are peace.</q>
Whenever I can have a quarter of an hour to ſpare from the neceſſary buſineſs, and the (at fit times) as neceſſary relaxations of life, which, while they are innocent, moderate, and reaſonable, will never be diſapproved by that good GOD, who has created every thing that is comely and pleaſant in the world, and invites us to rejoice, and do good all the days of our life; when I have any ſpare time, I ſhall gladly ſpend it in reading, with reverence and attention, ſome portions of the Bible. In all my common converſation, I ſhall have my eye continually up to Him, who alone can direct my paths to happineſs and improvements, and crown all my endeavours with the beſt ſucceſs. I ſhall try to be ſomething the better for every ſcene of life I am engaged in: to be ſomething
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038601_0009_1012350BAE5F3F10"/>the wiſer for every day's converſation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And let me not fear, but that if I daily thus faithfully ſtrive to grow in holineſs and goodneſs, be my growth at the preſent ever ſo imperceptible, I <q>ſhall in due time arrive at the meaſure of the fulneſs of ſtature in Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That I may be better for the laſt twenty-four hours, let me examine a little what temper I have been in all that time. In general, perhaps, I can recollect nothing much amiſs in it: but let me deſcend to particulars. Things are often very faulty, that appear at firſt ſight very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling. Perhaps I have ſo fond a conceit of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to think that I can never be in the wrong. Has any uneaſineſs happened in the family this laſt day? Perhaps I think the fault was wholly in others, and the right entirely on my ſide. But ought I not to remember, that, in all diſputes, there is generally ſome fault on both ſides? Perhaps they begun;—But did not I carry it on?—They gave the provication:— But did not I take it?—Am I not too apt to imagine, that it would be mean entirely to let a quarrel drop, when I have a fair opportunity to reaſon, and argue, and reproach, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my injured merit, and aſſert my right? Yet, is this agreeable to the precepts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Him, "who when he was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again?" Is it agreeable to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who has charged me, if my brother treſpaſs againſt me, to forgive him, not ſeven times only, but ſeventy times ſeven? Is it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Chriſtian doctrine, which exhorts
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038601_0010_10123510430C9FD8"/>us, not to think of ourſelves highly, but ſoberly as we ought to think; and that in lowlineſs of mind every one ſhould think others better than himſelf? And, alas! how often do I think this diſreſpect, though a ſlight one, provoking to <hi>me?</hi> this ſituation, though a happy one, not good enough for <hi>me?</hi> How often have I had in my mouth that maxim, that a worm if it is trod upon will turn again? Wretch that I am! ſhall I plead the example of a vile worm of the earth for diſobeying the commands of my Saviour, with whom I hope hereafter to ſit in heavenly places?</p>

               <p>—If our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, infinitely great and excellent, was, when he aſſumed human nature, ſo far from being exempted from the general law of labour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on our firſt father and all his race, who is there amongſt men, that ſhall plead an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption?

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038601_0011_10123511EB238888"/>various degrees, all the orders of angels are miniſtring ſpirits. In the happy worlds above, all is life and activity. And ſhall man, who is ſo fond of life, loſe half his little portion of it in a lazy ſlothful ſtate? ſhall he quench thoſe ſparks of immortality that glow in his boſom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with being, for three parts of his time, little better than a lump of organized clay? Innocent man in paradiſe, was not made for idleneſs: but guilty fallen man is peculiarly born to labour, and to trouble. Equally juſt and merciful was the doom pronounced to <hi>Adam</hi>; <q>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat bread.</q> Human nature, corrupted and depraved by the fall of our firſt parents, would be incapable of employing eaſe and leiſure to any happy purpoſes. Greatly do we need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant employment to keep us out of the reach of thoſe temptations from within, and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that in idleneſs particularly aſſault us. Greatly do we need to have much of our minds taken up with perpetual attention to neceſſary buſineſs and hourly duty, that they may not prey too much upon themſelves. Labour and pain are the neceſſary, though unpalatable, medicine of our ſouls. Shall we refuſe to follow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that heavenly Phyſician, who drank the bittereſt cup for us? Toil and trouble are the juſt puniſhments of guilty human nature: Shall we rebel againſt our awful Judge? Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and employment are the law of our being: And ſhall we not obey our ſovereign Ruler, our great and good Creator?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:038601_0012_1012351476B416E0"/>What then is my proper buſineſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that I may ſet diligently to it? In moſt ſtations in life, this is too evident to be aſked: And it is equally certain, that every ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the very higheſt, has its proper work and labour, which whoever performs not to the utmoſt of his power, is a wicked and ſlothful ſervant, for we have all a maſter in heaven.</p>
               <p>Come, then, my heart, let us cheerfully ſet about our buſineſs. Be it ſtudy and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mind, or toil of the body, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the hands: Be it care of our families and domeſtic affairs: Be it care of the public, and diſtribution of juſtice: Be it care of our neighbours, and charity to the poor: Be it edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of children, inſtruction of the ignorant, attendance on the ſick, culture of the ground, defence of our country: Whatever it be, let us do it diligently and heartily, as unto the LORD, and not unto men. As ſubjects, children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, let us obey our rulers, parents, maſters. And if it be the will of Providence to diſable us, for the preſent, from all active ſervice, by confining us in chambers of ſickneſs, in a weak and uſeleſs ſtate, let us ſet the example of an uncomplaining ſubmiſſion and cheerful reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and let patience, at leaſt, have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work.</p>
               <p>This ſubmiſſive, this humble, this obedient diſpoſition, is poverty of ſpirit. We ought to think nothing beneath us; nor to deſire any thing but what is allotted us. We ought to imagine nothing our own, and ſurely therefore not our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038601_0013_1012351763BCF8B8"/>time: Yet how apt are we to think it quite a hardſhip put upon us, if any ſmall portion of it is to be ſpent diſagreeably, and if we have not hours, and days, and years, to indulge in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs idleneſs and giddy pleaſure!</p>
               <p>Among other works, that of reforming my temper is ſurely a moſt neceſſary one. Let me therefore take myſelf a little to taſk. How have I behaved the laſt day?</p>
               <p>I have not, perhaps, been poſitively out of humour: But have I guarded my diſpoſition againſt every failing? Have I not indulged a nice fancy, in taking ſome diſguſt at any of thoſe I converſe with; which, trifling as it ſeems at preſent, may, in time, quite alienate our minds from one another? A diſagreeable look, or manner, too often gives a prejudice againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are really deſerving. Let me be upon my guard againſt ſuch prejudices. Let me overlook all trifling infermities in others: But let me ſpare them the pain and difficulty of having many ſuch to overlook in me. Let me obſerve in every thing a perfect cleanlineſs and neatneſs; for nothing is ſo diſguſtful as the contrary. Let me be mild and civil, moderate and diſcreet, in all my ways of ſpeaking: Let my behaviour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be eaſy and obliging, natural and unaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let me always preſerve, as much as I can, even under ſevere trials, a cheerful pleaſing countenance: And, among other things, let me try to avoid, as much as poſſible, falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe little fooliſh tricks and peculiarities, which every body is ſo apt to acquire, without
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038601_0014_10123519F241FF50"/>even perceiving it. I cannot help ſeeing in others how diſagreeable they are, though in them I ought as little as poſſible to attend to it. But let me watch myſelf a little, and diſcover, in order to reform, whatever I may have in me that makes me leſs agreeable, and therefore leſs uſeful, in ſociety.</p>

                  <q>AND GOD ſaw every thing that he had made; and behold, it was very good.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Such was the face of things at the creation. Every view, that could be taken, was a view of order and beauty, of happineſs and pleaſure. Too ſoon, by the frailty and by the guilt of man, this happy ſtate was changed; and through ſin, death and miſery entered into the world. Every part of our world was affected by the general diſorder. The earth produced thorns and thiſtles. The ſeaſons became unfavourable. The beaſts grew wild and ſavage. And hence ſprung a neceſſity of labour and ſelf-defence. Toil and wearineſs muſt be its natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to bodies now become mortal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. Pain and ſickneſs, the infirmities of old age, the fear of death and ſufferings, both for ourſelves and our friends, with all that variety of evils that burthen human life; all are the ſad effects of ſin. The diſorder of our minds, the vehemence of our paſſions, the dimneſs of our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038601_0015_1012351C81B07EC0"/>underſtandings, thoſe tendencies to evil, which even the beſt people, at ſome times, muſt feel ſtrongly working in their boſoms, are the bitter fruits of the original corruption of human nature in the firſt of men, our common parent.
Hence, ſurely, we ſhould draw the ſtrongeſt motives of humility, and throw ourſelves down, in the deepeſt abaſement of ſoul, before that GOD of holineſs, in whoſe <q>ſight the heavens are not pure,</q>
and who chargeth his angels with "folly;"
<q>How much more man which is a worm, and the ſon of man which is a worm?</q> Unaſſiſted human nature could not be in a more perfect ſtate, than our firſt parents were created: Infinitely ſuperior, certainly, to whatever we can imagine of good or excellent among ourſelves. If they were ſuch frail, ſuch wretched creatures, and ſo ſoon forfeited their very beings—Good GOD! then what is the very beſt of us!
<q>Let our confuſion be ever before us!</q>
"Let the ſhame of our face cover us."</p>
               <p>Strange it may ſeem, after theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to mention a happy and cheerful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our beings, as a ſerious and important duty. Many good perſons, who have deeply dwelt on this dark view of our mortal ſtate, have repreſented it as utterly unfit and ſinful for ſuch creatures, in ſuch a world, to think of any thing but ſuffering and mourning. But as ſure as our heavenly Father is good to all, and peculiarly ſo to us his helpleſs new-adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo ſurely they are widely miſtaken. The
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038601_0016_1012351E40E83D20"/>bleſſed promiſe of our redemption was uttered in the ſame moment with the doom of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and from that moment all was good again. Pain, and ſuffering, and ſorrow, became reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cure our corrupted nature; temptations, but a purifying fire to prove and to refine our virtue; and death, a kind releaſe from toil, a happy admiſſion into a better paradiſe. Through our bleſſed Saviour, we have obtained the grace of GOD to guide us in all our ways, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us under all our diſtreſſes. Through him, in him, we have every thing that can make us happy, unleſs we wilfully deſtroy ourſelves. <q>Rejoice, then, in the LORD, all ye righteous; be thankful all ye who are true of heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Serious and careful indeed we ought to be, watchful and diligent, humble and ſubmiſſive: Reflecting deeply on the frailty and vileneſs of our nature, and the important, the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that depends on this our ſhort and very uncertain time of trial here. In this ſenſe, we ought to <q>work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling,</q> and even to <q>rejoice before the LORD with reverence.</q> But while we <q>keep innocence, and take heed to the thing that is right,</q> let our cheerful hearts and looks confeſs the goodneſs of our gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who <q>gives us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs:</q> of Him, who has made every thing good and pleaſant; who has the tendereſt conſideration for all our infermities, and has provided every ſupport and every relief that can
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038601_0017_10123521DE9D18E0"/>make our paſſage thro' this world tolerable and comfortable to us. With joyful gratitude let us accept and improve theſe his mercies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. Let us make this world as happy as we can to ourſelves and one another: To do this, we need only be good Chriſtians. Our wills being perfectly reſigned, will acquieſce, without pain, in whatever diſpoſals Providence may ſee fit to make of us and ours: And taking "no thought for to-morrow," we ſhall neither be tormented with vain ſchemes, nor anxious fears. Our deſires being moderate, we ſhall paſs quietly and eaſily thro' life: And no unruly paſſions or vehement wiſhes will diſcompoſe our peace. Being free from private intereſts and ſelfiſh views, we ſhall have no rivalries nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with our neighbours. Being in perfect charity with all men, we ſhall with all be eaſy, cheerful, friendly; in every thing ſtudying to promote their good and happineſs: And in our turn receiving from many of them offices of kindneſs; and from ſuch as are ungrateful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the greateſt benefit of all, a noble op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to exerciſe thoſe duties on which GOD's forgiveneſs of ourſelves depends. With pleaſure and complacence our heavenly Father looks down on every ſociety of his children united in brotherly affection, and gives his bleſſing to every ſet of friends, and neighbours, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that perform their mutual relative duties as they ought, and love and delight in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Every innocent entertainment, that keeps up the cheerfulneſs and kindneſs of ſociety, he
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038601_0018_10123525435D38A8"/>approves. <q>The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous.</q> Our health can alone be preſerved by temperance, calmneſs, and induſtry. Induſtry, too, makes the world look beautiful around us. It turns the barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs into a fertile pleaſant land; and for thorns and thiſtles plants the roſe-tree and the vine, or ſows the tender graſs or uſeful corn. Induſtry preſerves us from inclemencies of weather, and finds ſome means to ſupply every want. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us wherewith to give alms to the poor, and thereby enables us to lay up a treaſure in heaven.</p>
               <p>Happineſs, then, a great degree of it, is in our power, even at preſent. But, fools that we are! we forfeit even preſent happineſs, for the indulgence of every peeviſh, froward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Let me examine myſelf a little on this. As much as I condemn it, am not I often guilty of this unaccountable folly? Am I not readier to cheriſh unkind ſuſpicions of thoſe I live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt, than to put a fair and favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon every diſagreeable incident? Am I not almoſt upon the watch to take offence at every trifling diſregard? Do I not think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath me ever to take the firſt ſtep towards a reconciliation? Do I not make it a point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to keep up reſentment, even tho' it pains me? How much happier are they, who go through the world with an eaſy good-humour! Never ſuſpecting that any body means them ill, who does not really and ſeriouſly hurt them: Paſſing over every trifle: And by placing themſelves
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038601_0019_10123526EC98ABF8"/>above all ſuch peeviſh follies, maintaining more real dignity than thoſe who are the proudeſt.</p>

               <p>How greatly do we all of us need this bleſſing, poor guilty creatures, who are every day offending Infinite Goodneſs, and provoking Almighty Power and Perfect Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice! How then ſhall we be merciful as we ought? Can this duty be practiſed by any but the great, or injured;—in relieving the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or in pardoning offenders? Yes: Every one of us may practiſe it every day we live. It is a great miſtake to think there is no ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that which rank and fortune give. Every one of us may, in ſomething or other, aſſiſt or inſtruct ſome of his fellow-creatures? for the beſt of human race is poor and needy, and all have a mutual dependence on one another: There is nobody that cannot do ſome good; and every body is bound to do diligently all the good he can. It is by no means enough to be rightly diſpoſed, to be ſerious, and religious in our cloſets: We muſt be uſeful too; and take care, that, as we all reap numberleſs benefits from ſociety, ſociety may be the better for every one of us. It is a falſe, a faulty, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent humility, that makes people ſit ſtill and do nothing, becauſe they will not believe that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038601_0020_10123529A1056650"/>they are capable of doing much: For every body can do ſomething. Every body can ſet a good example, be it to many or to few. Every body can in ſome degree encourage virtue and religion, and diſcountenance vice and folly. Every body has ſome one or other whom they can adviſe, or inſtruct, or in ſome way help to guide through life. Thoſe who are too poor to give alms, can yet give their time, their trouble, their aſſiſtance, in preparing or forwarding the gifts of others; in conſidering, and repreſenting diſtreſſed caſes to thoſe who can relieve them; in viſiting and comforting the ſick and afflicted. Every body can offer up their prayers for thoſe who need them: Which, if they do reverently and ſincerely, they will never be wanting in giving them every other aſſiſtance that it ſhall pleaſe GOD to put in their power. Even thoſe whoſe poor and toilſome life can admit of their giving no other help to ſociety, can, by their frugality and induſtry, at leaſt keep themſelves, in a great meaſure, from being burthenſome to the public. A penny thus ſaved, is a penny given. Dreadful ſtate of thoſe idle creatures, who, dragging on a wretched, profligate life, in lazineſs and rags, draw to themſelves thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities that ought to ſupport the helpleſs and really diſabled poor! Severely, I fear, ſhall they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for it at the laſt day; and every one in proportion, who lives an uſeleſs and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome drone in ſociety. It is our duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent poverty, as well as to relieve it. It is our duty to relieve every other kind of diſtreſs as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038601_0021_10122DF4AD973808"/>well as the diſtreſs of poverty. People who are always innocently cheerful and good-humoured, are very uſeful in the world. They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace and happineſs, and ſpread a thankful temper among all that live around them.</p>
               <p>Thus far in general: But it is well worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, in particular, my own duties and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations. Who are the people that I ought eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſtudy to make happy? Are they parents? —What a debt of gratitude do I owe them for all their care of me, and for me, in my helpleſs years? How kindly did they bear with the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward infirmities of my childhood; and ſhall not I with moſt affectionate tenderneſs ſupport and relieve all thoſe which years and cares bring upon them? My more active ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, my younger ſpirits and clearer thoughts, may now make me, in my turn, very helpful to them. If they are good people and good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, I am ſure this is my duty: If otherwiſe, I owe them one of ſtill higher importance; I owe them the moſt earneſt endeavours I can uſe for the reformation of their faults, or inſtruction of their ignorance. This duty extends to all my relations; and to all from whom I have ever received any benefit, or any offices of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. If it is my misfortune that any of them ſhould be bad people, though they have been good to me; or if any of thoſe who are related to me are engaged in a wrong courſe of life; ought I to fly from them, and leave them to ruin? No: gratitude and affection forbid it. Ought I then to encourage vice, and flatter
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038601_0022_1012352E9E7DE880"/>folly, if it happens among thoſe that I love? This, my higher duty to Almighty GOD, to truth and virtue, abſolutely forbids. What then is to be done? To preſerve the tendereſt affection for their perſons, and keep up and declare openly the ſtrongeſt abhorrence of their faults; to avoid every degree and every inſtance of eaſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, that may ſeem to give the leaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their vices: and at the ſame time to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy every art, and every earneſt endeavour, than can have the leaſt chance of reclaiming them: To pray for and pity them: To reprove and adviſe them; to pleaſe and oblige them in every thing I innocently can:—But if, upon the whole, I find them irreclaimable, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the leaſt poſſible danger of being infected by their example,—then to fly them as I would the plague; then to cut off a right hand, and pluck out a right eye, and break through every fondneſs, and every attachment, that would deſtroy my higheſt, my eternal intereſt. No ties that ſubſiſt amongſt human creatures can be ſo ſtrong, can be ſo dear, or ought to be ſo indiſſoluble, as thoſe which for ever bind us to our Creator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Next to the bonds of nature, are thoſe of choice. Married perſons are bound to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of very ſacred vows; and ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often to recollect them, and examine their conduct by them. Among other things, they ſhould carefully conſider, whether they have ſo ſtrict a guard upon their temper as they ought, now the happineſs of another perſon is made ſo
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038601_0023_101235325EBFA4A0"/>greatly to depend on their eaſy good-humour and cheerfulneſs: Whether they aſſiſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove one another; and whether they are ready to receive aſſiſtance and advice as kindly as to give it: Whether they preſerve a delicacy of behaviour, a neatneſs of appearance, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of manners, a mildneſs of ſpeech: Whether they enter kindly and affectionately into one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's intereſts and concerns.</p>
               <p>Friends ſhould conſider what engagements they are entered into with each other, how ſtrictly they are bound diligently to promote each other's welfare: To think of one another candidly and kindly: To overlook offences, to bear infirmities: To repay kindneſſes a thouſand fold: To be watchful over each other's conduct: To be true, ſincere, faithful, obliging, open, conſtant: And, to have the generous courage of reproving and oppoſing each other's follies and faults.</p>
               <p>All perſons ſhould conſider to whom they are accountable for their time, their labour, the ſuperfluity of their fortune: To maſters, to friends, to ſociety in general, to the deſerving or the helpleſs poor. Rich perſons owe a due portion of their riches to works of charity and to the public: The great owe their protection to merit: And all people owe it to themſelves, to improve every moment, and every opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this life affords them.</p>
               <p>Surely while I am making theſe reflections, I cannot omit more literal debts, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate duties. Do I owe money I am not
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038601_0024_1012353411C8F2B0"/>able to pay? Let me retrench every ſuperfluous expence, till my real debts are paid. Let me work and labour indefatigably, till I am enabled to be honeſt: And let me not be one moment eaſy, while I unjuſtly live on the expence of other people, and am hurtful to the ſociety that ought to be the better for me.</p>
               <p>It is worth conſidering, too, what promiſes I have made. Were they ever ſo raſh, if they engaged me in nothing contrary to innocence, it is my duty to fulfil them. Happy if it teaches me the wiſdom to be more cautious for the future.</p>

               <p>Alas! does it not ſeem from this and many other paſſages of Scripture, worthy of all obſervance and of all acceptation, as if it was our bounden duty in this world to lead a melancholy, wretched, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable life? And can this indeed be the will of Him who delighteth in mercy; who filleth our hearts with food and gladneſs; and has, in not a few places, expreſsly commanded us to rejoice evermore? Is there, then, an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in the duties of religion? God forbid! Yet ſhort-ſighted men, capable of taking into one view but a part of the vaſt and perfectly conſiſtent ſcheme of duty, and guided too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by paſſion or weakneſs, are perpetually
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038601_0025_10123536DEC2BD98"/>acting as if this was the caſe. Some free ſpirits there are who throw off all awful reſtraint, and, fully ſatisfied with themſelves if they keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wideſt bounds of what is juſt allowable, indulge without caution in every thing they think ſo. Their whole time is given up to mirth and jollity: Their whole fortunes, perhaps, are ſpent upon themſelves, without any regard to the calls of charity or duty. Jollily they go on in life, till ſome unforeſeen misfortune ſtops them ſhort, and throws a deep gloom over their funny land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of people, much to be eſteemed, and greatly to be pitied, are ſcrupulous about every thing; and frighted by a miſapprehenſion of ſome alarming texts, dare not allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the moſt innocent conveniences, and moſt harmleſs, and on many accounts uſeful and commendable, pleaſures. Their minds are ſo truly pious, that they are far from deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinking of the infinitely great and good GOD as a hard and rigid maſter: But they act with ſuch a ſlaviſh fear, as muſt needs make thoſe who are leſs well-diſpoſed frame ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly falſe imaginations of him; and their well-meant ſtrictneſs has the moſt dangerous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the world.</p>
               <p>Between theſe two extremes undoubtedly lies the plain path of duty: The narrow but not thorny road, that leads through the trueſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort this life can afford, to everlaſting happineſs in a better.</p>
               <p>The natural enjoyments of life are diſpenſed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038601_0026_10123539B36030F0"/>to us by a gracious Providence, to mitigate its natural evils, and make our paſſage through it not only ſupportable, but, at fit times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo far pleaſant as to make us go on with vigour, cheerfulneſs, and gratitude: And to give us ſome kind of earneſt of what we are bid to hope hereafter; ſome kind of faint notion what happineſs is; ſome ſenſible aſſurances, that there really is ſuch a thing, though not to be in any high degrees enjoyed on this ſide of the grave.— Still it is a yet more merciful diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame fatherly care, that pain and imperfection, ſatiety and diſappointment, ſhould be ſo mixed up with all our beſt enjoyments in this low ſtate of being, as to turn our chief aim and deſire towards heaven. And let us not fear, unleſs we wilfully and madly throw ourſelves into a giddy round of pleaſures on purpoſe to be intoxicated by them, Providence will merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully interpoſe in the fulleſt tide of innocent proſperity, and make us by ſome means or other feel an emptineſs and diſſatisfaction in the beſt this world can give: Eſpecially may this be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by thoſe, who take care to keep their minds always open to ſuch ſerious thoughts and right impreſſions as will perpetually preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if not rejected; and who reſerve ſome leiſure time in every day, for reading and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting.</p>
               <p>Our Maker knows ſo well the weakneſs of our frame, that he has not left it to us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon ourſelves, merely by way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch ſufferings as he ſees it neceſſary for
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038601_0027_1012353C399ACF98"/>us to undergo. That taſk would be ſo hard a one, that he would by no means impoſe it upon us. No: He will take care himſelf, that we ſhall unavoidably feel and experience a great deal of that evil which ſin introduced into the world; and all he requires of us, is to ſupport it as we ought. He requires nothing contrary to reaſon and the innocent inclinations of nature. If any of his laws appear harſh and difficult, it is from their oppoſition to our acquired habits, our prejudices and corruptions. To forgive injuries, to return good for evil, to live peaceably with all men, to be always mild, obliging, and good-humoured, to be kind and patient, charitable and induſtrious, temperate, ſober, and modeſt, theſe are no grievous laws to a pure and well tuned mind; nor can its genuine dictates be better complied with, than by obſerving them. Still, they will be a very grievous reſtraint on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs of our corrupted wills, our height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened paſſions, and indulged imaginations. To be continually attentive to our conduct in every minute inſtance, to ſet a watch before our mouth, and keep the door of our lips, to ſet ſcourges over our thoughts, and the diſcipline of wiſdom over our hearts, requires a ſoberneſs of mind, a diligence, a reſolute adherence to duty, that may undoubtedly deſerve the name of ſelf-denial and mortification; though, in effect, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo certainly enſures our happineſs both here and hereafter. To think we can do this by our own ſtrength, would be preſumptuous and vain. Tell a man, helpleſs with the palſy,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038601_0028_1012353E26FFE6E8"/>that perfect health is his natural and eligible ſtate; convince him ever ſo clearly how happy it would be for him to become active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious—your eloquence is mockery, and will not help him to the uſe of a ſingle limb.
But though we daily confeſs that we have <q>no health in us,</q>
HE who did actually ſay to the ſick of the palſy, "Ariſe, take up thy bed and walk," and was immediately obeyed, can effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our ſtill more helpleſs ſtate.
To this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Phyſician we can apply for help; and, by the aid he imparts, are enabled to follow the regimen he enjoins; and thus to <q>go on from ſtrength to ſtrength, till unto the GOD of gods ſhall appear every one in Sion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though our comfortable paſſage through this life, and the attainment of unſpeakable bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in another, are the allowed, the neceſſary, the enjoined objects of our purſuit; yet ſtill, in a great degree, we are to renounce ourſelves. By ſincere humility we are to conſider the vileneſs and wretchedneſs of our natural ſtate: We are to acknowledge, that of ourſelves we are able to do nothing as we ought; and, far from indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thoughts of vanity or ſelf-complacence, we are, when we have done our very beſt, to confeſs with unfeigned lowlineſs, that we are unprofitable ſervants. We are to truſt and hope alone in the merits and interceſſion of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer; and to own ourſelves <q>leſs than the leaſt of God's mercies.</q> As his creatures, we are to direct all our thoughts and actions to his honour and ſervice, <q>Whether we eat or drink, or
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038601_0029_10123542EA5E2548"/>whatever we do, we are to do all to the glory of GOD.</q>
In every thing, we are to conſider carefully the rule of duty: not ſcrupulouſly or ſuperſtitiouſly; for that tends to the diſhonour of GOD and religion, as well as to our own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort. We are never to do any thing for ſo low an end, as merely to gratify our own child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh humour; but, in all caſes, to moderate and guide ourſelves by the rules of reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Thus, even in uſing the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, and eaſy amuſements, and innocent pleaſures of life, we are to behave with a due ſenſe of that GOD who is every-where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. We are to look up to him with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as the bountiful beſtower of all good; and cheerfully accept theſe indulgences for the ends to which he has appointed them. Food, to reſtore our ſtrength waſted in active ſervice, and to preſerve our health and eaſe: Sleep, to renew our wearied ſpirits: Pleaſure to gladden our hearts, and fill them with pious gratitude and filial love. This cuts off at once all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance that croſſes thoſe good purpoſes, deſtroys our healths, diſtreſſes our hearts, makes our lives ſluggiſh and uſeleſs, and diſſipates or corrupts our minds. Riches and honours alſo are to be received with thankſgiving, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Providence allots them to; but then they are to be diligently, and carefully, and generouſly employed in the beſt purpoſes: and even the richeſt and the greateſt ought to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all indulgences of mere humour and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, how well ſoever they may ſeem able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038601_0030_101235457A8EC0D0"/>it, and kindly and faithfully conſider the more preſſing wants of their diſtreſſed fellow-creatures. To anſwer the purpoſes of charity, the rich muſt be frugal, and the poor induſtrious; and all give freely and diſcreetly, as proper calls require. Every body, in their turns, to maintain the peace of ſociety, and Chriſtian concord, muſt repreſs the little riſings of temper, and fretfulneſs of humour; muſt be ready to forgive and forget, to indulge and overlook.</p>
               <p>It is endleſs to go on enumerating inſtances, in which the juſt, the neceſſary adherence to our duty, requires us to deny our ſinful ſelves. Our cowardice, our falſe ſhame, our vanity, our weakneſs and irreſolution, our fondneſs and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial affection, our indolence and love of eaſe: Theſe, and numberleſs infirmities more, muſt be ſtruggled with and conquered, when we are called out to encounter dangers; to confeſs our Saviour before men; to withſtand the ſtrong tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of cuſtom and faſhion, of importunity and ill example; to turn a deaf ear to flattery, or candidly acknowledge our errors; to reſiſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations; to give righteous judgment; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all our private relations and attachments, where juſtice or public good are concerned; to reſign our deareſt enjoyments, when it is the will of GOD we ſhould; to check our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in their fulleſt flow; and to go on inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably improving ourſelves and doing good to others, till the night overtake us, <q>in which no man can work.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſufferings which it ſhall pleaſe Almighty
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038601_0031_101235472C456790"/>GOD to inflict upon us, we are to accept with humble reſignation; acknowledge his juſtice, and ſubmitting to it without a murmur. Thus patiently alſo we are to receive all the leſſer croſſes he ſees fit to lay upon us: nor ever ſuffer ourſelves to fret or repine at the various infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of human nature in ourſelves or others. All theſe we muſt look upon as parts of that penalty juſtly inflicted on our firſt parents guilt; and heartily thank Him, that he does not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terrifying notions of Popery, either expect us to inflict them on ourſelves, or give us the dreadful alternative of a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory after death. Uncommanded ſeverities, that are of no apparent uſe, but to torment ourſelves, and ſour our natures, and ſhorten our lives, can never be acceptable to our gracious Maker. Our bleſſed Saviour, when he mentions faſting as a duty along with prayer and almſgiving, leaves the frequency and ſtrictneſs of it to our own diſcretion; and only inſiſts upon one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which is, that we ſhould avoid in it all hypocriſy and oſtentation; and be careful to keep up all eaſe, good-humour, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of behaviour. There are very proper occaſions for exerciſing this duty without the leaſt ſuperſtition or moroſeneſs, and where it may tend to the beſt purpoſes:—Public calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, private diſtreſſes or temptations, perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and difficulties, times of peculiarly ſolemn devotion, and of reſolutely endeavouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſuch obſtinate faults and ill-habits as, like the dumb ſpirit in the goſpel, can <q>come out
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038601_0032_10123549327991E0"/>only by prayer and faſting.</q> But where it makes us appear ſtiff and diſagreeable, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with the innocent cheerfulneſs of ſociety, or may influence our health or temper in any wrong way; in ſuch caſes, it becomes a hurtful ſuperſtition, and as ſuch unallowable. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the public faſts appointed by authority, in a manner ſuited to every perſon's ſtrength and ability, with decency and reverence, can have none of theſe evil conſequences: and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this duty, at fit times, and in a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree, is an excellent remembrancer of the wretchedneſs of being attached to any ſenſual gratifications, and the eaſineſs as well as neceſſity at fit times to forbear them.</p>

               <head>SATURDAY.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER week is paſt; another of thoſe little limited portions of time which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber out my life. Let me ſtop a little here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter upon a new one; and conſider what this life is which is thus imperceptibly ſtealing away, and whither it is conducting me? What is its end and aim, its good and its evil, its uſe and improvement? What place does it fill in the univeaſe? What proportion does it bear to eternity?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:038601_0033_1012354C206C9D08"/>This mortal life is the beginning of exiſtence to beings made for immortality, and graciouſly deſigned, unleſs by wilful guilt they forfeit it, for everlaſting happineſs. Compared with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, its longeſt duration is leſs than a moment: therefore its good and evil, conſidered without a regard to the influence they may have on an eternity to come, muſt be trifling to a degree below contempt. The ſhort ſcene begun in birth, and cloſed by death, is acted over millions of times, in every age; and all the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of mortality are purſued, tranſacted, and forgot, like the labours of a bee-hive, or the buſtle of an ant-hill. <q>The thing which hath been, it is that which ſhall be; and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done; and there is no new thing under the ſun.</q> Our wiſdom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is to paſs through this buſy dream as calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we can; and not ſuffer ourſelves to be more deeply attached to any of theſe tranſitory things, than the momentarineſs and unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them deſerves.</p>
               <p>But conſidering this ſhort life as a probation for eternity, as a trial whoſe iſſue is to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our everlaſting ſtate, its importance to ourſelves appears beyond expreſſion great, and fills a right mind with equal awe and tranſport. The important day will come when there ſhall be a new thing indeed, but not under the ſun: For "heaven and earth ſhall paſs away;" but the words of HIM who created them, <q>ſhall not paſs away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What then is the good or the evil of life,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038601_0034_10123540A32E7458"/>but as it has a tendency to prepare or unfit us for that deciſive day? when <q>the Son of Man ſhall come in the clouds with power and great glory and ſhall ſend his angels, and ſhall gather his elect from the four winds:</q> That Son of Man who is the Son of GOD, <q>bleſſed for evermore;</q> and once before came down from heaven, and took upon him this our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nature, with all its innocent infirmities and ſufferings; and ſubjected himſelf even to the death of the croſs, that he might redeem us from all our ſins, and obtain the gift of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life for all who ſhould not willingly fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this laſt and greateſt effort of divine mercy!</p>
               <p>What then have we to do, but with love and gratitude unutterable to embrace the offers of ſalvation, and henceforth become in every thing his true and faithful diſciples? To whom ſhould we live, but to Him who died for us? To whom ſhould we give up ourſelves, but to Him who gave up himſelf for us? whoſe <q>yoke is eaſy, and his burden light.</q> In whom ſhould we truſt, but in Eternal Truth? In whom ſhould we cheerfully hope, but in Infinite Goodneſs? Whom ſhould we copy, but HIM, who was made like unto us in all things, ſin only excepted, and has left us an example, that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps? which if we do faithfully to the utmoſt of our power, his grace ſhall ſo aſſiſt us, that in the end we ſhall be where he is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory, and partake his bliſs.</p>
               <p>Let me think then, and think deeply, how I have employed this week paſt. Have I advanced
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:038601_0035_1012355255428CF8"/>in, or deviated from the path that leads to life? Has my time been improved or loſt, or, worſe than loſt, miſpent? If the laſt, let me uſe double diligence to redeem it. Have I ſpent a due portion of my time in acts of devotion and piety, both private, public, and domeſtic? and have they been ſincere, and free from all mixture of ſuperſtition, moroſeneſs, or weak ſcrupuloſity? Have I, in ſociety, been kind and helpful, mild, peaceable, and obliging? Have I been charitable, friendly, diſcreet? Have I had a due regard, without vanity or oſtentation, to ſet a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? Have I been equally ready to give and receive inſtruction and proper advice, careful to give no offence, and patient to take every thing in good part? Have I been honeſt, upright, and diſintereſted? Have I in my way, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſtation and calling, been diligent, frugal, generous, and induſtrious to do good? Have I, in all my behaviour, conſulted the happineſs and eaſe of thoſe I live with, and of all who have any dependence upon me? Have I preſerved my underſtanding clear, my temper calm, my ſpirits cheerful, my body temperate and healthy, and my heart in a right frame? If to all theſe queſtions I can humbly, yet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently anſwer, that I have done my beſt: If I have truly repented all the faulty paſt, and made humble, yet firm and vigorous and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate reſolutions for the future; poor as it is, the honeſt endeavour will be graciouſly accepted: And I may to-morrow gladly and ſecurely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſacred table, and partake that bread
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:038601_0036_1012355407F3A500"/>of life, which our bleſſed Saviour gave, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to all goodneſs thoſe who receive it worthily, and to be not only the means of grace, but the pledge of glory. Amen and Amen!</p>
