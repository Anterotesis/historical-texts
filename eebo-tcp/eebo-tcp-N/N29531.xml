            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Turkiſh Faſt, Out of the Monthly Mercury, for <hi>December,</hi> 1697.</head>
            <p>THe 29 of the laſt Month, N. S. the new Aga of the Janizaries made his Publick Entry into <hi>Adrianople</hi>; but he had not above Ten or Twelve Captains of the Janizaries to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, all the reſt who were at the Battel of <hi>Zenta</hi> being kill'd, or ſince dead of their Wounds. The next day the Grand Signior arriv'd at the ſame City with his new prime Viſir; but he rode directly to his Seraglio without entring into the City, not deſiring they ſhould make him any publick Reception, or that the Sultanneſs his Mother ſhould meet him, as ſhe intended, two Miles out of the City. The ill Succeſs of the laſt Campagne has caſt a deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation into all the Provinces of his Empire which have heard the ill Tidings, inſomuch that in ſome Places the People begin to murmur againſt the Grand Signior and his Government. For which Reaſon the Sultan has caus'd a General Faſt, and Publick Prayers to be ſaid throughout all his Dominions <hi>Alamode de Turqueske,</hi> which are to be accompany'd with Proceſſions to <hi>Mecca,</hi> in hopes to appeaſe the Anger of Heaven. To which purpoſe he has ſet forth the following Ordinance, wherein are many things to be obſerv'd relating to Mahometan Bigotry.</p>
            <p>THe Grand Signor of the Turks acknowledging that the Hand of God lies heavy upon his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and his Subjects, for that they have ſo often fought and been vanquiſh'd as well by Sea as by Land by their Enemies the Chriſtians, who have alſo in a little time regain'd from 'em a large Extent of their Country, attributes theſe frequent Misfortunes to the too great Confidence he has had in his Strength and his Alliances againſt the Emperor of the Chriſtians For which Reaſon he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains and Commands, by theſe Preſents, for the attoning the Wrath of God, and his great Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> That every <hi>Friday</hi> of the New Moon, as alſo upon the 5th. 6th. and 7th. of the Month, that all Perſons faſt all the Day, without eating or drinking, till the Stars appear in the Sky. That the Multi and his Clergy upon thoſe Days be cloath'd with Sackcloth, girt with Cords, with long Beards; and that they go in that poſture, firſt through the Streets, and then to the Churches, with their Eyes fix'd upon the Earth, lamenting and crying, <hi>Ja Aagib, Allah, Allah,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>O Merciful God, O God.</hi> That they alſo take the Coffin of the Grand Prophet out of his Sepulchre in <hi>Mecca</hi> That after they have plac'd it in a Chair, they alſo take Twenty five more Coffins full of the Bones of thoſe who were formerly ſlain fighting in Defence of the Muſulman Religion; which done, they ſhall perfume 'em with Incenſe, to the end that by that means the great Prophet may be mov'd to employ his Interceſſions to appeaſe the Wrath of the Great God. That atter all this has been done upon the above-mention'd Days, and that they ſhall have plac'd the Prophet's Coffin in the open Field, all Pilgrims and Inhabitants, as alſo all the Foreigners of all the Caravans, may walk ſeven times about the Coffin weeping and bewailing themſelves, and that the laſt Day of the Faſt they make a ſolemn Proceſſion, Twenty Miles an end, in the following manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Six thouſand Turks ſhall lead the way cloath'd in Sackloth, girt with Cords, bare-foot, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Turbans, carrying a Box full of dead Mens Bones, with broken Scimitars, ſmall ruſty Firearms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Three thouſand other Muſſelmen all bloody, cover'd with Aſhes, ſhall follow them, bewailing themſelves, and tearing their Cloaths.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Six thouſand Perſons naked from the Waſt upward, ſhall follow them, whipping their Backs and Breaſts with Thorns till they fetch blood, which ſhall drop upon the Ground, nor ſhall they be ſuffer'd to rub or wipe themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After them ſhall appear Three thouſand Spahi's bareheaded, with long Beards, carrying the Prophet's Coffin, who ſhall be ſurrounded with Three hundred Baſha's with naked Swords, and if any one ſhall offer to take off his Eyes from looking ſtedfaſtly upon the Coffin, the Baſha's ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently kill him,<note place="margin">☞</note> and caſt his body to the Dogs. 5 At the end of every Mile they ſhall put to the Sword a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slave, and a <hi>Jew</hi>; and they ſhell let 'em die in their own Blood. 6. Thirty Baſha's, Governours of Provinces, ſhall follow them without Purple, and with Turbans of plain black Cloth, dy'd before hand in the Blood of a <hi>Jew</hi> &amp; an Aſs: and every one of theſe Baſha's ſhall have one Hand bound behind him, and inſtead of a Sword ſhall wear a long Camel's Tail trailing upon the Ground. 7. Three thouſand Janizaries ſhall follow them without Arms, but with Battoons, which they ſhall trail after 'em, and they ſhall cry out, <hi>Allah bize ramah eile, Lord be Merciful unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Next to them ſhall come a Cheſt full of Money, which ſhall be ſcatter'd upon the Road. But the Poor ſhall be forbid, upon pain of being empal'd, to touch the Money before the end of the Proceſſion, 9. Laſtly, The Concourſe of People ſhall cloſe the Proceſſion. In the midſt of the Crowd there ſhall walk a Hundred Santons, or otherwiſe Turkiſh Hermites, who ſhall cut their Arms, Breaſts, and Faces, with Knives, till the Blood drop upon the Ground, and at the end of every Mile they ſhall lift up their Hands to Heaven, and cry, <hi>Vengeance against the Chriſtians,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Allah Jek<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Advice from FRANCE. From <hi>Poitou</hi> they Write, that the Sieur <hi>de Maupeon d' Ablege,</hi> Intendant of Juſtice, has given Sentence, without Appeal, upon ſeveral New Converts of that Country, that were aſſembl'd together for the Exerciſe of their Religion, two of which he caus'd to be hang'd, one at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and the other at St. <hi>Maixant,</hi> and he has alſo condemn'd ſeveral to the Galleys, others to Baniſhment, and others to terrible Forfeitures.</p>
