            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE MIGHTY DESTROYER DISPLAYED, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OBSERVING ſome years ago the dreadful havock made by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe of diſtilled ſpirituous liquors in this part of the world, I was induced to inſert in one of the almanacks an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of what had been written on that ſubject by Dr. Hales, fellow of the Royal Society, containing his own remarks, with the ſentiments of ſeveral perſons of note in the phyſical way; whoſe knowledge of the nature of diſtilled liquors, as well as of their effects on the human frame, beſt qualified them to give a right judgment thereon. And as the exceſſive and indeed inſtaken uſe of theſe liquors continues, and rather increaſes, on this Continent, 'tis thought a republication of thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:042555_0003_101C75A7CB10A058"/>with ſome additions, may, thro' divine bleſſing, be beneficial to many; particularly to ſome well minded people, who are under miſtaken prejudices on this moſt intereſting ſubject. "My principal and indeed only motive," ſays this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent author, <q>is to endeavour to rouſe the caution and indignation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, againſt thoſe mighty deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and debaſers of the human ſpecies, <hi>fermented diſtilled ſpirituous liquors;</hi> thoſe worſe than infernal ſpirits, which bewitch and infatuate the nations with their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries.</q> —An evil ſo amazingly great, that did not woeful experience too fully prove it, it ſeems incredible, that any whom it concerns could poſſibly be ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, as not to uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſuppreſs this deſtructive <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That eminent phyſician Dr. Hoſſman expreſly cautions againſt the uſe of diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſpirituous liquors. "Becauſe," ſays he, <q>they are, above all things, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, being cauſtic burning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which, by inflaming the ſolids, and thickening the fluids, cauſe obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which bring on many fatal diſcaſes, ſuch as hectick fevers, jaundice, dropſies, &amp;c. whereby multitudes are yearly and daily deſtroyed.</q> He alſo
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042555_0004_101C75AA6AF83A98"/>obſerves, <q>that they rot the entrails, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the liver, ſtomach and bowels; as it is evident, not only by opening the hodies of thoſe who are killed by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but alſo by what is obſerved in Germany of the effect which the cauſtic, fiery, remaining waſh of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillers, has on the guts of hogs; which are thereby ſo tendered, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make puddings with them.</q>—He farther obſerves, <q>That the fleſh of ſuch hogs will not keep, even when ſalted, ſo well as the fleſh of other hogs.</q> Dr. Cheyne, in his eſſay of health and long life, ſays, <q>All people, who have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the firſt cravings for ſuch poiſonous liquors. The maladies begot by them, bring forth neceſſity upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of drams and gills; till, at laſt, a kind dropſy, nervous convulſion, flux, if not a fever, or phrenzy, ſets the poor ſoul free. It has often raiſed in me the moſt melancholly reflections, to ſee the virtuous and ſenſible, bound in ſuch chains and fetters, as nothing leſs than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could releaſe them from.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Short, in his hiſtory of mineral waters, page 225. ſays, <q>The ofther I reflect on the miſchief done by diſtilled
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:042555_0005_101C75AD2A652A28"/>ſpirits, the more I am confirmed, that the human race had been happier had drams never been known: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help cordially joining with Doctor Allen, in his Synopſis Medici, A. 1633. <hi>That the plentiful devouring of thoſe ſpirits has killed as many thouſands of men, as there are ſtars in the ſky. Nay, ten times ten thouſands have died by theſe, more than all the reſt of the poiſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Lind, in his treatiſe on the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, ſays, <q>He obſerved moſt deſtructive diſtempers to be much increaſed, even to mortality, by diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; which ſailors are too apt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ſwallow down.</q> And Doctor Hales obſerves, from the remarks made to him by an eminent ſurgeon, <q>That the ſtomachs of great dram-drinkers were contracted into half the common natural ſize, and hard; ſomewhat like leather, that had been held to the fire. The conſequence of which was, loſs of appetite, and a waſting conſumption.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the ſeverity of weather, to which men are ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; without which, they ſay, they ſhould periſh with cold; which is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in a great meaſure, true of thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:042555_0006_101C75AFCB57CB18"/>who are habituated to drink them; the blood of ſuch being thereby ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifeleſs in the midſt of ſummer, without frequent repetitions: this is what ſome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to endure cold and hardſhips? their vital heat not being extinguiſhed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, does, by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually ſecure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the falſe flaſh of a dram. Beſides, it is well known, that men did not periſh in the coldeſt countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had. Of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hudſon's Bay, page 199. Where he obſerves, <q>That the natives on the very cold coaſt, of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to ſell diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robuſt and active; whereas thoſe of them that are ſupplied with drams from the Engliſh, are a meagre, dwarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, indolent people, hardly equal to the ſeverity of the country, and ſubject to many diſorders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:042555_0007_101C75B2693CDAB0"/>
And as to the pernicious effects of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coaſt of Guinea) it is obſerved, that the French and Portugueſe, who do not indulge in diſtilled ſpirits, are healthy compared with the Engliſh; who, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely of ſpirits, &amp;c. die faſt. Thus, alſo, it is obſerved of the women in the Weſt-Indies, that being ſober, they live long; but it is often otherwiſe with the men, who are more generally intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>The unhappy dram-drinkers are ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bound in ſlavery to theſe infernal ſpirits, that they ſeem to have loſt the power of delivering themſelves from this worſt of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of thoſe, who have it in their power, to with-hold this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>man-bane,</hi> either as parents, maſters, or rulers to the people committed to their truſt.</p>
            <p>Since then the evil is become ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly epidemical as to debilitate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy multitudes, in moſt parts of the world; it behoves all, who have any bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of pity for their fellow-creatures, more eſpecially the governors of the nations, as guardians and tender fathers, to guard the people committed to their charge from this <hi>mighty deſtroyer.</hi> Can there be any
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:042555_0008_101C75B62CEEAF80"/>conſideration, of ſufficient weight, to the contrary. Is it found policy to encourage vice in the people, becauſe a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue ariſes from their debaucheries? Where will the revenue be, when the people, who ſhould pay them, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? Are not a hardy, induſtrious healthy people, always found to be the moſt able to contribute amply to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government? And will not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, in the end, be found a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to increaſe the real wealth and ſtrength of a nation, than to make drunkenneſs the cheapeſt of vices? But if the conſideration of the inhumanity of being inſtrumental to the deſtruction of multitudes, and in a manner, in ſome parts of the world, of whole nations, is not of weight enough to influence; yet, ſure, the awful conſideration, that it muſt needs be highly diſpleaſing to our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator, to have his favourite creature man thus debaſed, diſgraced, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in body and ſoul, ought to have its due weight. Can it in reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that he will always remain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſpectator of of ſuch aſtoniſhing proceedings? And will he not in mercy viſit the nations for theſe things, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſtill much greater ruin of future generations, in conformity to his uſual
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:042555_0009_101C75B7B4B36CB0"/>method of proceeding, when irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are arrived to great exceſſes? This diſeaſe has now attained to ſo enormous a pitch, that it is much to be feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than God's ſevere fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, will effectually cure it in many of the nations; who ſeem as ſupine and unconcerned about it, as if only ſo many thouſands of locuſts were deſtroyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: for if in fifty or ſixty years this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive peſt has ſpread thus far and wide, how vaſtly greater will the havock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mankind be in an hundred years more, if ſome check be not put to its career?</p>
            <p>If it had been ſaid, an hundred years ago, to any of the rulers of the nations, that they ſhould patiently, and even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly, ſee ſuch multitudes of their ſubjects deſtroyed both body and ſoul, and that only for filthy lucre; would they not, with indignation, have ſaid as Hazael did to Eliſha, 2 Kings viii. 13. <q>
                  <hi>But what is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi>
               </q> The plain truth is, that it is with the nations as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens to private perſons, that when they grow gradually from bad to worſe, they, at the ſame time, become more and more hardened, ſo as to be even reconciled to practices for which they had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:042555_0010_101C75BA93FA0F38"/>at firſt the utmoſt deteſtation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for familiarity takes away our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and robs things of their power to ſtrike ſtrongly upon us.</p>
            <p>Though thouſands and tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands periſh every year by diſtilled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors, yet few appear to lay it effectually of heart, I muſt here except the heads of the poor wild Indians, of the Six Nations ſituate back of New-York, and other parts of North-America, who being ſenſible of the great deſtruction made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them by diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, have long ſince, and do ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, earneſtly to deſire, that no ſuch ſpirit ſhould be ſold to their people. At a treaty held at Carliſle in this province, with the deputics of the Six Nations, the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares and other weſtern Indians, in the year 1753, Scarrooyady, one of the chiefs of the Six Nations, ſpeaking on behalf of all the Indians preſent, expreſſed himſelf to the following effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The rum ruins us: we beg you would prevent its coming in ſuch quantities, by regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the traders. We never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the trade was for whiſkey <note n="*" place="bottom">A ſpirit made of grain.</note> We deſire it may be forbidden, and none
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:042555_0011_101C75BD64680D98"/>ſold in the Indian country; but that if the Indians will have any, they may go amongſt the inhabitants, and deal with them for it. When theſe whiſkey tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders come, they bring thirty or forty cags, puts them down before us, and make us drink, and get all the ſkins that ſhould go to pay the debts we have contracted, for goods bought of the fair trader; and by theſe means, we not only ruin ourſelves, but them too. Theſe wicked whiſkey ſellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them ſell their very clothes from their backs. In ſhort, if this practice be continued, we muſt be inevitably ruined. We moſt earneſtly, therefore, beſeech you to remedy it.</q> The Indian ſpeaker gave, as is uſual with them in matters of moment, a treble ſtring of wampum, in confirmation of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The deſtructive effect of diſtilled ſpirits, have alſo extended their baneful influence amongſt the people of Africa. It is, in a great meaſure, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of thoſe infernal ſpirits, that the poor negroes have been as it were bewitched, and prevailed upon to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their unhappy country people, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring them to the European mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: hence devaſlation, bloodſhed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:042555_0012_101C75C140F29978"/>have ſpread in their land; many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and hundreds of thouſands, have been doomed to a miſerable thraldom ; and many, very many, brought to a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and untimely end: innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be mentioned, to confirm this melancholy truth; of which I ſhall mention two, <hi>viz.</hi> Andrew Brue, the noted French factor, who reſided ſixteen years in Guinea, tells us, <q>That, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, brandy is the beſt commodity amongſt the negroes, as they love it to exceſs: that it is eaſy, from hence, to eſtimate the vaſt profit made by the company, when its ſtore-houſe is well provided with this liquor.</q> And Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Moor, the Engliſh factor, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Africa, ſays, <q>That it was to the king of Barſailly's inſatiable thirſt for brandy, that his ſubjects freedom and families were in ſo precarious a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is no uncommon thing for habitual rum-drinkers, when a ſit of ſickneſs comes on, which they conclude will be their laſt, to deſire to have plenty of rum by them; by which means, they continue intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated till death: to ſo aſtoniſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable a ſottiſh condition have they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced themſelves! This is a caſe ſo cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous to mankind, that to have a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:042555_0013_101C75C2CA9C6288"/>ſenſe of it, and yet not to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, nor earneſtly caution againſt it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind perſon of a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous precipice or pit; yet, alas! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned are the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at this moſt enormous ruin of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes! In trials for life, what diligence is uſed to ſind the occaſion of the loſs of one ſubject! What care will not a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phyſician beſtow for the preſervation of one life! How did the wiſe Romans honour him, who ſaved the life of one Roman citizen! But in the preſent caſe, it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thouſand, but probably no leſs than a million that peris;h, yearly, by this worſt of plagues. How then dare the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of nations be unconcerned or ſilent in a cauſe in which humanity, virtue, and the real welfare of mankind, both civil and religious, are ſo deeply concerned? A cauſe, which tends not only to the weakening the faculties, enervating the bodies of men, but alſo in debaſing the ſpecies, and ſhortening the lives of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.</p>
            <p>But the moſt afflictive and dreadful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the common uſe of diſtilled ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors, are, that it not only height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the paſſions of men and depraves their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:042555_0014_101C75C5B3E552F8"/>morals; but what is inſinitely worſe, and ought to be <hi>an awakening</hi> conſideration, they become prophane and abandoned, and to the laſt degree regardleſs of their duty to God and man; the feelings of the mind are gradually benumb'd, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility to the healing inſluence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion enſues.</p>
            <p>The Almighty who has ſo curiouſly wrought our wonderful frame out of the duſt, knowing how prone we are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order it by irregularities, hath of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fatherly care of us, not only implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us a ſtrong deſire of life and ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but has alſo ſtriclly warned us to avoid all deſtructive irregularities and vices, and to practiſe thoſe virtues which are ſo well adapted to our nature, that they have a direct tendency to give health to the ſoul, as well as marrow to the bones, Prow. cxi. 8. Yet how is this delicate, this curiouſly wrought frame, abuſed and diſord red by repeated irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of many kinds, but never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the enormous degree that it has of late years arrived at by the exceſſive abuſe of theſe formented, diſtilled ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors, which, by their miſchievous effects, ſeem to claim Satan himſelf for their author. The benevolent author firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned from whoſe collection great part of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:042555_0015_101C75C8508C5018"/>the foregoing is collected, obſerves, <q>That if any of his readers ſhould think the ſubject is overpreſſed, ſuch are deſired to conſider that the calamitous urgency of the caſe abſolutely requireth the moſt pathetical expoſtulation, to rouſe the attention and indignation of mankind, againſt this greateſt of all plagues that ever befel unhappy man, which is both our ſin and our moſt ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Cheyne farther obſerves, <q>That if only the profligate, the ſcoundrel, the abandoned run into theſe exceſſes, it were as vain to endeavour to reclaim them, as it were to ſtop a tempeſt, or calm a ſtorm: But that now the vice is become epidemical, ſince it has got not only among mechanics and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but among perions of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but among perions of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt genius, the fineſt taſte, and the moſt accompliſhed parts. And oh! that I could (adds the doctor) give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the lye in not mentioning them, even among the firſt and leaſt fallen part of the creation itſelf, and thoſe of them too, of the moſt elegant parts end the ſtricteſt virtuc, even of thoſe who are in other reſpects blameleſs. Since the caſe is ſo, it will not be amiſs to ſhew, to the evidence of a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:042555_0016_101C75CB00F2C858"/>ſtration, the folly as well as fruitleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a courſe. A fit of the colick, or of the vapours; a family misfortune: the death of a child, or of a friend, with the aſſiſtance of the nurfe or the next neighbour, often gives riſe and becomes the weighty cauſes of ſo fatal an effect. A little lowneſs requires drops, which paſs readily down under the notion of phyſic: Drops beget drams, and drams beget more drams, till they come to be without weight and without meaſure—did this bewitching poiſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually cure or relieve them from time to time, ſomething might be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the folly and the frenzy of ſuch a courſe, but on the contrary, it height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and enrages all their ſymptoms and ſufferings ever afterwards, excepting the few moments immediately after taking it down; and every dram be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the neceſtity of two more to cure the ill effects of the firſt, and one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute's indulgence they purchaſe with many hours of greater pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beſides making the malady more incurable. Low ſpiritedneſs itſelf is no diſeaſe; beſides there are remedies that will relieve it ſo long as there is any oil remaining in the lamp.—Exerciſe, abſtinence and proper evacuations, with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:042555_0017_101C75CDB2554CB8"/>time and patience, will continually make it tolerable; very often they will perfectly cure. The running into drams is giving up the whole at once, for neither laudanum nor arſenick will kill more certainly, altho' more quickly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The miſtaken uſe and grievous abuſe of rum and other diſtilled ſpirits, perhaps in no caſe appear more palpably than at the time of harneſt, a buſineſs which, under the Moſaic Diſpenſation, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly enjoined to be carried on with humiliation and thankſgiving, and ought by all means, to be obſerved as ſuch under the goſpel; but through the abuſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors, is made an occaſion of a greater abuſe of the creature and diſhonour of the Creator; this ariſes, in many, from a miſtaken perſuaſion that hard labour, particularly that of the harveſt field, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be carried on without a quantity of rum or other diſtilied ſpirits; and in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died in the field through extream heat and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and it is ſuppoſed that many more would die, if a plentiful uſe of ſpirituous liquors was not allowed. But this I am perſuaded is a great miſtake, it being much more likely that the free uſe of rum occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the death of thoſe people; the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:042555_0018_101C75D04FAEE868"/>quantity they had ſwallowed down, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater flow of ſpirits into the head than the ſtrength of the body could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Indeed the repeated large quantities of rum commonly drank during the whole time of harveſt, keeps up the blood in a continual ferment and ſever, in which ſtate people cannot have a proper reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſleep; their conſtitutions are thereby onervated, their lives ſhortened, and an unfitneſs for religious impreſſions general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevails.</p>
            <p>Theſe moſt ſolemn and weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, have induced ſome well mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people to endeavour to lead, by their examples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and under theſe attempts, experience has made in manifeſt, that very little or no ſtrong liquor is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at thoſe times; indeed they have been convinced that the harveſt and other laborious work, can be very well manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without making uſe of any ſpirituous liquors at all. If ſuch labour was carried on with ſteadineſs and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of ſtrength being ſought for by that means; more frequent intervals of reſt, with a little food, oftener allowed the reapers, and ſmall drinks; ſuch as molaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and water made agreeable with a little
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:042555_0019_101C75D4467DE938"/>cyder, ſmall beer, or even milk and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's ſatisfaction and their own advantage; and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus wages they would receive, inſtead of the ſpirituous liquors uſually given, might be ſuſticient to purchaſe bread for their families.</p>
            <p>This ſober and moderate manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was certainly the general practice in this province, for a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years after its firſt ſettlement, when but ſmall quantities of ſtrong liquors, and often none at all could be procured <note n="*" place="bottom">In a printed oration, not long ſince pronounced by Dr. Ruſh, before the Philoſophical Society of this city, we are told at page 65, <q>Some of you may remember the time, and your fathers have told thoſe of us who do not, when the diſeaſes of Pennſylvania were as few and as ſimple as thoſe of the Indians. The food of the inhabitants was then ſimple; their only drink was water; their appetites were reſtrained by labour: religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the influence of ſickening paſſions: private hoſpitality ſupplied the want of public hoſpitals: nature was their only nurſe: temperance their principal phyſician.</q>
               </note> The people in thoſe early times maintained their health, and were enabled to perform their labour to ſatisfaction. But this did not long continue, the great call for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:042555_0020_101C75D5CE1A8CC8"/>brought us into connections with thoſe countries from whence rum was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and the deſire of gain has ſince in a progreſſive encreaſe, induced our traders to bring us plenty of diſtilled ſpirits, and together with them <hi>diſeaſes and death</hi> in return for our flour, and other uſeful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.

                     </gap>1400 gallons.</p>
                  <p>So that by a modeſt computation there <hi>has been</hi> couſumed in one year, at leaſt twenty five thouſand pounds in rum. This exceſſive drinking of rum, as it has ſlain its thouſands, is likely to deſtroy its ten thouſands, for by its corroſive and fiery property, is debauches the ſtomach, dries up the radical moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, poiſons the juices, inflames the blood; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheaths the bowels, debilitates the nerres and ſtepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the brain.</p>
               </note> we find the introduction and conſumption of rum had made an amazing progreſs, and began to rouſe the attention of ſome of the conſiderate, may I not ſay, of the lovers of their country in that day. And from the too apparent general uſe, there is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:042555_0021_101C75D871785A38"/>no room to ſuppoſe but that it has gone on in an increaſed proportion to our numbers; tho' not now ſo eaſily aſcertained, from the additional numbers of ports, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious means of procuring it: Nor ought we to omit, in ſuch accounts, the large quantities of whiſky and other liquors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled amongſt ourſelves from grain, fruit, and molaſſes, which cannot well be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>I have heard of ſeveral thoughtful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who, from a perſuaſion that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of giving ſpirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with thoſe they have employed, not to uſe any ſpirituous liquors in their fields; theſe have had their work performed to good ſatisfaction, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any damage enſuing to their labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Nay, where they have remained any conſiderable time with ſuch employers, they have generally acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſenſible of the benefit ariſing from having thus totally refrained the uſe of thoſe liquors. A particular inſtance of this kind occurred laſt ſummer, in the caſe of Joſhua Evans, of Haddonfield; this conſiderate perſon being convinced that the uſe of rum and other ſpirituous liquors, was extreamly hurtful to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring people; more eſpecially during
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:042555_0022_101C75DA00D14A20"/>the time of harveſt, apprehended it to be his duty, to become an example in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to this pernicious cuſtom; and he concluded to run all riſques of loſs and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which might happen to himſelf by the delay of bringing in his harveſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than comply with a cuſtom which he apprehended to be ſo deſtructive of his fellow <hi>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore offered ſix-pence per day more than other farmers, to ſuch labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as were willing to aſſiſt in bringing in his harveſt, on condition that no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors ſhould be uſed in his fields. Notwithſtanding the ſingularity of ſuch a propoſal, a ſufficient number of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers offered themſelves, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, That the hurrying manner in which the people drove on their labour in the harveſt field, cauſed an unnatural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and heat in their bodies, and of courſe an exceſſive thirſt enſued, which often occaſioned their drinking water, or ſmall liquors, in ſuch immoderate degree as to become hurtful and very dangerous, that this was generally aſſigned as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the uſe of ſpirituous liquors: That, in order to avoid theſe extremes, he propoſed to lead them himſelf in the harveſt work, deſiring they would go no faſter than he did; they acted according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:042555_0023_101C75DDC30FA160"/>and his corn was cut down and brought in as well, if not better, than ever it had been before; and tho' the people drank little but water or milk and water, chuſing it rather than cyder and water, or ſmall beer, which they were not uſed to; they went thro' their buſineſs with ſatisfaction to him and themſelves. This perſon has purſued the ſame courſe with labourers he has hired for other work; who, tho' ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſpirituous liquors, after having ſerved him ſeveral days, have frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they had done very well <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them,</hi> finding themſelves in a better ſtate both of body and mind, than when they began to work for him.</p>
            <p>This is a plain inſtance in contradiction to the common prejudice, that labouring people cannot with ſafety perform their work without uſing thoſe liquors. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral more examples might be inſtanced of ſome conſiderate people who have made it a rule not to make any uſe of ſpirituous liquors, either amongſt their workmen in the proſecution of their trades, or on their plantations. To theſe experience has ſhewn, that their people could not only do as well without it, but found themſelves much better in health, and well ſatisfied in mind.</p>
            <p>Several phyſicians of eminence have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves in favour of this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:042555_0024_101C75E193F3F0D0"/>amongſt others, the celebrated doctor Buchan, in his Domeſtic Medicine, or Family Phyſician, a work ſo well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as to have been, within theſe two years, twice reprinted in this city. At page 71, of the Engliſh edition, he ſays, <q>Many imagine that hard labour could not be ſupported without drinking ſtrong liquors. This, tho' a common, is a very erroneous notion. Men who never taſted ſtrong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily <note n="*" place="bottom">The few of theſe, who notwithſtanding their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, may have attained to a conſiderable age, it is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, would have lived much longer, had they been temperate.</note> But ſuppoſe ſtrong <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fever, which waſtes the ſpirits, heats and inflames the blood, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſes the body to numberleſs diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At page, the ſame author tells us, <q>That all intoxicating liquors may be conſidered as poiſons. However diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:042555_0025_101C75E31E86C608"/>that is their real character, and ſooner or later they will have their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q> It is a prevailing opinion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of drinking ſpirituous liquors at har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and other hard labour, that it gives relief by throwing out the ſweat. Now, moderate quantities of any ſmall liquor, even water itſelf, if not drank too cold, and particularly if ſweetned with molaſſes, and a little ſour'd with ſome proper acid, would certainly anſwer the purpoſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bad effects which attend the uſe of ſpirits.</p>
            <p>It is well known that a pint of good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes will, in diſtillation, afford rather more than a pint of good proof rum; therefore muſt contain as much, if not more real ſtrength than the ſame quantity of rum, without any of its noxious qualities; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the ſtate the Almighty firſt formed it, the fiery property ſo clothed and united with the earthy and balſamick parts, as to cauſe it to be quite friendly to our nature, and not liable to intoxicate; as the ſpirit alone will, when ſeparated by diſtillation from the other parts.</p>
            <p>Small beer or water mixed with ſome of our home made wines; or, as before ſaid, water mixed with a due quantity of molaſſes, made agreeably acid, to ſuch as chuſe it, by mixing it with a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:042555_0026_101C75E4B12BD460"/>of cyder, or ſome other acid liquor, or even good vinegar <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>We find by hiſtory, that the Roman ſoldiers in their long marches, often thro' parching deſerts, loaded with heavy armour, uſed vinegar and water as the moſt ſuitable refreſhment, they carried with them two veſſels, either of tin or leuther, the one filled with water, the other with vinegar. It alſo appears from ſcripture, in the caſe of Ruth, when in the learveſt field of Boaz, that it was cuſtomary to make uſe of vinegar, as a ſuitable refreſhment in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Ruth, chap. ii.</p>
                  <p>I was informed by a perſon who reſided ſome time with the Indians, that they made a drink with parched corn, which was very agreeable and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The corn, after being parched, is pounded and ſifted, the mealy part mixed in water, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes or ſugar, to this ſome proper acid might be added, which would make it yet more agreeable and wholſome.</p>
               </note>; milk and water, or even water itſelf, if uſed with caution, will anſwer all the purpoſes of common drink for labouring people.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ſeveral prejudices in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the miſtaken uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, there is none gives it a greater ſanction or ſupport, than the prevailing opinion, even with perſons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed with water, is the beſt and ſafeſt liquor that can be drank; hence conſirming it, that ſpirit in one form
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:042555_0027_101C75E9ABF3BD50"/>or other is neceſſary. To ſuch who have not been accuſtomed, and think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not habituate themſelves to drink water, there may appear to be ſome kind of plea in this argument, eſpecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cyder, or other fermented liquors that are dead, hard, ſour, or not properly fermented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing colicks, &amp;c. But I believe if thoſe perſons ſuffered the weight of the ſubject, and the conſequence of the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they thereby give to the uſe of theſe deſtructive ſpirits, to take proper place with them, it might ſuggeſt the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if not neceſſity, of introducing a more ſalutary practice to themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. That pure fluid (water) which the benevolent father of the family of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind points out for general uſe, is ſo ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the human frame, that except in a very few caſes, people might with ſafety gradually uſe themſelves to it: And as to ſuch well diſpoſed people who ſtill retain a favourable opinion for the uſe of ſpirit mixed with water, ought they not, even from love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from, and example others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, (on account of the prodigious havock made by the uſe of ſpirits) agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the example ſet us by the Apoſtle

And where water is met with, as is ſometimes the caſe, which is ſcarce fit to drink; its vain to think to remove the noxious qualities by mixing it with ſpirit; for tho' bad water may be made more palatable by mixing ſpirit with it, yet all the bad qualities of the water will remain, to which will only be ſuperadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bad qualities of the ſpirit. There are many ways propoſed by which water may be helped without any ſuch additions, as by filtration, thro' porous ſtones, or thro' an earthen veſſel, in the bottom of which there is a quantity of ſand, which retains the noxious mixture. Hard water
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:042555_0029_101C75EE215A1DD0"/>may be made ſoft by boiling, or by being expoſed to the ſun and air. Some propoſe mixing water, which is impure, with loam; this being well ſtirred and left to ſettle, the noxious parts will ſubſide with the loam, and the water may be drawn off clear and ſit for uſe.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cheyne in his treatiſe before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, obſerves, That without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, water is the primitive original beverage; as it is the only ſimple fluid ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for diluting, moiſtening and cooling— the ends of drink, appointed by nature, and happy had it been for the race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it other mixed and artificial liquors had never been invented. <q>It has been an agreeable appearance to me, ſays this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to obſerve with what freſhneſs and vigour thoſe who, tho' eating freely of fleſh meat, yet drank nothing but this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, have lived in health, indolence, and chearfulneſs to a great age. Water alone is ſufficient and effectual for all the purpoſes of human wantin drink. Strong liquors were never deſigned for common uſe. They were formerly kept in England, as other medicines are, in apotherearies ſhops.</q> Speaking of the effects of wine (a liquor in general much leſs hurtful than diſtilled ſpirits) which he ſays to have been ſo much in uſe at the time he wrote,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:042555_0030_101C75EFAA124F38"/>that the better ſort of people ſcarcely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <q>That as natural cauſes will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produce their proper eſlects, their blood was inſlamed into gout, ſtone, and rheumatiſm, raging fevers, pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, &amp;c. Water is the only diſſolvent or menſtruum, and the moſt certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luter of all bodies proper for food.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Short, in his diſcourſe of the inward uſe of water, ſpeaks much in its commendation. He ſays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of water, from the longevity and healthfulneſs of thoſe who at firſt had no better liquor, and the health and ſtrength of body and ſerenity of mind of thoſe who at this day have no other common liquor to drink. Of this the common people amongſt the Highlands of Scotland, are a ſuſſicient inſtance, amongſt whom it is no rarity to find perſons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy, ſtrong, and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty-ſix or forty <note n="*" place="bottom">I was informed by a perſon of credit, from his own obſervations in Scotland, of the ſtrength and hardineſs of the common people there; and of their ability to bear cold and fatigue; tho' the cold is great in winter, and their ſupport in ſome parts principally, if not wholly when abroad confined to oatmeal and water; he has ſeen a ſhepherd laid down to reſt on ſleep on the mountain, without any ſhelter, wrapt up in his plaid in cold ſnowy weather, ſuch as would have froze moſt other people.</note> The excellency of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:042555_0031_101C75F49E678220"/>water, the doctor ſays, may be argued from the great ſucceſs people, otherwiſe deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, have attained over other nations, while they remained content with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of nature for drink. Of this the Perſian, Grecian, and Roman monarchies are inſtances. This was alſo the caſe of our anceſtors, the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, whilſt their manners remained ſimple, and their food and drink ſuch as nature had provided, they encreaſed to ſuch a degree, that their country not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to contain them, they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend out ſwarms of people to ſeek for ſettlements in the more ſouthern parts of the world; theſe gradually ſettled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the different parts of the Roman empire: But ſince thoſe Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have forſaken the wholſome cuſtoms of their forefathers, and habituated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the uſe of ſtrong liquors, they are ſo enfeebled, and their numbers have ſo much decreaſed, that many parts of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:042555_0032_101C75F6261D1480"/>their own country now remain unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. The rulers eaſy under the pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary advantages which ariſe, themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the practice of drinking to exceſs, look without concern on this enormous ruin of multitudes of their fellow men. Thus it is in Ruſſia, where a vaſt revenue is raiſed from diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, and a multitude of people proportionably large, are deſtroyed thereby. Again ſays the doctor, <q>There is a ridiculous maxim uſed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for buſineſs—I ſay it is water only that can endue its drinkers with the ſtrongeſt bodies and moſt robuſt conſtitutions, where exerciſe or labour is joined with it, ſince it beſt aſſiſts the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the ſmalleſt particles, that they may better paſs the ſtrainers of the body, which ſeparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the ſides of the veſſels, and exerciſe invigorates the fibres and muſcles; whereas the rapid motion of the blood excited by drinking ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, can not fail of being prejudicial to the body, it will cauſe the watery parts to diſſipate and the remaining grow thick and tough, and the event be obſtructions, inflammations, impoſthumations, &amp;c.— and tho' ſtrong liquors afford a greater
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:042555_0033_101C75F8D7F7ECE0"/>flow of ſpirit for a ſhort time, yet this is always followed with as much low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit; ſo that to gain a neceſſary ſtock of ſpirits, the perſon is obliged to repeat the ſame force, till he learns a cuſtom of drinking drams. In this we are confirmed, if we conſider the great ſtrength and hardineſs of poor ruſticks in many parts of the world, whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is moſtly vegetable food, and their drink water." The doctor adds, "That it often happens that perſons of tender, weakly, crazy conſtitutions, by refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong liquors and accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drink water, make ſhift to ſpin out many years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Cadogan, in his treatiſe on the gout, lately printed in this city, tells us, <q>That water is the only liquor nature knows of, or has provided for all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and whatſoever nature gives we muſt depend upon it, is beſt and ſafeſt for us; accordingly we ſee that when we have committed any exceſs or miſtake of any kind, and ſuffer for it, 'tis water that relieves. Hence the chief good of bath, ſpa, and many other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal waters, eſpecially to hard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is that element that dilutes and carries off crudities and indigeſtions, &amp;c. the mineral virtues they contain may
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:042555_0034_101C75FA72D01E20"/>make them tolerable to the ſtomach in their paſſage, but do, as I believe, little more in the body, it is the water that cures. Wine was given us as a cordial.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Cheyne ſays he has known men of weak and tender conſtitutions, who could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor digeſt upon drinking wine, who, by drinking at meals common water heated, have recovered their appetites and digeſtion, &amp;c. have thriven and grown plump. Speaking of malt liquors, he gives it as his ſentiment, that a weak ſtomach can as readily, and with leſs pain, digeſt pork and peaſe ſoup, as Yorkſhire or Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham ale: he adds, That they are of ſo glutinous a nature as to make excellent bird lime, and when ſimmered ſometime over a gentle fire, make the moſt ſticking, and the beſt plaſter for old ſtrains that can be contrived. Even the ſmall beer that is commonly drank at London, if it be not well boiled, very clear, and of a due age, muſt be hurtful to perſons of weak nerves and ſlow digeſtion.</p>
            <p>Doctor Buchan tells us, The great quantity of viſcid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to render the blood ſizy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inflammations of the lungs. Thoſe who drink ardent ſpirits or ſtrong
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:042555_0035_101C75FF6BC84468"/>wine, do not run leſs hazard; theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender veſſels of the lungs in pieces.</p>
            <p>Doctor Short, page 33, after deſcribing the many diſtempers produced by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of malt and other fermented liquors, adds, That ſeeing conſtitutions differ, it is not to be expected that ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors ſhould produce all the ſame ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in one and the ſame perſon, yet that all drinkers have ſeveral of them; and if they come not to that height, its becauſe they afterwards uſe great exerciſe or hard labour, with ſometimes thin diluting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, which prevent their immediate hurting <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Edward Bancroft, in his natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Guiana, which includes the colonies of Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, Barbices, &amp;c. writes, That the inhabitants derive no ſmall aſſiſtance from the Indians—ſome of whom reſide on almoſt every plantation.—Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians however, are debauched by luxury and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and their manners but ill agree with thoſe of the Indians who have preſerved their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and ſimplicity. They are encouraged in their propenſity to intemperance by the whites, who freely ſupply them with rum, thereby to attach them more firmly to their ſervice, which confiderably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs their health and diminiſhes their numbers.— Speaking of the diſeaſes incident to the country, he ſays, Theſe are as numerous as in other countries, where they have been augmented by cookery, with its ſtimulating, provocative arts, exciting inordinate appetites, by multiplying the variety of diſhes, which blended in the ſtomach, compoſe ſuch an incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous medly, that the digeſtive organs cannot poſſibly aſſimilate the pernicious maſs to wholeſome chyle.

Its cuſtomary, and often neceſſary in the ſummer ſeaſon, particularly in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons, for people who are ſpent by labour or application, to have recourſe to ſome kind of refreſhment. This is generally of two kinds, very different in their nature and effect, <hi>viz.</hi> The one is a mixture of ſpirituous liquors, as punch, grog, &amp;c. or fermented liquors, as cyder, beer, &amp;c. The other is mild and diluting, ſuch as tea, or coffee, &amp;c. The uſe of ſpirituous or fermented liquors, for the reaſons already given, are hurtful and dangerous; more eſpecially, as the ſorrowful experience of many within knowledge, has taught that there is very great danger of even ſober
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:042555_0037_101C760398781578"/>people who uſe them, with what is termed moderation, becoming habituated and gradually encreaſing their ſtrength and quantity, till it proves the ruin of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families.</p>
            <p>This caution can ſcarcely be too often repeatod, as it has been ſo frequently the melancholy ſituation of perſons, other wiſe valuable members of ſociety. But the uſe of mild diluting drinks, ſuch as cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, or the ſeveral ſorts of teas, either of our own produce or thoſe brought from the Indies, may be truly cermed innocent and friendly to our naturcs, and very proper to promote a good perſpiration and recruit our ſpirits when diſſipated thro' application or labour. And as the uſe of theſe innocent dilutors have not eſcaped cenſure, more eſpecially from perſons who are attached to the uſe of ſpirituous or fermented liquers; it may be agrecable to the reader, to hear the ſentiments of doctor Cheyne on the ſubject. And here it may be well to remark that theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations were addreſſed to the people of England, where the heat not being ſo great as in theſe parts, thoſe reſtorative dilutent drinks are not ſo frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

            <p>Doctor Engelbertus Kaempfer, phyſician of the Dutch embaſſy to the emperor of Japan, in his account of that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, preparation, and uſe of tea; ſays, is ſo common in Japan, that travellers drink ſcarce any thing elſe upon the road.—The freſh gathered leaves are dried or roaſted
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:042555_0040_101C760D5531F2F8"/>over the fire in an iron pan, and when hot, rolled with the palm of the hand on a matt, till they become curled. They have public roaſting houſes built for this very purpoſe, and contrived ſo that every body may bring their leaves to be coaſted. The doctor makes no diſtinction between green and bohea; the only difference from his account, ariſes from the different time of gathering. The firſt, gathered whilſe the leaves are tender, has the beſt flavour and is moſt valuable; the ſecond is leſs ſo: the laſt, gathered when the leaves are full grown is the cheapeſt. He gives it as his ſentiments, from his obſervations of the effect of tea, that when properly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and of a due age, it gently refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the animal ſpirits, and wonderfully chears and comforts the mind; it opens obſtructions, cleanſes the blood, and more particularly removes that tartarous matter which is the efficient cauſe of gravelly and gouty diſternpers. This he ſays it does ſo effectually, that he never met with any who was troubled either with the gout or ſtone, amongſt the tea-drinkers of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. He adds that he is wholly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the uſe of teas would be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame ſucceſs in the like eaſes, even in Europe, were it not for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diltary diſpoſition, for either of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers derived to ſome perſons from their

It appears the uſe of tea meets with oppoſition in the Eaſt countries, as well as amongſt ourſelves, from thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe practice contradicts the uſe of theſe kinds of innocent diluting drinks: for the doctor remarks, That in Japan the uſe of tea is very much cried down by thoſe perſons who are lovers of ſakii beer, which is there brewed from rice.</p>
            <p>All the good qualities aſcribed by the above mentioned phyſicians, to foreign tea, may be as truly applied to teas made of our own country produce, ſuch as ſage, balm, burnet, ſaſſafraſs, &amp;c. &amp;c. theſe I am perſuaded would anſwer all, if not more and better purpoſes than the foreign teas. But I ſpare to ſay much on this head at preſent, leſt by diſcouraging the uſe of any mild diluting drink, (eſpecially one in ſuch general uſe, and which ſimply conſidered as a diluent, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a good ſubſtitute,) any ſtrength ſhould be given to the uſe of ſpirituous or fermented liquors in its ſtead.</p>

What multitudes of lives would thereby be ſaved, and what innumerable outrages, as theſt, murder, &amp;c. prevented: To rectify which, were an apparently vain and fruitleſs attempt, while drunkenneſs is made the cheapeſt of all vices.

            <p>And as for ſuch who, tho' convinced of the impropriety of the practice, yet for fear of not having their labour performed, or for other reaſons, cannot prevail upon themſelves to refrain giving it to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and labourers, let theſe at leaſt ſo
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:042555_0045_101C761B31ECDE58"/>weaken and qualify it, as to prevent its immediate deſtructive effects.</p>
            <p>A very eminent phyſician has given the following direction for the beneſit of thoſe who have not wiſdom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, <hi>viz.</hi> By degrees to mix water with the ſpirit; to leſſen the quantity every day, and keep to the ſame quantity of water, till in about the courſe of a week, nothing of the dram kind be uſed along with the water. By this means the perſon will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no inconveniency, but reap great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit upon leaving off drams or ſpirits, as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the ſtomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be of ſervice. The appetite always increaſes in a few days after leaving off drams, unleſs by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the ſtomach is deſtroyed. And when the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is thus affected, a cup of carduus, camomile tea, wormwood or centaury every morning faſting and every evening, will be found a good remedy.</p>

Some GENERAL MAXIMS, moſtly drawn from the foregoing, which as they cannot be too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly held up in the view of the young and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, its hoped the obſervant reader will excuſe the repetition.</p>
            <p>THE great rule of diet is to ſtudy ſimplicity: Nature delights in the moſt plain and ſimple food; and every animal, except man, follows her dictates.</p>
            <p>Nothing conduces more to health and long life, than abſtinence and plain food, with due labour.</p>
            <p>Water alone is ſufficient and effectual for all the purpoſes of human want in drink: It is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diſſolvent nature has provided, and the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diluter of all bodies proper for food; quickens the appetite and ſtrengthens digeſtion moſt. Doctor Cheyne and doctor Cadogan.</p>
            <p>Strong and ſpirituous liquors were never deſigned for common uſe: They were formerly kept in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as other medicines are, in apothecaries ſhops: If freely indulged, they become a certain tho' ſlow poiſon. Cheyne.</p>
            <p>All intoxicating liquors may be conſidered as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; however diſguiſed, that is their real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſooner or later they will have their effect. Doctor Buchan.</p>
            <p>Every act of intoxication puts nature to the expence of a f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver, in order to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the poiſonous draught; when this is repeated almoſt every day, it is eaſy to foreſee the conſequence.</p>
            <p>Fevers occaſioned by drinking, do not always go off in a day, they frequently end in an inflammation of the breaſt, liver, or brain, and produce fatal effects.</p>
            <p>There is no danger in leaving off drinking ſtrong liquours at once, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for continuing them being falſe and groundleſs. Cheyne.</p>
            <p>Strong liquors do not prevent the miſchiefs of a
<pb n="48"
                   facs="unknown:042555_0047_101C761F9647BC40"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>ſurfeit, nor carry it off ſo ſafely as water, tho' they ſeem to give preſent relief. Cheyne.</p>
            <p>Many imagine that hard labour could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without drinking ſtrong liquors. This tho' a common, is a very erroneous opinion: Men who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſted ſtrong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily. Buchan.</p>
            <p>Every thing that has paſt the fire, ſo that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts, as in diſtillation, as far as it poſſibly can, retains a cauſtic corroſive and burning quality ever afterwards.</p>
            <p>In the continued diſtilation of ſpirits, the action of fire is ſo ſtrong as to reduce them to liquid fire at laſt; which will of themſelves evaporate in viſible flames and ſumes. Cheyne.</p>
            <p>The great quantity of viſcid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the blood ſizy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed obſtructions and inflammations of the lungs, &amp;c. Buchan.</p>
            <p>Malt liquors (excepting clear ſmall beer of due age) are extreamly hurtful to tender and ſtudious perſons. Cheyne.</p>
            <p>There are few great ale drinkers who are not phthiſical, nor is that to be wondered at, conſidering the glutinous and almoſt indigeſtible nature of ſtrong ale. Buchan.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who drink ardent ſpirits or ſtrong wines do not run leſs hazard; theſe liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender veſſels of the lungs in pieces. Buchan.</p>
            <p>Doctor Cadogan in his late treatiſe on the gout, ſays, He cannot allow him to be ſtrictly temperate; who drinks any wine or ſtrong liquors at all, unleſs it be medicinally.</p>
