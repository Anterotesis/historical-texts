            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOUGH GOD, (for wiſe reaſons, beſt known to himſelf) has permitted ſin to enter into the world; yet, we may be ſure, he will not ſuffer the purpoſes of his goodneſs to be fruſtrated by it; but will, in ſome way or other, over-rule this worſt of evils, for good; and make ſinners themſelves, (contrary to their deſign and intention) the inſtruments of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the great ends of his moral government, and the occaſional cauſes of benefit to others, at the ſame time, that they expoſe themſelves to miſery and ruin, which will inevitably come upon them, either in this world or in that to come, or in both, as a juſt puniſhment for their wickedneſs, unleſs prevented by repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017130_0004_0FA03189A5CF3300"/>IT cannot be doubted, but the infinitely wiſe GOD knows how to promote his own glory, by thoſe ungoverned luſts of envious, diſcontented and proud mortals, which are a prolific ſource of continual miſchief and miſery, both to particular perſons and ſocieties, and whereby thouſands and ten thouſands are involved in great troubles and grievous diſtreſſes, all the days of their lives. And as GOD knows how to promote his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by the luſts of men, ſo we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he will do it, (as he has done it already in innumerable obvious inſtances, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world) either by laying reſtraints upon thoſe luſts, or over-ruling their operations in ſuch a manner, as to make them contribute (in direct contrariety to their natural aim) to the execution of his own gracious purpoſes; or by taking occaſion from them, to exhibit ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diſplays of his power, wiſdom and goodneſs, as ſhall be admirably adapted to beget and cheriſh adoring thoughts of his being, perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and providence, and to produce all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal honorary acts of worſhip and homage, which he requires of us.</p>
            <p>WE live in an angry and provoking world. Ever ſince the fatal apoſtacy of our firſt parents, <hi>the wrath of man</hi> has been at work to ſpread mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and wretchedneſs over the face of the earth. <hi>Hateful and hating one another,</hi> is too much the character of by far the greater part of the human race. It ſeems indeed, that it muſt be evident to every one, that the happineſs of ſocial life depends
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017130_0005_0FA0318A6B06C540"/>
eſſentially upon the exerciſe of mutual benevolence and the conſtant reciprocal interchange of kind and friendly offices; but yet, as if men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ignorant of the vaſt advantages of love and harmony, peace and friendſhip, it may, with truth, be affirmed of the generality, that they
<q>
                  <l>"Live in hatred, enmity and ſtrife</l>
                  <l>"Among themſelves, and levy cruel wars,</l>
                  <l>"Waſting the earth, each other to deſtroy."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THROUGH the prevalence of pride, envy, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, avarice, and other corrupt luſts, the earth is full of the habitations of violence, cruelty and war. Theſe paſſions are the grand ſource of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jealouſies, animoſities, enmities, reproaches, inſults and injuries; they lead directly to a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every moral obligation, and of every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſocial virtue; their natural fruits are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, unrighteouſneſs &amp; oppreſſion, from whence come ſtrife and contention, diſcord, tumult and diſorder; and when they are inflamed with wrath and armed with power, they generally drive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to extremity, puſhing men into ſuch arbitrary and cruel actions and purſuits, as enkindle the flames of war, which it often requires a vaſt effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of human blood to extinguiſh.</p>
            <p>BUT when we ſee or feel the ſad effects of the diſorderly paſſions and baneful diſtempers of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, our comfort is, that <hi>the Lord God om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent reigneth,</hi> who can and will anſwer his own moſt wiſe purpoſes thereby, or ſet bounds thereto, as to his infinite wiſdom ſhall ſeem beſt.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017130_0006_0FA0318B2A5CFC68"/>
This comfortable doctrine is clearly contained in the text. We may reſt aſſured, that the ſupreme governor of the world, will not ſuffer <hi>the wrath of man,</hi> of a weak and impotent mortal, (how much ſoever advanced above his fellow mortals) to overthrow his government, or defeat the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his wiſdom; but will cauſe it to <hi>praiſe him</hi>; that is, (as was juſt now ſuggeſted) he will either ſo check and reſtrain it, or ſo manage and over-rule the operations of it, as to make it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the ends and deſigns of his providence, and the occaſional cauſe of ſuch events, as ſhall ſhew forth his perfections, and induce every atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pious obſerver, to praiſe and glorify him.</p>
            <p>I DOUBT not, my hearers, but you can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect inſtances that have fallen under your own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, wherein the luſts of particular perſons have been either remarkably reſtrained, or remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably over-ruled, as occaſions of good, where evil was deſigned and intended. Every inſtance of this kind, that comes within our view, ſhould lead us to admire and adore the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, who diſappointeth the evil deſigns of ſinners, and cauſeth even the operation of their luſts to be productive of events, in favour of thoſe, whom they meant to injure.</p>
            <p>SACRED hiſtory furniſhes us with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to this purpoſe. I will mention a few of them, which will ſerve, at once, to illuſtrate the meaning of the text, and to ſuggeſt ſome thoughts and reflections, ſuitable to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017130_0007_0FA0318BE6EE4F00"/>THE ſtory of Joſeph, in the book of Geneſis, affords one inſtance, to this purpoſe. Inſtigated by pride, envy, anger and unreaſonable reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his brethren ſold him into Egypt. They had nothing in view, in this baſe and unnatural action, but the gratification of their own unruly paſſions and corrupt luſts; but the wiſdom of GOD over-ruled it for good, contrary to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and deſign. They <hi>thought evil</hi> againſt their innocent brother, when they ſold him for a ſlave; but this heinouſly wicked action of theirs, was the occaſion of his promotion to high honor and authority in the Egyptian court, whereby he was enabled to <hi>ſave his father's houſe,</hi> and <hi>much people alive</hi> in a time of famine.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER pertinent inſtance, we may find in the hiſtory of Pharaoh, in the beginning of the book of Exodus. The wrath and madneſs of Pharaoh, and the cruelties which his haughty and ſavage temper prompted him to exerciſe upon the children of Iſrael, in order to check their growth, and ſecure them in a ſtate of dependance and baſe ſervitude, prepared the way, under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Providence, for their remarkable deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and afforded occaſions for a ſeries of ſuch wonderful diſplays of the power of GOD, as could not but excite all pious obſervers, to pay him their devout honors and adorations. And the deſtruction, which Pharaoh's pride and obſtinacy plunged him into, was no leſs remarkable, than was the deliverance of Iſrael. From whence it is natural to obſerve, that proud aſpiring mortals
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017130_0008_0FA0318CAC627128"/>
are often <hi>enſnared in the work of their own hands,</hi> and defeated by the very meaſures which they take to carry their iniquitous ſchemes into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>There are many devices in a man's heart,</hi> ſays the wiſe man, <hi>but the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE great men, the princes and potentates of the earth, who are entruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affairs of ſtates and kingdoms, are as much ſubject to the controul of an higher power, as any of the lower ranks and claſſes of people. They are all at the diſpoſal of the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world, whoſe providence, as it is concerned in all occurrences and events, and in all the viciſſitudes of human affairs, ſo does more eſpecially interpoſe in the riſe and fall of empires, and in all the great revolutions that take place among the nations of the earth. In ways and by means unthought of and unforeſeen, the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt policies and moſt promiſing ſchemes of reſtleſs ambition, are often diſconcerted, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures adopted by it, made to terminate in its own confuſion. When this is the caſe, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reaſon to adore the providence of that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Being, who preſides over the world, and is the diſpoſer of all events.</p>
            <p>THOSE men, who are actuated by a luſt of power and domination, ſeem, ſometimes, to be judicially left of GOD, to uſe ſuch methods, for the promotion of their ambitious ſchemes, as have a direct tendency to defeat their enterprizes, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017130_0009_0FA0318DAFE809C0"/>
to preſerve to others thoſe important rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, of which they endeavour to rob them, for the ſake of aggrandizing themſelves. The conduct of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> after the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Solomon</hi> (as it is recorded in the twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſt book of Kings) affords a very ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king example of this kind. As ſoon as <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> came to the throne of his father, the people applied to him, with their petitions, for a redreſs of grievances: But Rehoboam, deſpiſing the moderate counſels of the aged and wiſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the imprudent advice of young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful courtiers, as being more agreeable to his own aſpiring and ambitious views, <hi>anſwered</hi> the people <hi>roughly,</hi> and rejected their petitions with inſult. In conſequence of ſuch ill-treatment, ten tribes revolted, and ſet up another king over them: Of this revolt and revolution, Rehoboham himſelf was the immediate occaſional or procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cauſe. His pride and haughtineſs, alienated from him the hearts of the greateſt part of his ſubjects, and divided his father's dominion into two kingdoms. But it is very obſervable, that it is expreſſly ſaid, <hi>The cauſe was from the Lord</hi>; and this is aſſigned as the reaſon why Rehoboam, adhering to the imprudent counſels of raw and raſh politicians, rejected, with affrontive inſolence, the reaſonable petitions of the people. This revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being agreeable to the will of GOD, Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am was left to his own folly, which kept the things of his peace out of ſight, and influenced him to take a ſtep, which provoked the moſt of the tribes to throw off their allegiance, and reject him from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017130_0010_0FA0318F0B2D7B10"/>
being king over them. Thus GOD often <hi>taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs</hi>; cauſing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which they principally depend upon, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing their ambitious deſigns, to produce events directly contrary to their views and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>BY their wrath, by their vindictive reſentments, the haughty and ambitious, are ſometimes preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated into actions, for the gratification of their pride and revenge, which not only iſſue in their own ruin, but in the advancement of thoſe whom they meant to deſtroy. Haman (of whom we have a particular account in the book of Eſther) is an inſtance, in proof of this. In the fierceneſs of his wrath (the occaſion of which, it may be preſumed you are not ignorant of) Haman plotted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Mordecai, and all the Jews in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Ahaſuerus; and had the addreſs to obtain a decree from the king, for that purpoſe. But this infernal plot terminated in his own utter ruin, and led the way to Mordecai's promotion, affording, at the ſame time, an occaſion for a ſignal diſplay of the wiſdom and goodneſs of Providence, in the deliverance of the Jews from the deſtruction that was juſt ready to fall upon them. This inſtance, with that of Pharaoh before mentioned, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently juſtify the following obſervation, viz. that,</p>
            <p>GREAT and important revolutions, in favour of the cauſe of righteouſneſs and liberty, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought about, by means of the cruel and vindictive meaſures, which powerful oppreſſors
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017130_0011_0FA03190995B9B90"/>
take, to promote their ambitious views, and to keep others in awe and ſervile dependence. Wrath and cruelty are generally raſh and precipitate, and calculated to raiſe a ſpirit of indignation and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate oppoſition, in thoſe who feel the ſad effects of them. The haughty tyrant, who endeavours to advance his oppreſſive ſchemes, and to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up above all law and juſtice, by ſeverities and cruelties, dictated by wrath, does thereby fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently work out his own diſappointment, and is forced eventually to acknowledge his impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and to own a power above himſelf.</p>
            <p>BUT when the power of oppreſſors is ſo great, as to bear down all oppoſition, and compel peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a ſervile ſubmiſſion, it is to be conſidered as a juſt judgment of GOD, who ſometimes cauſes <hi>the wrath of man to praiſe him,</hi> by employing it to puniſh a people for their ſins. And herein we may obſerve the unſearchable wiſdom of GOD, who, while man (unneceſſitated by any foreign impulſe) is impiouſly and wickedly gratifying his luſts, makes thoſe very luſts ſubſervient to his providence, for the puniſhment of others. This is admirably ſet forth in the conduct of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian monarch (as the ſame is recorded in the tenth chapter of the prophecy of Iſaiah.) GOD was pleaſed to make uſe of this haughty tyrant, as a rod, for the correction and chaſtiſement of his people; wiſely managing the diſtempers of his proud and ambitious mind, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jews, for their ſinful defections from him. But as the Aſſyrian acted freely, being
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017130_0012_0FA03191489B52C8"/>
under no conſtraint, it was no excuſe for him, that GOD made his pride and ambition, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in bringing his righteous judgments on the Jewiſh nation; but his conduct was highly affrontive to Heaven, and expoſed him to the righteous reſentments of the Supreme Governor. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſays GOD, <hi>when I have performed my whole will on Zion and Jeruſalem, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſyria, and the glory of his high looks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the inſtances that have been mentioned above, we ſee, that ſo far as GOD permits the <hi>wrath of man</hi> to exert itſelf, he will over-rule the operations of it, for advancing the important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his government; and we are fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he will, in no caſes, ſuffer it to break out farther, than ſhall redound to his praiſe and honor. <hi>The remainder of wrath he will reſtrain</hi>; that is, he will ſet bounds to it, and render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to accompliſh what it aims at. Thus (as we are informed in the 37th chapter of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Iſaiah) he reſtrained Sennacherib's wrath, and forced him to quit his enterprize againſt Jeruſalem. Sennacherib carried his boaſts and menaces to ſuch an height, as implied a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the great Lord of heaven and earth; but the GOD whom he defied interpoſed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his attempting what he deſigned, by the miraculous deſtruction of one hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five thouſand of his army in one night; thus <hi>putting an hook in his noſe, and a bridle in his jaws,</hi> and obliging him to <hi>return</hi> home <hi>aſhamed.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017130_0013_0FA03194E4EA0320"/>
Such miraculous interpoſitions of providence for <hi>reſtraining the wrath of man,</hi> cannot indeed be rationally expected, in common caſes; but GOD can do this as effectually, without a miracle, as with, as will appear from what will preſently be offered.</p>
            <p>SHOULD GOD permit the wrath of man to do all that it deſigns, what havock and devaſtation, what miſchief and wretchedneſs, would it ſpread through the world? This world, at beſt, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turbulent ſcene; but it would be much more ſo, did not providence lay reſtraints upon the luſts and paſſions of ill-deſigning men, and prevent their going to ſuch lengths in miſchief, as they wiſh. It is happy for the world, that man's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not equal to his wrath; and that thoſe, who, inſtigated by an evil temper, form miſchievous projects, are often hindered from executing them; at leaſt, to that extent, which they deſire.</p>
            <p>THERE are many ways, wherein GOD checks and reſtrains <hi>the wrath of man,</hi> and defeats its pernicious devices, when, and ſo far as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES he does this by raiſing a ſpirit of fear, whereby men are diſcouraged from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking or proſecuting thoſe miſchievous enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, which their wrath and corrupt luſts would otherwiſe prompt them to undertake and purſue. As GOD has the <hi>hearts of all men in his hands, and turneth them whitherſoever he will, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water,</hi> ſo there is reaſon to believe that,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017130_0014_0FA0319642DB79D0"/>
by ſecret influences, he does ſometimes raiſe and ſometimes depreſs the natural ſpirits of men, for the promotion of his purpoſes of judgment or of mercy. Every one who is acquainted with, and firmly believes the divine philoſophy of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, muſt be clear in this, that GOD can, and frequently does, by immediate impreſſions on the mind, ſo effectually diſhearten and intimidate thoſe, whoſe vindictive paſſions would lead them into all manner of miſchief and cruelty, as either to confine the operations of their wrath to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to render it weak and impotent, faint and irreſolute, in its attempts againſt others. The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of the earth are, no doubt, often thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Faintneſs</hi> is <hi>ſent into their hearts,</hi> and fear takes hold on them, which ſerves as a barrier againſt that torrent of wrath, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpread deſtruction and deſolation all around them. Again,</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES GOD <hi>reſtrains men's wrath</hi> by interpoſing unthought-of accidents, obſtacles and difficulties, which entirely diſconcert their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and overthrow their miſchievous ſchemes and devices. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift,</hi> ſays the royal preacher, <hi>nor the battle to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of ſkill; but time and chance happeneth to them all:</hi> by which he doubtleſs means to teach us,
<q>that there is a ſecret providence concerned in all human affairs, which ſometimes preſents men with unexpected opportunities, or interpoſeth
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017130_0015_0FA03196676305E8"/>
accidents, which no human wiſdom could foreſee; which ſometimes produceth events contrary to human probabilities, giving ſucceſs to very unlikely means, and defeating the ſwift, the ſtrong, the learned, the induſtrious, and thoſe that are beſt verſed in men and buſineſs, of their ſeveral ends, and deſigns.</q>
All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is at the beck of the great Creator, who, when he pleaſes, can employ any part thereof, to <hi>diſappoint the devices of the crafty, and carry the counſels of the froward headlong.</hi> What we call ſecond cauſes, are entirely dependent upon the great firſt cauſe, to whom they owe all their force and energy; and who can, and, no doubt, often does (either immediately by himſelf, or mediately by ſubordinate agents) occaſionally ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend, retard or quicken their influence, to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the moſt promiſing ſchemes of men, and thereby to humble their pride, to teach them their dependence, and to promote his own moſt wiſe purpoſes. Secret and hidden cauſes he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſets to work, whereby unforeſeen and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected events are produced, which overthrow the ſchemes of human pride, ambition and revenge. By ſtorms and peſtilences, by diſaſters and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, which no human ſkill could foreſee, or power obviate, he frequently cohibits the wrath of the mightieſt potentates, and cruſhes the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous machinations of his people's enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to abortion.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, GOD ſometimes checks and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the wrath of men,</hi> by leaving them to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017130_0016_0FA031972A086BF8"/>
infatuation, whereby they are led to adopt counſels and meaſures, tending, in the natural courſe of things, to defeat their deſigns, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their enterprizes. When men are puſhing forward their iniquitous ſchemes with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt zeal and vehemence, and have the moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering proſpects of ſucceſs, they are ſometimes, by an unaccountable imprudence, led to reject the counſels moſt favourable to their deſigns, and to embrace thoſe that lead directly to diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſtory of Abſolom, in the ſecond book of Samuel (not to mention again the caſe of Rehoboam) furniſhes an inſtance of this kind. Abſolom raiſed a rebellion againſt his father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; but in proſecuting his ambitious views, he was remarkably influenced to adopt meaſures, calculated to defeat and diſappoint him. The ſage advice of Ahithophel, a judicious and ſkilful counſellor, though moſt favourable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, was <hi>turned into fooliſhneſs</hi> in his ſight, and he was left to comply with counſels of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature, which iſſued in the ruin both of his wicked projects, and himſelf. This was <hi>the Lord's doing.</hi> And thus GOD ſometimes judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>hides wiſdom from the wiſe,</hi> and leaves them to purſue ſuch imprudent methods, as directly tend to diſappoint their hopes, and fruſtrate their moſt promiſing ſchemes.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, another way wherein GOD <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the wrath of man,</hi> is, by rouſing thoſe who ſuffer, or are likely to ſuffer by it, to ſtand in their own defence; and inſpiring them with
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017130_0017_0FA03197E745D158"/>
courage and reſolution, to oppoſe and reſiſt, to the utmoſt, all the miſchievous efforts of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, wrath and anger of thoſe proud aſpiring mortals, who would, if poſſible, rob them of their natural rights, and plunge them into a ſtate of ſervility. And this is the moſt uſual method of Providence, for reſtraining and curbing the diſorderly paſſions and corrupt luſts of ambitious and revengeful men. Sometimes indeed GOD is pleaſed to interpoſe in an extraordinary way, for the deliverance of his people from the rage and wrath of their enemies; to take their controverſy, as it were, into his own hands; and to work ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for them, by means, in which their own agency is not at all concerned: but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, it is by the right uſe, of thoſe means of preſervation and ſafety, which he has put into their power, that he defends &amp; ſaves them. There is nothing more irrational than to neglect ſuch means, and depend upon miraculous protections. When GOD purpoſes to reſtrain the wrath of his people's enemies, he uſually rouſes a ſpirit of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſtirs them up to make a reſolute reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and animates and excites them to the moſt vigorous efforts for the maintenance of their rights. And whenever a people are enabled to baffle and diſappoint their enemies, and defeat their attempts to gratify their ambition or revenge, they ought to aſcribe the glory to GOD, whoſe interpoſing providence has proſpered their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and crowned their enterprizes with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:017130_0018_0FA031990BB53910"/>AND now, my hearers, as the ſubject does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuggeſt ſuch reflections as are ſuitable to this <hi>Anniverſary,</hi> you may very reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an application of what has been ſaid, adapted to the preſent occaſion. This therefore will now be attempted.</p>
            <p>IN the riſe and progreſs of the preſent war, we have ſeen both parts of our text verified, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable inſtances. <hi>The wrath of man</hi> has been made to <hi>praiſe GOD,</hi> by producing events con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe, which it aimed at. <hi>The wrath of</hi> man has alſo been reſtrained, defeated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and after all its vaunting boaſts, been obliged to own its impotence and weakneſs. And, in ſhort, though GOD has permitted <hi>the wrath of man</hi> to plunge us into great troubles and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as a juſt puniſhment for our manifold impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and vices, yet he has hitherto ſo managed and over-ruled it, ſo curbed and checked it, as to afford the cleareſt evidence of his powerful providence, which preſides over the world, and governs all things.</p>
            <p>THE pride, avarice and ambition of Great-Britain, gave riſe to the preſent hoſtile conteſts. From this ſource originated thoſe oppreſſive acts, which firſt alarmed the freemen of America; and provoked them, after petitioning in vain for redreſs, to form plans of oppoſition and reſiſtance. This conduct of America exaſperated the Britiſh adminiſtration, and rouſed all their wrath Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with angry reſentments, they proceeded
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017130_0019_0FA031996646D400"/>
from oppreſſion to open war, in order to frighten and compel us into a ſubmiſſion to thoſe arbitrary and deſpotic ſchemes, which they were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at all hazards, to carry into execution. But thoſe vindictive and ſanguinary counſels and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which, in the vehemence of their paſſions, they adopted, for this purpoſe, have, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of GOD, contrary to their expectations, involved them in the moſt perplexing difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by uniting thirteen provinces of America, in that declaration of independence, which they now wiſh us to reſcind.</p>
            <p>I BELIEVE it will be obvious to every one, who will take a ſurvey of the violent and hoſtile proceedings of Great-Britain, and of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhe took to intimidate theſe ſtates, and awe them into unconditional ſubmiſſion, prior to their declaration of independence, that every part of her conduct, was calculated to produce this great event; having a direct tendency to plunge the people of America, into a ſtate of deſperation, by cutting them off from every chance of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their liberties, in any other way, than by erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into an independent nation, and oppoſing force with force. Now, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that, before our breaking our connection with Great-Britain, the methods and meaſures uſed and purſued by her, in order to accompliſh her unrighteous deſigns againſt us, and promote her ambitious views, did all uniformly tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to the neceſſity of taking that ſtep, does it not ſeem, as if ſhe had been left to judicial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017130_0020_0FA0319A791DF6A8"/>
and that her conduct can beſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, by ſaying, as in the caſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the ten tribes from Rehoboam, <hi>The cauſe was from the Lord?</hi> This (as has been obſerved) is expreſly aſſigned, as the reaſon why Rehoboam <hi>hearkened not to the people,</hi> but <hi>anſwered them roughly.</hi> And may we not, with equal proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aſſign this as the reaſon, why the Britiſh king, inſtead of hearkening to the cries and prayers of his loyal ſubjects in America, ſhould either treat their complaints and petitions with neglect, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them only with inſult and additional inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſend forth his fleets and armies, to awe them into ſilence, and force them into ſervile ſubmiſſion? May we not reaſon thus; <hi>The cauſe was from the Lord,</hi> therefore the king of Great-Britain, judicially blinded to his own intereſt, hearkened not to the prayers and petitions of the oppreſſed and aggrieved people of America; but took ſuch violent methods, in order to compel them into ſlaviſh paſſive obedience, as reduced them to the diſagreeable neceſſity of a revolt and final ſeparation? Had our petitions and prayers been properly regarded, and moderate pacific meaſures purſued, we ſhould have entertained no thoughts of a revolt; for even after hoſtilities had commenced, we were ardently deſirous of continuing united with our mother country, if ſuch an union could have been preſerved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a ſacrifice of our liberties. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, we may ſafely appeal to that Being, who ſearches all hearts, to juſtify us, when we declare, that it was far from our intention or inclination to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017130_0021_0FA0319AE68BEB80"/>
ſeparate ourſelves from Great-Britain; and that we had it not even in contemplation to ſet up for independency; but on the contrary, earneſtly wiſhed to remain connected with her, until ſhe had deprived us of all hopes of preſerving ſuch a connection, upon any better terms than uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſubmiſſion. It was her refuſing to grant us better terms, that united theſe ſtates, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the confederation, which has connected them together like a band of brethren, and, of many members, made them one compacted and well-cemented body. And that ſhe ſhould inſiſt upon this, and, depending upon her power to cruſh us, ſhould reject and trample under foot all our petitions, and come againſt us with hoſtile force, in order to eſtabliſh an abſolute deſpotic domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us, argues that ſhe was left to her own folly (as Rehoboam was) to purſue meaſures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her peace, and which, in the natural courſe of things, tended to produce that revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has diſmembered the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and raiſed ſo great a part of it to a ſtate of independence.</p>
            <p>AND as the wrath of Great-Britain, under the over-ruling providence of GOD, firſt occaſioned this great revolution, ſo her wrath has hitherto been defeated in all its powerful efforts to reduce us back to a ſtate of dependence; which can be aſcribed to nothing but the interpoſition of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Providence, laying reſtraints upon her, and weakening her hands, ſo that ſhe could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her enterprizes. For if we look back, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017130_0022_0FA0319C31BABE50"/>
conſider the ſtrength of our enemies, and our own weak condition, when the awful ſcenes of war firſt opened upon us, we cannot but acknowledge it to be owing to the ſpecial interpoſing power of the Supreme Diſpoſer of all things, that we were not ſoon overcome, but have been enabled to maintain our cauſe hitherto, in many ſevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, through ſeveral bloody campaigns.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider how unprepared and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided we were for the conteſt, when hoſtilities firſt commenced; that we were without money, without ammunition, without magazines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cloathing for ſoldiers; that we had neither military diſcipline nor any regular ſettled civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that we were deſtitute of that aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from foreign powers, which we have had ſince; and, in ſhort, that under the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, being deficient in all military prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we were forced into a war, with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, well prepared and well provided with all eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials for the conflict, having a numerous and well-diſciplined army, commanded by ſkillful and experienced officers, who had been bred to arms; and a navy ſuperior to any in Europe, which gave them the empire of the ſeas, and rendered their reſources almoſt inexhauſtible; when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things, what reaſon have we to adopt the language of the Pſalmiſt, and ſay, <hi>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would have ſwallowed us up quick?</hi> Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when we conſider further, the peculiar ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and difficulties we were ſubjected to, from
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017130_0023_0FA0319C63E7E8E8"/>
internal enemies, who under the pretext of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, or the diſguiſe of friendſhip, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly plotting miſchief againſt us, and doing all that they could, with ſafety, to weaken our hands; to diſcourage and diſhearten us; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our operations; to perplex and entangle our affairs; and to aid and aſſiſt the Britiſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The principal advantages gained, at one time or another, by our profeſſed enemies, who have openly waged war againſt us, have been greatly owing to aſſiſtances afforded them, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enemies among ourſelves, who, had not the mercy of GOD prevented, would, before now, have ruined their country. We have therefore abundant reaſon to be thankful to the ſovereign Ruler of the world, not only that he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to protected us againſt the open violence of our avowed foes; but alſo that he hath guarded us againſt the treacheries and treaſonable conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of falſe and diſaffected perſons, whom we have harboured in our own boſoms; and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe hidden and miſchievous artifices, which they have uſed to work our deſtruction.</p>
            <p>THE ſcene of war, in which we have been involved, has been chequered with an alternate ſucceſſion of favourable and unfavourable events. Sometimes we have met with diſappointments and defeats, when we had raiſed expectations of ſucceſs. At other times we have been proſpered, even beyond our moſt ſanguine expectations. In ſeveral inſtances our enterprizes have been crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wonderful ſucceſs, exceeding our moſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017130_0024_0FA031A190D7DFD8"/>
flattering hopes. And, on the whole, we have great reaſon to adore the providence of GOD, who has hitherto remarkably reſtrained the wrath of our enemies; mercifully defended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected us; and ſupported our righteous cauſe, by many ſignal interpoſitions.</p>
            <p>To every attentive obſerver, it muſt be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the wrath of Great-Britain, ſo far as it has been permitted to exert itſelf, has contributed to bring about and eſtabliſh our independency. It has evidently been the occaſion of events, which have raiſed us to an honorable conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the European powers, and induced ſome of them openly to eſpouſe our cauſe, and aid us by a friendly alliance. It is alſo worthy of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that the wrath, which has been enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in American breaſts, has been over-ruled for the promotion of the ſame great ends. Great-Britain firſt prepared fewel, and then put fire to the combuſtibles, which ſhe had prepared, for ſetting the paſſions of America into a flame. And the wrath, which ſhe has thus rouſed in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, has been wiſely managed by Providence, for checking and reſtraining her rage and vengeance. Her conduct has not only been the occaſion of ſtirring up a noble ſpirit of liberty throughout America, and kindling into a blaze every ſpark of virtuous patriotiſm, and true courage; but of firing the mind with honeſt indignation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; yea, of tranſporting the paſſions, in ſome inſtances, among individuals, into criminal exceſſes. But even theſe exceſſes of the paſſions,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017130_0025_0FA031A2DEE4D810"/>
have, by Providence, been made to conſpire with better principles, and more laudable ſprings of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſtrengthen the oppoſition to Britiſh ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and check the career of Britiſh rage and cruelty.</p>
            <p>FAR be it from me to juſtify any exceſſes of wrath and anger. I am no advocate for outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, even on the moſt provoking occaſions. But I cannot but obſerve, that, as on the one hand, it will not be denied, that the human paſſions have, in ſome inſtances, among particular perſons broken forth into a criminal exceſs of riot; ſo, on the other, it cannot but be acknowledged, that there have been many inſtances of a very cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable indifference and tameneſs of temper, which, without any emotion, could behold the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin of the country, or have quietly ſubmitted to conceſſions fatal to liberty.</p>
            <p>WE are not to ſuppoſe, that either reaſon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion requires the total ſuppreſſion of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is both rational, and a duty, to ſtir them up into exerciſe, when ſuitable objects are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view. None of our original paſſions, are in themſelves vicious. They become vicious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their exorbitancy. It is the exceſs of them that is criminal. While they are tempered with prudence and diſcretion, and kept within due bounds, they may be indulged to advantage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many occaſions.</p>
            <p>THOUGH rage, and inflamed wrath, are no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential properties of patriotiſm; yet patriotiſm,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017130_0026_0FA031A447CD8730"/>
without feeling or ſenſibility, is a meer name. The paſſionate appearance of the ſame love of one's country, and of the ſame determined zeal for promoting the honor and intereſt of it, will indeed be different, in different conſtitutions. A patriot of a calm and diſpaſſionate temper, tho' he cannot but feel juſt reſentment at the wrongs, and injuries done to his country, and ſhew a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſolution to do all, that in him lies, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his country's cauſe, againſt all its enemies, wil yet not ſhew the ſame vehement warmth, that will diſcover itſelf in a patriot, of a more ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and fiery temper, nor be ſo liable to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, by a fierce zeal, into imprudent and raſh meaſures.</p>
            <p>AND here let me obſerve, that to me it ſeems an argument of the wiſdom of GOD, that (as there are few comparatively poſſeſſed of virtuous principles; and as even the beſt principles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtimulus from the paſſions, would remain dormant and inactive; and as the generality are influenced by their paſſions only, which need ſomething to reſtrain and direct them, or to rouſe them up, when the public good calls for great and general exertions) Providence has ſo ordered it, that there ſhould be a diverſity of tempers and conſtitutions among men, to be both a ſpur and a check to one another; that the more warm and vehement might give an active ſpring to the more cool and ſluggiſh, and, on the contrary, the more calm and moderate be a curb to the more ſanguine and haſty; and that the two extremes,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017130_0027_0FA031A4CD89BA90"/>
meeting with thoſe, who are more equally tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with due proportions of zeal and prudence, all might happily unite; and, by the mutual col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion of their different tempers and paſſions, be enabled to collect their ſeveral powers, into one combined and vigorous effort, for carrying into execution, every neceſſary enterprize, againſt a common enemy, and for the promotion of the welfare and proſperity of ſociety.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever we may think of the ends of Providence, in ordering ſuch a diverſity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers among men, this is certain, that GOD will ſo manage the moſt diſorderly, turbulent and boiſterous paſſions, as to make them promotive of the deſigns of his government, or lay ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon them, that inſtead of fruſtrating, they ſhall really ſubſerve the purpoſes of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Of this we have had the cleareſt evidence, in a variety of inſtances in the courſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war; which affords ſubſtantial ground for a rational hope and truſt in GOD, for the future.</p>
            <p>HAD the power of Great-Britain been equal to her wrath, what a miſerable and wretched ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould we have been in, before now! From the rage and vindictiveneſs, which ſhe has diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; from the threats which ſhe has thrown out; and from the barbarous cruelties which have marked her ſteps in the proſecution of the preſent war (eſpecially when ſhe gained any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over us) we may eaſily infer what would be our unhappy fate, ſhould her wrath prevail, at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017130_0028_0FA031A565B3B7D8"/>
laſt, and force us to ſurrender at diſcretion. In this caſe, all would be ſeizure and proceſs, confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and impriſonment, blood and horror, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and arbitrary puniſhment. For ſo it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has been, and always will be, when what is called a rebellion is ſuppreſſed, and the ſuppoſed rebels obliged to throw themſelves uncondition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the mercy of their incenſed prince.</p>
            <p>GREAT-BRITAIN indeed, ſince our alliance with France, has made a ſhew of offering a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of grievances, and of granting us even more than we aſked for, before our declaration of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence; on condition of our re-uniting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with her, in violation of our national faith and honor, which we have ſolemnly plighted to our generous ally; but ſhould we comply with this condition, what ſecurity could we have of her laſting friendſhip? Philip, of Spain, when he found that his arbitrary proceedings had thrown his ſubjects, in the low countries, into a ferment and flame, and raiſed ſuch an oppoſition to his government, as he was unable immediately to ſuppreſs, was once prevailed upon by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the governeſs, the Ducheſs of Parma, to hearken to their complaints and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and grant a redreſs of grievances; in conſequence of which, things in general, ſoon returned to a toilerably quiet and peaceable ſtate. But notwithſtanding this ſeeming compliance with the deſires of his ſubjects, Philip only meant to gain time, being determined, as ſoon as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhould be more favourable, to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017130_0029_0FA031A628855A20"/>
his ambitious and tyrannical ſchemes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, in a little while, he commiſſioned the Duke of Alva, at the head of a large army of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran troops, to carry the ſame into the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous execution: This conduct of his, rekindled the flame, and revived thoſe commotions, which eventually coſt Spain a great part of her low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try provinces. Should we, in contradiction to our ſolemn engagements to others, return to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with Great-Britain, upon the plan propoſed by her commiſſioners (who, by the way, are not empowered to ratify any thing) we might ſoon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of the low countries, be again o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſeperate from her, and to fly to arms for our defence. And in this caſe ſhe would have a fairer chance of ſubjugating us, and we ſhould be in the utmoſt danger of falling a prey to her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wrath, becauſe, having violated our faith with foreign powers, they would hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to truſt us again, or to afford us thoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and ſuccours, that we might ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>IT is doubtleſs the ardent deſire of every one, now preſent, to ſee a ſpeedy and happy end to the war. But can any ſuppoſe, that a ſeperate compoſition with Great-Britain, upon her terms, would reſtore public peace and tranquility, and cloſe the ſcenes of war? Have we not rather rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that it would oblige us immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to engage in her quarrel with thoſe, who have befriended us in our diſtreſs, and aſſiſt her in avenging herſelf upon them, for the aid which
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017130_0030_0FA031A6F167ACB0"/>
they afforded us? A ſeparate peace with Great-Britain, upon any other plan, than that of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mutual independence, would plunge <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> directly into a war with France and Spain, who would have reaſon to reſent ſuch a flagrant viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our national faith and honor. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it would alſo arm many other European powers againſt us. We can therefore have no hopeful proſpect, of enjoying the bleſſings of peace, or of enjoying them long, but upon the plan of independency.</p>
            <p>THE appeal has been made to Heaven, and Heaven has hitherto ſupported us, and reſtrained the wrath of our enemies. Truſting in GOD therefore, we ſhould take courage ſtill to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberties, wherewith he has made us free,</hi> without fondly deſiring any diſhonorable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous compoſitions.</p>
            <p>BUT though from the great things which GOD has done for us, we are encouraged to hope, that his providence will, in due time, work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſalvation for us, if we continue to exert ourſelves, as becometh free men; yet no one can certainly tell what will be the iſſue of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conteſt, or how it will terminate. The vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of futurity are looked againſt human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; nor is it poſſible to aſcertain the event of any human enterprize or undertaking. Our concern ſhould be, to make the great Governor of futurity our friend, as we deſire the kind aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his propitious providence, to bring our enemies to make peace with us, upon terms of honor, juſtice and equality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:017130_0031_0FA031A7AC9F1C68"/>AND here, let me obſerve, that nothing dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens our proſpects more, or gives us more reaſon to be fearful, as to the event of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, than the great and general prevalence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs among us. He muſt have been very unobſerving, who does not know, that by means of unrighteouſneſs, the body-politic has been, and ſtill is, labouring under a dangerous diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>whole head being ſick and the whole heart faint,</hi> and there being but little <hi>ſoundneſs, from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE goodneſs of our cauſe does not make ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs certain. A good cauſe often ſuffers, and is ſometimes loſt, by means of the ſin and folly of thoſe, who are engaged in it. This is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which ought to lie with weight on our minds, at the preſent day, and engage us to <hi>put away the evil of our doings,</hi> and <hi>keep ourſelves from every wicked thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN Solomon ſays, <hi>righteouſneſs exalteth a nation,</hi> he aſſerts no more, than what the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all ages has found to be true. For righteouſneſs not only procures the ſmiles of a propitious Providence upon a people; but alſo tends, in the natural courſe of things, to promote their proſperity; being adapted to prevent diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſcords among them, to cement them together in the firmeſt union, and, by preſerving public and private credit, to enable them to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their force and ſtrength, when the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, for repelling an invading enemy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves againſt all the hoſtile attempts
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017130_0032_0FA031A86B742540"/>
of aſpiring ambition. The effects of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are very different; for unrighteouſneſs not only provokes GOD to withold his bleſſings from a people; but it alſo tends, in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to entangle and perplex their affairs, and to render them weak, and unable to oppoſe any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent aſſaults of arbitrary power, by creating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them internal ſtrife and contention; by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding them into angry parties; by deſtroying mutual truſt and confidence; and ſo rendering it extremely difficult, and next to impoſſible, to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them in meaſures, neceſſary for their ſafety and defence againſt a common enemy, or the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic views of deſigning ambition.</p>
            <p>WE have therefore reaſon to fear, if unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould continue to abound, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge of the world, will ceaſe to reſtrain the wrath of our enemies, and, leaving us in the hands of our own folly, permit them to execute the dreadful purpoſes of their furious reſentments, as a juſt puniſhment for our obſtinate perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in our evil ways. But if we will put away our unrighteouſneſs, <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well,</hi> we ſhall have grounds to hope, that the <hi>righteous Lord, who loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> will ſtill be our friend and patron, and enable us to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our cauſe, againſt the utmoſt force of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged enemies, until they are brought to reaſon or ruin. For,
<q>
                  <l>"To the righteous, GOD is near,</l>
                  <l>"And never will their cauſe forſake."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:017130_0033_0FA031A936D89A88"/>THOUGH GOD is pleaſed to employ the wrath of our enemies, as a rod of correction, to puniſh us, for our ſins; and may permit them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to great lengths, in the proſecution of their arbitrary and unrighteous ſchemes, in order to teach us righteouſneſs, and make us pious and virtuous; yet their conduct is nevertheleſs odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable in his ſight, and will not (as we have reaſon to believe) paſs unpuniſhed. We may therefore aſſure ourſelves, that when we leave our ſins, and become an obedient people, GOD will bring to nought all their miſchievous deſigns, either by diſpoſing them to peace, or by leaving them to follow the lead of their own haughty temper, until they plunge themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction. For GOD often turns the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the oppreſſor upon his own head, and cauſes him, in the end, to fall into the pit which he digged for others. And a people, who have ſmarted under the cruel rod of oppreſſion, may rationally expect this, when they are ſuitably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſalvation by repentance and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the moſt powerful and ſucceſsful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, are only rods of GOD's ſchool (like the proud Aſſyrian beforementioned) and when he has anſwered the deſigns of his providence by them, he uſually lets looſe his wrath upon them, and puniſhes them for their arrogance, pride and miſchievous ambition. The deſtruction which ſometimes falls upon ſuch men, is finely deſcribed in the fifteenth chapter of the book of Job, from the 31ſt verſe to the end, which I will give you in the words of an elegant modern verſion:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I conclude, let me apply myſelf, in a few words to the militia of this town, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear under arms, on this memorable occaſion.</p>
            <p>SIRS,</p>
            <p>THE manner of your obſerving this day, in commemoration of the commencement of the preſent war, the ſcene whereof, was firſt opened in this place, does you honor, as it gives an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, at once, of your piety, and of your patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm and firm attachment to the cauſe of your country. With honeſt indignation we recollect the day, when the ſtorm of Britiſh vengeance,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017130_0035_0FA031AD1C483818"/>
which had been long gathering, firſt burſt upon your heads, in the wanton maſſacre of ſeveral of your brave fellow citizens and ſoldiers. The memory of thoſe, who have magnanimouſly jeoparded their lives, and ſhed their blood in their country's cauſe, will ever be dear to us. We particularly retain an honorable remembrance of thoſe, who firſt fell a ſacrifice to Britiſh wrath; and feel emotions of ſympathy towards their ſurviving relatives, who cannot but be ſenſibly affected on this occaſion. We would alſo join with you, in grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to GOD, who mercifully checked the wrath of our enemies in its firſt eruptions, and cauſed it to recoil back on their own heads. We doubt not, but from the warmth of honeſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; from a love of liberty and of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, you will perſevere to oppoſe and reſiſt thoſe inſolent and haughty enemies, of whoſe wanton cruelty, you have had too melancholy a ſpecimen, to permit you to expect much mercy at their hands, ſhould they gain their point.</p>
            <p>LET me now obſerve, that your appearing equipt in military armour, as ſoldiers prepared for war, naturally leads to reflections on the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence of thoſe corrupt luſts of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>from whence come wars.</hi> They who would be glad to <hi>live peaceably with all men,</hi> are often unhappily forced into contention, and obliged to take arms, and engage in hazardous conteſts, in order to defend their lives and liberties, againſt the evil deſigns of unreaſonable men, who when they ſuppoſe they have power and ſtrength to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017130_0036_0FA031AE8BE50F28"/>
their purpoſes, ſcruple not to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded ſcope to their pride, covetouſneſs and ambition; which paſſions are mortal enemies to the rights of mankind, and the ſource of that ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and cruel bondage, under which ſo many of the nations of the earth groan at this day.</p>
            <p>A CONSIDERATION of the pernicious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and effects of theſe corrupt luſts and paſſions ſhould engage you and ſhould engage us all, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them in ourſelves. For where they prevail, they not only lead to a conduct prejudicial to the peace and welfare of human ſociety, but make men ſlaves in the worſt ſenſe, how much ſoever they may hate the name.</p>
            <p>WHILE therefore, you are engaged with a laudable zeal in the cauſe of civil liberty, you will permit me to remind you, that there is another kind of liberty of an higher and nobler nature, which it is of infinite importance to every one to be poſſeſſed of; I mean that glorious internal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which conſiſts in a freedom from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, and in the habit and practice of all the virtues of a good life. This is that noble and exalted liberty of the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> of which our ſaviour ſpeaks, when he ſays, <hi>If the ſon of God ſhall make you free, then ſhall ye be free indeed.</hi> And this, once gained, will inſpire you with the greateſt magnanimity and fortitude, in the cauſe of outward liberty. For <hi>the righteous are bold as a lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:017130_0037_0FA031B253CCE4B8"/>To conclude. Let us all, with that ardor and earneſtneſs, which the importance of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, labour after this <hi>glorious liberty of the ſons of God</hi>; that when we ſhall quit this tumultuous warring world, (having acted our parts well in it) we may be admitted to thoſe peaceful manſions, where, free from ſtrife and contention, and all the pernicious effects of ungoverned wrath and ambition, we ſhall enjoy a bleſſed immortality, in the tranquil uninterrupted poſſeſſion of every felicity that our natures are capable of.</p>
