            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OBSERVE in theſe Words. 1. Something that ſome depended on, as an Evidence of their good Eſtate, and Acceptance, as the Objects of GOD's Favour, viz. a ſpeculative Faith, or Belief of the Doctrines of Religion. The great Doctrine of the Exiſtence of one only GOD is particularly mentioned; probably, becauſe this was a Doctrine wherein, eſpecially, there was a viſible and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſtinction, between profeſſing Chriſtians and the Heathens, amongſt whom the Chriſtians in thoſe Days were diſperſed: And therefore, this was what many truſted in, as what recommended them <hi>to</hi>; or at leaſt, was an Evidence <hi>of,</hi> their Intereſt in the great ſpiritual and eternal Privileges, in which Chriſtians were diſtinguſhed from the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How much is allowed concerning this Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a good Attainment: <hi>Thou dost well.</hi> It was good, as it was neceſſary. This Doctrine was one of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines of Chriſtianity; and, in ſome reſpects, above all others fundamental. It was neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, in order to Salvation: And a Being without the Belief of this Doctrine, eſpecially in thoſe that had ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to know as they had, whom the Apoſtle wrote to, would be a great Sin, and what would vaſtly aggravate
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023344_0004_0FBF074DA5723268"/>
their Damnation. This Belief was alſo good, as it had a good Tendency in many Reſpects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is implicitly denied concerning it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is any Evidence of a Perſon's being in a State of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The whole Context, ſhews this to be the Deſign of the Apoſtle in the Words: And, it is particularly manifeſt, by the Concluſion of the Verſe; which is the</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thing obſervable in the Words, viz. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which the Apoſtle proves, that this is no Sign of a State of Grace, viz. that it is found in the Devils. They believe that there is one GOD, and that He is a holy ſin hating GOD; and that He is a GOD of Truth, and will fulfill his Threatnings, by which He he has denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed future Judgments, and a great increaſe of Miſery on them; and that He is an Almighty GOD, and able to execute his threatened Vengeance upon them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the DOCTRINE I infer from the Words, to make the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nothing in the Mind of Man, that is of the ſame Nature with what the Devils experience, or are the ſubjects of, is any ſure Sign of ſaving Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any Thing that the Devils have, or find in themſelves, which is an Evidence of the ſaving Grace of the Spirit of GOD, then the Apoſtle's Argument is not good; which is plainly this: <hi>That which is in the Devils, or which they do, is no certain Evidence of Grace. But the Devils believe that there is one</hi> GOD. <hi>Therefore, thy believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is one</hi> GOD, <hi>is no ſure Evidence that thou art gracious.</hi> So that the whole Foundation of the Apoſtle's Argument lies in that Propoſition. <hi>That which is in the Devils is no certain ſign of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I ſhall mention two or three further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Arguments of the Truth of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Devils have no Degree of <hi>Holineſs</hi>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe Things, which are Nothing beyond what they are the ſubjects of, cannot be <hi>holy Experiences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil once was holy; but when he fell, he loſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023344_0005_0FBF07504C3503E8"/>
all his Holineſs, and became perfectly wicked. He is the greateſt Sinner, and in ſome Senſe, the Father of all Sin. John viii. 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Luſts of your Father ye will do. He was a Murderer from the Beginning and abode not in the Truth; becauſe there was no Truth in him: When he ſpeaketh a Lie, he ſpeaketh of his own; for he is a Liar and the Father of it.</hi> 1 John iii. 8. <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the Beginning.</hi> He is often ſpoken of, as by Way of Eminence, THE WICKED ONE. So, Matt. xiii. 19. <hi>Then cometh</hi> the wicked One, <hi>and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart.</hi> v. 38. <hi>The Tares are the Children of</hi> the wicked One. 1 John, ii. 13. <hi>I write unto you young Men, becauſe ye have overcome</hi> the wicked One. Chap. iii. 12. <hi>Not as</hi> Cain, <hi>who was of that</hi> wicked One. Chap. v. 18. <hi>Whoſoever is born of</hi> GOD—keepeth himſelf, <hi>and that</hi> wicked One <hi>toucheth him not.</hi> So the Devils are called <hi>evil Spirits, unclean Spirits, Powers of Darkneſs, Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> itſelf: Eph vi 12. <hi>For we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood; but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, againſt</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Darkneſs of this World, <hi>againſt ſpiritual</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs <hi>in high Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, ſurely thoſe Things which the Minds of Devils are the Subjects of, can have nothing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true Holineſs in them. The Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which they have of the Things of GOD and Religion, cannot be of the Nature of divine and holy Light, nor any Knowledge that is merely of the ſame Kind. No ſuch Impreſſions as are made on their Hearts, can be of a ſpiritual Nature. That Kind of Senſe, which they have of divine Things, however great, cannot be an holy Senſe. Such Affections as move their Hearts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever powerful, cannot be holy Affections. If there be no Holineſs in them, as they are in the Devil, there can be no Holineſs in them as they are in Man; unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be added to them, beyond what is in them, or they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023344_0006_0FBF07531B817D18"/>
are in the Devil. And if any Thing be added to them, then they are not the ſame Things; but are ſomething beyond what Devils are the Subjects of; which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Suppoſition; for the Propoſition which I am upon, is, that thoſe Things which are of the <hi>ſame Nature,</hi> and <hi>nothing beyond</hi> what Devils are the Subjects of, cannot be holy Experiences. 'Tis not the Subject that makes the Affection, or Experience, or Quality holy; but 'tis the Quality that makes the Subject holy.</p>
            <p>And if thoſe Qualities and Experiences, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are the Subjects of, have nothing of the Nature of Holineſs in them; then they can be no certain Signs, that Perſons which have them, are holy or gracious. There is no certain Sign of true Grace, but thoſe Things which are ſpiritual and gracious. 'Tis GOD's Image that is his Seal and Mark, the Stamp, by which thoſe that are his, are known. But that, which has Nothing of the Nature of Holineſs, has Nothing of this Image. That, which is a ſure Sign of Grace, muſt either be ſomething, which has the Nature and Eſſence of Grace; or is flowing from, or ſome way belonging to its Eſſence: For that, which diſtinguiſhes Things one from another, in their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or ſomething appertaining to their Eſſence. And therefore, that which is ſometimes found wholly without the Eſſence of Holineſs or Grace, can be no eſſential, ſure, or diſtinguſhing Mark of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Devils are not only abſolutely without all true Holineſs, but they are not ſo much as the Subjects of any common Grace.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould imagine, that ſome Things may be Signs of Grace, which are not Grace itſelf, or which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nature and Eſſence of Grace and Holineſs in them; yet, certainly they will allow, that the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are ſure Evidences of Grace, muſt be things that are near akin to Grace, or having ſome remarkable Affinity with it. But the Devils are not only wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of any true Holineſs; but they are at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023344_0007_0FBF075552264168"/>
Diſtance from it, and have nothing in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in any wiſe akin to it.</p>
            <p>There are many in this World, who are wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſaving Grace, who yet have common Grace: They have no true Holineſs, but nevertheleſs, have ſomething of that which is called <hi>moral virtue</hi>; and are the Subject of ſome Degree of the common Influences of the Spirit of GOD. 'Tis ſo with thoſe in general, that live under the Light of the Goſpel, and are not given up to judicial Blindneſs and Hardneſs. Yea, thoſe that are thus given up, yet have ſome Degree of reſtraining Grace, while they live in this World; without which, the Earth could not bear them, and they would in no Meaſure, be tolerable Members of human Society. But when any are damned, or caſt into Hell, as the Devils are, GOD whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdraws his reſtraining Grace, and all merciful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Spirit whatſoever: And they have neither ſaving Grace, nor common Grace; neither the Grace of the Spirit; nor any of the common Gifts of the Spirit; neither true Holineſs, nor moral Virtue of any kind. Hence ariſes the vaſt Increaſe of the Exerciſe of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the Hearts of Men, when they are damned. And herein is the chief Difference between the damned in Hell, and unregenerate and graceleſs Men in this World: Not that wicked Men in this World, have any more Holineſs or true virtue than the damned, or that wicked Men, when they leave this World, have any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Wickedneſs infuſed into them: But when Men are caſt into Hell, GOD perfectly takes away his Spirit from them, as to all it's merciful common Influences, and entirely withdraws from them, all Reſtraints of his Spirit and good Providence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that a Perſon's being in any Reſpect as the Devil is, ſhould be a certain Sign, that he is very unlike, and oppoſite to him; and hereafter, ſhall not have his part with him. True Saints are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unlike, and contrary to the Devil, both relative
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023344_0008_0FBF0756C21F9FF8"/>
and really. They are ſo <hi>relatively.</hi> The Devil is the grand Rebel; the chief Enemy of GOD and CHRIST; the Object of GOD's greateſt Wrath; a condemned Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, utterly rejected and caſt off by him; forever ſhut out of his Preſence; the Priſoner of his Juſtice; an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting inhabitant of the infernal World. The Saints, on the contrary, are the Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; Members of the Family, of the glorious KING of Heaven; the Children of GOD; the Brethren and Spouſe of his dear Son; Heirs of GOD; Joint-heirs with CHRIST; Kings and Prieſts unto GOD. And they are extremely different <hi>really.</hi> The Devil, on Account of his hateful Nature, and thoſe accurſed Diſpoſitions which reign in Him, is called <hi>Satan,</hi> the Adverſary, <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon,</hi> the Great Deſtroyer, <hi>the Wolf, the roaring Lion, the great Dragon, the old Serpent.</hi> The Saints are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as GOD's <hi>holy Ones,</hi> his <hi>anointed Ones, the Excellent of the Earth; the Meek of the Earth; Lambs</hi> and <hi>Doves</hi>; CHRIST's <hi>little Children</hi>; having the <hi>Image of</hi> GOD, <hi>pure in heart</hi>; GOD's <hi>Jewels; Lilies in</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s Garden; Plants</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; <hi>Stars of Heaven; Temples of the Living GOD.</hi> The Saints, ſo far as they are ſaints, are as diverſe from the Devil, as Heaven is from Hell; and much more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than light is to darkneſs: And the eternal ſtate that they are appointed to, is anſwerably diverſe and contrary.</p>
            <p>Now it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that a being, in any reſpect, as <hi>Satan</hi> is, or the being the ſubject of, any of the ſame properties, qualifications, affections, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are in him, is any certain evidence, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are thus exceeding different from him; and in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo diverſe, and appointed to an eternal ſtate, ſo extremely contrary in all reſpects. Wicked Men, are in ſcripture, called the <hi>children of the Devil.</hi> Now is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that Men's being, in any reſpect, as the Devil is, can be a certain ſign, that they are not his children, but the Children of the infinitely holy and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed GOD? We are informed, that wicked Men, ſhall

hereafter, have their part with Devils; ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to the ſame everlaſting fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his angels. Now, can a man's being like the Devil in any reſpect, be a ſure token that he ſhall not have his part with him, but with glorious Angels, and with JESUS CHRIST, dwelling with him, where he is, that he may behold, and partake of his glory?</p>

               <p>The firſt USE may lie in ſeveral inferrences, for our <hi>Inſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. From what has been ſaid, it may be infer'd, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of reaſon, that nothing that <hi>damned men</hi> do, or ever will experience, can be any ſure ſign of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damned men</hi> are like the <hi>Devils</hi>; are conformed to 'em in nature and ſtate. They have nothing better in them than the Devils; have no higher principles in their hearts; experience nothing, and do nothing of a more excellent kind: As they are the children and ſervants of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and as ſuch ſhall dwell with him, and be partakers with him, of the ſame miſery. As CHRIST ſays, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaints, in their future ſtate; Matt. xxii. 30. That <hi>they ſhall be as the Angels of</hi> GOD <hi>in Heaven:</hi> So it may be ſaid concerning ungodly men, in their future ſtate; that they <hi>ſhall be as the fallen, wicked Angels in Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each of the forementioned reaſons, given to ſhew the truth of the doctrine, with reſpect to Devils, hold good with reſpect to damned men. Damned men have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thererefore, thoſe things, which are nothing beyond what they have, cannot be holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences. So it is true, that the damned men, are not only abſolutely deſtitute of all true holineſs, but they have not ſo much as any common grace. And laſtly, 'tis unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that a perſon's being in any reſpect, as the damned in Hell are, ſhould be a certain ſign, that they are very unlike and oppoſite to them, and hereafter, ſhall not have their portion with them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:023344_0010_0FBF075A69068C58"/>II. We may hence infer, that no degree of ſpeculative knowledge of things, of Religion, is any certain ſign of ſaving grace. The Devil, before his fall, was among thoſe bright and glorious Angels of Heaven, which are repreſented as morning ſtars, and flames of fire, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in ſtrength and wiſdom. And tho' he be now become ſinful, yet his ſin has not aboliſhed the faculties of the angelick nature; as when man fell, he did not loſe the faculties of the human nature. Sin deſtroys <hi>ſpiritual principles,</hi> but not the <hi>natural faculties.</hi> 'Tis true, ſin, when in full dominion, entirely prevents the exerciſe of the natural faculties, in holy and ſpiritual underſtanding; and lays many impediments in the way of their proper exerciſe in other reſpects: It lays the natural faculty of reaſon, under great diſadvantages, by the many and ſtrong prejudices, which the mind is brought under the power of: And in fallen man, the faculties of the ſoul, are, doubtleſs, greatly impeded in their exerciſe, through that great weakneſs and diſorder of the corporeal organ, which it is ſtrictly united to; which is the conſequence of ſin. But there ſeems to be nothing in the nature of ſin, or moral corruption, that has any tendency to deſtroy the natural capacity; or even to diminiſh it, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If ſin were of ſuch a nature, as neceſſarily to have that tendency and effect; then it might be expected, that wicked men, in a future ſtate, where they are given up entirely to the unreſtrained exerciſe of their corruptions and luſts, and ſin is, in all reſpects, brought to its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection in them, would have the capacity of their ſouls greatly diminiſhed: Which we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe; but rather on the contrary; that their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are greatly enlarged, and that their actual knowledge is vaſtly increaſed; and that even with reſpect to the Divine Being, and the things of Religion, and the great concerns of the immortal ſouls of men; and that, with regard to theſe things, the eyes of wicked men are open'd; and they, in ſome reſpects, emerge out of darkneſs into
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023344_0011_0FBF07637112BA98"/>
clear light, when they go into another world.</p>
               <p>The greatneſs of the abilities of the Devils, may be argued, from the repreſentation in <hi>Eph.</hi> vi. 12. <hi>We wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame may alſo be argued, from what the ſcripture ſays of Satan's ſubtilty. <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 3. <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 10.</p>
               <p>And as the Devil has a faculty of underſtanding of large capacity, ſo he is capable of great ſpeculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of the things of GOD, and the inviſible and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal world, as well as other things; and muſt needs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, have a great underſtanding of theſe things; as theſe are the things which have always been chiefly in his view; and as his circumſtances, from his firſt exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, have been ſuch as have tended chiefly to engage him to attend to theſe things. Before his fall, he was one of thoſe <hi>Angels, who continually beheld the face of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is in Heaven.</hi> And ſin has no tendency to deſtroy the memory: And therefore, has no tendency to blot out of it, any ſpeculative knowledge that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there.</p>
               <p>As the Devil's ſu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>lity, ſhews his great capacity; ſo the way in which his ſubtility is exerciſed and manifeſted; which is principally in his artful management, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to things of religion; his exceeding ſubtile repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, inſinuations, reaſonings and temptations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things, demonſtrates his great actual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them. As in order to the being a very artful diſputant in any ſcience, tho' it be only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and deceive ſuch as are converſant in the ſcience; a perſon had need to have a great and extenſive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the things, which pertain to that ſcience.</p>
               <p>Thus the Devil has, undoubtedly, a great degree of ſpeculative knowledge in divinity; having been, as it were, educated in the beſt divinity ſchool in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, viz. The Heaven of Heavens. He muſt needs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023344_0012_0FBF0765B860DC80"/>
have ſuch an extenſive and accurate knowledge, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and attributes of GOD, as we, worms of the duſt, in our preſent ſtate, are not capable of. And he muſt have a far more extenſive knowledge of the works of GOD; as of the work of creation in particular; for he was a ſpectator of the creation of this viſible world: He was one of thoſe <hi>morning ſtars</hi> that we read of, <hi>Job</hi> xxxviii. 4, 5, 6, 7. who <hi>ſang together,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>Sons of GOD,</hi> that <hi>ſhouted for joy, when</hi> GOD <hi>laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth, and laid the meaſures thereof, and ſtretched the line upon it.</hi> And ſo he muſt have a very great knowledge of GOD's works of Providence: He has been a ſpectator of the ſeries of theſe works from the beginning: He has ſeen how GOD has governed the world in all ages: He has ſeen the whole train of GOD's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſucceſſive diſpenſations of Providence towards <hi>his church,</hi> from generation to generation. And he has not been an indifferent ſpectator; but the great oppoſition, which there has been between GOD and him, in the whole courſe of thoſe diſpenſations; has neceſſarily, greatly engaged his attention, in the ſtricteſt obſervation of them. He muſt have a great degree of knowledge, concerning JESUS CHRIST, as the ſaviour of men; and the nature and method of the work of redemption, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſdom of GOD in this contrivance. 'Tis that work of GOD, wherein, above all others, GOD has acted in oppoſition to him; and in which he has chiefly ſet himſelf in oppoſition to GOD. 'Tis with relation to this affair, that that mighty warfare has been maintained, which has been carried on between <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the Devil and his Angels, through all ages, from the beginning of the World; and eſpecially, ſince Chriſt appeared in the world. The Devil has had enough to engage his attention, to the ſteps of divine wiſdom in this work; for 'tis to that wiſdom he has oppoſed his ſubtility: And he has ſeen, and found, to his great diſappointment, and unſpeakable torment; how divine wiſdom, as exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023344_0013_0FBF07673A7CA418"/>
in that work, has baffled and confounded his devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He has a great knowledge of the things of another world; for the things of that world, are in his immediate view. He has a great knowledge of Heaven; for he has been an inhabitant of that world of Glory: And he has a great knowledge of Hell, and the nature of its miſery; for he is the firſt inhabitant of Hell; and above all the other inhabitants, has experience of its torment, and has felt them conſtantly, for more than fifty-ſeven hundred years. He muſt have a great knowledge of the holy ſcriptures; for 'tis evident, he is not hindred from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is written there, by the uſe he made of the words of ſcripture, in his temptation of our Saviour. And if he can know, he has much opportunity to know, and muſt needs have a diſpoſitton to know, with the greateſt exactneſs; that he may, to greater effect, prevent and wreſt the ſcripture, and prevent ſuch an effect of the word of GOD on the hearts of men, as ſhall tend to overthrow his kingdom. He muſt have a great knowledge of the nature of mankind, their capacity, their diſpoſitions, and the corruptions of their hearts; for he has had long and great obſervations and experience. The heart of man, is what he has had chiefly to do with, in his ſubtile devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, mighty efforts, reſtleſs and indefatigable operations and exertions of himſelf, from the beginning of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And 'tis evident, that he has a great ſpeculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the nature of experimental Religion, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to imitate it ſo artfully, and in ſuch a manner, as to <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is manifeſt, from my text and doctrine, that no degree of ſpeculative knowledge of things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is any certain ſign of true piety. Whatever clear notions a man may have of the attributes of GOD, and doctrine of the Trinity; the nature of the two covenants, the economy of the perſons of the Trinity, and the part which each perſon has in the affair of man's redemption; if he can diſcourſe never ſo excellently of the offices of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023344_0014_0FBF0768AAA6EE18"/>
CHRIST, and the way of ſalvation by him, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable methods of divine wiſdom; and the harmony of the various attributes of GOD in that way; if he can talk never ſo clearly and exactly of the method of the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner, and of the nature of converſion, and the operations of the ſpirit of GOD, in applying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of CHRIST; giving good diſtinctions, happily ſolving difficulties, and anſwering objections; in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner tending greatly to the enlightening the ignorant, to the edification of the church of GOD, and the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gainſayers; and the great increaſe of light in the world: If he has more knowledge of this ſort than hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of true ſaints, of an ordinary education, and moſt divines; yet all is no certain evidence of any degree of ſaving grace in the heart.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the ſcripture often ſpeaks of knowledge of divine things, as what is peculiar to true ſaints; as in John xvii. <hi>This is eternal life, that they may know thee, the only true</hi> GOD, <hi>and</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Matt. xii. 27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son, and he to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> Pſ. ix. 10. <hi>They that know thy name, will put their trust in thee.</hi> Philip. iii. 8. <hi>I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>my Lord.</hi> But then, we muſt underſtand it of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind of knowledge, from that ſpeculative under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Devil has to ſo great a degree. It will alſo be allowed, that the ſpiritual ſaving knowledge of GOD, and divine things, greatly promotes ſpeculative knowledge; as it engages the mind in its ſearch into things of this kind, and muſt aſſiſt to a diſtinct under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them; ſo that, other things being equal, they that have ſpiritual knowledge, are much more likely than others, to have a good doctrinal acquaintance with things of Religion—but yet, ſuch acquaintance may be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing characteriſtic of true ſaints.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It may alſo be inferr'd from what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023344_0015_0FBF076A6A608E78"/>
that for perſons meerly to yield a ſpeculative aſſent to the doctrines of Religion as true, is no certain evidence of a ſtate of grace. My text tells us, that the Devils <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi> and as they believe that there is one GOD, ſo they believe the truth of the doctrines of Religion in general. The devil is orthodox in his faith—he believes the true ſcheme of Doctrine—he is no <hi>Deist, Socinian, Arian, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian</hi> or <hi>Antinomian</hi>—the articles of his faith are all ſound, and what he is thoroughly eſtabliſhed in.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for a perſon to believe the doctrines of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, merely from the influence of things ſpeculative, or from the force of arguments, as diſcerned only by ſpeculation, is no evidence of grace.</p>
               <p>Tho' 'tis probably a very rare thing, for unregenerate men, to have a ſtrong perſuaſion of the truth of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Religion, eſpecially, ſuch of 'em as are very myſterious, and much above the comprehenſion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Yet 'tis manifeſt, that we have no warrant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that it can never be ſo, or to look upon ſuch a perſuaſion, as an infalliable evidence of grace—and that no perſon can ſafely determine his ſtate to be good from ſuch an evidence. Yet if he, not only himſelf, ſeems to be very confident of the truth of Chriſtianity and its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, but is able to argue moſt ſtrongly for the proof of them—yet in this, he goes nothing beyond the Devil— who, doubtleſs, has a great knowledge of the rational ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, by which the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and its ſeveral principles are evinced.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when the ſcripture ſpeaks of <hi>believing that</hi> JESUS <hi>is the Son of</hi> GOD, as a ſure evidence of grace, as in 1. John v. 1. and other places, it muſt be underſtood, not of a mere ſpeculative aſſent, but of another kind and manner of believing, which is called the faith of GOD's elect. <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 1. There is a ſpiritual conviction of the truth, which is, a believing with the whole heart, peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to true ſaints—of which I would ſpeak particularly by and by.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:023344_0016_0FBF0785ADF88248"/>IV. It may be infer'd, from the doctrine which has been inſiſted on, that 'tis no certain ſign, that perſons are ſavingly converted; that they have been ſuBjects of very great diſtreſs and terrors of mind, through appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of GOD's wrath, and fears of damnation.</p>
               <p>That the Devils are the ſubjects of great terrors, through apprehenſions of GOD's wrath, and fears of future effects of it, is implied in my text; which ſpeaks not only of their <hi>believing,</hi> but <hi>trembling.</hi> It muſt be no ſmall degree of terror, which ſhould make thoſe principalities and powers, thoſe mighty, proud and ſturdy beings, to tremble.</p>
               <p>There are many terrors, that ſome perſons, who are concerned for their ſalvation, are the ſubjects of, which are not from any proper awakenings of conſcience, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of truth; but from melancholy, or frightful impreſſions on their imagination; or ſome groundleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and the deluſions, and falſe ſuggeſtions of Satan. But if they have had never ſo great, and long continued terrors, from real awakenings, and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of truth, and views of things as they are; this is no more than what is in the Devils, and will be in all wicked men, in another world. However ſtupid and ſenſeleſs moſt ungodly men are now, all will be effectually awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened at laſt: There will be no ſuch thing as ſlumbering in Hell. There are many that cannot be awaken'd by the moſt ſolemn warnings, and awful threatnings of the word of GOD; the moſt alarming diſcourſes from the pulpit, and the moſt awakening and awful providences; but all will be thoroughly awaken'd, by the ſound of the laſt trumpet, and the appearance of CHRIST to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and all ſorts will then be fill'd with moſt amazing terrors, from apprehenſions of truth, and ſeeing things as they be; when <hi>the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men,</hi> (ſuch as were the moſt lofty and ſtouthearted, moſt ready to treat the things of Religion with contempt) <hi>ſhall hide themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023344_0017_0FBF0785F2B3E390"/>
mountains; and ſay to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> Rev. vi. 15.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if perſons have firſt been awakened, and then afterwards have had comfort and joy, 'tis no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign, that their comforts are of the right kind, that they were preceded by very great terrors.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It may be further infer'd from the doctrine, that no work of the law on men's hearts, in conviction of Guilt, and juſt deſert of puniſhment, is a ſure argument, that a perſon has been ſavingly converted.</p>
               <p>Not only, are no awakenings and terrors, any certain evidence of this, but no meer legal work whatſoever; tho' carried to the utmoſt extent that it can be; nothing wherein there is no grace or ſpiritual light, but only the meer conviction of natural conſcience, and thoſe acts and operations of the mind, which are the reſult of this; and ſo are, as it were, meerly forced by the clear light of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without the concurrence of the heart and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that light: I ſay theſe things are no certain ſign of the ſaving grace of GOD, or that a perſon was ever ſavingly converted.</p>
               <p>The evidence of this, from my text and doctrine, is demonſtrative; becauſe the Devils are the ſubjects of theſe things; and all wicked men that ſhall finally periſh, will be the ſubjects of the ſame. Natural conſciene is not extinguiſhed in the damned in Hell; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, remains, and is there in it's greateſt ſtrength, and is brought to it's moſt perfect exerciſe; moſt fully to do its proper office, as GOD's vicegerent in the ſoul, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe rebels againſt the king of heaven and earth, and manifeſt GOD's juſt wrath and vengeance, and by that means to torment them; and be as a never-dying worm within them. Wretched men find means in this world, to blind the eyes, and ſtop the mouth of this vicegerent of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023344_0018_0FBF07876B489CB8"/>
a ſin revenging GOD; but they ſhall not be able to do it always. In another world, the eyes and mouth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be fully open'd. GOD will hereafter, make wicked men to ſee and know theſe things, which now they induſtriouſly hide their eyes from; <hi>Iſai.</hi> xxxvi. 10, 11. <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteouſneſs; in the land of uprightneſs he will deal unjuſtly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord. Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee: But they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed for their envy at the people; yea the ſire of thine enemies ſhall devour them.</hi> We have this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on often annexed to GOD's threatnings of wrath to his enemies; <hi>and they ſhall know, that I am the Lord:</hi> This ſhall be accompliſhed by their woful experience, and clear light in their conſciences, whereby they ſhall be made to know, whether they will or not; how great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, holy and righteous a GOD <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> is; whoſe authority they have deſpiſed: And they ſhall know, that he is righteous and holy in their deſtruction. This all the ungodly will be convinced of, at the day of Judgment, by the bringing to light all their wickedneſs of heart and practice; and ſetting all their ſins, with all their aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, in order, not only in the view of others, even of the whole world, but in the view of their own conſciences. This is threaten'd, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence: Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thyſelf. But I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes.</hi> Compare this with the four firſt verſes of the Pſalm.—The end of the day of Judgment, si not <hi>to find out what is juſt</hi>; as it is with human judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is <hi>to manifest what is just</hi>; to make known GOD's juſtice in the judgment which he will execute, to men's own conſciences, and to the world. And therefore, that day is called <hi>the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of</hi> GOD. <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 5. Now ſinners often cavil againſt the juſtice of GOD's diſpenſations, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the juſtice of the puniſhment, which GOD threatens for their ſins; excuſing themſelves, and condemning GOD:

But when GOD comes to manifeſt their wickedneſs in the light of that day, and to call them to an account, they will be ſpeechleſs; <hi>Matt.</hi> xxii. 11, 12. <hi>And when the king came to ſee the gueſts, he ſaw there, a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he ſaith unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? and he was ſpeechleſs.</hi> When the king of Heaven and earth comes to judgment, their conſciences will be ſo perfectly enlighten'd and convinced, by the all ſearching light, they ſhall then ſtand in; that their mouths will be effectually ſtopped, as to all excuſes for themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all pleading of their own righteouſneſs, to excuſe or juſtify them; and all objections againſt the juſtice of their judge; that their conſcience will condemn them only, and not GOD.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it follows from the doctrine, that it can be no certain ſign of grace, that perſons have had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of ſin; have had their ſins of life, with their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations remarkably ſet before them, ſo as greatly to affect and terrify them; and withal, have had a great ſight of the wickedneſs of their hearts, and been convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the greatneſs of the ſin of unbelief, and of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſeableneſs and heinouſneſs of their moſt ſecret ſpiritual iniquities; and have been brought to be convinced of the uttter inſufficiency of their own righteouſneſs; and to deſpair of being recommended to GOD by it; have been as much brought off from their own righteouſneſs, as ever any are, under a meer legal humiliation; have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are wholly without excuſe before GOD, and deſerve damnation; and that GOD would be juſt, in executing the threaten'd puniſhment upon them, tho' it be ſo dreadful. All theſe things, will be in all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly at the day of judgment, when they ſhall ſtand with Devils, at the left hand, and ſhall be doomed as accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to everlaſting fire, with them.</p>
               <p>Indeed there will be no ſubmiſſion in them. Their conſcience will be fully convinced, that GOD is juſt in their condemnation; but yet their wills will not be bowed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023344_0020_0FBF07A117225530"/>
to GOD's juſtice. There will be no acquieſcence of mind, in that divine attribute; no yielding of the ſoul to GOD's ſovereignty, but the higheſt degree of enmity and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. A true ſubmiſſion of the heart and will, to the juſtice and ſovereignty of GOD, is therefore allowed to be ſomething peculiar to true converts, being ſomething which the Devils and damned ſouls are, and ever will be far from; and which a meer work of the law, and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conſcience, however great and clear, will never bring men to.</p>
               <p>When ſinners are the ſubjects of great convictions of conſcience, and a remarkable work of the law; 'tis only a tranſacting the buſineſs of the day of Judgment, in the conſcience before hand: GOD ſits enthroned in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as at the laſt day he will ſit enthron'd in the cloud of heaven; the ſinner is arraigned, as it were, at GOD's bar; and GOD appears in his awful greatneſs, as a juſt and holy, ſin-hating and ſin revenging GOD, as he will then. The ſinners iniquities are brought to light; his ſins ſet in order before him; the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the counſels of the heart are made manifeſt; as it will be then: Many witneſſes do, as it were, riſe up againſt the ſinner under convictions of conſcience; as they will againſt the wicked at the day of judgment: And the books are open'd, particularly the book of GOD's ſtrict and holy law, is open'd in the conſcience, and its rules applied for the condemnation of the ſinner; which is the book that will be open'd at the day of Judgment, as the grand rule of Judgment, to all ſuch wicked men as have lived under it: And the ſentence of the law is pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſinner; and the juſtice of the ſentence made manifeſt; as it will be at the day of Judgment. The conviction of a ſinner at the day of Judgment, will be a work of the law, as well as the conviction of conſcience in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the work of the law (if the work be <hi>meerly legal)</hi> be ſure, is never carried further in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of ſinners now, than it will be at that day, when it's work will be perfect, in thoroughly ſtopping the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023344_0021_0FBF07A62A0D4A10"/>
mouth. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>Now we know, that what things ſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before GOD.</hi> Every mouth ſhall be ſtopped by the law, either now or hereafter; and all the world ſhall become ſenſibly guilty before GOD; guilty of death, deſerving of damnation.—And therefore, if ſinners have been the ſubjects of a great work of the law, and have thus become guilty, and their mouths have been ſtopp'd; it is no certain ſign that ever they have been converted.</p>
               <p>Indeed the want of a thorough ſenſe of guilt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of puniſhment, and conviction of the juſtice of GOD, in threatning damnation, is a good negative ſign; 'tis a ſign that a perſon <hi>never was</hi> converted, and truly brought, with the whole ſoul, to embrace CHRIST as a Saviour from this puniſhment: For 'tis eaſily demonſtrable, that there is no ſuch thing as entirely and cordially accepting an offer from GOD, of a Saviour, from a puniſhment that he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, which we think we don't deſerve. But the having ſuch a conviction, is no certain ſign, that perſons have true faith, or have ever truly received CHRIST as their Saviour. And if perſons have great comfort, joy, and confidence, ſuddenly let into their minds, after great convictions, of ſuch a kind as has been mention'd; 'tis no infalliable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that their comforts are built on a good foundation.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifeſt, therefore, that too much ſtreſs has been laid by many perſons, on a great work of the law, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding their comforts: Who ſeem not only to have look'd on ſuch a work of the law, as neceſſary to precede faith, but alſo to have eſteem'd it as the chief evidence of the truth and genuineneſs of ſucceeding faith and comforts. By this means it is to be fear'd, very many have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and eſtabliſh'd in a falſe hope. And what is to be ſeen in the event of things, in multitudes of inſtances, confirms this. It may be ſafely allowed, not to be ſo uſual for great convictions of conſcience, to prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and fail of a good iſſue, as for leſſer convictions;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023344_0022_0FBF07A8DADC7ED0"/>
and that more generally, when the ſpirit of GOD proceeds ſo far with ſinners, in the work of the law, as to give 'em a great ſight of their hearts, and of the heinouſneſs of their ſpiritual iniquities; and to convince 'em that they are without excuſe; and that all their righteouſneſs can do nothing to merit GOD's favours; but that they lie juſtly expoſed to GOD's eternal vengeance without mercy; a work of ſaving converſion follows. But we can have no warrant to ſay, it is univerſally ſo, or to lay it down as an infallible rule, that when convictions of conſcience have gone thus far, ſaving faith, and repentance will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow. If any ſhould think they have ground for ſuch a determination, becauſe they can't conceive what end GOD ſhould have, in carrying a work of conviction to ſuch a length, and ſo preparing the heart for faith; and after all, never giving ſaving faith to the ſoul; I deſire it may be conſidered, where will be the end of our doubts and difficulties, if we think ourſelves ſufficient to determine, ſo poſitively and particularly concerning GOD's ends and deſigns in what he does. It may be aſked ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector, what is GOD's end in giving a ſinner <hi>any degree</hi> of the ſtrivings of his ſpirit, and conviction of conſcience; when he afterwards ſuffers it to come to nothing, and to prove in vain? If he may give ſome degree that may finally be in vain; who ſhall ſet the bounds, and ſay how great the degree ſhall be? Who can, on ſure grounds, determine, that when a ſinner has ſo much of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, which the Devils and damned in hell have; true faith and eternal ſalvation, will be the certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. This we may certainly determine, that, if the Apoſtle's argument in the text be good, not any thing whatſoever, that the Devils have, is certainly connected with ſuch a conſequence. Seeing ſinners, while ſuch, are capable of the moſt perfect convictions, and will have them at the day of Judgment, and in Hell; who ſhall ſay, that GOD never ſhall cauſe reprobates to anticipate the future Judgment and damnation in that reſpect? And
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023344_0023_0FBF07AAB32CDC50"/>
if he does ſo, who ſhall ſay to him, what doeſt thou? Or call him to account concerning his ends in ſo doing. Not but that many poſſible wiſe ends might be thought of, and mention'd, if it were needful, or I had now room for it.—The ſpirit of GOD, is often quenched, by the exerciſe of the wickedneſs of men's hearts, after he has gone far in a work of conviction; ſo that their convictions never have a good iſſue. And who can ſay that ſinners, by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their oppoſition and enmity againſt GOD, (which is not at all mortified by the greateſt legal convictions, neither in the damned in Hell, nor ſinners on earth) may not provoke GOD to take his ſpirit from them, even after he has proceeded the greateſt length in a work of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Who can ſay, that GOD never is provoked to deſtroy ſome, after he has brought 'em, as it were, through the wilderneſs, even to the edge of the land of reſt? As he ſlew ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> even in the plains of <hi>Moab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let it be conſidered, where is our warrant in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make uſe of any legal convictions, or any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or order of ſucceſſive events in a work of the law; and conſequent comforts, as a ſure ſign of regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſcripture is abundant, in expreſsly mentioning evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of grace, and of a ſtate of favour with GOD, and characteriſticks of the true ſaints: But where do we ever find ſuch things as theſe, amongſt thoſe evidences? Or where do we find any other ſigns inſiſted on, beſides grace itſelf, it's nature, exerciſes and fruits? Theſe were the evidences that <hi>Job</hi> relied upon; Theſe were the things that the Pſalmiſt, every were inſiſts upon, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his ſincerity: And particularly in the cxix Pſalm, from the beginning to the end. Theſe were the ſigns that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> truſted to, in his ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the characteriſticks given of thoſe that are truly happy, by our ſaviour, in the beginning of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the mount. Theſe are the things that CHRIST mentions, at the true evidences of being his real diſciples, in his laſt, and dying diſcourſe to his diſciples, in the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023344_0024_0FBF07AC33F3D1E8"/>
xiv. xv. and xvi. Chapters of <hi>John</hi>; and in his interceſſary prayer, Chap. xvii. Theſe are the things which the Apoſtle Paul often ſpeaks of, as evidences of his ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſure title to a crown of glory. And theſe are the things he often mentions to others, in his epiſtles, as the proper evidences of real chriſtianity; a juſtified ſtate, and a title to glory. He inſiſts on the <hi>fruits of the ſpirit; love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance,</hi> as the proper evidences of <hi>being</hi> CHRIST's, and <hi>living in the ſpirit:</hi> Gal. v. 22.—25. 'Tis that <hi>Charity,</hi> or divine love, <hi>which is pure, peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy, &amp;c.</hi> that he inſiſts on, as the moſt eſſential evidence of true Godlineſs; without which, all other things are nothing. Such are the ſigns which the Apoſtle James inſiſts on, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evidence, of a truly wiſe and good man: Jam. iii 17. <hi>The wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſy.</hi> And ſuch are the ſigns of true Chriſtianity, which the Apoſtle John in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts on, throughout his epiſtles. And we never have any where in the Bible, from the beginning to the end of it, any other ſigns of Godlineſs given, than ſuch as theſe. If perſons have ſuch things as theſe apparently in them, it ought to be determin'd, that they are truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, without its being inſiſted, that it be firſt known, what ſteps or method the ſpirit of GOD took, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe things into the ſoul; which often times, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together untraceable. All the works of GOD, are in ſome reſpects, unſearchable: But the Scripture, repreſents the works of the ſpirit of GOD, as peculiarly ſo; Iſai. xl. 13. <hi>Who hath directed</hi> the ſpirit of the Lord, <hi>or being his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, hath taught him?</hi> Ecleſ. xi. 5. <hi>As thou knoweſt not what is the way of</hi> the ſpirit; <hi>nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child, ſo thou knowest not the works of GOD, who maketh all.</hi> John iii. 8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth; and thou hearest the ſound thereof;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023344_0025_0FBF07AE88F49658"/>
but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of</hi> the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It follows from my text and doctrine, that it is no certain ſign of grace, that perſons have earneſt deſires and longings after ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Devils, doubtleſs, long for deliverance from the miſery they ſuffer, and from that greater miſery which they expect. If they tremble through fear of it, they muſt, neceſſarily, earneſtly deſire to be delivered from it. Wicked men, are in ſcripture, repreſented as longing for the privileges of the righteous, when the door is ſhut, and they are ſhut out from among them: They come to the door, and cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> Therefore, we are not to look on all deſires, or all deſires that are very earneſt and vehement, as certain evidences of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart. There are earneſt deſires of a religious nature, which the ſaints have, that are the proper breathings of a new nature, and diſtinguiſhing qualities of true ſaints: But there are alſo longings, which unregenerate men may have, which are often miſtaken for marks of Godlineſs: They think they hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; and have earneſt deſires after GOD and CHRIST, and long for Heaven; when indeed, all is to be reſolved into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of ſalvation, from ſelf-love; and ſo is a longing which ariſes from no higher principles, than the earneſt deſires of Devils.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It may be infer'd from what has been obſerved; that perſons who have no grace, may have a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of an external glory, in things heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and of whatſoever is external, pertaining to things of Religon.</p>
               <p>If perſons have impreſs'd ſtrongly on their minds, ideas of that ſort, which are obtain'd by the external ſenſes; whether they are of that kind that enter by the ear, as any kind of ſound; whether it be the moſt pleaſant mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or words ſpoken of excellent ſignification; words of ſcripture, or any other, immediately ſuggeſted, as
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023344_0026_0FBF07B0B3029FD0"/>
tho' they were ſpoken, tho' they ſeem to be never ſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their caſe, or adapted to the ſubject of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: Or whether they are of that kind, that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the eye, as ideas of a viſible beauty and glory; a ſhining light, an external glory of Heaven; golden ſtreets, walls and gates of precious ſtone; ſplendid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces; glorious inhabitants, ſhining forth as the ſun; a moſt magnificent throne, ſurrounded by angels and ſaints, in ſhining ranks: Or any thing external, belonging to JESUS CHRIST; either in his humbled ſtate, as of JESUS hanging on the croſs with his crown of thorns, his wounds open, and blood trickling down; or in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſtate, with awful majeſty, or raviſhing beauty and ſweetneſs in his countenance; his face ſhining above the brightneſs of the ſun, and the like: Theſe things are no certain ſigns of grace.</p>
               <p>Multitudes that are now in Hell, will have ideas of the external glory, that pertains to things heavenly, far beyond what ever any have in this world. They will ſee all that external glory and beauty, in which CHRIST will appear at the day of Judgment, when the ſun ſhall be turned into darkneſs before him; which, doubtleſs, will be ten thouſand times greater than ever was impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the imagination of either ſaints or ſinners, in this preſent ſtate, or ever was conceived by any mortal man.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It may be infer'd from the doctrine, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have no grace, may have a very great and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſenſe of many divine things in their hearts.</p>
               <p>The Devil has not only great ſpeculative knowledge, but he has a ſenſe of many divine things, which deeply affects him, and is moſt ſtrongly impreſs'd on his heart. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Devils and damned ſouls, have a great ſenſe of the <hi>vast importance</hi> of the things of another world. They are <hi>in</hi> the inviſible world, and they ſee and know how great the things of that world are: Their experience teaches 'em in the moſt affecting manner. They have a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023344_0027_0FBF07B2D8465B00"/>
great ſenſe of the worth of ſalvation, and the worth of immortal ſouls, and the vaſt importance of thoſe things, that concern men's eternal welfare. The parable in the latter end of the xvi. Chap. of Luke, teaches this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the <hi>rich man</hi> in Hell, as intreating that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent <hi>to his five brothers, to testify unto them, less they ſhould come to that place of torment.</hi> They who endure the torments of Hell, have, doubtleſs, a moſt lively and affecting ſenſe of the vaſtneſs of an endleſs eternity; and of the comparative momentarineſs of this life, and the vanity of the concerns and enjoyments of time. They are convinced effectually, that all the things of this world, even thoſe that appear greateſt and moſt important to the inhabitants of the earth, are deſpicable trifles, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the things of the eternal world. They have a great ſenſe of the preciouſneſs of time, and of the means of grace, and the ineſtimable value of the privileges which they enjoy, which live under the goſpel. They are fully ſenſible of the folly of thoſe that go on in ſin; neglect their opportunities; make light of the counſels and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of GOD; and bitterly lament their exceeding folly, in their own ſins; by which they have brought on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo great and remedileſs miſery. When ſinners, by woful experience, know the dreadful iſſue of their evil way; they will <hi>mourn at the last, ſaying, how have I hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that inſtructed me!</hi> Prov. iv. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Therefore, however, true Godlineſs is now attended with a great ſenſe of the importance of divine things; and 'tis rare, that men that have no grace, do maintain ſuch a ſenſe, in any ſteady and perſevering manner; yet 'tis manifeſt, thoſe things are no certain evidences of grace. Unregenerate men may have a ſenſe of the importance of of the things of eternity, and the vanity of things of time; the work of immortal ſouls; the preciouſneſs of time and means of grace, and the folly of the way of allowed ſin;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023344_0028_0FBF07B475E53208"/>
And may have ſuch a ſenſe of thoſe things, as may deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect them, and cauſe 'em to mourn for their own ſins, and be much concerned for others. Tho' it be true, they have not theſe things in the ſame manner, and in all reſpects, from the ſame principles and views, as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men have them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Devils and damned men, have a ſtrong and moſt affecting ſenſe of the awful <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>majeſty</hi> of GOD. The awful majeſty of GOD, are greatly made manifeſt in the execution of divine wrath, which they are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of. The making this known, is one thing GOD has in deſign, in his vengeance on his enemies. Rom. ix. 22. <hi>What, if</hi> GOD <hi>willing to ſhew his wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering the veſſels of wrath, fitted to destruction?</hi> The Devils tremble before this <hi>great and terrible</hi> GOD, and under a ſtrong ſenſe of his <hi>awful majeſty.</hi> 'Tis greatly manifeſted to them, and damned ſouls now; but ſhall be manifeſted in a further degree, in <hi>that day, when the Lord Jeſus ſhalt be revealed from Heaven, in flaming fire, to take vengeance upon them</hi>; and when they ſhall earneſtly deſire to fly, and <hi>be hid from the face of him that ſits on the throne, (which ſhall be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the glory of his majeſty.</hi> Iſai. ii. 10.) and when they <hi>ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> When CHRIST <hi>comes,</hi> at the laſt day, <hi>in the glory of his Father, every eye ſhall ſee him</hi> in that glory, (in this reſpect, that they ſhall ſee his terrible majeſty) and they alſo that pierced him: Rev. i. 7. Both thoſe Devils, and wicked men, which tormented and inſulted him, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in meanneſs and ignominy, ſhall then ſee him in the glory of his father.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident, therefore, that a ſenſe of GOD's terrible majeſty, is no certain evidence of ſaving grace: For we ſee that wicked men, and Devils are capable of it: Yea, many wicked men in this world have actually had it. This is a manifeſtation, which GOD made of himſelf, in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023344_0029_0FBF07EAB921E678"/>
the ſight of that wicked congregation at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> which they ſaw, and were deeply affected with; <hi>ſo that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Devils and damned men have ſome kind of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſenſe of all the attributes of GOD, both natural and moral, that is ſtrong and very affecting.</p>
               <p>The Devils know GOD's <hi>almighty power</hi>: They ſaw a great manifeſtation of it, when they ſaw GOD lay the foundation of the earth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were much affected with it. And they have ſeen innumerable other great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his power; as in the univerſal deluge, the deſtruction of Sodom, the wonders in Egypt, at the red ſea, and in the wilderneſs; the cauſing the ſun to ſtand ſtill in <hi>Joſhua's</hi> time; and many others. And they had a very affecting manifeſtation of GOD's mighty power on themſelves, in caſting all their hoſts down from Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into Hell; and have continual affecting experience of it, in GOD's reſerving them in ſtrong chains of darkneſs, and in the ſtrong pains they feel; and will hereafter, have far more affecting experience of it, when <hi>they ſhall be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed from the glory of</hi> GOD's <hi>power,</hi> with that mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which they now tremble in expectation of. So the Devils have a great knowledge of the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of GOD: They have had unſpeakably, more opportunity and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve it, in the work of creation, and alſo in the works of providence, than any mortal man has ever had; and have been themſelves the ſubjects of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable affecting manifeſtations of it, in GOD's diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confounding them in their moſt ſubtil devices, in ſo wonderful and amazing a manner. So they ſee and find the <hi>infinite purity and holineſs</hi> of the divine nature, in the moſt affecting manner, as this appears in his infinite hatred of ſin, in what they feel of the dreadful effects of that hatred. They know already, by what they ſuffer, and will know hereafter to a greater degree, and far more affecting manner, that ſuch is the oppoſition of GOD's nature to ſin, that it is like a conſuming fire, that burns
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023344_0030_0FBF07F82A165A60"/>
with infinite vehemence againſt it: They will feel the vehement heat of that fire, in a very dreadful manner. They alſo will ſee the holineſs of GOD, as exerciſed in his love to righteouſneſs and holineſs, in what they will ſee of the reward of the righteouſneſs of CHRIST, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his people, in the glory of CHRIST and his church; which alſo will be very affecting to Devils, and wicked men. And the <hi>exact juſtice</hi> of GOD, will be manifeſted to them in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt, moſt convincing and moſt affecting light, at the day of Judgment. When they will alſo ſee great and affecting demonſtrations of the riches of his Grace, in the marvellous fruits of his love to the veſſels of mercy; when they ſhall ſee them at the right hand of CHRIST, ſhining as the ſun, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their father, and ſhall hear the bleſſed ſentence pronounced upon them; and will be deeply affected with it; as ſeems naturally implied in the xiii. Chap. of Luke, 28, 29, verſes. The Devils know GOD's <hi>Truth</hi>; and therefore, they believe his threatnings, and tremble in expectation of their accompliſhment. And wicked men that now doubt his truth, and dare not truſt his word, will hereafter, in the moſt convincing, affecting manner, find his word to be true, in all that he has threatened; and will ſee that he is faithful to his promiſes, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of his ſaints. Devils and damned men, know that GOD is <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>unchangeable</hi>; and therefore, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of there ever being an end to their miſery.</p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis manifeſt, that meerly Perſons having an affecting ſenſe of ſome, or even of all GOD's attributes, it is no certain ſign, that they have the true Grace of GOD in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Here poſſibly, ſome may object againſt the force of the foregoing reaſoning. That ungodly Men in this World, are in exceeding different circumſtances, from thoſe which the Devils are in; and from thoſe which wicked men will be in, at the day of Judgment. Thoſe things which are viſible and preſent to theſe, are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023344_0031_0FBF07FA98E9EE00"/>
now future and inviſible to the other. And wicked men in this world, are in the body, that clogs and hinders the ſoul, and are encompaſſed with objects that blind and ſtupify 'em. And therefore, it don't follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wicked in another world, have a great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and lively ſenſe of ſuch and ſuch things, without grace, that ungodly men, in their preſent ſtate may have the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer: 'Tis not ſuppoſed, that ever men in this life have all thoſe things which have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, to the ſame degree that the Devils and damned have them. None ſuppoſes that ever any in this life have ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of conſcience to an equal degree with them. 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed, that any mortal man, whether Godly or Ungodly, has an equal degree of ſpeculative knowledge with the Devil. And, as was juſt now obſerved, the wicked, at the day of Judgment, will have a vaſtly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er idea of the external glory of CHRIST, than ever any have in the preſent ſtate. So, doubtleſs, they will have a far greater ſenſe of GOD's awful greatneſs and terrible majeſty, than any could ſubſiſt under in this frail ſtate. So we may well conclude, that the Devils, and wicked men in Hell, have a greater and more affecting ſenſe of the vaſtneſs of eternity, and (in ſome reſpects) a greater ſenſe of the importance of the things of another world, than any here have. And they have alſo longings after ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an higher degree than any wicked men in this world.</p>
               <p>But yet, it is evident, that men in this world, may have things of <hi>the ſame kind</hi> with Devils and damned men. The ſame ſort of light in the underſtanding; the ſame views, and the ſame affections; the ſame ſenſe of things, the ſame kind of impreſſions on the mind, and on the heart. If the objection is againſt the concluſiveneſs of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that has been made uſe of to prove this; 'tis againſt the concluſiveneſs of that reaſoning which is the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's, more properly than mine. The Apoſtle judged it, a concluſive argument, againſt ſuch as thought their <hi>believing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023344_0032_0FBF07FBAF336790"/>
there was one</hi> GOD, an evidence of their being gracious,; that the Devils believed the ſame. So the argument is exactly the ſame, againſt ſuch as think they have grace, becauſe they believe GOD is a <hi>holy</hi> GOD, or becauſe they have a ſenſe of the <hi>awful majeſty</hi> of GOD. The ſame may be obſerved of other things that have been mentioned. My text has reference not only to the act of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Devils in believing, but to that affection of their hearts, which accompanies the views they have: As <hi>trembling</hi> is an effect of the affection of the heart. Which ſhews, that if men have both the ſame views of underſtanding, and alſo the ſame affections of heart, that the Devils have, it is no ſign of grace.</p>
               <p>And as to the particular degree, to which theſe things may be carried in men, in this world, without grace; it appears not to be ſafe, to go about ſo to aſcertain and fix it, as to make uſe of it as an infallible rule to determine men's ſtate. I know not where we have any rule to go by, to fix the preciſe degree, in which GOD by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or his common influence on the mind, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in wicked men in this world, the ſame views and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which the wicked have in another world; which 'tis manifeſt, the former are capable as well as the latter, having the ſame faculties and principles of ſoul; and which views and affections, it is evident, they often are actually the ſubjects of in ſome degree; ſome in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſome in a leſs degree. The infallible evidences of grace, which are laid down in ſcripture, are of another kind: They are all of a holy and ſpiritual nature; and therefore, things of that kind, which a heart that is wholly carnal and corrupt, cannot receive, or have any experience of. 1. Cor. ii. 14.</p>
               <p>I might alſo here add, that obſervation and experience, in very many inſtances, ſeems to confirm what ſcripture and reaſon teaches in theſe things.</p>
               <p>The ſecond USE may be of <hi>ſelf-examination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the things which have been obſerved, put all on
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023344_0033_0FBF07FD372DC350"/>
examining themſelves, and enquiring whether they have any better evidences of ſaving grace, than ſuch as have been mentioned.</p>
               <p>We ſee how the infallible ſpirit of GOD, in the text, plainly repreſents the things the Devils are the ſubjects of, as no ſure ſign of grace. And we have now, in ſome inſtances, obſerved how far the Devils, and damned men go, and will go in their experience, their knowledge of divine things, their belief of truth, their awakenings and and terrors of conſcience, their conviction of guilt, and of the juſtice of GOD, in their eternal, dreadful damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their longings after ſalvation, their ſight of the external glory of CHRIST, and heavenly things; their ſenſe of the vaſt importance of the things of Religion, and another world; their ſenſe of the awful greatneſs and terrible majeſty of GOD, yea, of all GOD's attributes. Theſe things may well put us on ſerious ſelf-examination, whether we have any thing to evidence our good eſtate, beyond what the Devils are the ſubjects of CHRIST ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>except your right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe, enter into the kingdom of Heaven:</hi> So the ſpirit of CHRIST, in his Apoſtle James, does in effect, ſay, in my text, except what ye experience in your ſouls, go beyond the experiences of Devils, ye ſhall, in no caſe, enter into the kingdom of GOD.</p>
               <p>Here, it may be, ſome will be ready to ſay, I have ſomething beſides all theſe things, which have been mentioned; I have things which the Devils have not, even <hi>love</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, you may have ſomething <hi>beſides</hi> the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Devils, and yet, nothing <hi>beyond</hi> them. Tho' the experience be different, yet it may not be owing to any different principle, but only the different circumſtances, under which theſe principles are exerciſed. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from whence the forementioned things in Devils and damned men do ariſe, are theſe two, <hi>natural underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-love.</hi> 'Tis from natural underſtanding or reaſon, that they have ſuch a degree of knowledge in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023344_0034_0FBF080291A05440"/>
divine things, and ſuch a belief of them. 'Tis from theſe principles of natural underſtanding and ſelf-love, as exerciſed about their own diſpoſitions and actions, and GOD as their judge, that they have <hi>natural conſcience</hi>; and have ſuch convictions of conſcience, as have been ſpoken of. 'Tis from theſe principles, that they have ſuch a ſenſe of the importance of the things of religion, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal world, and ſuch <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>gings after ſalvation. 'Tis from the joint exerciſe of theſe two principles, that they are ſo ſenſible of the awful majeſty of GOD, and of all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the divine nature, and ſo greatly affected with them. And it is from theſe principles, join'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe, the wicked, at the day of Judgment, will have ſo great an apprehenſion <hi>of,</hi> and will be ſo greatly affected <hi>by</hi> the external glory of CHRIST and his ſaints. And that you have a kind of love or gratitude and joy, which Devils and damned men have not, may poſſibly not ariſe from any other principles in your heart, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from theſe two, but only from theſe principles, as exerciſed in different circumſtances. As for inſtance; your being a ſubject of the reſtraining grace of GOD, and being under circumſtances of hope, and the receipt of mercy. The natural underſtanding and ſelf-love of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, poſſibly might affect them in the ſame manner, if they were in the ſame circumſtances. If your love to GOD, had it's firſt ſource from nothing elſe than a ſuppoſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate divine witneſs, or any other ſuppoſed evidence, that CHRIST died for you in particular, and that GOD loves you; it ſprings from no higher principles than ſelf-love; which is a principle that reigns in the hearts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Self-love is ſufficient, without grace, to cauſe men to love thoſe that love them, or that they imagine love them, and make much of them; <hi>Luke</hi> vi 32. <hi>For if ye love them which love you, what thank have you? For ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them.</hi> And would not the hearts of devils be fill'd with great <hi>joy,</hi> if they, by any means, ſhould take up a confident perſuaſion that GOD had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023344_0035_0FBF08062B789210"/>
them, and was become their friend, and that they ſhould be delivered from that wrath which they now are in trembling expectation of. If the Devils go ſo far as you have heard, even in their circumſtances, being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally caſt off, and given up to unreſtrain'd wickedneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without hope, knowing that GOD is, and ever will be their enemy, they ſuffering his wrath without mercy: How far may we reaſonably ſuppoſe they might go, in imitation of grace and pious experience, if they had the ſame degree of knowledge, as clear views, and as ſtrong conviction, under circumſtances of hope, and offers of mercy; and being the ſubjects of common grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining their corruptions, and aſſiſting and exciting the natural principles of reaſon, conſcience, &amp;c. Such things as Devils are the ſubjects of; ſuch great conviction of conſcience; ſuch a ſenſe of the importance of eternal things; ſuch affecting views of the awful majecty, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, power, holineſs, juſtice, and truth of GOD, and ſuch a ſenſe of his great grace to the ſaints, if they, or any thing like 'em, ſhould be in the heart of a ſinner, in this world; at the ſame time that he, from ſome ſtrong impreſſion on his imagination, of CHRIST appearing to him, or <hi>ſweet</hi> words ſpoken to him, or by ſome other means, has ſuddenly, after great terrors, imbibed a ſtrong confidence, that now, this great GOD, is his friend and father, has releaſed him from all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery he feared, and has promiſed him eternal happineſs: I ſay, ſuch things would, doubtleſs, vaſtly heighten his extaſy of joy, and raiſe the exerciſe of natural gratitude, (that principle from whence ſinners love thoſe that love them) and would occaſion a great imitation of many graces, in ſtrong exerciſes. Is it any wonder then, that multitudes under ſuch a ſort of affection, are deceived? Eſpecially when they have Devils to help forward the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion whoſe great ſubtilty, has chiefly been exerciſed in deceiving mankind, through all paſt generations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enquiry.</hi> Here poſſibly, ſome may be ready to enquire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If there may be ſo many things, which men may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023344_0036_0FBF082086687120"/>
from no higher principles than are in the minds and hearts of Devils; what are thoſe exerciſes and affections, that are of a higher nature, which I muſt find in my heart, and which I may juſtly look upon as ſure ſigns of the ſaving grace of GOD's ſpirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, thoſe exerciſes and affections which are good evidences of grace, differ from all that the Devils are the ſubjects of, and all that can ariſe from ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as are in their hearts, in two things; <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>foundation</hi> and their <hi>tendency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They differ in their <hi>foundation,</hi> or in that belonging to them, which is moſt fundamental in them, and the foundation of all the reſt, which pertains to 'em; <hi>viz. An apprehenſion, or ſenſe of the ſupreme holy beauty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of divine things, as they are in themſelves, or in their own nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Devils, and damned in Hell are, and forever will be entirely deſtitute of. This the Devils once had, while they ſtood in their integrity; but this they wholly loſt, when they fell: And this is the only thing that can be mention'd, pertaining to the Devil's apprehenſion and ſenſe of the divine being, that he did loſe. Nothing elſe belonging to the knowledge of GOD, can be deviſed, that he is deſtitute of. It has been obſerved, that there is no one attribute of the divine nature, but what he is ſenſible of, and knows, and has a ſtrong and very affecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of; and this I think is evident, and undeniable. But the ſupreme beauty of the divine nature, he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether blind to: He ſees no more of it, than a man born perfectly blind does of colours. The great ſight he has of the attributes of GOD, gives him an idea, and ſtrong ſenſe of his awful majeſty, but no idea of his beauty and comlineſs. Tho' he has ſeen ſo much of GOD's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of power, wiſdom, holineſs, juſtice and truth, and his wonderful works of grace to mankind, this ſo many thouſand years, and has had occaſion to obſerve them with the ſtrongeſt attention: Yet all ſerves not to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023344_0037_0FBF082153F1BA68"/>
give him the leaſt ſenſe of his divine beauty. And tho' the Devils ſhould continue to exerciſe their mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mind, with the ſtrongeſt intention; and ſhould take things in all poſſible views, in every order and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet they never will ſee this. So little akin, is the knowledge they have to this, that the great degrees of that knowledge, bring them no nearer to it. Yet, the more knowledge they have of GOD, of that kind, the more do they hate GOD. That wherein the beauty of the divine nature, does moſt eſſentially conſiſt, viz. his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or moral excellency, appears in their eyes furtheſt from beauty: 'Tis on that very account chiefly that he appears hateful to 'em. The more holineſs they ſee in him, the more hateful he appears: The greater their ſight is of his holineſs, the higher is their hatred of him raiſed. And becauſe of their hatred of his holineſs, they hate him the <hi>more,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> they ſee of his other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. They would hate a holy being, whatever his other attributes were; but they hate ſuch a holy being the worſe, for his being infinitely wiſe, and infinitely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more than they would do, if they ſaw in him leſs power, and leſs wiſdom.</p>
               <p>The wicked, at the day of judgment, will ſee every thing elſe in CHRIST, but his beauty and amiableneſs. There is no one quality or property of his perſon, that can be thought of, but what will be ſet before them, in the ſtrongeſt light at that day, but only ſuch as conſiſt in this. They will ſee him coming in the clouds of Heaven, <hi>in power, and great glory, in the glory of his father.</hi> They will have that view of his external glory, which is vaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what we can have any imagination of: And they will have the ſtrongeſt and moſt convincing demonſtrations of all his attributes and perfections. They will have a ſenſe of his great majeſty, that will be, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely affecting to them. They ſhall be made to know effectually, <hi>that he is the Lord.</hi> They ſhall ſee what he is, and what he does: His nature and works, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſtrongeſt view. But his holy and infinite beauty
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023344_0038_0FBF0822B678C748"/>
and amiableneſs, which is all in all, and without which every other quality and property is nothing, and worſe than nothing, they will ſee nothing of.</p>
               <p>Therefore, 'tis a ſight or ſenſe of this, that is the thing, wherein does fundamentally conſiſt, the difference between thoſe things in which the ſaving grace of GOD's ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and the experiences of Devils and damned ſouls. This is the foundation of every thing elſe that is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in true Chriſtian experience. This is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the faith of GOD's elect. This gives the mind a ſaving belief of the truth of divine things. 'Tis a view of the excellency of the things exhibited in the goſpel, or ſenſe of the divine beauty, and amiableneſs of the ſcheme of doctrine there exhibited, that ſavingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the mind, that it is indeed divine, or of GOD. This account of the matter is plainly implied: 2. Cor. iv. 3, 4. <hi>But if our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt; in whom the GOD of this world hath blinded the minds of them that BELIEVE NOT; leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>who is the image of</hi> GOD, <hi>ſhould ſhine into them.</hi> And, v. 6. <hi>For</hi> GOD, <hi>who commandeth the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of</hi> GOD, <hi>in the face of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. 'Tis very evident that a ſaving belief of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, as ariſing from a view of the divine glory or beauty of the things it exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its. 'Tis by this view, that the ſoul of a true convert is enabled ſavingly, to ſee the ſufficiency of CHRIST for his ſalvation. He that has his eyes open'd to behold the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſuperlative beauty and lovelineſs of JESUS CHRIST, is convinced of his ſufficiency, to ſtand as a mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, a guilty, Hell-deſerving wretch, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely holy GOD, in an exceeding different manner than ever he can be convinced by all the arguments that are made uſe of, by the excellent authors or preachers.</p>
               <p>When he once comes to ſee CHRIST's divine lovelineſs, he wonders no more that he is thought worthy by GOD the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023344_0039_0FBF08242E167E10"/>
father, to be accepted for the vileſt ſinner. Now it is not difficult for him to conceive, how the blood of CHRIST ſhould be eſteem'd by GOD ſo precious, as to be worthy to be accepted as a compenſation for the greateſt ſins. The ſoul now properly ſees the preciouſneſs of CHRIST, and ſo does properly ſee and underſtand the very ground and reaſon of his acceptableneſs to GOD, and the value GOD ſets on his blood, obedience and interceſſion. This ſatisfies the poor guilty ſoul, and gives it reſt; when the fineſt and moſt elaborate diſcourſes, about the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of CHRIST, and ſuitableneſs of the way of ſalvation, would not do it. When a man then comes to ſee the proper foundation of faith and affiance, with his own eyes, then he believes ſavingly. <hi>He that ſeeth the ſon, and believeth on him, hath everlasting life.</hi> John vi 40. when CHRIST thus <hi>MANIFESTS GOD's NAME</hi> to men, then <hi>they believe that all things whatſoever</hi> GOD <hi>has given to</hi> CHRIST <hi>are of him, and believe that</hi> CHRIST <hi>was ſent of</hi> GOD. John xvii. 6, 7, 8. And <hi>they that thus know</hi> CHRIST's <hi>name will trust in him.</hi> Pſ. ix 10. In order to true faith in JESUS CHRIST, the ſon of GOD, is REVEAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED IN MEN. Gal. i. 15, 16. And 'tis this ſight of the divine beauty of CHRIST, that bows the wills, and draws the hearts of men. A ſight of the greatneſs of GOD in his attributes, may overwhelm men, and be more than they can endure; but the enmity and oppoſition of the heart, may remain in its full ſtrength, and the will remain inflexible; whereas, one glimpſe of the moral and ſpiritual glory of GOD, and ſupreme amiableneſs of JESUS CHRIST, ſhining into the heart, overcomes and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes this oppoſition, and inclines the ſoul to CHRIST, as it were, by an omnipotent power: So that now, not only the underſtanding, but the will, and the whole ſoul receives and embraces the Saviour. This is moſt certainly the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, which is the firſt internal foundation of a ſaving faith in CHRIST, in the ſoul of the true convert; and not on having of it immediately ſuggeſted and revealed to the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023344_0040_0FBF0825BAFA82C0"/>
ſoul, by a text of ſcripture, or any immediate outward or inward witneſs, that CHRIST loves <hi>him,</hi> or that he died for <hi>him in particular,</hi> and is <hi>his</hi> ſaviour; ſo begetting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and joy, and a ſeeming love to CHRIST, becauſe he loves him: By which ſort of faith and converſion, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrably vain and counterfeit) multitudes have been deluded. The ſight of the glory of GOD, in the face of JESUS CHRIST, works true ſupreme love to GOD: This is a ſight of the proper foundation of ſupreme love to GOD, viz. The ſupreme lovelineſs of his nature; and a love to him on this ground, is truly above any thing that can come from a meer principle of ſelf-love, which is in the hearts of Devils, as well as men. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets true ſpiritual and holy joy in the ſoul, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed joy in GOD, and glorying in him, and not rejoicing in ourſelves.</p>
               <p>This ſight of the beauty of divine things, will excite true deſires and longings of ſoul, after thoſe things; not like the longings of Devils, or any ſuch forced deſires, as thoſe of a man in great danger of death, after ſome bitter medicine, that he hopes will ſave his life; but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural free deſires, the deſires of appetite; the thirſtings of a new nature; as a new-born babe deſires the mother's breaſt; and as the hungry man longs for ſome pleaſant food he thinks of; or as the thirſty hart pants after the cool and clear ſtream.</p>
               <p>This ſenſe of divine beauty, is the firſt thing in the actual change made in the ſoul, in true converſion, and is the foundation of every thing elſe belonging to that change; as is evident by thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 18. <hi>But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Truly gracious affections and exerciſes of mind dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from ſuch as are counterfeit, which ariſe from no higher principles than are in the hearts of Devils, in their tendency: And that in theſe two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:023344_0041_0FBF0843665EDC58"/>(1.) They are of a tendency and influence very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which was eſpecially the Devil's ſin, even pride. That pride was in a peculiar manner the Devil's ſin, is manifeſt from 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 6. <hi>Not a Novice left, being lifted up with pride, he fell into the condemnation of the Devil.</hi> Falſe and deluſive experiences evermore tend to this; tho' oftentimes under the diſguiſe of great and extraordinary humility. Spiritual pride, is the prevailing temper, and general character of hypocrites, deluded with falſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and affections. They are in general, of a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directly contrary to thoſe two things belonging to the Chriſtian temper, directed to by the Apoſtle; the one in <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 16 <hi>Be not wiſe in your own conceit</hi>; and the other in <hi>Philip.</hi> ii. 3. <hi>Let each eſteem others better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Falſe experience is conceited of itſelf, and affected with itſelf. Thus he that has falſe humility, is much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to think, how he is abaſed before GOD: He that has falſe love, is affected, when he thinks of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his love. The very food and nouriſhment of falſe experience, is to view itſelf, and take much notice of itſelf; and it's very breath and life is to talk much of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or ſome way to be ſhewing itſelf. Whereas truly gracious views and affections, are of a quite contrary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: They nouriſh no ſelf-conceit; no exalting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the man's own righteouſneſs, experience, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; no high conceit of his humiliations. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to no oſtentation, nor ſelf-exaltation, under any diſguiſe whatſoever. But that ſenſe of the ſupreme, holy beauty and glory of GOD and CHRIST, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them, and that only, mortifies pride, and truly humbles the ſoul. It not only cuts off ſome of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt branches (cauſing many branches to grow out, where but one was before) but it ſtrikes at the very root of pride; it alters the very nature and diſpoſition of the heart. The light of GOD's beauty, and that alone, truly ſhews the ſoul its own deformity, and effectually incline it to exalt GOD, and abaſe itſelf.</p>

Theſe gracious exerciſes and affections, differ from the other in their tendency, to deſtroy Satan's intereſt. 1ſt In the perſon himſelf, in their tendency, to cauſe the ſoul to <hi>hate every evil, and falſe way,</hi> and to produce uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal holineſs of heart and life; diſpoſing him to make the ſervice of GOD, and the promoting his glory, and the good of mankind, the very buſineſs of his life. Whereas thoſe falſe diſcoveries and affections, have not this effect. There may indeed, be great zeal, and a great deal of what is called religion; but it is not a truly Chriſtian zeal; 'tis not a being zealous of good works: Their Religion is not the ſervice of GOD; 'tis not a ſeeking and ſerving GOD; but indeed, a ſeeking and ſerving themſelves. Tho' there may be a change of life, 'tis not a change from every wicked way, to a uniform Chriſtian life and practice; but only a turning the ſtream of corruption from one channel to another. Thus the Apoſtle James diſtinguiſhes, in our context, a true faith, from the faith of Devils: James ii. 19, 20. <hi>Thou believeſt there is one</hi> GOD. <hi>The Devils alſo believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that ſaith without works is dead?</hi> And thus the Apoſtle John diſtinguiſhes true communion with GOD. 1. John i. 6, 7. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of</hi> CHRIST <hi>cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> By this he diſtinguiſhes true ſpiritual knowledge, Chap ii. 3, 4. <hi>Herely we do know, that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> And hereby the ſame Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes true love. Chap. iii. 18, 19. <hi>Let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed,</hi> [<hi>in work,</hi> as the word ſignifies] and in truth. <hi>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him.</hi>

               <p>But it is not ſo with true Religion, in it's genuine beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That, if it prevails in great power, will doubtleſs excite the rage of the Devil, and many other enemies of Religion: However, it gives great advantage to its friends, and exceedingly ſtrengthens the cauſe; and tends to convince or confound enemies. True Religion, is a divine light in the ſouls of the ſaints; and as it ſhines out in the converſation before men, it tends to induce others to glorify GOD. There is nothing like it, (as to means) to awaken the conſciences of men, to convince infidels, and to ſtop the mouths of gainſayers. Tho' men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hate the power of Godlineſs; yet, when they ſee the fruits of it, there is a witneſs in their conſciences in its favour. <hi>He that ſerveth</hi> CHRIST <hi>in righteouſneſ, and peace, and joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Holy Ghost, is acceptable to</hi> GOD, <hi>and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of man.</hi> Rom. xiv. 17, 18. The prevailing of true Religion, ever tends to the honour of Religion in the world; tho' it commonly is the occaſion of great perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. 'Tis a ſure thing, the more it appears, and is exemplified in the view of the world, the more will its honour, and the honour of its author be advanced.— Philip. i. 11. <hi>Being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs; which are by</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>unto the glory and praiſe of</hi> GOD.</p>
