            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSAL. XXX. 11, 12.</bibl>
               <q>Thou haſt turned for me my mourning into danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thou haſt put off my ſackcloth, and girded me with gladneſs: To the end that my glory may ſing praiſe to thee, and not be ſilent; O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is a pſalm or ſong of praiſe to God, compoſed (as the title of the pſalm expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it) by David at the dedication of his houſe: But the pſalm is taken up in the recounting the troubles and fears, difficulties and dangers he had been in; and the merciful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of divine providence for his deliverance out of them. And if we would have our hearts truly and thoro'ly affected with divine goodneſs, and our lips opened wide in devout praiſes to God, we muſt look back to the troubles, the fears, the dangers and diſtreſſes we have been in, and from which God has delivered us: For the greatneſs of a mercy is according to the degree
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010230_0005_0F7DB59BF23D4848"/>
of evil, miſery or calamity we are delivered from. — This was the way by which the pſalmiſt's ſoul was elevated in high devotion, his heart inlarged in gratitude, and his lips opened wide in praiſe to God. — It ſhould ſeem he had not only been under great difficulties and hazards, by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and by the hand of Saul, who from envy and jealouſy ſought his life; but that he had been brought low, and upon the borders of the grave by ſickneſs: But he cried unto the Lord, and he heard him, and kept him alive that he ſhould not go down into the pit; and he praiſes God, that his anger endured for ſo little a while, but for a moment, and then viſited with his favour which is life: <hi>weeping endured for a night; but joy came in the morning,</hi> 5th v. of the context. In the verſes of our text he obſerves, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful the loving kindneſs of God had been to him in this reſpect; that he had ſcattered the clouds, changed the dark and gloomy ſcenes that had been before him, and had opened ſuch new ſcenes of joy and gladneſs as called for the moſt enlarged gratitude and exalted praiſes. — <hi>Thou haſt turned for me my mourning into dancing:</hi> He went mourning becauſe of the enemy and the oppreſſor, and was full of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becauſe of his ſickneſs, and the threatnings of death: But now his mourning was turned into dancing, his ſpirits were relieved of the heavy burthen that lay upon them: and he felt ſuch a lightneſs and chearfulneſs within upon his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010230_0006_0F7DB59FA0161898"/>
deliverance, as inclined him to dancing and ſuch like tokens of joy. <hi>Thou haſt put off my ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth:</hi> In times of trouble, and when under the mighty hand of God, by ſome ſore judgment or threatning evil, they were wont in token of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to put on ſackcloth. Thus we find David and all the elders of Iſrael, in the time of the Lord's anger, and when threatned with deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, clothed with ſackcloth. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chron. 21. 16.</note> But now God had put off his ſackcloth, had redreſſed his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and removed his grounds of fear. <hi>And girded me with gladneſs,</hi> That is, ſo delivered him, ſo relieved and revived his ſpirit, as not only gave him peace and calmneſs of mind, but cauſed great joy and gladneſs of heart to him. <hi>He girded</hi> him with gladneſs. He compaſſed him about with gladneſs as with a girdle on every ſide. His ſoul was filled with joy: and gladneſs appeared all about him, in his countenance, in his ſpeech, and in his whole behaviour. His troubles were removed, his burthens were taken off, his fears all vaniſhed, and ſo he was all joy and gladneſs. <hi>To the end that my glory may ſing praiſe to thee, and not be ſilent.</hi> That is, that his tongue might ſpeak and ſing the praiſes of God, and not ſuffer ſuch mercies to paſs in ſilence and without a due acknowledgment of them. God delivered him from all his troubles, and from all that was his fear, and girded him with gladneſs, with this view that David might ſee
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010230_0007_0F7DB5A0747C8DD0"/>
the power and goodneſs of God herein and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate his praiſes. <hi>O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever.</hi> He had ſuch a ſenſe of the divine goodneſs, while he was thus girded with gladneſs, that he was not only for ſinging and ſpeaking forth the praiſes of God for the preſent; but was for maintaining an abiding ſenſe hereof upon his heart, ſo as ſhould be an inexhauſtible fund for everlaſting praiſe. The pſalmiſt had ſuch a ſtrong and lively ſenſe of the ſalvations and deliverances he had of late receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it ſeemed to him that he ſhould never forget the ſame: But that the remembrance hereof would be ſo freſh and ſtrong upon his mind, that he ſhould feel an heart, and find a tongue to celebrate his praiſes forever, and ever.</p>
            <p>The words thus largely opened afford us the following obſervations, which I hope will appear ſeaſonable for our preſent meditation on the great and glorious occaſion of our being this day together in the houſe of God. —</p>
            <p n="1">1 OBS. <hi>The great God has the abſolute go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our affairs and circumſtances in the world, and opens the various ſcenes of life to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 OBS. <hi>It is the will of God, and what he has in view, when he changes the ſcene in favour of his people, that they ſhould not be ſilent, but ſhould awake their glory to ſpeak and ſing his praiſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is what we are taught in the text, and which is acknowledged to his glory. David paſſed thro' very various ſcenes of life, ſometimes he was mourning in ſackcloth: and then he was girded with gladneſs; both which he aſcribes to God. <hi>Thou</hi> hideſt thy face and I was troubled, 7th v. <hi>Thou</hi> haſt alſo girded me with gladneſs, as in the text. And this is a glorious character which God aſſumes to himſelf. <hi>I even I am He and there is no God with me; I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah 45. 7.</note>.—</p>
            <p>Here let me ſay,</p>
            <p>1ſt. <hi>Whatever ſorrowful, afflicted or threatning circumſtances we are at any time under, it is by the over-ruling providence of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall there be any evil in the city,</hi> that is evil of affliction, <hi>and the Lord hath not done it</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Amos. 3 0.</note> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are afflicted with bodily pains and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "He is chaſtned with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010230_0009_0F7DB5A2B7EB6248"/>
his ſoul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the deſtroyers" <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 23. 19 22.</note>. And he is ready to ſay with Hezekiah when threatned with death by reaſon of the diſeaſe that was upon him, "I ſaid in the cutting off my days I ſhall go to the gates of the grave: I ſhall not ſee the Lord in the land of the living: I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world: He will cut me off with pining ſickneſs" <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah 38. 10, 11, 12.</note>. Sometimes God reduces to ſtraits, poverty and famine: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he deprives of the deareſt friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and with them takes away the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable enjoyments and the ſweeteſt comforts of life, and gives them to complain with the pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <note n="‡" place="bottom">88 Pſalm 18.</note> "Lover and friend haſt thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkneſs." Sometimes God hides the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and they are troubled: and while they ſuffer God's terrors they are even diſtracted. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God ſo over-rules or permits it to be, that a people's rights and privileges are invaded, and infringed, they are greatly oppreſſed, and bro't into ſlavery, or are under the fearful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it. How did God over-rule as to his people Iſrael, that they ſhould be ſo many years in the land of Egypt, and in the houſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage! And how often did God afterwards, when ſettled in their own land, for their ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures from him, ſell them into the hands of their enemies, who cruelly oppreſſed them!
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010230_0010_0F7DB5A37220CB50"/>
Sometimes ſuch a ſevere hand was kept over them by thoſe who had them in ſubjection, that they were not allowed, ſo much as a blackſmith in all Iſrael, leſt they ſhould make ſwords and ſpears, or any ſuch weapons of defence, nor ſo much as their huſbandry tools <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam 13. 19.</note>. Or if a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not actually brought into ſuch a bondage as this; yet any approaches towards, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch infringements, may well cauſe grief and fear, ſorrow and mourning, in token of which they were wont in ancient time to put on ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. Thus Mordecai clothed himſelf with ſackcloth when that cruel edict of Ahaſuerus came out againſt the Jews. <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph 4 2, 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And what a ſorrowful, diſturbed and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſtate have all the Britiſh colonies of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica been in, when by a late parliamentary act, many of the privileges and liberties we had been in the quiet poſſeſſion of, were cut ſhort: and ſhould the act have continued, we ſhould not have been the free people that once we were, and ſhould have been ſubject to ſuch oppreſſions as our fathers knew nothing of; and which neither we nor our children would have been able to bear.</p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>Whenever the dark ſcene is changed, and a more agreable one opens to us; it is God that does it for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou</hi> haſt turned for me, my mourning into dancing. <hi>Thou</hi> haſt put off my ſackcloth, and

girded me with gladneſs. That is, the great God changes the ſcene, and gives us occaſion for joy and gladneſs, and leads us to all the natural outward expreſſions thereof.</p>
            <p>Joy and ſorrow are human paſſions, and one or the other is excited, according to the different ſcenes God in his providence opens to us. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and fears, of themſelves, beget ſorrow and mourning: But the removal of real afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſcattering our fears, and putting us into agreable circumſtances, begets a joy and gladneſs of heart. And this joy is excited more or leſs according or in proportion to the occaſion. If it be a ſore calamity, and a very grievous burden we are delivered from, or if it be at ſuch a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſeaſon when the danger is imminent and very threatning, and our fears run high; remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a calamity, and ſcattering ſuch fears as are gathering into diſtreſs and horror, creates ſo much the greater joy and gladneſs: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the trouble, or the fear is ſo great and preſſing upon the mind, that the ſudden removal of the ſame excites a joy and gladneſs beyond what we can expreſs: The ſalvation may be ſo great, and ſo ſenſibly affect the mind, that men of ſtrong paſſions, are ſometimes thrown into rapturous extacies of joy.—There is a joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
            <p>And how is God now turning our mourning into dancing, putting off our ſackcloth and gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with gladneſs, by the joyful and well
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010230_0012_0F7DB5A79B902318"/>
atteſted news from that far, but mother country, which aſſures us that the grievous and bitter ACT which put us into mourning, covered us with ſackcloth, and threw us all into confuſion, is now REPEALED, <hi>totally repealed,</hi> made null and void, by the KING, LORDS, and COMMONS, in parliament aſſembled; ſo as to be as if it had never been!</p>
            <p>Oh! with what joy and gladneſs does it gird every true-born Engliſhman, every friend to liberty, and every true lover of his country, his mother country or theſe Britiſh colonies! what joy does now fill every breaſt, what gladneſs appears in every face and feature! and how does every one feel himſelf ready to burſt forth in loud acclamations of joy!</p>
            <p>But to exhilerate your ſpirits, and excite your joys in a rational manner, and as becomes men of thought and judgment; who would always govern this very paſſion of the ſoul by ſolid and ſubſtantial reaſon; I ſay, in order to this, let us only conſider the deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the nation and all theſe colonies muſt have been in; if the government at home had eſtabliſhed the ACT, and proceeded to the inforcement of the ſame. If theſe had been the heavy tidings from home, that the parliament inſiſted upon the rigorous execution of this <hi>act</hi> in all the American plantations, and that in order to it <hi>fleets</hi> were forming, <hi>forces</hi> raiſing, and a grand armament preparing, to inforce obedience
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010230_0013_0F7DB5A855F72F28"/>
to the ACT. I ſay if theſe had been the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tidings, Oh what grief, what fear, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and confuſion, ſhould we have been put into! what anger and wrath, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, what oppoſition, what force, what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence would this irritated people have gone into! what deſolation, what ſlaughter, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed might have been expected! — And what an unſpeakable hurt muſt it have brought upon us, and upon our mother country! what an alienation of affection, what an interruption of mutual trade and commerce deſtructive to them as well as to us!</p>
            <p>Moreover, How would they and we be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our watchful and perfidious enemies, who would ſuddenly and eagerly have catch'd at ſuch a favourable opportunity to make repriſals upon us! —</p>
            <p>Surely when we conſider the very extenſive as well as pernicious influence of this ACT, how deeply it would affect the nation as well as the colonies: and what contention and ill blood, yea, what violence, and ſhedding of blood, what deſtruction, and deſolation is happily prevented by the repeal of this act: Every one who loves his neighbour, who is concerned for the public peace and ſafety, or that has any humanity, or bowels of compaſſion, muſt be glad and rejoice at this merciful deliverance.</p>
            <p>But then by the repeal of this oppreſſive act, there is a poſitive good accruing, that may ſerve
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010230_0014_0F7DB5A8B5F17A90"/>
further to excite the joy, and increaſe the gladneſs of our hearts. This ſerves to indear the KING (if poſſible) yet more and more to us, and fill us with gratitude as well as loyalty to him, and to his royal houſe, and will induce this people with all freedom to ſacrifice their very lives and fortunes for the ſupport and defence of his crown and dignity.</p>
            <p>This alſo will maintain within us a juſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for, and dutiful regard to the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the ſupreme legiſlative power of the nation, who heard our cauſe and redreſſed our grievances.</p>
            <p>This alſo will fix upon our hearts a moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance of thoſe wiſe and worthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, who heartily eſpouſed and ſo ſtrenuouſly pleaded our cauſe, and ſet things in ſo clear and convincing a light, as to procure the repeal of ſuch a diſagreable and deſtructive act. Theſe great and good men, I ſay, who have exerted themſelves according to their ſuperior abilities, and their inviolable attachment to juſtice, truth and liberty in our behalf, will be remembred with honor, love and gratitude, and their memory bleſſed we hope in future generations.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by reaſon of this happy repeal, love and affection between the mother country and us, will return with its wonted ardor: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and trade will be carried on with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer freedom, to the mutual advantage of both them and us. And we ſhall be ready upon every
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010230_0015_0F7DB5A9803D1C88"/>
occaſion to ſtrengthen one another's hands for mutual ſafety againſt the common enemy. And it gives the moſt pleaſing proſpect of the growing greatneſs of the Britiſh empire. So that all who love the peace and proſperity of the nation and all its dependencies; and are pleaſed to ſee ſo ſweet and pleaſant a thing as brethren dwelling together in unity and love; muſt needs rejoice and be exceeding glad at this happy turn of times, as one of the moſt diſtinguiſhing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive bleſſings of an outward nature that we ever received.</p>
            <p n="2">2 OBS. <hi>It is the will of God, and what he has in view, when he changes the ſcene in favour of his people, that they ſhould not be ſilent; but ſhould awake their glory to ſpeak and ſing his praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the end that my glory may ſing praiſe to thee and not be ſilent.</hi> The great God will have us not only glad and joyful for any agreable and happy turn of affairs; but would have us alſo thankful. Many people are glad at the good news, and agreable change of affairs; but not thankful. They feel a pleaſing ſenſation within; but no due ſenſe of God, or religious acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of him. Whereas, this is what God expects and requires of us as men, and chriſtians. <hi>He girds me with gladneſs, to the end that my glory may ſing praiſe to him, and not be ſilent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the pſalmiſt's glory ſome underſtand his <hi>ſoul,</hi> his rational and intellective powers, which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010230_0016_0F7DB5AA366A2148"/>
are indeed the glory of the man. But others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it rather of his <hi>tongue,</hi> as <hi>ſinging</hi> and <hi>not keeping ſilence</hi> mentioned in the text are appropriate to the tongue.</p>
            <p>Let us take them together; reaſon, religion and ſpeech are the diſtinguiſhing glory of man above every creature upon the footſtool: and this glory taking it collectively, is not to be <hi>ſilent</hi> when we receive any ſignal favours from God; but to ſhew forth his praiſe. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greatneſs of benefits received, with all the great and happy conſequences thereof. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is to view the great God as the author, and giver of every good thing, and to obſerve the great and the undeſerved goodneſs of God, in all the merciful and powerful interpoſitions of his providence; and the tongue is to ſpeak and ſing, and thereby to ſhew forth the praiſes of God.</p>
            <p>And who will ſuffer his glory to be ſilent? who can refrain from meditating upon the great and wonderful things God has done for us, and from having his heart enlarged in thankfulneſs, and his mouth filled with praiſes? Surely reaſon, and religion, and the tongue, ſhould all awake upon this great and joyful occaſion, and not be ſilent.</p>
            <p>We ſhould ſet our <hi>reaſon</hi> to work, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greatneſs, extenſiveneſs, and vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the affair for which we are at this time celebrating the praiſes of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010230_0017_0F7DB5AB12E259C0"/>The <hi>Stamp Act</hi> was very extenſive, not only as to the vaſt variety of articles contained in it; but as to thoſe who were ſubjected to it, and would be very much affected by it. It extended to all the Britiſh ſubjects in America, from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada to Florida, comprehending all the Britiſh Iſlands. Moreover, our reaſon and judgment tells us, that it greatly affected Great-Britain itſelf in all its merchandize and manufacture: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the whole Britiſh empire would have felt the ill-influence of it: and conſequently that the repeal of this act has relieved a multitude of people, and filled many thouſands and millions with joy. For reaſon tells us this is the moſt effectual method of preventing any grievous breach between the mother country, and theſe her colonies; and of preſerving the peace, love, and happy harmony that have ſo long ſubſiſted between us; and of eſtabliſhing the power, wealth and proſperity of all. And ſo in ſhort reaſon tells us, that this is one of the greateſt affairs, as to its influence and conſequences, that has been tranſacted in the nation for many ages. I believe it will be readily yielded, that there has ſcarcely been one thing of ſo great importance to the Britiſh nation and colonies, ſince the <hi>happy revolution</hi> near fourſcore years ago, by King William of glorious memory; as the total repeal of the ſtamp act.</p>
            <p>Now let religion ſpeak, and let us ſet ourſelves to conſider that divine power and influence by <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010230_0018_0F7DB5ABD4C9EE10"/>which this happy repeal has been effected.— Religion teaches us to view the hand of God in every thing. Religion teaches us that by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine permiſſion that oppreſſive act was paſs'd, by which God hid his face from us, teſtified his anger, and let us ſee what our ſins deſerved: and that it is of his undeſerved mercy, and thro' his all governing influence, that it is now repealed.</p>
            <p>We may ſee, and we ought to obſerve, ſo far as we can, the natural means by which things are brought about; but we muſt look above and beyond all human means and natural cauſes, to him <hi>who ſitteth upon the circle of the earth,</hi> and who guides and governs in univerſal nature.</p>
            <p>We may ſee, and we ought with gratitude to obſerve, the wiſdom, the ſagacity, the faithfulneſs, the indefatigableneſs of our generous friends in eſpouſing and ſolliciting our cauſe; and we may ſee the various arguments made uſe of, and the happy influence they had upon the King, and Parliament: But we muſt look thro' all theſe to the great Governor of the world, who has the hearts of Kings, and of all men in his own hands, to change and turn them even as the rivers of water are turned: and ſo religion ſees the hand of God in bringing about this repeal. And the good chriſtian will trace the foot-ſteps of divine providence, ſo far as is plain and obvious, and where it is beyond his penetration, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as the work of the Lord, and regard it as the operation of his hands. Thus the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010230_0019_0F7DB5AC71AA08F8"/>
obſerves the hand of God in that general commotion ſtirred up in the nation when the act was firſt paſſed, and the time of its taking place appointed. The providence of God is alſo to be ſeen in the univerſal uneaſineſs and clamour in all the colonies upon the firſt tidings of it, all as one man riſing up in oppoſition to it; ſuch a union as was never before ſeen in all the colonies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God is to be ſeen in the change of the miniſtry at ſuch a critical and important ſeaſon, and calling ſuch eminently worthy patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots into the adminiſtration, who ſaw the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences of inforcing the ſtamp act, and were (as we underſtand) to a man for the repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And how viſible is the hand of God in raiſing up ſuch wiſe, able and faithful friends and advocates to ſollicit the repeal, and in filling their mouths with ſuch clear, ſtrong and cogent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to convince and perſwade of the abſolute neceſſity of a total repeal. Such as the Duke of Graſton, Marquiſs of Rockingham, Lord Dartmouth, Lord Camden, General Conway, the right Honorable William Dowdeſwell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Sir William Meredith, Sir George Saville, Col. Barre, great and worthy patriots, whom God has raiſed up and honoured as eminent inſtruments of our deliverance. And how viſible is the hand of God, more eſpecially with reſpect to the great, the good, and the excellent Mr. Pitt, that grand <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of true virtue, and of Engliſh liberty,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010230_0020_0F7DB5AF5B5DCC60"/>
and whom God has once, and again raiſed up to be the deliverer of theſe Britiſh colonies from captivity, and ſlavery. I ſay, how remarkable was the kind hand of providence, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his chronical grievous malady of body, his ſoul was inſpired with ſuch a ſacred ardor for his country's ſafety; that he ſurmounted all the difficulties of bodily pain and weakneſs; and appeared in that auguſt aſſembly with all his flannels, and was enabled to utter himſelf with ſuch clearneſs, cloſeneſs, plainneſs and faithfulneſs as carried conviction with it, and had its deſired effect. Religion teaches us that the great God made ſo great a man; formed and fitted him for ſuch eminent ſervices, and uſed and honored him as ſuch a public Saviour to the Britiſh Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Religion teaches us to ſee the great God ſtanding in the congregation of the mighty, and judging among the Gods, preſiding both in the houſe of Commons, and in the houſe of Lords, exciting their attention to the weighty reaſonings, and cauſing them to feel ſuch force and energy therein, as to change their mind, and be inclined to repeal what they ſo lately enacted, being convinced this was the beſt, if not the only way to ſave the nation and its colonies from ruin. Now that majority of Parliament is to be highly honored, for their regard to the public good, that they no ſooner ſaw the dangerous tendency of their late act, but they ſpeedily made it null and void. But as we would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010230_0021_0F7DB5B00C7F2C48"/>
and reſpect every man, that has given his hand or voice for the public ſafety; ſo we would ſee the hand of God in all this remarkable event, from the beginning to the end. For religion will not allow us to attribute any thing to meer chance, but points out the hand of God in the moſt caſual events. In what is there more chance than in votes, and lots? But what ſays the wiſe man? Prov. 16. 33. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap; but the whole determination is of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well now, when reaſon and religion teach us theſe things, what is the tongue, that glory of men to do upon it? Why, be ſure, not to be <hi>ſilent,</hi> but to awake and talk of all his wondrous works, to ſing unto him, and to give praiſe.</p>
            <p>And who will, or who can ſuffer his glory to be ſilent, or refrain from ſhewing forth the praiſes of God for this remarkable glorious inſtance of his goodneſs and mercy? O! how ſhould our lips be opened in the moſt exalted praiſes of God, and ſay he is our God and we will praiſe him, our father's God and we will prepare him an habitation, who has remembred us in our low eſtate, and in the critical hour gave the vote for us! What praiſes are due to almighty God from this people? that he gave us favour in the eyes of the King and of his Miniſtry, and of his Lords and of his Commons, who have redreſſed our grievances, and taken away the heavy yoke, that neither we nor our children would have been able to bear; whereby he has
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010230_0022_0F7DB5B040AFB860"/>
relieved our diſtreſſed minds, removed the gloom that hung upon every face, turned our mourning into dancing, put off our ſackcloth, and girded us with gladneſs. Oh! how then ſhould we <hi>praiſe him with joyful lips, and ſhew forth his praiſe from day to day? I will bleſs the Lord at all times; his praiſe ſhall continually be in my mouth. My ſoul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord, the humble ſhall hear thereof, and ſhall be glad. 0! magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together, and ſay, bleſs the Lord O our ſouls, and forget not all his benefits: Our ſoul is eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler, the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped; our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we muſt employ our tongue, our glory, not only to ſpeak but to ſing his praiſes. This is the language of gratitude and true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>O come let us ſing unto the Lord, let us make a joyful noiſe to the rock of our ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover we find in Ezra's day <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek 3. 11.</note>, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in praiſing the Lord ſhouted with a great ſhout. <hi>Be glad then in the Lord, and rejoice ye righteous, and ſhout for joy all ye that are upright in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 OBS. <hi>The true people of God deſire to keep up ſuch a conſtant ſenſe of divine goodneſs, as to be always diſpoſed to praiſe his name, and to give thanks to him forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010230_0023_0F7DB5B0F6EDFB30"/>
               <hi>O Lord my God! I will give thanks unto thee forever.</hi> A truly grateful people will not content themſelvcs with a few thankful acknowledgments, or in attending the public worſhip of God in a way of praiſe and thankſgiving for an hour or two, or in bonfires and illuminations the evening after; but will labour to retain a grateful ſenſe of divine favours all their life long, and to tranſmit the memory of God's great goodneſs to future generations. This will be the care of a godly and a grateful people, not to forget any of God's benefits; eſpecially ſuch as are public, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and very important; but to preſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of them from generation to generation. <hi>We will not hide them from their children, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the generations to come the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength and his wonderful works which he hath done; that the generations to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their children, that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 78. 4. 6. 7.</note>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the grateful and the gracious ſoul will be for giving thanks to God forever in this world, as he will endeavour that one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall praiſe his works to another, and declare his mighty acts. But then the pious thankful ſoul will praiſe this God forever and ever, in the other world, where all the wonders of divine

goodneſs, and all his ſeaſonable appearances for his church and people will ſo open themſelves to the ſaints, as to fill them with new matter of admiration and praiſe to all eternity.</p>
            <p>How careful ſhould we then be to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the memory of this late ſignal deliverance: and endeavour that God may be praiſed forever and ever upon the account hereof: and when we are ſleeping in the duſt of <hi>death</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not praiſe God, and in the <hi>grave</hi> which cannot celebrate him; our children may riſe up and praiſe him; and ſo from generation to generation. And we wiſh to God there may be ſuch laſting, happy and bleſſed effects of this repeal, as to our religious as well as civil intereſts, as that we and our children may have occaſion for rendering everlaſting praiſes to God in heaven. And if the repeal of this act ſhould be the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing our religious as well as civil liberties, and of tranſmitting pure and undefiled religion to future ages: Oh! what a reſource will it be of perpetual and everlaſting praiſes!</p>
            <p>But then, as we are to keep up a grateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual remembrance of God's great mercy to us, that ſo we might praiſe him forever and ever; ſo it becomes us to keep up a continued grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe worthy honorable patriots whom God has made eminent inſtruments of good unto us. Ingratitude to friends and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors is to be abhorred: and if we would not be ungrateful we may not be forgetful of ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010230_0025_0F7DB5B271AEEEE0"/>
who have been diſtinguiſhingly kind, and good to us: But muſt endeavour to perpetuate their names with honor: that they who riſe up after them, and us, may call them bleſſed. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the juſt is bleſſed: and the righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance. And it is highly juſt and reaſonable, that they who have received ſpecial benefits from the great and the good, ſhould do their part that the memory of ſuch may be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>And as God has in this late dark day, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical juncture, raiſed up powerful friends, and worthy benefactors to us, who by their wiſdom and zeal, their courage, conſtancy and cloſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in our behalf, have procured this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deliverance for us; ſurely we can do no leſs than call them bleſſed, by wiſhing bleſſings of every kind to them and theirs: and not only ſo, but ſhould endeavor that the memory of their good deeds may be handed down with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, not only in the annals of time and hiſtory of the preſent age; but by ſome laſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other.</p>
            <p>And if it was in our power, how agreable would it be to have the glorious Mr. Pitt, and others of the fore-mentioned Worthies, who are avowed enemies of corruption, tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, who are the faſt friends of virtue, and powerful advocates for liberty; at the ſame time lovers of their King, their nation, and all the colonies: I ſay, how agreable would it be to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010230_0026_0F7DB5B5EB23CAF0"/>
have brazen or marble monuments erected, not only to perpetuate their memory; but to let the future ages ſee the truly grateful ſenſe we had of their patriotic goodneſs in the time of it? I don't mean idolatrous images, to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was the ſuperſtition and folly of the ancient heathen, with reſpect to their heroes; but to preſent to future ages the reſemblances of ſuch whom God formed, raiſed up, and made ſuch eminent inſtruments of ſaving the Britiſh Empire from impending ruin.</p>
            <p>All that I have further to add here is, that in our praiſes and thankſgivings to God for this preſent merciful deliverance, we join our humble ſervent prayers that this our tranquility may be lengthened out to future generations; and that; this people may never more be moleſted in ſuch a manner: But that we and ours may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the quiet poſſeſſion of all our conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal rights from age to age. And as the God of our fathers has ſo wonderfully appeared for us at this time, we may confidently hope and truſt he will for time to come, if we walk in his ways, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. And indeed conſidering, how fully this affair was debated in parliament, and the judgment of ſome eminently learned in the law, of both houſes of parliament relative to conſtitutional right, <note n="*" place="bottom">It appears by the public prints, that Lord Camden in the houſe of Lords. and Mr. Pitt in the houſe of Commons, declared the Stamp Act to be unconſtitutional.</note> and taking many other

things into conſideration, we have no ground to fear any thing of this ſort, ſo long as we approve ourſelves loyal ſubjects of king George, and his ſucceſſors in the Britiſh throne; and yield all due ſubjection to the Britiſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>And, as the Jews of old, when they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the cruel edict of the king for their deſtruction, were filled with gladneſs and praiſe, and kept up an anniverſary ſolemnity in joyful remembrance of their deliverance, which was a <hi>day of gladneſs and feaſting, a good day, and of ſending portions one to another</hi>

            <p>And as this religious exerciſe will be followed with public rejoicings, and external tokens of joy; let me earneſtly exhort you all, both old and young, high and low, to conduct with all that decency &amp; due decorum, which becomes thoſe who have been in the houſe of God this day, pouring out our devout religious acknowledgments before him; and attending upon the counſels of his word. Let me intreat you, and in the name and fear of God, let me charge you in all your mirth to refrain from every thing that is <hi>profane;</hi> from every thing that is <hi>rude</hi> or <hi>unſeemly;</hi> from every thing that is <hi>intemperate</hi> and contrary to the rules of ſobriety; and from every thing that

is <hi>miſchievous</hi> or hurtful to the perſons or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of others.</p>
            <p>And let me further caution you againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging your rejoicing in a way of triumph or inſult upon any perſons at home (for I know of none among ourſelves) who have appeared zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous promoters of the act which is now aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And that you avoid every thing that is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rirating or provoking to mens ſpirits; or that tends to beget ill-will: For we know of no man, but whoſe help and good-will we may ſometime or other have occaſion for. Finally here let me adviſe you to break up your diverſions in good ſeaſon, and return every one quietly to his place of abode: And may every thing be conducted with ſo good order, and with ſuch innocency of behaviour as becomes the diſciples of Chriſt, who joy in the Lord, and when they greatly rejoice, it is in the God of their ſalvation. And if theſe external rejoicings flow from, or are accompanied with true gratitude to the God of heaven, who has appeared for our help, it will be a token of farther good.</p>
            <p>Let me add one word more and have done; and that is, that we <hi>pay all due reſpect to the civil magiſtrate,</hi> and a willing ſubjection to the government over us, whether ſupreme or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate. Let us conſider the true deſign of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is the <hi>good of the community;</hi> and fixing this in our mind as a firm principle, it will ſerve very much to direct, and regulate as

to all exertions of power, as well as to our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubmiſſion thereunto. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you the apoſtolic advice, 1 Pet. 2. 13— 17. <hi>Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake,</hi> that is, to every conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional ordinance of man that is not repugnant to the ſuperior law of God and nature; <hi>whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well: For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men: As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs; but as the ſervants of God. Honor all men, love the brotherhood; fear God and honor the King,</hi> PRAYING <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for Kings, and for all in authority, and that you yourſelves may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now bleſſed be the Lord who hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad: Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who <hi>only</hi> doth wondrous things, and bleſſed be his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name forever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. AMEN, and AMEN.</p>
