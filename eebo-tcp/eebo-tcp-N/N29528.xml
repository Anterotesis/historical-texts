            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Religion, and many afforded Five Thousand Seven, Eight, Nine, Twelve, Thirteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand a piece. However, in the midst of these <hi>Martyrdoms,</hi> the Almighty Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, so disposed the Hearts of men to Serve Him, that above Two Thousand One Hundred and Fifty Churches were Gathered; in many of which, there were above Ten Thousand Communicants; yea, persons of the Highest Quality Espoused their Cause; <hi>Princes</hi> did submit unto the Golden Scepter of the Messiah, in their <hi>Holy Discipline;</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> became the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of their Churches.</p>

which it liveth.</hi> Behold! now, those Threatned <hi>Vials of the Wrath of God,</hi> poured out!</p>
            <p>It was by the Loyalty of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> that the present French King, obtained the Quier Possession of his Crown; and their Adversaries at the Court, made the very Services of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> unto their King an Argument &amp; Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for their Destruction. The Popish Clergy suggested, That if the Protestants were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, as to Save the State from Ruine, they might as easily Ruine the State at another Time, in siding with its Enemies. An Extirpation of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was hereupon Resolved; and the most horrible and barbarous things that can be imagined, wore after the year 1660. done, in pursuance of this Resolution. All the Cruelties and Butcheries perpetrated by the Children of <hi>Cain,</hi> in former Ages, hardly equal, the <hi>Persecution,</hi> which now sell upon the Reformed, like an irresistible Tempest: The Characters of such a <hi>Persecution,</hi> animated by the most Exalted <hi>Spirit of Hell,</hi> are too terrible to be described, otherwise, than as the Painter Portray'd the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> besmearing his whole Table with Blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reformed</hi> saw, their great Idol, breaking the publick <hi>Faith</hi> unto them, in all possible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; Their <hi>Temple</hi> one after another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish'd; Their <hi>Pastors</hi> Banish'd; every <hi>Office</hi> Tendred inaccessible to them; and <hi>Justice</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

'em, even in all the common Rights of Humanity it self. When the project was grown ripe for it, the <hi>Leviathan</hi> at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> Turn'd loose a vast Army of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> upon those Flocks of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> whom the Foregoing Temptations had not conquered. The Leaders of those <hi>New Apostles,</hi> first Summoned the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the several Towns together, to let 'em know, 'Twas the Kings pleasure, they should all Turn <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> The poor people Humbly Replied, <hi>They would gladly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their Lives and Estates in the Service of their King, but their Consciences could be at the Dispose of none but the Great God alone.</hi> These <hi>Dragons</hi> then furiously possessed themselves of the several Towns, and were every where Quartered in the Houses of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> like <hi>Locusts</hi> devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before them. When these Devourers, had first wasted the <hi>Estates</hi> of this Distressed people of God, they then fell upon their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> After the most Bitter Execrations, these direful Tormentors, would multiply Torments upon the <hi>Martyrs</hi> now in their fierce Hands, whereof, even the <hi>General Kinds,</hi> could not in many pages be Enumerated. They would hang up the good people, by their Feet, and making of great Smokes under them, almost choak them: If then the Sufferers would not sign an <hi>abjuration,</hi> they toss'd them to and fro into great <hi>Fires,</hi> till they were nigh <hi>Roasted;</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039330_0006_10146C5D6E406888"/>
somesimes plunge them down into deep <hi>Wells,</hi> till they were half <hi>Drowned</hi> there. Others they stript Naked, and prick'd 'em with pins, and Nails, and Bodkins, till they could endure no more; and others they drag'd about, by the <hi>Noses,</hi> with <hi>Pincers</hi> holding of them. Some they kept Waking, by cruel <hi>Pinches,</hi> and <hi>Noises,</hi> for many Dayes and Nights together, till they utterly thereby lost their Wits; and others that were sick, they intollerably vexed, with <hi>Drums</hi> continually Beating in their Chambers. They bound the <hi>men</hi> in some Houses, and Ravished their <hi>Wives,</hi> and their <hi>Daughters,</hi> before their Eyes: In others, they pull'd off the <hi>Nails,</hi> and scorched and scalded the <hi>Feet,</hi> of the Saints of God; and used a Thousand other Cruelties, which none but the Wit of <hi>Devils</hi> could have Invented for them. So dismal was the success of this <hi>Draconick Persecution,</hi> that in a little while, the Great <hi>Scourge</hi> who did all this, coin'd Medals, whereon he brag'd, <hi>That he had Reduced no less than Twenty Hundred Thousand Calvinists from the Protestant Religion.</hi> If none of these Cruelties, could conquer the minds of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> they were cast into hideous <hi>Dungeons,</hi> where they pined away to Death. If any did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>Faithful to the Death,</hi> their Dead Bodies, be their <hi>Port, or Sex,</hi> what it would, were Drag'd naked thro' the Streets, and after a thousand Indignities, thrown upon the Dunghils. But
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039330_0007_10146C5F38C95698"/>
if any were caught <hi>Flying away,</hi> there were all possible <hi>Additions</hi> made unto the Cruelties em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, many Thousands of <hi>Protestants</hi> flying away, found a merciful Providence assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Escape:</hi> and some of the <hi>Escaped,</hi> got over to <hi>New-England,</hi> where before they came, there were <hi>Prayers</hi> made with many Solemn <hi>Fastings</hi> for them; and after they came, they met with further Kindnesses, from our Churches.</p>
            <p>Among these <hi>Refugees,</hi> there was one, who became an Inhabitant of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> His Employment was that of a <hi>Sailor;</hi> but Sailing from hence, about four or five years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go he fell into the Hands of his Idolatrous Country men. Those Persecuting Idolaters, immediately required him, to <hi>Go to Mass;</hi> but for his constant Refusal of that Impietie, he hath ever since been undergoing many <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</hi> From the midst of his Miseries, he writes an <hi>Excellent Letter,</hi> unto his Wife, in these parts of the World; a Letter breathing such an <hi>Excellent Spirit,</hi> that many serious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians here, who have heard it Read unto them, have judged it would be a general Advantage unto the Interests of Religion among us, to Translate and Publish it. What I now do in publishing it, I do but as the Incomparable <hi>Jurien,</hi> has done, who very often does insert in his <hi>Pastoral Letters</hi> to the <hi>French Churches,</hi> a Copy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039330_0008_10146C62AFA46170"/>
of such Things as these, newly written by some of their Sufferers, without any fear of adding to their Sufferings; I do it also with the Leave of the <hi>Consistory of Elders</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>Boston:</hi> And I do it, with all due caution and concealment, of any circumstances, that may procure any damage to the poor <hi>Prisoner of the Lord:</hi> There having been a greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard unto his concerns in his own <hi>Writing,</hi> and <hi>Sending</hi> the Letter, than in our thus <hi>Publishing</hi> of it.</p>

               <salute>My Dear Wife.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis is the <hi>sixth</hi> time that I write to you, since the Lord has changed my condition of a <hi>Gally Slave</hi> into that of a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> without having received any of <hi>your</hi> Answers. I am ready to believe that 'tis not your fault, and that you have written as many to <hi>me,</hi> as I have done to <hi>you,</hi> without having received <hi>mine.</hi> The <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> are so great, that we can have no mutual Communications by <hi>Writing:</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>men</hi> are so animated against me, that they employ all their power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to hinder me from receiving any <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Consolations;</hi> and to speak the truth, <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> shews me that herein they succeed; and if they could oblige <hi>God</hi> to deprive me of <hi>Internal Consolation</hi> they would do it with pleasure; but God is <hi>Righteous in all his ways, and full of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in all his works:</hi> as he sees me deprived of all humane relief, he gives in unto me of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi> if his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> will not permit him to leave the <hi>young Ravens</hi> without their food, will his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> abandon a <hi>Soul,</hi> which he had so often hindred from falling into <hi>Hell?</hi> especially after he has made him taste the <hi>First Fruits</hi> and <hi>fore-tasts</hi> of Soveraign Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness?

no, God <hi>forsakes not the works of his hands;</hi> he is faithful and just to accomplish his Promises. Therefore I will say, that in vain they strive to destroy the <hi>work of the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Almighty <hi>Power</hi> of God is too much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested therein, to suffer them to attain the end which they propose, they labour more and more to surmount my <hi>patience,</hi> and conquer my <hi>perseverance,</hi> to the end they might <hi>triumph</hi> over my <hi>Faith;</hi> but alas! I look upon my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with grief of heart, and my <hi>Faith</hi> which is sustained by the <hi>hope of Love,</hi> despises generously the assaults which they make upon it. Nay, <hi>My Dear Wife,</hi> they at present attack me more ardently than ever; the Eternal God exercises me as an <hi>Old Souldier,</hi> altho I am but a <hi>little while</hi> since Listed into his Company. I intend to continue to you the <hi>Journal</hi> of my <hi>Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> since the last <hi>March,</hi> I mean the <hi>abridgment</hi> thereof; for to tell you the whole, I neither can, nor may do, for many reasons. I liv'd pritty quiet in my Prison at the <hi>Cittadelle,</hi> during twenty three, months, wherein I have been alone in a little Chamber. There was under me a poor Believer in a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> with <hi>two chains,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>Sang Psalms</hi> too loud. It was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>I</hi> spake to him; for our Persecutors were not willing that we should hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together. I did however speak to him; but very seldom; for he is a man whom God has
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039330_0014_10146C72EE4083E0"/>
afflicted to the <hi>Loss of common sense.</hi> They came to understand that I spake to him, which obliged my <hi>Overseers</hi> to change my place; but I abode but a little while in this <hi>Second Lodging;</hi> for they perceived that I <hi>Sang</hi> also, and commanded me many times, to be silent, on pain of being put into the <hi>Dungeon;</hi> but I could not obey them. However I <hi>Sang very low;</hi> but the <hi>Cittadelle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countermined, and a great Cistern in the middle of the <hi>Armoury,</hi> the least noise that can be made is heard every where in the Officers Chambers. They then caused me to be put into the <hi>Dungeon;</hi> but I abode there only thirty five days; for the great Provost came to the <hi>Cittadelle,</hi> with two Guards to fetch me and the fore-mentioned poor afflicted person, and brought us hither.</p>
            <p>It is meet that I excite you to bless God with me, <hi>my Dear Heart:</hi> for in the midst of all my troubles the Eternal Exercises an admirable care about all that concerns me. You may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that when I was Aboard the Gally, I employed my self in Copying out some good Sermons, which my Friends gave me. I had about twenty of them, one half whereof I left in an house Ashore, that if they came to search me I might not lose them all at once. In go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>Cittadelle,</hi> they took from me seven of the Sermons, with an <hi>English Bible,</hi> and an Exposition of the Fifty First Psalm in <hi>English,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:039330_0015_10146C75553FA2E0"/>
and another little English Book, all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at the Majors till I came out. As I came out, I asked for them, <hi>they</hi> gave them to the <hi>Provost:</hi> God touched <hi>his</hi> heart; for when I was in the <hi>Boat,</hi> he gave them to me, and as I went into the <hi>Fort,</hi> no one took them from me, tho' they saw them; only they <hi>kick'd</hi> them with their feet; and so they are still with me, by the same goodness of my God. Sing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him, <hi>My dear Wife,</hi> a Song of Praise and Acknowledgment; for our enemies are not willing that we should have either <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Inkborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to continue the Story of my Persecution. They brought me hither, and put me into a little hole on the top of a Tower of the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> where there is a Guard; the window they had plaistred up, that there was only an hole of <hi>four Inches</hi> to let in the <hi>Light</hi> to see to <hi>eat.</hi> I was very ill in that place, but the Devil thought I was too well of it: and indeed I was magnificently accommodated, to what I am at present. I abode there only fifty one days; the twentieth day of <hi>August,</hi> on <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> about ten a Clock in the morning, the Commander came himself, to fetch me out, with my Cloaths. Here I willingly confess my weakness, for I <hi>wept.</hi> The Commander ordered them to search my poor Straw Bed; they did it, but without success for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039330_0016_10146C76EFB39FC8"/>
               <hi>hid</hi> all that was therein, namely, an <hi>English Bible,</hi> a Quire of <hi>Large Paper,</hi> whereof this is some, a Bag, wherein was my <hi>Pocket Bock,</hi> and <hi>Inkborn;</hi> and now, my <hi>Dear Wife,</hi> will you not praise the King of our Souls, who does such strange things? I publish them, to the end God may be blessed for them: for if they had found the fore mentioned things, they would have overwhelmed us with <hi>cruel Afflictions:</hi> the Commander is a man without pitty, who will let us <hi>Blood,</hi> with a <hi>Pistol Shot,</hi> when we are <hi>Sick.</hi> They made me come down from the Tower wherein I was, and go out of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon: this Dangeon is encompassed with a <hi>Dry Ditch;</hi> the Gases of it are a <hi>Draw-Bridge;</hi> there are two great <hi>Towers</hi> at the Entry. After I had passed this <hi>Bridge,</hi> they made me go down by a <hi>Ladder</hi> into the <hi>Ditch,</hi> where they threw all my poor Cloaths. The <hi>Six Souldiers</hi> that conducted me with their Arms, took the <hi>Ladder</hi> and set it up against a Tower, wherein is an hole like a little <hi>Port hole.</hi> This done, they bid me go up thither; and the Officers who were upon the <hi>Bridge,</hi> and Spectators of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> told me, that I must go in, my feet foremost; so that I was fain to crawl in at the hole, the Wall being about <hi>eight foot</hi> thick. I entred into that <hi>charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habitation;</hi> I found my self envelop'd with profound <hi>Darkness;</hi> but the Eternal Created <hi>that,</hi> as well as the <hi>Light,</hi> so that I little matter
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039330_0017_10146C7B2B6BEFB0"/>
it. Now comes a <hi>Second Alarm</hi> for me: my <hi>Straw Bed</hi> could not come in at the hole; the <hi>Straw</hi> was fain to be taken out by little and little, in the presence of the fore mentioned Gentlemen, who look'd down into the <hi>Ditch. Ah! Eternal God,</hi> said I, <hi>thou art my All; as thou art wont to do Wonders, conduct me still, that I may still prosper.</hi> I address'd my self to the Officer who Led me; I declared to him all that was in my <hi>Straw-Bed;</hi> I pray'd him to save all that was there; promising to recompence him; he accepted the <hi>Offer:</hi> he himself empty'd the bed before the Gentlemen; and caus'd it, to be carried up to me by little and little; but he kept a little of the <hi>Straw,</hi> with all my concerns, in my <hi>Straw Bed,</hi> and brought them to me <hi>himself Admire here the Protection of the King of Kings!</hi> A man I am unknown to him, and besides poor, and in Chains; judge if any other than <hi>God</hi> could make such a <hi>charge</hi> in the heart all at once? therefore give <hi>Praises</hi> to God for it; but Praises of <hi>Obedience</hi> as well as or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration. O, My dear Heart,</hi> how many testimonies do I receive of the powerful protection of my God! 'tis this that swallows up my Soul in a River of <hi>chaste delight</hi> in the midst of all the evil they make me suffer; the thought of His Goodness is so much the more sweet, in that he causes it to be <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>sensible,</hi> to the forcing my very <hi>flesh</hi> to glorify him with <hi>joy. This is what cannot be comprehended, unless experienced!</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:039330_0018_10146C7CB8434A30"/>
Here I am then, without <hi>Light,</hi> in a place full of <hi>stinking ordure.</hi> But I undergo a double <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> in having this poor distracted Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with me; for this <hi>two years</hi> he has not comb'd himself: his <hi>hair</hi> is clotted together, full of ordure; he won't change his Linnen which the King allows him: so that he stinks enough to make a man cast up his heart; those that bring us our meat, abhor the <hi>smelt</hi> which is here. I do all that I can to make him shift himself, but he won't be perswaded, nor suffer his <hi>hair</hi> to be cut; notwithstanding they make me <hi>eat</hi> with him, to aggravate my <hi>Servitude.</hi> I confess, I suffer more with <hi>this man,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of him, than by all that my <hi>Enemies</hi> can do unto me; his <hi>stink</hi> is such as cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; but besides this, he now speaks not at all, and 'tis now a long while since he has spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any body; this is the <hi>Sorrowful Society</hi> which the Eternal now gives me, after a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of two years and three months; this man had a <hi>good Wit,</hi> and as is said, was a <hi>Schollar:</hi> but alas! he has only the <hi>Shape</hi> of a man; at the <hi>Cittadelle,</hi> he spake very little, and that which he said, shew'd him to be <hi>crazed;</hi> the Almighty God give us <hi>humble hearts,</hi> that his <hi>Grace</hi> make us not proud; for this is the last Sin that we have to combat with: <hi>Pride</hi> sometimes rises from <hi>vertue</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>Thus you see where I am in the Story of my
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039330_0019_10146A1553ABC440"/>
Sufferings at this day. Now, <hi>My dear Wife,</hi> I pray you to let me know the State of my dear Children, if they be yet alive, and what <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to vertue</hi> are found in them; for tho' they be yet <hi>young,</hi> we may however judge of them by their inclination; and the <hi>Countenance,</hi> which is the <hi>mirrour of the Soul,</hi> oftentimes discovers what we are. I know this rule is not always general, nor do I give it to you as <hi>infallible.</hi> I exhort you to be very careful to give them a <hi>Christian Education:</hi> You should use all diligence to learn them to <hi>read</hi> and <hi>write,</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to God, and <hi>Sing</hi> his Praises. O the <hi>charming Employment</hi> for an heart enamoured with God, to be <hi>Singing his Praises!</hi> Therefore <hi>my dear Heart,</hi> neglect not this; labour to be their <hi>mother a second time,</hi> by endeavouring with all your might, that they may be <hi>Born again by grace:</hi> All the world talk of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> but there are only few that know it by <hi>experience.</hi> Men know how to say that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was gross in his conceptions of it, tho a <hi>Doctor of the Law;</hi> but it often happens that <hi>those</hi> who thus speak, feel the efficacy thereof no better than <hi>he.</hi> Know then, that it is not the corporal or animal life which is renewed, but that of the <hi>Soul;</hi> the affections, desires &amp; thoughts are sanctified. When a person is <hi>Regenerate,</hi> he aims only at the Glory of Christ; the sentiments of the heart are conformed to the light of the Spirit, that is to say, the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>heart</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Behold no less than a <hi>Congregation</hi> of our whole Province, met at this Time, in one GREAT AND GENERAL AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEMBLY. The most Happy and Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tidings, that ever were uttered in any <hi>Assembly</hi> are now to be brought unto YOU, O <hi>Congregation</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Never did any Sinful congregation more want a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to Appease the Exasperated. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of Heaven: Our multiplied So have so provoked the God of Heaven, that <hi>we are

Consumed by his Anger, and by His Wrath we are Troubled:</hi> The offended Majesty of Heaven, is every day Siezing on our <hi>Friends,</hi> and Siezing on our <hi>Fields,</hi> and Siezing on our <hi>Ships,</hi> and Siezing on our <hi>Stores,</hi> and Siezing on our very <hi>Lives,</hi> for Sacrifices. But you are now Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with the Advice, of a Sacrifice for the Congregation; a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> whereto if we do in a right manner Apply our selves, out God will call for no further <hi>Sacrifices</hi> from among us, to Atone His Incensed Majesty: Our <hi>Adversity</hi> will soon be turned into <hi>Prosperity;</hi> and we shall Sing that Song, O <hi>Lord, I will praise thee, for tho' thou wast Angry with me, thine Anger is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thou wilt comfort me.</hi>

                  <hi>What is the Sacrifice provided by God for His People, Collected and Considered in a whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and how may a Congregation obtain the Benefit of that Sacrifice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks, one may see a peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in our <hi>New-English Congregation,</hi> to Invite our most affectionate and Importunate Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto such a <hi>Sacrifice!</hi> The <hi>Sin Offering for the Congregation,</hi> was to be, <hi>Burnt without the Camp:</hi> With regard whereto, the Apostle said, in Heb. 13. 13. <hi>Let us go forth unto Jesus without

               <p>We have <hi>Sinned</hi> against the God that made us, and our Sin loudly and sadly calls for a Sacrifice unto the God against whom we have Sinned.</p>
               <p>The Blessed God hath given a <hi>Law</hi> to His Creatures; and a <hi>Law</hi> Arm'd with a <hi>Penalty.</hi> Without a <hi>Law,</hi> we cannot suppose a <hi>Sin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and without a <hi>Penalty,</hi> we cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Law</hi> significant. If this <hi>Law</hi> be violated, the Just God has obliged Himself, that the <hi>Penalty</hi> of it shall be Executed. The <hi>Punishment</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> is upon this presupposal, become a <hi>Necessary</hi> Thing; 'Tis <hi>Necessarily</hi> expected from that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, who, as we read in Exod. 34. 7 <hi>Will by no means clear the Guilty;</hi> and who, as we read, Psal. 5. 4. <hi>Is not a God that hath Pleasure in wickedness.</hi> The <hi>Natural Conscience</hi> of man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Terrifies him, with such an Expectation;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039330_0024_10146C8B2E0ABE40"/>
God has written it upon the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, with <hi>a Pen of Iron, and a point of a Diamond;</hi> Men that are never so <hi>Barbarous,</hi> are smitten with Apprehensions of a VENGEANCE, that <hi>Sin</hi> must be followed withal.</p>
               <p>But now, the <hi>Subject,</hi> which undergoes the <hi>Punishment</hi> of Sin, is therein made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin. God becomes not Favourable unto the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, until His <hi>Glories,</hi> which have been <hi>Denyed</hi> by <hi>Sin,</hi> be <hi>Displai'd</hi> in such a <hi>Punishment</hi> of Sin, as His <hi>Threatnings</hi> have denounced. Now the <hi>Punishment</hi> of Sin, infers and inflicts DEATH, on the miserable <hi>Subject</hi> which it falls upon. The <hi>Punishment</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> is nothing less than that, in Gen. 2. 17. <hi>Thou shalt surely Dy:</hi> Nothing less than that in Ezek. 18. 4. <hi>The Soul that Sinnneth shall Dy:</hi> Nothing less than that in Rom. 6. 23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death</hi> (just contrary unto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life.</hi>) Such is the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> who is by <hi>Sin</hi> Reproached, Affronted, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and such is the <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Affront,</hi> by <hi>Sin</hi> cast upon that <hi>Infinite Object,</hi> that nothing less than <hi>Destruction</hi> can be a due <hi>Punishment</hi> for it. But This makes a <hi>Sacrifice!</hi> It belongs unto an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice,</hi> to be <hi>Destroy'd:</hi> Such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is nothing else but, <hi>Oblatio rite Consumpta.</hi> A Thing Suffering <hi>Destruction</hi> for Sin, to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, which by Sin ha's been wronged, is therein made a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>

               <head>Conclusion. II.</head>
               <p>There were many <hi>Sacrifices</hi> Appointed and Accepted by the Great God, before the coming of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> but they were of no Account any further, than as they respected the Great Sacrifice of the Messiah to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were made unto God by the Saints of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> but still they were <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> that <hi>God</hi> Himself had <hi>Instituted.</hi> The Custome of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> was practised, by the <hi>First Men</hi> that ever were; and thence Derived unto all Nations of men. Our <hi>First Parents</hi> had their <hi>First Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>Skins;</hi> and there is no doubt, that the <hi>Beasts</hi> from whom the <hi>Skins</hi> were taken, had been Slain for <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> Now, as tis said, in Gen. 3. 21. <hi>The Lord God made Coats of Skins, and Cloathed them:</hi> So tis plain, that <hi>the Lord God</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and therefore He Appointed, the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing</hi> of the Things thus despoiled of their <hi>Skins.</hi> And among all the Sons of these our <hi>First Parents,</hi> the Rite of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> hath been mentained every where, but where the Preaching of the <hi>Gospel</hi> hath Abolish'd it. Had it been a Dictate of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> would not have Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd it, but Continued it, but Confirmed it, but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it. No, It was God Himself, who Appointed the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which Repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then brought unto Him. Tis said of <hi>Abel,</hi> in Heb. 11. 4. <hi>By Faith be effered unto God, a more Excellent Sacrifice.</hi> Had <hi>Sacrifices</hi> been only <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039330_0026_10146C90F3317BE8"/>
Inventions,</hi> they could not have been offered in <hi>Faith,</hi> nor would God have call'd 'em <hi>Excellent.</hi> It may seem an Harsh Doctrine, which the Churches of <hi>New England</hi> have hitherto owned, and the Lord Jesus Christ will <hi>Spue</hi> them out of His <hi>Mouth,</hi> when they shall cease to own it! But it was the Doctrine of the Blessed Martyrs, in the Dayes of the <hi>Marian</hi> Persecution, and of the First and Best <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> They are the very words of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Hooper,</hi> in his <hi>Confession of the Christian Faith; They are not only Idolaters, which Worship and Serve Idols and Strange Gods, but also all those which Worship and Serve the True God of Heaven, after their own Fantasie, or after the Traditions of men, without Faith, without the Word of God, and otherwise than God hath commanded them.</hi> On this Principle [And it is a sound one!] I say, That <hi>Sacrifices</hi> must need be no <hi>Humane Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> no, they were <hi>Divine Institutions.</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safely so ever many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves on this point, <hi>Eusebius of Coesarea,</hi> seems to have better determined it, That the ancient <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were not <hi>Humanely Invented,</hi> but <hi>KATA THEIAN EPINOIAN.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, When God was Recovering the Nation of <hi>Israel,</hi> from the Degeneracy, wherein the other Nations of the World had wofully depraved themselves, He Renewed the command of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing,</hi> with Supernumeracy and Innumerable
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039330_0027_10146C92B0A46098"/>
Ceremonies. Indeed, by the <hi>Edicts</hi> of God unto the Nation of <hi>Israel,</hi> Corporal <hi>Death</hi> was to Ensue upon every <hi>Act of Disobedience.</hi> Now the Lord, who was the Law giver of <hi>Israel,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed that Extremity as to many Offences, and for the Corporal Death of the <hi>Offender,</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Death of the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of what Account were the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> thus <hi>Instituted?</hi> Alas, Tho they were thus <hi>instituted,</hi> yet they were all <hi>Insufficient.</hi> Consult the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Tenth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and you'l see a considerable paragraph in the Word of God, written on purpose to prove them so. Indeed, it was not consistent with the Honour of GOD, for Him to be contented with the <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Beast,</hi> as a sufficient <hi>Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for the <hi>Sin</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi> The Exact <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the Spotless <hi>Purity,</hi> the Infinite <hi>Grace</hi> of God, are to be manifested, in a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our Sin. Was the <hi>Blood</hi> of an abject <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Goat,</hi> any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable manifestation of the <hi>Infinite Perfections</hi> of God? God published His <hi>Will,</hi> in Thunders and Lightnings and Earthquakes, and with mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions or <hi>Angels</hi> which attended the giving of His <hi>Fiery Law.</hi> Shall the Death of a sorry <hi>Brute,</hi> be enough to make amends, for the Rebellion of the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> against that Soveraign <hi>Will?</hi> No man in his wits, can think so despicably of the Divine Majesty. What proportion is there, between the <hi>Sin</hi> of a <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:039330_0028_10146C9519746B20"/>
of an <hi>Irrational Machin?</hi> How can the Butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of contemptible <hi>Cattle</hi> be a compensation, for the Disparagement, that Sin has done to the Almighty GOD, who crtated all the <hi>Cattel upon a thousand Hills?</hi> The most High often Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed His contempt of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in themselves; The people that abounded in <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but look'd not beyond the <hi>Surface</hi> of them, He Rebuked for their <hi>Vain Oblations.</hi> [Consider Isa. 1. 11. &amp; Psal. 40. 6.]</p>
               <p>And I pray, What then were the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for? Our Great <hi>Lord-Redeemer,</hi> was to be made a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> And <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were <hi>Nothing,</hi> any further than they were <hi>Figures</hi> of that <hi>Great Sacrifice.</hi> In the Ancient <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> God would have a Representation of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> where with our Lord Redeemer would, in the Fulness of Time, Reconcile Him unto us. This was the use and scope of the <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> They were but <hi>Christ in a Cloud,</hi> when the <hi>Smoke</hi> of them went up in a <hi>Cloud</hi> before the Lord.</p>

               <p>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who <hi>Knew no Sin,</hi> hath been made a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> a Real, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Erpiatory Sacrifice to God, for our <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There have been two sorts of <hi>Sacrifices; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistical,</hi> and <hi>Expiatory.</hi> None ever Dream't that our Lord was an <hi>Eucharistical Sacrifice:</hi> That and How, He was an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice,</hi> is now
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039330_0029_10146C98A84CB620"/>
to be Declared. If you pursue the Hebrew word, <hi>Phadah,</hi> To <hi>Redeem,</hi> as far as the Arabic, <hi>Fadah,</hi> You'l find, it signifies, <hi>To Devote ones self to Death.</hi> Truly, Twas by <hi>Devoting Himself to Death,</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us, that our Lord Jesus Christ hath <hi>Redeemed</hi> us, For,</p>
               <p>First; All that belonged unto a Real and Proper <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> was <hi>done</hi> to and <hi>found</hi> in our Lord Jesus Christ, when He <hi>Suffered</hi> for us. Particularly; Our Lord Jesus Christ, as God and Man in One Person, as our <hi>Immanuel,</hi> as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> is a Glorious Priest. It is our well-grounded Belief, in Heb. 8. 1. <hi>We have such an High Priest, who is set on the Right Hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the Heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, this Illustrious <hi>Priest,</hi> hath presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, an Offering for us. This <hi>Offering</hi> was, His <hi>Manhood;</hi> An Humane <hi>Body;</hi> as tis said in Heb. 10. 5. <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldest not, but a Body:</hi> And an Humane <hi>Soul;</hi> as tis said in Isa. 53. 10. <hi>His Soul, a Trespass Offering.</hi> Yea, &amp; this was an <hi>Offering</hi> of Gods own <hi>Prescribing</hi> too. An <hi>Offering</hi> that God Himself hath not <hi>Prescribed,</hi> is as a <hi>Dogs Neck,</hi> and a <hi>Swines Blood</hi> unto Him; whereas the <hi>Offering</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is that whereof He could say, as, <hi>Thou, O God, hast prepared it,</hi> so, <hi>Thou, O God, hast prescribed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, there most be an Altar, whereon our <hi>Priest</hi> presented this <hi>Offering.</hi> That <hi>Altar</hi> is His <hi>Godhead.</hi> It is the <hi>Altar,</hi> which <hi>Dignifies</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039330_0030_10146C9B1EC44FF0"/>
                  <hi>Sanctifies</hi> the <hi>Offering.</hi> The <hi>Humanity</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, being taken up into <hi>One Person,</hi> with the <hi>Second Person</hi> in God, the <hi>Worth</hi> of the <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> by its Intimate Relation to that <hi>Person,</hi> is no less than Infinite. The <hi>Blood</hi> that ha's been <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,</hi> is, as in Act. 20. 28. <hi>The Blood of God.</hi> The Life that ha's been <hi>Offered,</hi> is, as in 1 Joh. 3. 16. <hi>The Life of God.</hi> The <hi>Offering</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is therefore enough to purchase for us, all the Blessings of God: It may be said of all the most <hi>Invaluable</hi> Blessings, <hi>Their Full Value ha's been Offered for them!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christians; You see a Priest, an Offering and an Altar, in our Lord JESUS CHRIST, Yea, Behold, the <hi>Mystery;</hi> ONE CHRIST is All! And what is wanting to make up a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?</hi> One Thing more; A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must be Cutt Off. And so was our Lord JESUS CHRIST. It is said, in Dan. 9. 26, 27, <hi>The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; and he shall cause the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease.</hi> All Fulfill'd in our JESUS, most Punctually, and Gloriously! Was there not a Sacrifice, when His <hi>Blood</hi> was poured out, when the Flames of Hell took Hold of Him, when He was horribly Burnt in the Fire of the Wrath of God?</p>
               <p>Secondly; Our Lord Jesus Christ, being thus Offered a Real and Proper <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> did by His Deadly Sufferings make an Expiation for our Sins. The <hi>Sorrows</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039330_0031_10146C9D862AD798"/>
when He became a <hi>Man of Sorrows,</hi> fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Intentions of an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As now;</p>
               <p>Did an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> Bear the <hi>Sins</hi> of the People? This was the meaning of that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, in Lev. 1.4. <hi>He shall put his Hand on the Head of the Burnt Offering, and it shall be Accepted for Him.</hi> Thus, as the Hebrew Doctors tell us, they <hi>Transferred</hi> their Guilt from Themselves to their Victim. Well,; Such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is our Lord Jesus Christ, as to <hi>Bear</hi> the Sins of His Elect. It is said, in 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>He, His own self, Bare our sins, on the Tree.</hi> Though our Lord Jesus Christ was not <hi>Culpably Guilty,</hi> yet He was <hi>Penalty Guilty,</hi> of our Sins. It is a Rude and a Crude Speech, to say, <hi>That Christ was the Greatest Sinner in the World;</hi> For, Christ never was a <hi>Sinner;</hi> If He had been a <hi>Sinner</hi> He could not have been a <hi>Saviour.</hi> But He became a <hi>Surety</hi> for Sinners, and therein He became Responsible for all our Sins: All our <hi>Debts,</hi> He took upon Himself.</p>
               <p>Again; Was the Misery due to the <hi>Sinner,</hi> laid upon the <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice?</hi> The Order for the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> was, to <hi>Wound</hi> it, <hi>Stab</hi> it, <hi>Kill</hi> it, <hi>Flay</hi> it, <hi>Pull</hi> it a Pieces, <hi>Wring</hi> off the Neck of it, <hi>Burn</hi> it unto Ashes. Why? The <hi>Sinner</hi> must say, <hi>All of this, have I, by my sins deserved!</hi> Well; Such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is our Lord Jesus Christ, as to Encounter that very Misery, which belonged unto us. It is said, in lsa. 53. 4, 5. <hi>Surely, He
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039330_0032_10146C9F12F6A128"/>
hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows, the Chastisement of our Peace was upon Him.</hi> Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was <hi>Essential</hi> unto the <hi>Death,</hi> which we were to undergo for our Sinning against God, was all undergone by our Sinless Jesus. Tis true, There are many particular miseries, which come upon these and those Individual men for their Sins, that yet our Lord Jesus Christ must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, but then He did undergo what was <hi>Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> thereunto: Yea, What He <hi>underwent</hi> was Equal to what all we have <hi>Deserved.</hi> Indeed a world of <hi>Penal Evil</hi> does besal the Reprobate Sinner, which is not Simply from the <hi>Curse,</hi> but from the Disposition of the Sinner under the Curse. A total Separation from God; Blindness of mind, Hardness of Heart, Eternity of Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, are Circumstantials, &amp; Accidentals of the misery due for Sin, which the Condition of the Sinner as <hi>Personally</hi> defiled with Sin, and unable to help himself, does Expose him unto; our Lord underwent not these unhappy circumstances: His condition rendred them not Necessary for Him. Yet, all the <hi>Essentials</hi> of our Death He submitted unto; all the Death which the Law imposed on Him.</p>
               <p>Once more; Was the <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> of old Substituted in the Room of the <hi>Sinner?</hi> That so the <hi>Sinner</hi> might Escape, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must Supply his place; <hi>Nephesh tachath Nephesh,</hi> as they Expressed it; <hi>Life must go for Life, and Soul must,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039330_0033_10146CA272217B18"/>
go for Soul.</hi> Well; Such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is our Lord Jesus Christ, as to be <hi>Substituted</hi> for <hi>Us,</hi> and to Dy in <hi>our Stead,</hi> as well as for <hi>our Good.</hi> It was, as in Math. 20. 28. <hi>To give His Life, a Rensome for many.</hi> When our Lords Dying <hi>For us,</hi> is affirmed, the preposition, ANTI, is often Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; a preposition, that implies a <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yea, the Phrases for it, all over the New Testament are such, that, until all the <hi>Greek Books</hi> under Heaven, are annihilated, the Notion of our Lords Dying <hi>in our Place,</hi> cannot be Refused.</p>
               <p>Finally; Was God Atoned upon an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice?</hi> and the Criminal <hi>Released</hi> from the Confusion that belong'd unto him, and <hi>Restored</hi> unto the Compassion of Heaven? Yes. Well; Such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is our Lord Jesus Christ; that our <hi>Peace</hi> with God, is thereby obtained. We read in Rom. 5 9, 10. <hi>We are Reconciled unto God, by the Death of His Son.</hi> So, <hi>Now</hi> we are not under a Sentence of Everlasting Death, as we were before our Believing on that <hi>Sacrifice. Now</hi> we draw near to God, whom we see sitting on a <hi>Mercy Seat. Now</hi> we have a claim to all that the Good Will of God ha's promised for the <hi>Heirs of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is it not an Unjust Thing?—Thirdly; No; Tis no Unjust Thing, that our <hi>Innocent</hi> Lord Jesus Christ, should be made an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice,</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of His Poor, Guilty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, Ungodly and Unworthy People.

                  <hi>A Translation of the Punishment of Sin, by the Dispensation of God,</hi> is the very Foundation, of the <hi>Christian,</hi> and all <hi>Revealed,</hi> Religion. And that such a <hi>Translation</hi> may be without <hi>Iniquity</hi> in the Great God, is evident from the Instances actually given of it, by that God who can do <hi>no Iniquity.</hi> [See Exod. 20. 5. &amp; Lam. 5. 11. &amp; 2 King. 23. 26, 27. and Gen. 9. 25. and 2 Sam. 21. 8, 14.] But, this Administration of Justice, is not Promiscuous. There are Two Things Especially, that render it, a <hi>Just Thing,</hi> that here the <hi>Just Suffer for the Unjust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the Eternal Covenant of Redemption, freely offered, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and Engaged, for to become our <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Our Lord says, in Psal. 40. 7. <hi>Sacrifice and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thou didst not desire;—then said I, Lo, I come; in the Roll of thy Book, it is written of me.</hi> The Hebrews wrote their <hi>Contracts, Agreements, Indentures,</hi> in <hi>Rolls;</hi> The meaning of this passage may be, that there was a <hi>Contract,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> between God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, for His becoming a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The <hi>Decree</hi> of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God the <hi>Son,</hi> as well as God the <hi>Father.</hi> He was not <hi>Compelled</hi> unto the Undertaking of <hi>Redeeming</hi> us, by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Himself. Now, <hi>Volenti non sit Injuria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; Our Lord Jesus Christ, that He might become our <hi>sacrifice,</hi> became nearly sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

unto us. The <hi>Legal Relation</hi> between the <hi>Debtor,</hi> and the <hi>Surety,</hi> He took on Himself. Now, as his <hi>Legal,</hi> according to the Sentence of the Wise man, in Prov. 11. 15. <hi>He that is surety for a Stranger, shall smart for it;</hi> So, our Lord Jesus Christ, became a <hi>Surety for a Sinner</hi> &amp; then, Lo, <hi>He Smarts,</hi> He Bleeds, He Dies for it. <hi>Hostages</hi> may be made a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for them, whom they are given for. Our Lord Jesus Christ, gave Himself up, as a <hi>Pledge</hi> to the <hi>Justice</hi> of God for us. <hi>Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> are sometimes made <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> one for another.

Beloved, SON unto the horrible <hi>Grief,</hi> of being made a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Much more than the Epistle, to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> must be curt out of our Bibles, before we foregoe this Glorious Truth. And indeed, All the True Believers, before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, had an Eve to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in the <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were but so many Remembrances of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> who was promised, one day to be <hi>Bruised,</hi> for our Deliverances from the old <hi>Serpent.</hi> Hence we read, in Psal. 51. 16, 17. <hi>Thou desirest not Sacrifice, thou delightest not in Burnt offering: The Sacrifices of God are a Broken Spirit; a Broken and a Contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> The special Character, which the Spirit of God put on the <hi>Messiah,</hi> coming to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin, was that of, <hi>The Bruised one:</hi> Yea, the very First Time that ever the <hi>Messiah</hi> was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the World, His being Bruised, was the Thing propos'd concerning Him. The <hi>Messiah,</hi> was to be, <hi>A Broken and Contrite one:</hi> There never were such <hi>Heart breaking Things</hi> Encountred by any Living, as what very felt by our Lord Jesus Christ, in the <hi>Rich Bay,</hi> when Earth and Hell joyned for the Afflicting of Him, and His Father also treated Him, as one made a <hi>Curse</hi> for Sin. In the <hi>Agonies</hi> which then came upon Him, He cryed out, <hi>My Heart is Broken!</hi> This, This was the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which thou, O <hi>David,</hi> still didst six
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039330_0037_10146CACBA618A98"/>
the Eye of thine <hi>Hope</hi> upon. Yea, and all the Faithful People of God, then knew no other <hi>Hope.</hi> Thus we read, in Psal. 130. 6. <hi>My Soul waits for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning.</hi> The <hi>Messiah</hi> is undoubtedly, <hi>The Lord,</hi> there waited for. In <hi>the Morning,</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> that <hi>Watched</hi> in the Temple, had their <hi>Daily Sacrifices.</hi> Yea, but the Faithful People of God, when they brought their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> unto Him, had their Faith <hi>Waiting</hi> for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was to bring a <hi>Plenteous Redemption</hi> with Him. Thus we read, in Heb. 6. 1, 2. <hi>Repentance from Dead Works, and Faith towards God, the Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms, and of Laying on of Hands.</hi> As <hi>Repentance,</hi> was the Thing Taught by the <hi>Baptisms,</hi> or <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> used among the Faithful People of God; So, <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was Taught by the <hi>Laying on of Hands.</hi> When they brought their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> they were to <hi>Lean</hi> with their <hi>Hands</hi> there upon; and hereby their Faith, which is a <hi>Leaning,</hi> a <hi>Staying,</hi> a <hi>Resting,</hi> on the Christ, intended by the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> was intimated.</p>
               <p>Now, if you Consult the Book <hi>Leviticus,</hi> you will find Six kinds of <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifices,</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> all of them, the <hi>Types</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for the Sins, not only of the <hi>Jewish,</hi> but also of the <hi>Gentile World.</hi> There was, (I) The <hi>Burnt-Offering.</hi> (II) The <hi>Meat Offering.</hi> (III) The <hi>Peace Offering.</hi> (IV) The <hi>Sin Offering.</hi> (V) The
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:039330_0038_10146CAF67EEDEB0"/>
                  <hi>Trespass-Offering.</hi> (<hi>VI</hi>) The <hi>Offering of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> All these were Offerings at the <hi>Brazen-Altar;</hi> All these were Offerings <hi>made by Fire;</hi> All these were Offerings designed for <hi>Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among these, one is a Sin-Offering. The Difference between the <hi>Sin-Offering,</hi> and the <hi>Trespass Offering,</hi> Lay in this: The <hi>Sin Offering</hi> was for Sins of Ignorance, of Infirmity, of Greater Surprisal by Temptation: The <hi>Trespass-Offering</hi> was for Sins against Knowledge, and Crimes of a more grievous and heinous Nature.</p>
               <p>Now the Law of the Sin-Offering, distinctly directed it for Four sorts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: (<hi>I</hi>) The <hi>Priest.</hi> (<hi>II</hi>) The <hi>Body</hi> of the People. (<hi>III</hi>) The <hi>Ruler</hi> of the People. (<hi>IV</hi>) Any <hi>Private Person</hi> among the People.</p>
               <p>Behold, among these, A Sin-Offering for the Congregation; A <hi>Young Bullock,</hi> made a <hi>Sin Offering for the Congregation.</hi> And the <hi>Gospel</hi> of that <hi>Sin Offering,</hi> we will Endeavour now to set before you, O <hi>Congregation</hi> of our <hi>New English Israel,</hi> in the Ensuing Admonitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us, with a most Affectionate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, Behold the Circumstances of the Sin-Offering for the Congregation, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully answered in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ; who, by being <hi>made a Sin Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did Condemn Sin in the Flesh.</hi> As now:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:039330_0039_10146CB0F1837DC8"/>
Was the <hi>Sin Offering for the Congregation,</hi> to be a Young Bullock, without Blemish? Truly, Our Lord Jesus Christ Suffered for us, even in His <hi>Youth;</hi> The <hi>Ancient of Dayes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Suffered for us, before He was an <hi>Old Man. He</hi> Suffered, because <hi>We</hi> must say, <hi>Lord, I have been as Bullock unaccustomed unto thy Yoke!</hi> And when He Suffered, He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from any Blemish upon Him: His Perfection was Absolute.</p>
               <p>Again. Was the <hi>Sin Offering for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> to be Slain? Truly, Our Lord Jesus Christ, felt nothing less than the very pains of <hi>Death</hi> for our Sin; <hi>Death,</hi> very <hi>Death,</hi> is the Doom of <hi>Sin.</hi> Tis therefore said of our Lord Jesus Christ; <hi>He became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross.</hi> The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God said unto our Lord Jesus Christ, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> said unto his only <hi>Isaac, My Son, Go Dy!</hi> He <hi>Dyed</hi> most <hi>Obediently.</hi> The <hi>Legacies</hi> of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, ordered for us, in the <hi>Testament</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, could not have come unto us, but by <hi>the Death of the Testator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore. Was the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Sin Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Congregation,</hi> to be Sprinkled Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Times before the <hi>Vail</hi> or the Sanctuary, towards the <hi>Holy of Holies?</hi> Truly, <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> is, <hi>A purchased Possession:</hi> And so is that Heavenly State of <hi>Holiness,</hi> which the Church on Earth, must in the <hi>Seventh
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039330_0040_10146CB3F4E1A4B8"/>
Age</hi> of the World, arrive unto: Tis the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ha's made a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase</hi> of it. We read, <hi>That we Enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Jesus:</hi> Oh! we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, never, never come there, but by the <hi>Blood of Jesus!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover. Was part of the <hi>Blood,</hi> of the <hi>Sin Offering for the Congregation,</hi> to be put upon the <hi>Horns,</hi> of the Golden Altar of Incense? Truly, The <hi>Intercession</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is founded in His <hi>Blood:</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ Above, with the <hi>Incense</hi> of His <hi>Intercession</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for us, ha's carried the mention and the merit of His <hi>Blood</hi> thither with Him. We are told, <hi>By His own Blood. He Entred in once into the Holy place, having obtained Eternal Redemgtion</hi> The Salvations, which our Lord Jesus Christ in the <hi>Holy Place</hi> is demanding for us, He demands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Consideration, <hi>Oh! my God, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; my Blood ha's bought all that I callenge!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more. Was the rest of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Sin Offering for the Congregation,</hi> to be Parish forth at the Bottom of the Altar <hi>of Burnt-Offering?</hi> Truly The <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, ha's been <hi>Poured forth:</hi> Tis said, <hi>He hath poured out His Soul unto Death.</hi> When <hi>Circumcised,</hi> when <hi>Buffeted</hi> in His Agony when <hi>Scourged</hi> with Thongs, when <hi>Crowned</hi> with Thom. when Fastned with Iron unto a <hi>Tree,</hi> (for our Lord, becoming the <hi>Servant</hi> of God, must have
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039330_0041_10146CB8273F93B0"/>
his <hi>Ear-Bored,</hi> and a Body fastned with <hi>Iron,</hi> unto a post of <hi>Wood!</hi>) When <hi>Pierced</hi> with a <hi>Spear,</hi> in all these, His precious <hi>Blood</hi> was <hi>poured forth.</hi> But the Efficacy of this <hi>Blood,</hi> that which renders if so <hi>Precious,</hi> is, Its Nearness to the <hi>Altar.</hi> Our Lords <hi>Deity,</hi> is that <hi>Altar,</hi> from which the vertue of His <hi>Blood</hi> arises: Were not the Blood our Lord Jesus Christ, at the <hi>Bottom of that Altar,</hi> it would have no vertue, and small value in it.</p>
               <p>To Conclude; Was the <hi>Sin Offering for the Congregation,</hi> to be Burned; the Inwards of it, on the <hi>Altar;</hi> all the whole <hi>Carcase</hi> beside, in a <hi>clean place without the Camp,</hi> or without the City-Gates? Truly, The <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, like a Formidable <hi>Fire,</hi> Seized on our Lord Jesus Christ: It was a <hi>Fiery Trial</hi> That came upon Him: His very <hi>Inwards</hi> were all on a Light <hi>Fire</hi> under the Wrath of the Most High. This horrid <hi>Fire,</hi> cast all His <hi>Inwards</hi> into such an Anguish, as caused a <hi>Bloody Sweat</hi> upon Him. Then was our Lord <hi>carried forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gates of the City:</hi> 'Tis said, <hi>They carried Him out of Jerusalem, to Golgotha.</hi> So says our Apostle, in Heb. 13. 11, 12. <hi>The Bodies of those Beasts whose Blood is brought into the Sanctuary, by the High Priest, for Sin, are Burnt without the Camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that He might San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify the People with His own Blood, Suffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gate.</hi>
               </p>

Now, Let this <hi>Contemplation</hi> be your <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for some Actions, that may Save the whole <hi>Congregation</hi> from the Wrath of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Let us <hi>Humbly</hi> Plead with God, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, not only for our <hi>own Souls,</hi> but let every Soul do it, for this whole Congregation. The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is not only, pleadable for <hi>Persons,</hi> but also for <hi>Peoples,</hi> that belong unto Him. Alas, my Friends; 'Tis <hi>utterly a Fault</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, That we make too little use of our Lord Jesus Christ. Particularly, In our Prayers and our Cares, for the welfare of our <hi>whole Congregation,</hi> we make too little Use of this <hi>Alsufficient Sacrifice.</hi> We read in I Sam. 7. 9, 10. <hi>Samuel offered a Burnt Offering wholly unto the Lord, and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him: And as Samuel was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up the Burnt Offering, the Lord Thundered with a great Thunder on that day upon the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, and discomfited them.</hi> It may be, if we had more pleaded the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, that <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> for our <hi>Israel,</hi> the Lord would have long e're now, heard our Cries, and Thundered with a great Thunder on our <hi>Philistean</hi> Adversaries. I may tell you, Syrs; We are not less Accommodated with a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>our</hi> Land, than the Old Church of <hi>Israel</hi> was for <hi>Theirs!</hi>

Attend, I beseech you, to this GRAND METHOD, of <hi>Deliverances!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Three or Four Things, which we are to Plead, with a <hi>Lively Faith</hi> before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Let our first plea be This: That our Lord Jesus Christ, hath Endured those very <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God, whereto our Sins have made <hi>us</hi> obnoxious. Do the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, <hi>Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> us? They did as much <hi>Impoverish</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>when</hi> He had not an <hi>House</hi> where to lay His Head, <hi>when</hi> He had not <hi>Money</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon Earth to pay His Tax, <hi>when</hi> He wanted <hi>Bread,</hi> and had nothing but a <hi>Stone,</hi> to feed upon, and <hi>when</hi> His very <hi>Garments</hi> were violently taken from Him. Do the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God Commission <hi>Enemies,</hi> to vex us <hi>with all Adversity?</hi> They Let Loose as many <hi>Enemies</hi> on our Lord Jesus Christ, when Earth and Hell combined for His Ruine Do the <hi>Judgments of</hi> God, fill us with <hi>Animosities</hi> one against another? They turn'd the like <hi>Animosities</hi> on our Lord Jesus Christ, when His own <hi>Country-men</hi> made continual Clamours against Him. Are we <hi>kill'd</hi> by the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God? They were <hi>Killing Judgments</hi> that fell upon our Lord Jesus Christ, when He cried out, <hi>My Soul is Exceeding Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even unto Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let our Second Plea be This; That God had <hi>more Glory</hi> from His <hi>Judgments</hi> on our Lord
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:039330_0044_10146CBDB8340408"/>
Jesus Christ, than if our people should perish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ireful Direful Plagues of His Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the Calamities of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Perfections of God slash'd out, unto the view of men and Angels, with a Brightness more dazling, than that of the Brightest Lightning. The <hi>Holiness</hi> of God was never so <hi>glorified,</hi> as when He <hi>Spared not His own Son, but gave Him up to Death for us.</hi> The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, was never so <hi>Glorified,</hi> as when He cured the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Wounds of the <hi>Patient,</hi> by wounding the <hi>Physician.</hi> The <hi>Power</hi> of God was never so <hi>Glorified,</hi> as when He upheld a <hi>man</hi> in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, which would have made an <hi>Arch Angel</hi> saint. The <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, was never so <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi> as when He made His only <hi>Son,</hi> to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> His Burning Displeasure against His <hi>Enemies.</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> of God was never so <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> as when He <hi>Inflicted</hi> upon our Lord, all that He had <hi>Threatened</hi> unto <hi>us.</hi> If all the <hi>Trees</hi> of the Woods in this Countrey were laid in one pile, and all the <hi>Men</hi> Laid on that pile, and the <hi>Breath of the Lord,</hi> like a <hi>Stream of Brimstone,</hi> should kindle it, there would not be such a Discovery of the Greatness and the Glory of God, as there ha's been, in the Death of our Lord Jesus Christ. That Cry, in the Mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Oh! my God! Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> ha's proclamed the Glory of God, infinitely more than if our Houses were
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:039330_0045_10146CC2C8A64778"/>
all fill'd with the Cryes, of Murdered infants and Ravished Women, and Men Massacred by <hi>Indian Salvages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let our Third Plea be This; That if God will Deliver us from His <hi>Judgments,</hi> the <hi>Oblation</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ shall have the <hi>Glory of it all;</hi> We are as an <hi>Unfruitful Figtree</hi> before the Lord; that old Picture of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Nation, is <hi>Ours;</hi> We Deserve <hi>Cutting down:</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ sees the <hi>Axe</hi> of Divine Vengeance ready to strike the fatal <hi>Blow;</hi> He takes the <hi>Blow</hi> upon Himself, and is <hi>Cut off out of the Land of the Living.</hi> If we then are Saved from Desolating Blows, laid at the <hi>Root of the Tree,</hi> we will say, <hi>Thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ for This! He</hi> warded off the <hi>Blow: For the Transgression of my People, was He Stricken.</hi> Sirs, You cannot Imagine, how Delightful it will be unto the God of Heaven, to hear us <hi>Pleading</hi> of these Arguments?</p>
               <p>But Add one more unto them. Let our fourth Plea be, That our Lord Jesus Christ, hath been made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>Sins,</hi> which had no <hi>Sin Offering</hi> allow'd unto them. Atrocious and Flagitious, and Prodigious Impieties, for which the <hi>Sin Offering</hi> was never directed; no, nor the <hi>Trespass-Offering</hi> neither; even for <hi>Those,</hi> is our Lord Christ a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> There was a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:039330_0046_10146CC456E82A90"/>
chief man in <hi>Israel,</hi> who could say, <hi>Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest not Sacrifice:</hi> The Jewish Commentators give This, as the Sense of it; That his Crimes were such as had no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> provided for them. Yea, but for such is the Sacrifice of the <hi>Messiah</hi> provided. Hence the Apostle says, in Act. 13. 39. <hi>By Him, all that Believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are Justified from all Things, from which ye could not be Justified by the Law of Moses.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Blasphemy</hi> it self, which had no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> may find one, in the Lord Jesus Christ: Says <hi>Paul, I was a Blasphemer, but I obtained mercy!</hi> The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> tells us, Num. 15. 25, 30. <hi>The Priest shall make Atonement, for all the Congregation, and it shall be Forgiven them, for it is Ignorance: But the Soul that doth ought presumptuously, shall be cut off.</hi> Yea, but in our Lord Jesus Christ we have a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for which our <hi>Presumptions</hi> also may be Forgiven unto us! Oh! <hi>plead it; plead it,</hi> with the God who <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives Iniquity, Transgression and Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But will it not be a <hi>presumptuous</hi> Thing to do so? or, will it not Encourage and Embolden the <hi>Congregation</hi> to <hi>Go on still in their Trespasses,</hi> if we venture to plead the Great <hi>Sacrifice for the Congregation,</hi> before we see a <hi>General Reformation</hi> of our <hi>Trespasses?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer; <hi>God Forbid!</hi> Methinks, there is little <hi>Evangelical</hi> in this <hi>Objection.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:039330_0047_10146CC72A80FF28"/>
First; Nothing will have such a Tendency to a <hi>General Reformation,</hi> as to fly more generally to the <hi>Great Sacrifice for the Congregation</hi> than we do. It may be, the <hi>General Reformation</hi> so much desired and required, hitherto sticks at This; the Great <hi>Sacrifice for the Congregation</hi> is not first of all enough Recognized: Our Attempts about a <hi>General Reformation</hi> prove abortive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we Attempt it, with too much of the <hi>Spirit of the Old Covenant</hi> Prevailing in us. Mark What I say; A Sin will never be thorowly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> until it be <hi>Pardoned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; We are to plead the <hi>Great Sacrifice for the Congregation,</hi> that so we may obtain from God, the Grace for a <hi>General Reformation.</hi> God must be petitioned, for a <hi>General Reformation,</hi> as purchase by the Great <hi>Sacrifice for the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> which is to Dispose us, and Assist us, unto a <hi>General Reformation</hi> is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ hath been made a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to obtain the <hi>Reformation</hi> of His People, and <hi>purify us to Himself a peculiar people, zealous of Good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Let us, with much Abhorrence of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and of our <hi>Selves</hi> for our Sins, Confess over the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the many Sins, by which we have, as a <hi>Congregation</hi> exposed our selves unto the Displeasure of God. As in one peculiar <hi>Sin Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:039330_0048_10146CC8BA485960"/>
for the People,</hi> there was the practice En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined; in Lev. 16. 21. <hi>He shall confess over it, all the Iniquities of the Children of Israel, and all their Transgressions in all their Sins:</hi> Thus, Let us take a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the <hi>Iniquities,</hi> and the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> wherewith our <hi>Congregation</hi> hath Sinned against God. [Alas, We have many a sad <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,</hi> published among us!] And Let us, with all sincere Impartiality, with all humble Sincerity, <hi>Confess</hi> them all. <hi>Confess</hi> all our Sins against the Rulers of <hi>Piety,</hi> and of <hi>Charity;</hi> all our Sins against the <hi>Profession</hi> that we have made; all our Sirs against the <hi>Covenant</hi> that we have own'd. Yea, tho' we have <hi>Sinned Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,</hi> when we have <hi>Sinned,</hi> yet, as 'tis here said, <hi>When the Sin which they have Sinned, is known,</hi> Then the <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> must be, with all suitable Confessions applied unto.</p>
               <p>Syrs, We cannot be too Exact, in these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions</hi> of our Sins, and in <hi>Enquiries</hi> after the sad Occasions for these <hi>Confessions.</hi> Our Land may be more Denied with Sin, than we are well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; for sometimes the miscarriages of One man, may be equivalent unto those of the <hi>Whole Congregation.</hi> It is Remarkable; If a <hi>Priest</hi> Sinned, there must be as Great an <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for him, as for the <hi>Whole Congregation</hi> besides. Why, what would become of us, if the <hi>Whole Congregation</hi> should fall into filthy <hi>Wantonness,</hi> or,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:039330_0049_10146CCBEBBA3E90"/>
if the <hi>Whole Congregation</hi> should fall into beastly <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> or, if the <hi>Whole Congregation</hi> should fall into Scandalous <hi>Coveteousness?</hi> Alas, if any in <hi>Chief Place</hi> among us, do Sin at that rate, on those doleful occasions, we are to Abase our selves, as if the <hi>Whole Congregation</hi> were become Abominable before the Lord. But how much then ought they themselves, who have brought the <hi>Whole Congregation</hi> Lo; for ever Ly <hi>Low</hi> before the Lord and cry out unto His <hi>Whole Congregation,</hi> Calcate me, Insipidum Salem, Calcate me!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W.</hi> Tho' <hi>All the People</hi> are to Act Faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, as the <hi>Sacrifice for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> yet the <hi>Elders of the People</hi> are most of all to do it with a most singular Application.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>All men</hi> fly to the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, first for themselves: Thou, O man, must thy self becoming a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revenges of God, and <hi>Suffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire,</hi> if thou do it not! Now, if <hi>every man in the Land,</hi> would thus assure his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, there would be None in the Land, under the offence of Heaven But, until <hi>Then,</hi> [and therefore, <hi>Alwayes!</hi>] a <hi>few</hi> must Act Faith for <hi>all</hi> the rest. And there is not any <hi>One Christian</hi> among all this people, but what may and should
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:039330_0050_10146CCFE6AD0040"/>
put in suit, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, for <hi>all the people.</hi> As the <hi>Sin</hi> of some ONE person, may go a great way, to pull down the <hi>Wrath</hi> of Heaven, upon the <hi>Whole Congregation:</hi> ONE <hi>Achan,</hi> Did not that ONE MAN <hi>Sin, and the Lord was wroth with the Whole Congregation!</hi> So, who can tell, how far the <hi>Faith</hi> of ONE Person, in the <hi>Sacrifice for the Congregation,</hi> may go to avert the Wrath of Heaven from us all? ONE <hi>Amos,</hi> (and so, ONE poor, obscure, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Husbandman, or Mechanick!) may be Instrumental to Save a <hi>Congregation</hi> from <hi>Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, O you that are the Elders <hi>of our Israel</hi> 'Tis YOU, that are concerned above others, to present before the Lord, the Great <hi>Sacrifice for the Congregation.</hi> Of the <hi>Sin Offering,</hi> 'tis here said, <hi>The Elders of the Congregation shall Lay their Hands upon the Head of it, before the Lord.</hi> Out magistrates, our Ministers, are by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, the Elders of our <hi>Congregation;</hi> 'Tis on YOU, <hi>My Fathers,</hi> that this thing is most of all Incumbent: YOU, YOU, are They that must Believe in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, not only for your sake, but also for <hi>all the Congregation. My Fathers;</hi> You see, that we are a very Faulty, yea, and a very Froward, <hi>Congregation,</hi> and a <hi>Generation of sinful men.</hi> Do YOU, by Faith Lay before the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:039330_0051_10146CD3249733E8"/>
and Jealous God, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, on our behalf, and beg of Him, to Spare the <hi>Whole People</hi> for the Sake of that <hi>Sacrifice. Blessed art thou, O Land,</hi> when thou dost Enjoy Elders, that will be thus concerned for thee!</p>
               <p>Do This, when you are <hi>Asunder,</hi> in dayly, frequent, solemn Supplications. But especially when you are <hi>Together,</hi> Then, <hi>Then,</hi> is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Opportunity, for this your Faith, to be Exercised. Can a General Assembly of the <hi>Representatives</hi> of a Province, do a better thing than <hi>This;</hi> To, <hi>Joyn as one man in Solemn Devotions, with Fasting and Prayer, and Laying their Hands more Explicitly than ever on the Head of our Great Sacrifice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! were this Thing in a due manner done, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would <hi>Earnestly Remember</hi> us: <hi>My Bowels would be Troubled for them. I would surely have Mercy on them, saith the Lord.</hi> The Great God would say to the Destroying Angel, <hi>Put up thy Sword; I will require no further Sacrifice for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; Through the Sacrifice if my Son, I am well pleased, and Atoned.</hi> Then, as after the <hi>Sin Offering</hi> for the People, in Lev. 9. 15, 23. <hi>He brought the Peoples Offering,—And Moses and Aaron came put, and Blessed the People, and the
