            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with great pleaſure I ſee at laſt the preſervation of Children become the care of Men of Senſe: it is certainly a matter that well deſerves their attention, and, I doubt not, the Public will ſoon find the good and great effects of it. The FOUNDLING HOSPITAL may be of more uſe to the world, than was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at firſt imagined by the promoters of it; it will be a means not only of preventing the murder of many, but of ſaving more, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a more reaſonable and more natural method of nurſing. In my opinion, this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been too long fatally left to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Women, who cannot be ſuppoſed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012344_0003_0F88EF18E1F348C0"/>to have proper knowledge to fit them for ſuch a taſk, notwithſtanding they look upon it to be their own province. What I mean is, a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic knowledge of Nature, to be acquired only by learned obſervation and experience, and which therefore the unlearned muſt be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. They may preſume upon the examples and tranſmitted cuſtoms of their Great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, who were taught by the Phyſicians of their unenlightened days; when Phyſicians, as appears by late diſcoveries, were miſtaken in many things, being led away by hypothetical reaſonings to entertain very wild conceits, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which they were greatly bewildered themſelves, and miſled others to believe I know not what ſtrange unaccountable powers in certain herbs, roots, and drugs; and alſo in ſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices and ceremonies; for all which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their being no real foundation in Nature, they ought to be looked upon as the effects of ignorance, or the artifices of deſigning Quacks; who found their account in pretending to great knowledge of their occult qualities, and impoſing upon the credulous. The art of Phyſic has been much improved within this laſt century; by obſerving and following Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more cloſely, many uſeful diſcoveries have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012344_0004_0F88EF19BB8B5CC8"/>been made, which help us to account for things in a natural way, that before ſeemed myſterious and magical; and which have conſequently made the practice of it more conformable to reaſon and good ſenſe. This being the caſe, there is great room to fear, that thoſe Nurſes who yet retain many of theſe traditional preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, are capitally miſtaken in their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Children in general, and fancying that Nature has left a great deal to their ſkill and contrivance, often do much harm where they intend to do good. Of this I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to convince them, by ſhewing how I think children may be clothed, fed, and managed, with much leſs trouble to their Nurſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater eaſe, comfort, and ſafety, to the little ones.</p>
            <p>THE Foundlings under the care of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, I preſume, will be bred in a very plain, ſimple manner: they will therefore infallibly have more health, beauty, ſtrength, and ſpirits; I might add underſtanding alſo, as all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the mind are well known to depend upon the organs of the body; ſo that when theſe are in good order, the thinking part is moſt alert and active; the contrary, when they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012344_0005_0F88EF1CE4BD7CB0"/>are diſturbed or diſeaſed. When theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages appear in favor of Children ſo brought up, as I am confident in time they will, it may ſerve to convince moſt Nurſes, Aunts, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, &amp;c. how much they have hitherto been in the wrong, what miſchief is done to Children, and what multitudes are deſtroyed or ſpoiled, as well by cramming them with cakes, ſweetmeats, &amp;c. till they foul their blood, choak their veſſels, pall the appetite, and ruin every faculty of their bodies; as by cockering and indulging them, to the utter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their naturally good temper, till they become quite froward and indocile.</p>
            <p>When a man takes upon him to contradict received opinions and prejudices ſanctified by time, it is expected he ſhould bring valid proof of what he advances. The truth of what I ſay, that the treatment of Children in general is wrong, unreaſonable, and unnatural, will in a great meaſure appear, if we but conſider what a puny valetudinary race moſt of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of condition are; chiefly owing to bad nurſing, and bad habits contracted early. But let any one, who would be fully convinced of this matter, look over the BILLS OF MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TALITY;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012344_0006_0F88EF1D00FDB538"/>there he may obſerve, that almoſt half the number of thoſe who fill up that black liſt, die under five years of age: ſo that half the people that come into the world, go out of it again before they become of the leaſt uſe to it, or themſelves. To me this ſeems to deſerve ſerious conſideration; and yet I cannot find, that any one man of ſenſe and public ſpirit has ever attended to it at all; notwithſtanding the maxim in every one's mouth, that a multitude of inhabitants is the greateſt ſtrength and beſt ſupport of a Commonwealth. The miſconduct to which I muſt impute a great part of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, is too common and obvious to engage the idle and ſpeculative, who are to be caught only by very refined reſearches; and the buſy part of mankind, where their immediate intereſt is not concerned, will always overlook what they ſee daily; it may be thought a natural evil, and ſo is ſubmitted to without examination. But this is by no means the caſe; and where it is entirely owing to miſmanagement, and poſſibly may admit of a remedy, it is ridiculous to charge it upon Nature, and ſuppoſe that infants are more ſubject to diſeaſe and death than grown perſons; on the contrary, they bear pain and diſeaſe much better, fevers eſpecially (as is plain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012344_0007_0F88EF1DAAEFB300"/>in the caſe of the ſmall-pox, generally moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to Children) and for the ſame reaſon that a twig is leſs hurt by a ſtorm than an oak. In all the other productions of Nature, we ſee the greateſt vigour and luxuriancy of health, the nearer they are to the egg or the bud; they are indeed then moſt ſenſible of injury, and it is injury only that deſtroys them. When was there a lamb, a bird, or a tree, that died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was young? Theſe are under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate nurſing of unerring Nature, and they thrive accordingly. Ought it not therefore to be the care of every Nurſe and every Parent, not only to protect their Nurſelings from inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to be well aſſured that their own offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervices be not the greateſt the helpleſs creatures can ſuffer?</p>
            <p>IN the lower claſs of Mankind, eſpecially in the country, diſeaſe and mortality are not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, either among the adult or their children. Health and poſterity are the portion of the poor, I mean the laborious. The want of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity confines them more within the limits of Nature: hence they enjoy bleſſings they feel not, and are ignorant of their cauſe. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who has only a few rags to cover her child looſely, and little more than her own breaſt to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012344_0008_0F88EF2332EFF678"/>feed it, ſees it healthy and ſtrong, and very ſoon able to ſhift for itſelf; while the puny inſect, the heir and hope of a rich family, lies lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing under a load of finery that overpowers his limbs, abhorring and rejecting the dainties he is crammed with, till he dies a victim to the miſtaken care and tenderneſs of his fond Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the courſe of my practice, I have had frequent occaſion to be fully ſatisfied of this, and have often heard a mother anxiouſly ſay,
<q>The Child has not been well ever ſince it has done puking and crying.</q>
Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, though not attended to, point very plainly to their cauſe. Is it not very evident, that when a Child rids its ſtomach ſeveral times in a day, that it has been over-loaded? when it cries, from the incumbrance and confinement of its cloaths, that it is hurt by them? While the natural ſtrength laſts (as every Child is born with more health and ſtrength than is generally immagined), it cries at or rejects the ſuperfluous load, and thrives apace: that is, grows very fat, bloated, and diſtended beyond meaſure, like a houſe-lamb. But in time, the ſame oppreſſive cauſe continuing, the natural powers are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, being no longer able to throw off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012344_0009_0F88EF24D3E48398"/>weight; the Child, not now able to cry any more, languiſhes and is quiet. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, theſe complaints are not underſtood! it is ſwaddled and crammed on, 'till after gripes, purging, &amp;c. it ſinks under both burdens into a convulſion-fit, and eſcapes any farther torture. This would be the caſe with the lamb, was it not killed when it is full fat.</p>
            <p>THAT the preſent method of nurſing is wrong, one would think needed no other proof than the frequent miſcarriages attending it, the death of many, and ill health of thoſe that ſurvive. But the perſuading you of it may be a needleſs taſk; if you have ever thought about it, I doubt not but you are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced it is ſo. However, ſince you deſire my ſentiments upon the ſubject, taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you think with me, that moſt of our Nurſes are in a wrong method, I will endeavour, in as few words as poſſible, to tell you what I think a right one.</p>
            <p>YOU perceive, Sir, by the hints I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dropped, what I am going to complain of is, that Children in general are over-cloathed and over-fed; and fed and cloathed improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012344_0010_0F88EF2529BED038"/>To theſe cauſes I impute almoſt all their diſeaſes. But to be a little more explicit. The firſt great miſtake is, that they think a new-born infant cannot be kept too warm: from this prejudice they load and bind it with flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, wrappers, ſwathes, ſtays, &amp;c. which all together are almoſt equal to it's own weight; by which means a healthy Child in a month's time is made ſo tender and chilly, it cannot bear the external air; and if, by any accident of a door or window left careleſsly open too long, a refreſhing breeze be admitted into the ſuffocating atmoſphere of the lying-in bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, the child and Mother ſometimes catch irrecoverable colds. But, what is worſe than this, at the end of the month, if things go on apparently well, this hot-bed plant is ſent out into the country to be reared in a leaky houſe, that lets in wind and rain from every quarter. Is it any wonder the child never thrives after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? The truth is, a new-born Child can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be too cool and looſe in its dreſs; it wants leſs cloathing than a grown perſon in proportion, becauſe it is naturally warmer, as appears by the thermometer, and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bear the cold of a winter's night much better than any adult perſon whatever. There are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012344_0011_0F88EF25F7F65EC8"/>many inſtances, both antient and modern, of infants expoſed and deſerted, that have lived ſeveral days. As it was the practice of antient times, in many parts of the world, to expoſe all thoſe whom the parents did not care to be incumbered with; that were deformed, or born under evil ſtars; not to mention the many Foundlings picked up in LONDON ſtreets. Theſe inſtances may ſerve to ſhew, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made Children able to bear even great hardſhips, before they are made weak and ſickly by their miſtaken Nurſes. But, beſides the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ariſing from the weight and heat of theſe ſwaddling-cloaths, they are put on ſo tight, and the Child is ſo cramped by them, that its bowels have not room, nor the limbs any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to act and exert themſelves in the free eaſy manner they ought. This is a very hurtful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; for limbs that are not uſed will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſtrong, and ſuch tender bodies cannot bear much preſſure: the circulation reſtrained by the compreſſion of any one part, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce unnatural ſwellings in ſome other; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the fibres of infants are ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. To which doubtleſs are owing the many diſtortions and deformities we meet with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012344_0012_0F88EF26AA371548"/>every-where; cheifly among Women, who ſuffer more in this particular than the Men.</p>
            <p>IF Nurſes were capable of making juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, they might ſee and take notice of that particular happineſs, which a Child ſhews by all its powers of expreſſion, when it is newly undreſſed. How pleaſed! how delighted! it is with this new liberty, when indulged for a few minutes with the free uſe of its legs and arms. But this is not to laſt long; it is ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled up as before, notwithſtanding all its cries and complaints.</p>
            <p>I WOULD recommend the following dreſs: A little flannel waiſtcoat, without ſleeves, made to fit the body, and tie looſely behind; to which there ſhould be a petticoat ſewed, and over this a kind of gown of the ſame material, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is light, thin, and flimſey. The petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat ſhould not be quite ſo long as the Child, the gown a few inches longer; with one cap only on the head, which may be made double, if it be thought not warm enough. What I mean is, that the whole coiffure ſhould be ſo contrived, that it might be put on at once, and neither bind nor preſs the head at all: the linen
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012344_0013_0F88EF276D0DC0A0"/>as uſual. This I think would be abundantly ſufficient for the day; laying aſide all thoſe ſwathes, bandages, ſtays, and contrivances, that are moſt ridiculouſly uſed to cloſe and keep the head in its place, and ſupport the body. As if nature, exact Nature, had produced her chief work, a human creature, ſo careleſsly unfiniſhed as to want thoſe idle aids to make it perfect. Shoes and ſtockings are very needleſs incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances; beſides that they keep the legs wet and naſty, if they are not changed every hour, and often cramp and hurt the feet: a child would ſtand firmer, and learn to walk much ſooner without them. I think they cannot be neceſſary till it runs out in the dirt. There ſhould be a thin flannel ſhirt for the night, which ought to be every way quite looſe. Children in this ſimple, pleaſant dreſs, which may be readily put on and off without teazing them, would find themſelves perfectly eaſy and happy, enjoying the free uſe of their limbs and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they would very ſoon begin to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy when they are thus left at liberty. I would have them put into it as ſoon as they are born, and continued in it till they are three years old; when it may be changed for any other more genteel and faſhionable: though I could wiſh
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012344_0014_0F88EF28B72EE078"/>it was not the cuſtom to wear ſtays at all; not becauſe I ſee no beauty in the ſugar-loaf ſhape, but that I am apprehenſive it is often procured at the expence of health and ſtrength of body. There is an odd notion enough entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout change, and the keeping of children clean. Some imagine that clean linen and freſh cloaths draw, and rob them of their nouriſhing juices. I cannot ſee that they do any thing more than imbibe a little of that moiſture which their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies exhale. Were it, as is ſuppoſed, it would be of ſervice to them; ſince they are always too abundantly ſupplied, and therefore I think they cannot be changed too often, and would have them clean every day; as it would free them from ſtinks and ſourneſſes, which are not only offenſive, but very prejudicial to the tender ſtate of infancy.</p>
            <p>THE feeding of Children properly is of much greater importance to them than their cloathing. We ought to take great care to be right in this material article, and that nothing be given them but what is wholeſome and good for them, and in ſuch quantity as the body calls for towards it's ſupport and growth; not a grain more. Let us conſider what Nature directs in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012344_0015_0F88EF29A24930F0"/>the caſe: If we follow Nature, inſtead of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or driving it, we cannot err. In the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nurſing, as well as Phyſic. Art is ever deſtructive, if it does not exactly copy this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal. When a Child is firſt born, there ſeems to be no proviſion at all made for it; for the Mother's milk, as it is now managed, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes till the third day; ſo that according to this appearance of Nature, a Child would be left a day and a half, or two days, without any food. Were this really the caſe, it would be a ſufficient proof that it wanted none; as indeed it does not immediately; for it is born full of blood, full of excrement, it's appetites not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, nor it's ſenſes opened; and requires ſome intermediate time of abſtinence and reſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and recover the ſtruggle of the birth and the change of circulation (the blood runing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new channels), which always puts it into a little fever. However extraordinary this might appear, I am ſure it would be better that the Child was not fed even all that time, than as it generally is fed; for it would ſleep the greateſt part of the time, and, when the milk was ready for it, would be very hungry, and ſuck with more eagerneſs; which is often neceſſary, for it ſeldom comes freely at firſt. But let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012344_0016_0F88EF2CC956DA98"/>to reconcile this difficulty, that a Child ſhould be born thus apparently unprovided for. I ſay apparently, for in reality it is not ſo. Nature neither intended that a Child ſhould be kept ſo long faſting, nor that we ſhould feed it for her. Her deſign is broke in upon, and a difficulty raiſed that is wholly owing to miſtaken manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Child, as ſoon as it is born, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Mother, and not ſuffered to ſuck till the Milk comes of itſelf; but is either fed with ſtrange and improper things, or put to ſuck ſome other Woman, whoſe Milk flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a full ſtream, overpowers the new-born infant, that has not yet learnt to ſwallow, and ſets it a coughing, or gives it a hiccup: the mother is left to ſtruggle with the load of her milk, unaſſiſted by the ſucking of the Child. Thus two great evils are produced, the one a prejudice to the Child's health, the other the danger of the Mother's life, at leaſt the retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her recovery, by cauſing what is called a milk-fever; which has been thought to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but ſo far from it, that it is entirely owing to this miſconduct. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from experience, that there would be no fever at all, were things managed rightly: were the Child kept without food of any kind 'till it was hungry, which it is impoſſible it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012344_0017_0F88EF2D67C463B0"/>ſhould be juſt after the birth, and then applied to the Mother's breaſts; it would ſuck with ſtrength enough, after a few repeated tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, to make the milk flow gradually, in due proportion to the Child's unexerciſed faculty of ſwallowing, and the call of it's ſtomach. Thus the Child would not only provide for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the beſt of nouriſhment, but, by opening a free paſſage for it, would take off the Mother's load, as it increaſed, before it could oppreſs or hurt her; and therefore effectually prevent the fever; which is cauſed only by the painful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the lacteal veſſels of the breaſts, when the milk is injudiciouſly ſuffered to accumulate. Here let me deſcribe a caſe of pure Nature, in order to illuſtrate this material point yet farther. When a healthy young Woman lies-in of her firſt Child, before the operations of Nature have been perverted by any abſurd practices, her labor would be ſtrong, and, as I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to inſtance in the caſe of a firſt Child, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps difficult; but in a few minutes after her delivery, ſhe and her Child if it be not injured, would fall into a ſweet ſleep of ſix or ſeven hours: the Mother, if no poiſonous opiate has been unneceſſarily given her, would awake refreſhed, the Child hungry. A little thin broth with bread, or ſome ſuch light food,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012344_0018_0F88EF332CDE2908"/>ſhould then be given her; and ſoon after the Child be put to ſuck. In one hour or two the milk would infallibly flow; and, if nothing elſe be given it, the Child would grow ſtrong, and ſhe recover perfectly in a few days. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of nature, which is very little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and never followed. The general practice is as ſoon as a Child is born, to cram a dab of butter and ſugar down it's throat, a little oil, panada, caudle, or ſome ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome meſs. So that they ſet out wrong, and the Child ſtands a fair chance of being made ſick from the firſt hour. It is the cuſtom of ſome to give a little roaſt pig to an infant, which, it ſeems, is to cure it of all the Mother's long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Much nonſence has been propagated, and believed, about Womens longings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foundation in truth and nature. I wiſh theſe matters were a little more enquired into, for the honor of the ſex, to which many imperfections of this kind are imputed, which I am ſure it does not lie under.</p>
            <p>HERE I may be aſked, What is to be done with the Child born ſick, that, inſtead of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cries inceſſantly from the birth, and is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be quieted by any means? Let good
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012344_0019_0F88EF34D4CE6698"/>care be taken that it is not hurt by the dreſſing, or rather let it not be dreſſed at all, but wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in a looſe flannel. If notwithſtanding this precaution, it ſtill continues crying; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of feeding it, for it is certainly a prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous thing to think of feeding a Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſick, though poſſibly this may ſtop its mouth for a little while; let it be applied to the Mother's breaſt, perhaps it may bring the milk immediately; which would be the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for it in ſuch a caſe; or the nipple in its mouth may quiet it, though it does not bring it. And it is certainly better it ſhould be quieted without food than with it, which muſt neceſſarily make it worſe. Sometimes indeed the child may be ſo very ill, that it will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven attempt to ſuck. In ſuch a caſe, which I think can happen but rarely, where Children are unavoidably to be dry nurſed, let the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic I ſhall recommend a little farther on, be given, a little every hour, 'till it takes effect; ſtill attempting to bring it to ſuck the Mother's milk, which is the beſt Phyſick or food it can take.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Child ſucks it's own Mother, which, with a very few exceptions, would be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012344_0020_0F88EF34E9D605A0"/>beſt for every Child and every Mother, Nature has provided it with ſuch wholſome and ſuitable nouriſhment; ſuppoſing her a temperate Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that makes ſome uſe of her limbs, it can hardly do amiſs. The Mother would likewiſe, in moſt hyſterical nervous caſes, eſtabliſh her own health by it though ſhe were weak and ſickly before, as well as that of her offspring. For theſe reaſons I could wiſh, that every Woman that is able, whoſe fountains are not greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed or tainted, would give ſuck to her Child. I am very ſure, that forcing back the milk, which moſt young Women muſt have in great abundance, may be of fatal conſequence: ſometimes it endangers life, and often lays the foundation of many incurable diſeaſes. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are given for this practice are very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and drawn from falſe premiſes; that ſome Women are too weak to bear ſuch a drain, which would rob them of their nouriſhment. This is a very miſtaken notion; for the firſt general cauſe of moſt peoples diſeaſes is, not want of nouriſhment as here imagined, but too great a fulneſs and redundancy of humours; good at firſt, but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than the body can employ or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, they ſtagnate, degenerate, and the whole maſs becomes corrupt, and produces many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012344_0021_0F88EF35AF82C010"/>This is confirmed by the general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Phyſicians, who make holes in the ſkin, perpetual bliſters, iſſues, &amp;c. to let out the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity. I would therefore leave it to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether the throwing back ſuch a load of humour, as a Woman's firſt milk, be moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mend her conſtitution, or make her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints irremediable. The Mother's firſt milk is purgative, and cleanſes the Child of it's long-hoarded excrement; no Child, therefore, can be deprived of it without manifeſt injury. By degrees it changes its property, becomes leſs purgative, and more nouriſhing; and is the beſt and only food the Child likes, or ought to have for ſome time. If I could prevail, no Child ſhould ever be crammed with any unnatural mixture, till the proviſion of Nature was ready for it; nor afterwards fed with any ungenial alien diet whatever, at leaſt for the <hi>firſt three months</hi>: for it is not able to digeſt and aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late other aliments ſooner. I have ſeen very healthy fine Children, that never eat or drank any thing whatever but the Mother's milk for the firſt ten or twelve months. Nature ſeems to direct this, by giving them no teeth 'till about that time. There is uſually milk enough with the firſt Child; ſometimes more than it can
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012344_0022_0F88EF366D430D28"/>take: it is poured forth from an exuberant, overflowing urn, by a bountiful hand, that never provides ſparingly. The call of Nature ſhould be waited for to feed it with any thing more ſubſtantial, and the appetite ever precede the food; not only with regard to the daily meals, but thoſe changes of diet, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, increaſing life requires. But this is never done in either caſe, which is one the greateſt miſtakes of all Nurſes. Thus far Nature, if ſhe be not interrupted, will do the whole buſineſs perfectly well; and there ſeems to be nothing left for a Nurſe to do, but to keep the Child clean and ſweet, and to tumble and toſs it about a good deal, play with it, and keep it in good humour.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Child requires more ſolid ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, we are to enquire what, and how much, is moſt proper to give it. We may be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, there is a great miſtake either in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or quality of Childrens food, or both, as it is uſually given them; becauſe they are made ſick by it; for to this miſtake I cannot help im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting nine in ten of all their diſeaſes. As to quantity, there is a moſt ridiculous error in the common practice; for it is generally ſuppoſed,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012344_0023_0F88EF3739080190"/>that whenever a Child cries, it wants victuals; and it is accordingly fed, ten, twelve, or more times in a day and night. This is ſo obvious a miſapprehenſion, that I am ſurprized it ſhould ever prevail. If a Child's wants and motions be diligently and judiciouſly attended to, it will be found that it never cries but from pain: now the firſt ſenſations of hunger are not attended with pain; accordingly a Child (I mean this of a very young one) that is hungry, will make a hundred other ſigns of its want, before it will cry for food. If it be healthy and quite eaſy in it's dreſs, it will hardly ever cry at all. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe ſigns and motions I ſpeak of are but rarely to be obſerved; becauſe it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that Children are ever ſuffered to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. In a few, very few, whom I have had the the pleaſure to ſee reaſonably nurſed, that were not fed above two or three times in four and twenty hours, and yet were perfectly healthy, active, and happy; I have ſeen theſe ſignals, which were as intelligible as if they had ſpoken.</p>
            <p>THERE are many faults in the quality of their food: it is not ſimple enough. Their paps, panada's, gruels, &amp;c. are generally enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſugar, ſpice, and ſometimes a drop of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012344_0024_0F88EF37F6EE60C0"/>wine; neither of which they ought ever to taſte. Our bodies never want them: they are what luxury only has introduced, to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the health of mankind. It is not enough that their food be ſimple, it ſhould be alſo light. Several people, I find, are miſtaken in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what is light; and fancy that moſt kinds of paſtry, puddings, cuſtards, &amp;c. are light, that is, light of digeſtion. But there is nothing heavier in this ſenſe than unfermented flour and eggs boiled hard, which are the chief ingredients of thoſe preparations. What I mean by light, to give the beſt idea I can of it, is any ſubſtance that is eaſily ſeparated, and ſoluble in warm water. Good bread is the lighteſt thing I know; the power of due fermentation, in which conſiſts the whole art of making it, breaks and attenuates the tenacious particles of the flour, ſo as to give it theſe qualities I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make it the fitteſt food for young Children. Cowes milk is alſo ſimple and light, and very good for them; but it is injudiciouſly prepared: it ſhould not be boiled, for boiling alters the taſte and property of it, deſtroys it's ſweetneſs, and makes it thicker, heavier, and leſs fit to mix and aſſimilate with the blood.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012344_0025_0F88EF3999D79DA8"/>But the chief objection is, that their food is wholly vegetable, the bad conſequence of which is, that it will turn ſour in their ſtomachs. The firſt and general cauſe of all the diſeaſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, is manifeſtly this aceſcent quality of all their food. If any of theſe vegetable prepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have named, be kept in a degree of heat equal to that of a Child's ſtomach, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſour as vinegar in a few hours time. Theſe things are therefore very improper to feed a Child wholly with. Some part of it's diet ſhould be contrived to have a contrary tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſuch as we find only in fleſh, which is the direct oppoſite to acid, and tends to putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In a due mixture of theſe two extremes, correcting each other, conſiſts that ſalubrity of aliment our nature ſeems to require. As we are partly carnivorous animals, a child ought not to be fed wholly upon vegetables. The Mother's milk, when it is perfectly good, ſeems to be this true mixture of the animal and vegetable properties, that agrees beſt with the conſtitution of a Child; readily paſſes into good blood, requiring but a gentle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the powers of circulation to break and ſubdue it's particles and make them ſmooth and round, and eaſily diviſible. I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012344_0026_0F88EF3A31A20630"/>therefore, that one half of infants diet be thin light broths, with a little bread or rice boiled in them; which laſt is not ſo aceſcent as any other kind of meal or flour. Theſe broths ſhould be made with the fleſh of full-grown animals, becauſe their juices are more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate; eſpecially if they have never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be fatted. The juices of a young ox, taken from the plough, make the fineſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and moſt wholſome ſoup. I believe it is for the ſame reaſon, the fleſh of all wild ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals has a higher taſte than that of tame, ſagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ones, and is therefore moſt agreeable to the palate of the luxurious: but this is to be underſtood of thoſe creatures that feed on corn or herbage. The other part of Childrens diet may be a little toaſted bread and water boiled almoſt dry and then mixed with freſh milk, not boiled<note n="*" place="bottom">The LONDON Bakers are ſuſpected of putting Alum in their bread, which would be very pernicious to Infants; therefore ruſks, or the biſcuits called tops-and-bottoms, or rice may be uſed inſtead of it. Theſe will not turn ſour ſo ſoon as common bread; which quality is undoubtedly an objection to uſing much of it, eſpecially when Children are weakly. The ſafeſt and beſt method in my opinion is not to feed them at all; at leaſt till they are ſix or eight months old. The fineſt Children I ever ſaw lived wholly upon ſucking till after that age.</note>. This without ſugar, ſpice, or any
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012344_0027_0F88EF3AEAAB4F30"/>other pretended amendment whatever, would be perfectly light and wholſome, of ſufficient nouriſhment, ſomething like milk from the cow, with the additional ſtrength and ſpirit of bread in it. Twice a day, and not oftener, a ſucking Child ſhould be fed at firſt; once with the broth, and once with the milk thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. As to the quantity at each time, it's appetite muſt be the meaſure of that; it's hunger ſhould be ſatisfied, but no more; for Children will always eat with ſome eagerneſs full as much as they ought: therefore it muſt be very wrong to go beyond that, and ſtuff them 'till they ſpew, as the common method is. They ſhould not be laid on their backs to be fed, but held in a ſitting poſture, that ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing may be eaſier to them, and that they may the more readily diſcover when they have had enough. When they come to be about TEN or TWELVE MONTHS old, and their appetite &amp; digeſtion grows ſtrong, they may be fed three times a day; which, I think, they ought never to exceed their whole lives after. By night I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012344_0028_0F88EF3CEFC20F18"/>would not have them fed or ſuckled at all, that they might at leaſt be hungry in the morning. It is this night feeding that makes them ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat and bloated. If they be not uſed to it at at firſt, and, perhaps, awaked on purpoſe, they will never ſeek it; and if they are not diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the birth, in a week's time they will get into a habit of ſleeping all or moſt part of the night very quietly; awaking poſſibly once or twice for a few minutes when they are wet, and ought to be changed. Their meals, and in my opinion, their ſucking too, ought to be at ſtated times, and the ſame every day; that the ſtomach may have intervals to digeſt, and the appetite return. The Child would ſoon be quite eaſy &amp; ſatisfied in the habit; much more ſo, than when taught to expect food at all times, and at every little fit of crying and uneaſineſs. Let this method be obſerved about a TWELVE-MONTH, when, and not before, they may be weaned; not all at once, but by inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; that they may neither feel, nor fret at the want of the breaſt. This might be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily managed, if they were ſuffered to ſuck only at certain times. Were this plan of nurſing literally purſued, the Children kept clean and ſweet, tumbled and toſſed about a good deal,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012344_0029_0F88EF3DDB628750"/>and carried out every day in all weathers, I am confident, that in ſix or eight months time moſt Children would become healthy and ſtrong, would be able to ſit up on the ground without ſupport, to divert themſelves an hour at a time, to the great relief of their Nurſes, would readily find the uſe of their legs, and very ſoon ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>IF it be aſked, whether I mean this of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in general, and that weakly ones, born of unhealthy parents, ſhould be treated in the ſame manner; I anſwer, that it is not ſo common for Children to inherit the diſeaſes of their parents, as is generally imagined; there is much vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar error in this opinion; for people that are very unhealthy ſeldom have Children, eſpecially if the bad health be of the female ſide; and it is generally late in life when chronic diſeaſes take place in moſt Men, when the buſineſs of love is pretty well over: certainly Children can have no title to thoſe infirmities, which their parents have acquired by indolence and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance long after their birth. It is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for people to complain of ails they think hereditary, 'till they are grown up; that is, 'till they have contributed to them by their own ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012344_0030_0F88EF3F75EBCD70"/>and exceſſes, and then are glad to throw their own faults back upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and lament a bad conſtitution, when they have ſpoiled a very good one. It is very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that young Children are troubled with family-diſtempers: indeed, when we find them affected with ſcrophulous or venereal complaints we may reaſonably conclude the taint to have been tranſmitted to them; but theſe caſes are very rare in compariſon of the many others that are falſly, and without the leaſt foundation, imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Parents, when the real cauſe is either in the complainants themſelves, or bad nurſing that has fixed them early in wrong habits. In one ſenſe many diſeaſes may be ſaid to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, prehaps all thoſe of malformation; by which I mean not only deformity and diſtortion, but all thoſe caſes where the fibres and veſſels of one part are weaker in proportion than the reſt; ſo that upon any ſtrain of the body, whether of debauch or too violent exerciſe, the weak part fails firſt, and diſorders the whole. Thus complaints may be produced ſimilar to thoſe of the Parent, owing in ſome meaſure to the ſimilitude of parts, which poſſibly is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, like the features of the face; but yet theſe diſeaſes might never have appeared, but for the immediate acting cauſe, the violence done
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012344_0031_0F88EF40275DE180"/>to the body. Moſt diſtempers have two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the one a particular ſtate of the ſolids and fluids of the body, which diſpoſe it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive certain infections and impulſes; the other, the infection or impulſe itſelf. Now what I contend for is, that though this prediſponent ſtate or habit of the body be heritable, yet the diſeaſes incident to theſe wretched heirs may be avoided, by preventing the active cauſe; which may be done in many caſes by a due attenton to the non-naturals, as they are called; in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er words, by a temperate, active life: in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, by good nurſing. Therefore I conclude, that inſtead of indulging and enfeebling yet more, by the common methods, Children ſo unhappily born; that which I am recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, together with the wholſome milk of a healthy Nurſe, is the beſt, the only means to remedy the evil, and by which alone they may by degrees be made healthy and ſtrong. And thus, in a generation or two of reaſonable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate perſons, every taint and infirmity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the king's-evil and madneſs not excepted, would be totally worn out.</p>
            <p>THE plain natural plan I have laid down is never followed, becauſe moſt Mothers, of any
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012344_0032_0F88EF4545D5A318"/>condition, either cannot, or will not undertake the troubleſome taſk of ſuckling their own Children; which is troubleſome only for want of proper method; were it rightly managed, their would be much pleaſure in it, to every Woman that can prevail upon herſelf to give up a little of the beauty of her breaſt to feed her offspring; though this is a miſtaken notion, for the breaſts are not ſpoiled by giving ſuck, but by growing fat. There would be no fear of offending the huſband's ears with the noiſe of the ſqualling brat. The Child, was it nurſed in this way, would be always quiet, in good humour, ever playing, laughing, or ſleeping. In my opinion, a Man of ſenſe cannot have a prettier rattle (for rattles he muſt have of one kind or other) than ſuch a young Child. I am quite at a loſs to account for the general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſending infants out of doors, to be ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or dry-nurſed by another Woman, who has not ſo much underſtanding, nor can have ſo much affection for it as the Parents; and how it comes to paſs, that people of good ſenſe and eaſy circumſtances will not give themſelves the pains to watch over the health and welfare of their Children; but are ſo careleſs as to give
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012344_0033_0F88EF46ED16B980"/>them up to the common methods, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how near it is to an equal chance, that they are deſtroyed by them. The antient cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of expoſing them to wild beaſts, or drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, would certainly be a much quicker and more humane way of diſpatching them. There are ſome, however who wiſh to have Children, and to preſerve them, but are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their cares about them. To ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I would addreſs myſelf, and recommend it to every Father to have his Child nurſed under his own eye, to make uſe of his own reaſon and ſenſe in ſuperintending and directing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it; nor ſuffer it to be made one of the myſteries of the <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> from which the Men are to be excluded. I would adviſe every Mother that can, for her own ſake, as well as her Child's to ſuckle it. If ſhe be a healthy Woman, it will confirm her health; if weakly, in moſt caſes it will reſtore her. It need be no confinement to her, or abridgment of her time; four times in four and twenty hours will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough to give it ſuck; letting it have as much as it will take out of both breaſts at each time. It may be fed and dreſſed by ſome han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reaſonable ſervant, that will ſubmit to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; whom likewiſe it may ſleep with. No
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012344_0034_0F88EF4900231478"/>other Woman's milk can be ſo good for her Child; and dry-nurſing I look upon to be the moſt unnatural and dangerous method of all; and, according to my obſervation, not one in three ſurvives it. To breed a Child in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial manner, requires more knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the animal oeconomy, than the beſt Nurſe was ever miſtreſs of, as well as more care and attention than is generally beſtowed on Children; the ſkill of a good Phyſician would be neceſſary to manage it rightly. I am very glad this is not the method of the Hoſpital: I believe there is not the leaſt colour of objection to any part of the management of that moſt uſeful and excellent charity, as far as it depends upon the directors of it. Sending the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren out to Country-nurſes, under the care of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors, is undoubtedly the beſt method they could take; but how far theſe Nurſes and their Inſpectors (who, I ſuppoſe, are to be ſome good Gentlewomen in the neighbourhood) may be perſuaded out of their old forms, to treat their Nurſelings a little more reaſonably, is matter of much doubt. I fear they will be too tenacious of their prejudices, as well as opinionated of their ſkill, to be eaſily convinced they are in the wrong; and who ſhall undertake the taſk?
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012344_0035_0F88EF4933485390"/>However, I deſpair not of ſeeing a reformation one day or other; and to contribute to it as as much as lies in my power, I will give you my opinion as to the precautions neceſſary to be taken in the choice of theſe Nurſes; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a few reaſons why the Children, entruſted to their care, ſhould be treated ſome-what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently from thoſe who are nurſed in a more natural way, and ſuck their own Mothers. I make no doubt, but great care is taken, that the Nurſes recommended to the Hoſpital be clean and healthy Women. But this is not enough; the preference ſhould be given to the middle-aged; becauſe they will have more milk than the very young, and more and better than the old. This is a material conſideration, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they have each her own Child to ſuckle beſides. Thoſe between twenty and thirty are certainly of the beſt age. But what I think of the utmoſt conſequence is, that great regard ſhould be had to the time of their lying-in, and thoſe procured, if poſſible, who have not been bro't to bed above two or three months. The reaſon of this is, that Nature intending a Child ſhould ſuck about a twelvemonth, the milk ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues good much longer. About that time, Women in general, though they give ſuck, are
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012344_0036_0F88EF49F2B95A00"/>apt to breed again: ſome, indeed, that are very ſanguine, will breed ſooner; theſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their milk, are apt to be troubled with the <hi>catamenia,</hi> which diſturb it greatly; and therefore are not ſo proper to be made Nurſes of. But, whether they breed or not, it is my opinion, that after a year's time, or thereabouts, however it may agree with the Child that has ſucked it from the firſt, their milk will become ſtale and vapid, at leaſt very unfit for a new-born infant; that if it be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it's own Mother's milk, ought undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to have what is moſt like it; the newer it is, the more ſuitable in all reſpects to it's tender nature. Yet it is a common thing for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſuckle two or three Children ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſame milk.</p>
            <p>A NURSE ought to have great regard to her diet: it is not enough that ſhe be ſober and temperate, her food ſhould conſiſt of a proper mixture of fleſh and vegetables: ſhe ſhould eat one hearty meal of unſalted fleſh-meat eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, with a good deal of garden ſtuff and a little bread. Thin broth or milk would be beſt for her breakfaſt and ſupper. Her drink ſhould be ſmall beer, or milk and water; but upon no account ſhould ſhe ever touch a drop
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012344_0037_0F88EF4AA8E2CC00"/>of wine or ſtrong drink, much leſs any kind of ſpirituous liquors: giving ale or brandy to a Nurſe is, in effect, giving it the Child; and it is eaſy to conclude what would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>THE Children, likewiſe, thus ſent out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a particular treatment. The plan I would lay down, could I prevail, ſhould be that of Nature, excluding Art and foreign aid entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But when this is broke in upon, a little adventitious ſkill becomes indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; that if we are not perfectly right in following cloſely the deſign of Nature, we may co-operate a little, and not be totally wrong in counter-acting it, as is too often the caſe. What I mean is, that every Child, not allowed the Mother's firſt milk, whether it be dry-nurſed, or ſuckled by another Woman, ſhould be purged in a day or two after the birth; and this purging continued for ſome time: not by regular doſes of phyſick, that may operate all at once; but ſome lenient laxative ſhould he contrived, and given two or three times a day, ſo as to keep the Child's body open for the firſt nine days, or fortnight; leſſening the quantity inſenſibly, 'till it be left
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012344_0038_0F88EF4B696EE348"/>off. It ſhould be ſo managed, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the artifical phyſick may reſemble that of the natural. This is ſo material, that, for want of it, moſt Children within the firſt month break out in pimples all over; the Nurſes call it the red-gum, and look upon it to be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing, and that the children will be unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that have it not. So indeed they will be in all likelihood; and it is better that theſe foulneſſes, which become acrid and hot by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining too long in the body, ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged through the ſkin; than not at all; or that they ſhould be lodged in the blood, or fall upon the vitals, to lay the foundation of numberleſs future evils; but it is chiefly owing to the neglect of this method at firſt. A Child that ſucks it's own mother, unleſs it be greatly over-fed, or kept too hot, will never be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this humour at all. If the Children that are brought to the Hoſpital be not above a month old, and if it be found, upon enquiry, that they have not ſucked their own Mothers, ſomething of this kind preſcribed them would not be too late and improper. The following form may be uſed: Take manna, pulp of caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, of each half an ounce; diſſolve them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three ounces of thin broth. Let the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012344_0039_0F88EF4D884E6760"/>Child take two ſpoonfuls three times a day, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the quantity according to the effect; which, at firſt, ought to be three or four ſtools in four and twenty hours.</p>
            <p>ORDERS ſhould be given theſe Nurſes to keep the Children awake by day, as long as they are diſpoſed to be ſo, and to amuſe and keep them in good humour all they can; not to lull and rock them to ſleep, or to continue their ſleep too long; which is only done to ſave their own time and trouble, to the great detriment of the Childrens health, ſpirits, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. With regard to feeding them, as it is not likely they ſhould have milk enough to ſupport two, their own, and the Hoſpitial-child; it is beſt they ſhould begin immediately according to the method I have recommended, if they or their inſpectors can be perſuaded to think it right; which however, I would not have underſtood ſo ſtrictly, but it might ſometimes be a little varied, preſerving only the intention, I would adviſe, however, if it be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, now and then, to give them, as they grow up, a little bread and butter perfectly ſweet and freſh, and allowed but in very ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; otherwiſe it will be apt to turn bitter
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012344_0040_0F88EF4E66518260"/>and rancid in the ſtomach, and foul all the jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the body. A Child may be allowed any kind of mellow fruit, either raw, ſtewed, or baked; roots of all ſorts, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the kitchen-garden. I am ſure all theſe things are wholeſome and good for them, and every one elſe, notwithſtanding the idle notion of their being windy, which they are only to very debauched ſtomachs; and ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> milk; but no Man's blood wants the cleanſing refreſhing power of milk more than his, whoſe ſtomach, uſed to inflammatory things of high reliſh, will not bear the firſt chill of it. To Children, all this kind of food, taken in moderation, is perfectly grateful and ſalutary. Some may think that they carry into the ſtomach the eggs of future worms; but of this I am not very apprehenſive; for I believe there are few things we eat or drink, that do not convey them. But then they can never be hatched in a healthy inſide, where all the juices are ſweet and good, and every gland performs it's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: the gall in particular, would deſtroy them: bullocks gall has been found to be a good and ſafe vermifuge. It is my opinion, we ſwallow the eggs of many little animals, that are never
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012344_0041_0F88EF50071552F0"/>brought into life within us, except where they find a fit neſt or lodgment in the acid phlegm or vitiated humours of the ſtomach and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Were theſe totally diſcharged every day, and the food of yeſterday employed in nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſuperfluity thrown off to the laſt grain, no worms could ever breed or harbour in our vitals. As ſoon as the Children have any teeth, at ſix or eight months they may by degrees be uſed to a little flesh-meat; which they are always very fond of, much more ſo at firſt, than of any confectionary or paſtry wares, with which they ſhould never debauch their taſte.</p>
            <p>BREEDING teeth has been thought to be, and is fatal to many Children; but I am confident this is not from Nature: for it is no diſeaſe, or we could not be well in health 'till one or two and twenty, or later. Teeth are breeding the greateſt part of that time; and it is my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the laſt teeth give more pain than the firſt, as the bones and gums they are to pierce, are grown more firm and hard. But, whatever fever, fits, or other dangerous ſymptoms ſeem to attend this operation of Nature, healthy Children have ſometimes bred their teeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012344_0042_0F88EF50A613C1C8"/>any ſuch bad attendants; which ought to incline us to ſuſpect the evil not to be natural, but rather the effect of too great a fulneſs, or the corrupt humours of the body put into agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the ſtimulating pain the tooth cauſes in breaking its way out. This, I believe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happens without ſome pain, and poſſibly a little fever; but if the blood and juices be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſweet and good, and there be not too great a redundancy of them, both will be but ſlight, and paſs off imperceptibly, without any bad conſequence whatever. The chief intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the method I am recommending is, to preſerve the humours of the body in this ſtate; and therefore, if it ſucceeds, Children ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged will breed their teeth with leſs pain and danger than are commonly obſerved to attend this work of Nature.</p>
            <p>AS I have ſaid, that the firſt and general cauſe of moſt of the diſeaſes infants are liable to is the acid corruption of their food; it may not be amiſs juſt to mention an eaſy and certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, or rather preventative, if given timely, at the firſt appearance of predominating acid; which is very obvious from the crude, white, or green ſtools, gripes and purgings occaſioned
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012344_0043_0F88EF56C2660F38"/>by it. The common method, when theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms appear, is to give the pearl-julep, crab's eye, and the teſtaceous powders; which, though they do abſorb the acidities, have this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in their effect, that they are apt to lodge in the body, and bring on a coſtiveneſs, very detrimental to infants, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little manna, or ſome gentle purge, to be given frequently to carry them off. Inſtead of theſe, I would recommend a certain fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid powder, called <hi>Magneſia alba,</hi> which, at the ſame time that it corrects and ſweetens all ſourneſſes, rather more effectually than the teſtaceous powders, is likewiſe a lenient purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and keeps the body gently open. This is the only alkaline purge I know of, and which our diſpenſatories have long wanted. I have taken it myſelf, and given it to others for the heart-burn, and find it to be the beſt and moſt effectual remedy for that complaint. It may be given to Children from one to two drams a day, a little at a time, in all their food, 'till the acidities be quite overcome, and the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſymptoms diſappear entirely. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given it with good and great effect, even when the Children have been far gone in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes firſt brought on by prevailing acid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:012344_0044_0F88EF584F88BEE0"/>IT is always eaſier to prevent diſeaſes than to cure them; and as neither Children, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed grown perſons, are ever ſeized with chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diſeaſes ſuddenly, the progreſs of decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health being perceptibly gradual, it is no difficult matter for a Phyſician of common ſkill to obſerve the firſt ſtep towards illneſs, and to foretel the conſequence, in all thoſe whoſe habit of life is well known to him. But to Parents and Nurſes in general, theſe obſervations may not occur; I will therefore point out a few cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſigns and ſymptoms, by which they may be aſſured that a Child's health is decaying, even before it appears to be ſick. If theſe are neglected, the evil increaſes, grows from bad to worſe, and more violent and apparent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints will follow, and perhaps end in incurable diſeaſes, which a timely remedy, or a ſlight change in the diet and manner of life, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prevented. The firſt tendency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe may be obſerved in a Child's breath. It is not enough the breath be not offenſive; it ſhould be ſweet &amp; fragrant like a noſegay of freſh flowers, or a pail of new milk from a young cow that feeds upon the ſweeteſt graſs of the ſpring; and this as well at firſt waking in the morning, as all day long. It is always ſo with Children
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012344_0045_0F88EF58EA09BFD0"/>that are in perfect delicate health. As ſoon, therefore, as a Child's breath is found to be either hot or ſtrong, or ſour, we may be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that digeſtion and ſurfeit have fouled and and diſturbed the blood, and now is the time to apply a proper remedy, and prevent a train of impending evils. Let the Child be reſtrained in it's food; eat leſs, live upon milk or thin broth for a day or two; be carried, or walk if it is able, a little more than uſual in the open air. Let a little of this powder, or any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per phyſick, be given; not that I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe phyſic to be made familiar, but one doſe adminiſterd now would prevent the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a great many, that might afterwards be preſcribed with much leſs good effect.</p>
            <p>IF this firſt ſymptom of approaching illneſs be overlooked, the Child, who, if it was heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, would lie quiet as a log all night, will have diſturbed ſleep, reſtleſſneſs, terrifying dreams; will be talking, ſtarting, kicking and tumbling about; or ſmiling and laughing, as is common with very young Children when they are griped, and the Nurſes ſay they ſee and converſe with Angels. After this will follow loſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and complexion, check of growth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of ſtrength, cough, conſumption; or elſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012344_0046_0F88EF59A85754E0"/>colicks, gripes, worms, fits, &amp;c. diſeaſes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all the ſkill of a good Phyſician; and happy for them, if the utmoſt he can employ will reſtore them to any degree of laſting health.</p>
            <p>THERE is one thing more which I forgot to mention in it's proper place, and therefore I muſt take notice of it here; that is, the degree of exerciſe proper for Children. This is of more conſequence that all the reſt; for without it, all our care in feeding and cloathing will not ſucceed to our wiſhes: but when by due degrees a Child is brought to bear a good deal of exerciſe without fatigue, it is inconceivable how much impropriety and abſurdity in both thoſe articles it will endure unhurt. A Child, therefore, ſhould be puſhed forwards, and taught to walk as ſoon as poſſible. A healthy Child a year old will be able to walk alone. This we may call the aera of their deliverance; for this great difficulty ſurmounted, they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do well, by getting out of the Nurſe's hands to ſhift for themſelves. And here I muſt endeavour to correct a great miſtake, which is, that moſt people think it wrong to put weakly Children upon their legs, eſpecially if they are the leaſt bent or crooked; but whoever will
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012344_0047_0F88EF5A67689F80"/>venture the experiment will ſurely find, that crooked legs will grow in time ſtrong and ſtraight by frequent walking, while diſuſe will make them worſe and worſe every day. As they grow daily more and more able, let their walks be gradually increaſed, 'till they can walk two miles on a ſtretch without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs; which they will be very well able to do before they are three years old, if they are accuſtomed to it every day. To lead them ſuch a walk ſhould be impoſed as an indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble taſk upon their maids; for to them it will be the higheſt pleaſure; ſo far from a burden to them, that if they perform the daily duty, they will, from the impulſe of their own active vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, be found running, leaping and playing, all day long. Thus, a dull, heavy Child may be made playful and ſprightly, a weakly one healthy and ſtrong, and confirmed in good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and perpetual health.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome other little niceties, that, were they obſerved in the nurſing of Children, would be of ſome uſe to them, ſuch as making them lie ſtraight in bed, I do not mean extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a corpſe, but that their limbs may be free and eaſy. I have ſometimes ſeen Children
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012344_0048_0F88EF5B2A5DF668"/>a year or two old lie doubled up in bed as in the womb, eſpecially in cold weather, and from the conſtraint of their poſture fall into profuſe ſweats. This will be prevented if they are laid ſtraight, and ſleep relaxing all the muſcles of the body, the knees will naturally be bent a little. They ſhould be taught to uſe both hands alike; for employing one more than the other, will not only make the hand and arm ſo uſed, but alſo that ſide of the body, bigger than the other. This is ſometimes the cauſe of crookedneſs. It would likewiſe not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to forward their ſpeaking plain, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain diſtinct words to them, inſtead of the namby-pamby ſtile, and giving them back their own broken inarticulate attempts; by which means, I believe, ſome Children ſcarcely ſpeak intelligibly at ſeven years of age. I think they cannot be made reaſonable creatures too ſoon.</p>
            <p>THESE few looſe thoughts on the ſubject of nurſing Children, I ſend you for your private ſatisfaction, if they be lucky enough to give you any. I have neither time nor patience to think of form and order, or ſupporting them
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012344_0049_0F88EF5BE99CEC70"/>by affected demonſtrations taken from mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical principles and powers. All I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured is to be intelligible and uſeful; and therefore I have avoided, as much as poſſible, all terms of art; together with learned quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as often produced out of vanity, and to ſhow deep reading, as for the ſake of proof. If you think it may be of any uſe to publiſh this Letter, I am not unwilling it ſhould appear; if not, do with it what you pleaſe. I deliver it up as a FOUNDLING, to be diſpoſed of as you think proper. I ſhall only add, by way of perſuaſive to thoſe who may be inclined to make trial of the method I recommend, that I am a Father, and have already practiſed it with the moſt deſirable ſucceſs.</p>

                  <hi>P. S.</hi> IT is now above twenty years ſince I wrote the foregoing eſſay, and though I have made a few alterations, it was only to explain thoſe paſſages that contained any apparent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or obſcurity; I have never yet found
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012344_0050_0F88EF5E472CBF08"/>cauſe to alter eſſentially any one opinion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in it. I have thro' the whole induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured at the greateſt plaineſs and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and yet my meaning has been much miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aken. Some have very ſtrangely expected to find in it the general cure of Childrens diſeaſes, though it be profeſſedly wrote only to prevent them, by eſtabliſhing good health; a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing (whatever people may think) from the cure of diſeaſes. Sick or weak Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, whether ſuch by Nature or made ſuch by bad Nurſing, cannot perhaps be brought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the habits here recommended, but muſt firſt be cured of their maladies by a ſkilful phyſician, who, if he be alſo an honeſt man, will introduce theſe or ſimilar habits of management, to continue them in health and ſtrength. But in treating their diſeaſes, as well as in nurſing them I am very ſure many capital errors are committed. I object greatly in particular to the frequent uſe of antimonial and mercurial medicines; which, tho' they give ſometimes a little temporary releif, by diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crude and phlegmatic humours, killing worms, &amp;c. I am very confident a repeated uſe of them breaks the blood, relaxes the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012344_0051_0F88EF608C3DE558"/>and is every way deſtructive to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Children. Preſent relief ſeems to be all that is deſired, and therefore all that is intended by medication; the ſlow but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent effects of good habits few have patience to expect. Others have neglected eſſentials, to lay ſtreſs only upon trifles: A Lady of great ſway among her acquaintance told me not long ago, with an air of reproach, that ſhe had nurſed her Child according to my book, and it died. I aſked, if ſhe had ſuckled it herſelf? No. Had it ſucked any other woman? It was dry-nurſed. Then Madam, you cannot impute your misfortune to my advice, for you have taken a methed quite contrary to it, in the moſt capital point. Oh but, according to my direction, it had never worn ſtockings. Madam, Children may die, though they do or do not wear ſtockings.</p>

            <p>SERMONS to young Women, by James Fordyce, D. D. an eminent diſſenting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in London.</p>
            <p>Though this Author is a profeſſed advocate for that ſex, which leads the world, he does not however addreſs them in
<pb facs="unknown:012344_0053_0F88EF631A91B648"/>the uſual ſtrains of flattery and adoration, but in the ſober and impartial ſtile of friendſhip. He entertains the higheſt idea of their importance and deſtination; and does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in that debaſing light in which they are too often conſidered, as formed only to be domeſtic drudges, and the ſlaves of our pleaſures; but as intended to be reaſonable and agreable companions, faithful and affectionate friends, the SWEETNESS and the CHARM OF HUMAN LIFE. There are no compoſitions of this kind in the Engliſh language in which are to be found greater delicacy of ſentiment, correctneſs of imagination, elegance of taſte, or that contain ſuch genuine pictures of life and manners. <hi>Happy the Mothers who follow his Maxims in forming the taſte and manners of their daughters! Happy, thrice happy the daughters who are bleſſed with ſuch mothers.</hi>

            <p>The reader of taſte, during the peruſal of this admirable poem (which is not inferior to any in the Engliſh language) will enjoy ineffable delight in all its variety. The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beautiful and luxuriant <hi>Scenes</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>—of the genial ſeaſons,—of the rural haunts of innocence and peace, will now expand the heart with joy, and now ſooth into the tendereſt complacency.—The ſtrength and cogency of the proofs in favor of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion,</hi> adorned with all the graces of poetry, it is hoped will contribute to convince the judgment, and impreſs the mind with the warmeſt ſentiments of gratitude.—The ſcenes of miſery and diſtreſs incident to <hi>Human Life</hi> drawn by the pen of ſo feeling a writer, and heightened with the true colours of genius, will wring the throbbing breaſt with pangs of commiſeration, will awake all the finer movements of the ſoul, and improve the reader in the virtues of Humanity.</p>
