            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>FREQUENT addreſſes exclude us from the common topicks; but in ſeeking variety, we ought not to forget our inſtitution. The
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033405_0003_0FF6EA0D05122FF0"/>hiſtory and the character of our order have the firſt claims upon our attention, and will be the beſt guide to our duty.</p>
            <p>WHEN our Order was introduced into this Colony, and from Boſton into Britiſh America, an evident change had begun in the manners and the political ſentiments of the people. The ancient rigour of church diſcipline had been relaxed, and the crown was attempting to increaſe its prerogative. But the political proſpects of the country were enlarged. Intereſt, rather than relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, had drawn men into the capital, and the general character was at a criſis. The ſon of a biſhop had been in the chair, and a conſpicuous prelate
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dean Berkeley, afterwards Biſhop.</note> was in America, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to enjoy a religious eſtabliſhment. The ſhort life of governor Burnet prepared for the advancement of governor Belcher. Political men, whatever ſyſtem they may adopt, are ſure to accompliſh a change of manners in a ſimple people. The courts having been repeatedly removed from the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033405_0004_0FF6EA0FD849B660"/>capital, new aſſociations were formed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the new form of power. Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters and churches exerted, in ſecret, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they no longer openly claimed. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher yielded in turn to all parties, in hopes to reconcile them. He had been in Germany and in England, and was acquainted with our order, which he permitted one of his family to encourage. When aſſociations had become common, it was to be expected, and to be hoped, that ſome would exiſt free from party ſtrife, and remain ſacred to ſocial pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. For this purpoſe, with the manners of Europe, MASONRY was introduced. It has continued to ſpread, as our country has been prepared for its growth.</p>
            <p>AT preſent, the number of Brethren in Boſton is greater than in any place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Union. But the increaſe has been great in our capital, ſince the revolution, particularly in the number of Lodges. The ſpirit of the people, among whom early aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations appeared, has formed an habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Their political clubs, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033405_0005_0FF6EA1173645B58"/>ſocieties, their marine ſociety, their private clubs for friendſhip, for religion, for letters and for humanity: All their ſocial inſtitutions flouriſh together. As they riſe or ſink upon compariſon, the number of the aſſociated is not leſſened, but the relation is changed at pleaſure, as age, taſte, or duty may lead. Such an aſſociated place may not be found upon the globe, or ſuch harmony. Hardly any man of rank, or reputation is to be found, who has not had his club nights, and theſe are frequently paſſed in private houſes. What a change the increaſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic amuſements may accompliſh, is not to be imagined from preſent conſequences. We are happy in an appeal to the public, whether Maſons, in their public character have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the ſpirit of their Inſtitution. Bad men have been found. But Maſons have lived in love, without any interference with Church or State.</p>
            <p>THEIR progreſs has lately been rapid. Petitions are conſtantly before the GRAND LODGE for new Lodges. They accompany
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033405_0006_0FF6EA13E510FBB0"/>the increaſing wealth and independence of the YEOMANRY, and will continue while we enjoy our unexampled proſperity. Such are the proſpects of an Inſtitution, deſigned to preſerve the purity and the full extent of private friendſhip by aſſociation. An Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which never hopes to influence the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State; which knows no ſect in relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; and no qualification but of the good cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen. May it be glorious in its ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>IN paſſing over an hiſtory of ſixty years, we are able fairly to judge of the cauſes, which have operated againſt our Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in our own country and the world; and while we obſerve the oppoſition to its progreſs, we may learn the duties we owe to its character and reputation. And we may conſider three principal cauſes. The Clergy, who have an influence upon the popular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, being the guardians of the public morals; the Magiſtrates, who are inveſted with the civil authority; and that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful engine, <hi>ridicule,</hi> which has wrought the moſt powerful effects upon the human mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033405_0007_0FF6EA1630F11550"/>
WHEN we ſpeak of the Clergy, we intend not the order, but certain men in it. And we regard not theſe men, ſo much as the age in which they have lived, and the prejudices they have entertained. Father Robinſon juſtly ſaid,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Robinſon's Claude, on the compoſition of a Sermon.</note> "The hiſtory of the Pulpit is curious and entertaining. It has ſpoken all languages, and in all ſorts of ſtyle. It has partaken of all the cuſtoms of the Schools, the Theatres and the Courts of all Countries, where it has been erected. It has been a ſeat of wiſdom, and a ſink of nonſenſe. It has been filled by the beſt and the worſt of men. It has proved in ſome hands, a trumpet of ſedition, and in others, a ſource of peace and conſolation." When we ſpeak of the Clergy then, we ſpeak not of the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We love the prieſt in the patriarch of the firſt families of mankind, and we hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the Clergy, as the enlightened friends of the beſt civil ſociety. But into this order, men will intrude, who have ſtudied their Bible, and not mankind for whom it was
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033405_0008_0FF6EA187300EE38"/>written. Who know more of their own opinions from dogmas, than from hiſtory and inveſtigation. And who hate what they have not been taught to practice, having never aſſociated with mankind. Such as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy an ingenuous concern for the morals of ſociety, and maintain a conſtant vigilance againſt the prevalent abuſes of all inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while they diſtinguiſh the abuſes from the inſtitutions themſelves, we reverence. We aſk their reproofs, and we are ſure, that they will be candid. Let theſe righteous men ſmite us, and it will be kindneſs. Their leſſons will eſtabliſh us, and not deſtroy us. It is into the hands of other men we fear to fall.—Men, who have no charity for each other, and ſo ſurely can have no charity for us. Who hate the neareſt ſect moſt, not becauſe it is the worſt, but becauſe it is the neareſt. Not becauſe it moſt obſtructs the light from heaven, but becauſe it obſcures the light of their fame and intereſt. Men who ply the ſhuttlecock of faith, with the dexterity of expert gameſters, and have the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033405_0009_0FF6EA1AB9451E18"/>art of making the multitude fly with its feathers. What do they blame? Is it aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation! They cannot blame this abſolutely. For if there be a charge againſt them, it is for the abuſe of this principle in their own intereſt. They muſt then charge us with an abuſe of our aſſociation. The charge they find in our manners, not in our principles. But they charge all ſects in Chriſtendom, with the ſame tendency, when they have the beſt men on earth belonging to them. But what is the abuſe. <hi>All</hi> Maſons are not ſober men. Let us try to reform them then. Paul tells us, that the Chriſtians of his days turned the Communion into an exceſs, by which ſome loſt their lives. Maſons have not done worſe than this. But did Paul upſet the tables, and rout the company, and ſay that he would have no eating and drinking together, as long as he lived. No. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented means to correct abuſes. And to all, who will be ſo kind, we will hearken. The cauſes of illiberal conduct can be eaſily known. Men have been ignorant of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033405_0010_0FF6EA1D05FC68E0"/>ſects, to which they have been intolerant, and ignorance has been the parent of their fears. Education has excited an abhorrence, which intereſt has ſtrengthened. The prev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent vulgar errors have given the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude into their power. But to whom are we more indebted, than to the wiſe men of the Clergy. The ſcandal will be removed, when the order becomes enlightened. The civil authority has been exerciſed with greater wiſdom, as it has been leſs under eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal influence.—Becauſe more was feared for the Church, than the State. As we recede from the power of the Church, which like the cold of the North has checked the growth of every thing divine, we advance towards a milder ſky. The bigotry of Spain, and the power of the Inquiſition in Portugal, opened a perſecution againſt every thing they did not create, and could not abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The toleration found neceſſary for the population of Rome, proved more benign, and as the Princes of Italy gave freedom to Commerce, they became leſs ſuſpicious of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033405_0011_0FF6EA1F68062B88"/>foreign Inſtitutions. In France, which ſo bravely maintained the Gallican privileges againſt the Univerſal Biſhop, and thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervated the power of the Church, MASONRY had full encouragement in the genius of the nation. The Church had been already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed not to refuſe amuſements, but to aſſociate them even with religion. Here MASONRY appeared with a pomp and parade, unknown in any other country, and here it had its additional grades, to which no other nation had advanced. At Court theſe grades were not unknown. In Germany, theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations were in the ſpirit of the North, and the antiquities of the North ſhew the nobility as members and patrons. Such have been the moſt eminent Princes of the empire. Such was the great Hero of Pruſſia, and ſuch are the Princes of thoſe happy and well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Regions.</p>
            <p>IN the Britiſh Empire, the parent of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Maſonry,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſtinguiſhed from the Eclectic.</note> its progreſs has been well known, from the connexion between their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033405_0012_0FF6EA21A5C962B8"/>hiſtory and language and our own. The Engliſh nobility, but particularly the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have eſteemed its honours. The ſpirit has been well preſerved among the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iriſh, and has never been degraded by the Scots. The Britiſh Colonies in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, have preſerved its reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the Republics, it has had all its character, as Holland will aſſure us. Guarded againſt political diſcuſſions, it can give no cauſe of jealouſy to an enlightened admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration. And ſacred to friendſhip, it will always bleſs the public ſpirit. But in its triumph, it has had <hi>ſullen,</hi> and not always ſilent foes. Its <hi>ſimplicity</hi> only can enſure it general ſucceſs, yet this ſimplicity has been an objection, even to higher inſtitutions. Superſtition has impoſed an unkind opinion upon the vulgar. Other Inſtitutions have been jealous. Suſpicion has hovered over its ſecrets, and bad conſequences, if they have not been known, have been feared. As all ſocieties have degraded each other, by charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033405_0013_0FF6EA23E3BEB608"/>the vices of a <hi>few</hi> upon the many, we have alſo had a part in the ſhame.</p>
            <p>RIDICULE, ever buſy, not only to expoſe, but inſult, has been licenſed in all its choſen ſhafts. Proud of the laughter of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it has ſtrengthened objections, without the trouble to examine them. Ridicule, doubtleſs, is a choſen inſtrument in the hand of TRUTH. When a ſharpened arrow of the judgment, and guided by the eye of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whither benevolence points its way and gives it ſtrength to enter, it demands all the genius of SHAFTESBURY to give it due praiſe. But though it be a ſharp, it ſhould not be a poiſoned arrow. If it pierce error, it ſhould not wound the ſoul. Then the memory holds the ſhame of error, while the underſtanding hates the blame. We are our own phyſicians in the remedy. But ſuch is not the common ridicule of the world. It is as far from it as the kiſs of a friend, from the dagger of an aſſaſſin. When preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ſports with falſe alluſions, fear is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened into hatred, and truth is bent into
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033405_0014_0FF6EA2648A921F0"/>deformity. Ridicule is then poiſon to a weak mind. The moſt ſimple faſhions, the moſt innocent cuſtoms, and the moſt familiar manners may riſe diſguſting to the ſight. As in religious rites, whether it be wine, or bread, or water, each in turn may be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to the ſectary, and the uſe and the end be forgotten. Sympathy may be denied every token of its duty, from fear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. The addreſſes of the Clergy and Brethren have already diſarmed buffoonery, by the moral and religious force given to the MASONIC CONSTITUTIONS. We muſt not ſay, we care not for ill opinions. We ought not to renounce what we approve, if free from blame; but we ought to remember that every thing uſeful to ourſelves and the world, will in ſome degree depend upon character.

            <p>THE preſent ſtate of Europe has fixed the attention of the world upon our order. Its rapid ſpread in the preſent century, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of its members, the coincidence of its deſigns, and its ſecret communications, have contributed to urge enquiries into its hiſtory, its principles, and its influence upon civil ſociety, and to bring the criſis of its fate. The power of political aſſociations was never more ſeriouſly feared, and the alarm has been as great as the danger. No diſcoveries have yet been made, which can fairly impeach the inſtitution of FREE MASONRY. The opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of a country, in which it has had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed honours, will aſſiſt the language of prejudice; but charges which are not well ſupported by the beſt evidence, will not be received by candid minds.

Maſonry has attracted the public notice. More is feared from the aſſociation, than from the principle. Civil ſociety can apprehend no evil, while its leading members are known, and are free from any ſuſpicion of deſigns againſt civil eſtabliſhments. But the progreſs of a new philoſophy, which has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed an important change in the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of Europe, has been great, and this philoſophy has inſinuated itſelf into all ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties. Its friends and its enemies have been aſtoniſhed at its ſucceſs, and while its friends have continued active to combine all cauſes to aid its progreſs, its enemies became more jealous of every thing, which could be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in its ſervice. Queſtions never thought of before, have been aſked about the origin of Free Maſonry. Falſe friends, and ſerious enemies have conſpired to repreſent it, as ſuited the purpoſes of ridicule, or averſion, of their fears, or their wiſhes. But as yet
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033405_0017_0FF7BBEC88F83808"/>they have acted without permanent effect, from the unwarranted boldneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, from their diſagreement in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and the object of the order, and partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly from their ignorance of the manners of the age in which it firſt obtained public notice.</p>
            <p>THE Tomb of Morlai, is one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible efforts which provokes a ſmile from the initiated, but excites pity towards thoſe, who raſhly admit jealouſies uncomfortable to themſelves and their neighbours. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant attempt to repreſent Maſonry as inimical to royalty, has a rival only in the counterpart of Profeſſor Robinſon, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the hiſtory of its uſe among the friends of Charles the firſt of England. But if Morlai, five hundred years ſince, illuminated Lodges with principles hoſtile to royalty, how unhappy were the friends of Charles in the choice of an inſtitution for his defence. But how happy the adepts to remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, till they appeared in the cloſe of the French Revolution "to manage the good
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033405_0018_0FF7BBF300BFECD0"/>natured and benevolent aſſociates of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Lodges." Such men could never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly attempt to trace the inſtitution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch an attempt would have brought them, where ſuch an enmity, by conſent of hiſtorians, was without any political cauſe. Compare the hiſtory of the mother Lodges
<note n="*" place="bottom">Tomb of Morlai: This work ought to be compared with Robinſon.</note> with the hiſtory of their dates in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, eſpecially in Stockholm and in Scotland. Traditions profeſſedly received in this age, have left no belief of a political origin, and they are at leaſt good againſt bold inſinuations. MASONRY, whatever was its ancient hiſtory, has preſerved itſelf free from any imputations of a deſign upon the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or governments of Europe, till the preſent century. Its proſperity has given the alarm. It has embraced men of every character in the ſtate, and in the world of letters. Pride of diſtinction, in imitation of the orders in Europe, induced the Lodges of France and Germany, to accept the orders of the Knights,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033405_0019_0FF7BBF624A3F588"/>while men accuſtomed to literary honors, exceeded even the Univerſities in the number of their degrees. Theſe were ſacred to a more intimate friendſhip, and as they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered innocent prejudices, they were thought beneficial to the common cauſe, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated only to excluſive privileges. But as the practice was not univerſal, and is modern, we can diſtinguiſh the ancient inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from all orders, which have been united with it, as eaſily as we can primitive from corrupted Chriſtianity. The Engliſh Lodges exhibit the true form of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vouch for its independence of all the orders, with which it has been connected.</p>
            <p>THESE Lodges, from which we have deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our exiſtence, exempt us from any cenſures to which modern degrees might give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The form of the primitive Lodges was retained in America, till the revolution. The attachment to the French, which was then ſo ſtrong, and ſo ſincere, awakened an inclination to imitate them, but no attempts were made, beyond the orders, which exiſted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033405_0020_0FF7BBF7CE49B700"/>under the monarchy. The firſt members of a Lodge in Maſſachuſetts, ſome of which are living, and many of them have been well known to us, cannot be ſuſpected of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter deſign in that age. And we know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the progreſs in every other colony, to determine that no cauſes did counteract the original deſign. The deſigns of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Government had been long enough pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, to ſatisfy us of the influence they would employ in the colonies. How far political opinion could influence the Scotch Lodge in 1752, may be judged from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that it was inſtituted as ſoon as more than one Lodge was formed, and before any other cauſes than incidental curioſity and emulation could exiſt. There was no gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral or ſudden change from the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever obſerved, and the Convention in 1785, in which all the prejudices of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and Scotch Lodges were inveſtigated, did not even imagine a political cauſe of their ſeparate exiſtence. The public fears may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us how much we may have gained in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033405_0021_0FF7BBFB57E395D8"/>our reputation by aſſociation with the names of degraded orders, or by ſocieties expelled from Chriſtian countries.</p>
            <p>BY a late work,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Robiſon's Proof of a Conſpiracy, &amp;c.</note> confeſſedly written, from periodical papers, not always the vehicles of truth, and with evident deſign to alarm the public mind, our attention has been called to the ILLUMINATI, who have been conſidered as an order of Maſons, though at the ſame time, it is confeſſed, that they have not <hi>common</hi> principles.</p>
            <p>IN this work it is juſtly granted that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry proceeded from England to Germany. The order of ILLUMINATI has lately originated in Germany. According to Robiſon's account in 1775, Dr. Adam Weiſhauft founded the order; for all that is ſaid of its foreign correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, and progreſs is conjectural.
<note n="†" place="bottom">The inſinuations reſpecting Dr. Prieſtley and Zollikofer, would make any work infamous.</note> The mother Lodge of this order was at Munich, and from the public prejudices, it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in 1786. The alarming confeſſion of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033405_0022_0FF7BC0067980C20"/>four members in 1783 did not provoke an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſſolution. Step after ſtep was taken by the elector, and three years paſſed from the confeſſion to the third edict, which aboliſhed the order. But Weiſhauft had the offer of a penſion, which he refuſed. This ſeems not to be an unequivocal proof of guilt. But in the work before us, the charge of guilt is not extended to the whole order of ILLUMINATI but is confined to ſuppoſed higher orders not yet fairly detected; and it is confeſſed, that baſe as were the higher degrees, very worthy men had united in the lower, without knowledge of any evil tendency. This confuſed account is given in a manner adapted to excite the ſtrongeſt prejudices. Like a diſingenuous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, he alarms, by an unknown order, our fears of an innocent order, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to deſpiſe, while he confeſſes "that the order took its riſe among FREE MASONS, but is totally different from Free Maſonry." But a philoſopher might ſay, how abſurd is it to deſpiſe a ritual, which has ſo adequately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered its purpoſes, and which has ſuch real
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033405_0023_0FF7BC031A398810"/>power over human nature, as to combine men together, to overthrow kingdoms. What a principle muſt it command! While if it be a trifle, why ſhould ſuch vehement zeal be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it? Can trifles have ſuch dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? It ſeems by the account, that Free Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry, and its kindred inſtitutions, is a rival, and a powerful rival to all governments under heaven. It is then a moſt powerful combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And what elſe is any government? And ſurely the more ſimple the means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine men, in the ſecret of government, the better for mankind.

            <p>BUT if we hear the invectives againſt an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we ought to hear its vindication. Weiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauft ſays, that in the oath of the order, this caution was expreſſed, "I being previouſly aſſured that it ſhall contain nothing contrary to religion, the ſtate, or good manners." Such a caution ought at leaſt to ſatisfy us, that it borrowed no bad principles from an order on which it was ingrafted. To this confeſſion, the objection is, that Weiſhauft did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

In this aſſertion I am ſupported by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors of the firſt German reviews in general, and particularly by the reſpectable evidence of profeſſor Staeudlin, himſelf, as well as by that of the celebrated profeſſor Eberhard, of Halle, both of whom have ranked M.

            <p>SUCH accounts from Germany, if they will not exculpate him from every charge, will teach us to ſuſpend our judgment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to a crime, ſo high coloured, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve at once all the guilt of every unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion: A crime as great againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and policy, and all hopes of ſucceſs, as it is againſt humanity and civil ſociety.— A crime which ought not to have been pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with the qualifying clauſe, promiſing a penſion, from any government under heaven. The Engliſh Reviewers

This worthy man was a Grand Maſon, and moſt active in the revolution. Did the American Revolution begin in the Lodges? The circumſtantial evidence would be too tedious, in regard to the innocence of the whole body of Maſons in France.

It detects the ſpirit of the New Philoſophy, but it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys agents, not from Lodges, but from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. The economiſts of France did not reſt upon Free Maſonry, and the writer, who employs this evidence, muſt do great honor to his own underſtanding, willingly to admit a general charge of irreligion, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it, an innovation by an order whoſe duration was ſhort; eſpecially when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits that the Britiſh never ſuſpected of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, an order, which he declares to have originated in their own country.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033405_0030_0FF7BC1B7093B310"/>and religion, as they are eſtabliſhed by mankind in civil life. We may then aſſert our cauſe and ſay, that the whole intercourſe of life requires active and mutual ſervices, and ſpecial obligations; and that to increaſe theſe agreeably to the laws of nature and ſociety, upon general principles, is the beſt inſtitution of ſocial life, which combined law and liberty can protect.

            <p>BUT ſhould it appear that there have been extravagant men, in theſe extraordinary times, we ſhould remember that they roſe out of the character of the age. The part they had taken as citizens at firſt, and the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents they felt afterwards made them invent new forms of aſſociation. They ſeized upon ſuch expedients, to promote their deſigns. Other orders have been corrupted. And, Have not the meek diſciples of Jeſus publiſhed their
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033405_0031_0FF7BC2466F91CA0"/>political faith within the walls conſecrated to the goſpel of peace? We reprobate not chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity, when this liberty is abuſed. The change in Europe is accompliſhed by no order of men. The ſpirit has taken hold upon human nature. When the Abbe Barruel tells us, that from the <hi>honeſt ſimplicity</hi> of the firſt or primary Lodges, they were not admitted to the ſecrets of the conſpiracy, he ſays all we can aſk of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Author to exculpate Maſons with candid men, for ſuch are the only Lodges of our ancient Inſtitution. But how abſurd is the ſuſpicion! If the higher orders hold the ſecret, how are they to influence the Brethren, but as they influence mankind? If they do not converſe with them in their Lodges, they can know them only as citizens. Maſons are not then in the ſecret. Have not ſuch men excluded
<note n="*" place="bottom">Going out from us, they were not of us.—<hi>John.</hi>
               </note> themſelves from all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications in the Lodges? And will they have better opportunities to converſe with the Brethren out of their Lodges than in them.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the inſinuations of prejudice and party. Such is the confeſſion, that Lodges
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033405_0032_0FF7BC266AD49598"/>are not fit places for conſpiracy. All their evidence amounts to this truth, that when a ſpirit of revolution, or any thing elſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in a county, it pervades all claſſes of cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens. The books, the churches, the private ſocieties will be full of it. And to reaſon fairly, as the ſpirit of revolution ſeized ſome maſons, ſo it ſeized ſome chriſtians, and as chriſtians form a ſect, ſo maſons formed an order to enjoy their opinions. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is as ſafe for one as the other, that they ought to be aboliſhed. And as a part of this wonderful diſcovery is claimed by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſon, let him have the honor of it.</p>
            <p>WE do not refuſe a fair inveſtigation. We aſk no privileges, which can endanger the State. Sooner may all our glory paſs away, than one law fail. Let us turn to the hiſtory of Maſonry, in the full records of its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and tranſactions. In what inſtitution is there greater ſubordination? Is not its language from ancient governments? Does it not indulge the parade of forms, and the emblems of power, and employ the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033405_0033_0FF7BC2B94141748"/>honours of the ſtate? Are not its honours perpetual in the rank and the name? Has it not invited to the higheſt honours, the firſt magiſtrates of noble families? Has it not accepted Kings and Princes, the moſt jealous of their power? Has it not flouriſhed in every form of government? Men have found means to aſſociate political principles with Chriſtianity, becauſe, as Maſonry, it does not profeſs to give excluſive favours to any form of government. But becauſe Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity does not decide upon the form of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, Are not its precepts ſacredly tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of good citizenſhip? And is Maſonry leſs explicit? Are not Lodges acceſſiable to all parties? Have not the deſigns of party, led men away from the primitive Lodges, in which all ſiniſter deſigns were prevented by mutual jealouſy? Are not characters known? The Proteſtants and Catholics, after their ſeparation did not hold themſelves accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for each other. AS AN ORDER, WE ARE SACREDLY BOUND TO THE LAWS AND CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITUTION, AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033405_0034_0FF7BC2D203DAD68"/>OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR COUNTRY, and of this truth, our Grand Lodge has lately given an open declaration, by an addreſs to the Preſident of the United States. And that our benevolence is no modern ſubterfuge, the manuſcript of Mr. Locke is a full atteſtation.</p>
            <p>THE confidence of the world, we hope to deſerve, but we will claim it of the Brethren. We will cultivate it for the purpoſe of good citizens. Reaſon is always ſlow without experience. Let us then employ ourſelves in conſtant offices, which will confirm our ſincere affections. Let our countenance, our civilities, our guards and our virtues, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the ſpirit of our aſſociation.

May the friendſhips of our hearts give cheerfulneſs to our ſpirits, and gratitude to our feſtival.—Peace to the Brethren.—And when the wit of claſſic ages is loſt, and Butler and all his humble imitators are forgotten, may we accommodate a lovely ſong and ſay,
<q>
                  <l>Let madneſs, let folly, our order oppoſe,</l>
                  <l>Love and true friendſhip will rout all our foes.</l>
                  <l>TWO PILLARS ſupport the Lodge, where we dwell;</l>
                  <l>Where Friendſhip's our magic, and Union the ſpell.</l>
                  <l>May we practiſe all duties of <hi>friendſhip</hi> and <hi>love,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>To inſure us <hi>all</hi> ſeats in the GRAND LODGE above.</l>
